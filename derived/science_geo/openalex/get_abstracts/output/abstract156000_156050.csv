In NMuMG mammary epithelial cells, exogenous TGFβ1 induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 and Akt in vitro kinase activity against GSK-3β within 30 min. These responses were temporally correlated with delocalization of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and integrin β1 from cell junctions and the acquisition of spindle cell morphology. LY294002, an inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, and a dominant-negative mutant of Akt blocked the delocalization of ZO-1 induced by TGFβ1, whereas transfection of constitutively active p110 induced loss of ZO-1 from tight junctions. In addition, LY294002 blocked TGFβ-mediated C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2. Consistent with these data, TGFβ-induced p3TP-Lux and p(CAGA)12-Lux reporter activities were inhibited by LY294002 and transiently expressed dominant-negative p85 and Akt mutants in NMuMG and 4T1 cells. Dominant-negative RhoA inhibited TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, whereas constitutively active RhoA increased the basal phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting that RhoA in involved in TGFβ-induced EMT. Finally, LY294002 and neutralizing TGFβ1 antibodies inhibited ligand-independent constitutively active Akt as well as basal and TGFβ-stimulated migration in 4T1 and EMT6 breast tumor cells. Taken together, these data suggest that PI3K-Akt signaling is required for TGFβ-induced transcriptional responses, EMT, and cell migration.

TGFβ signals through the activation of heteromeric complexes of TGFβ type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) receptors (1Massague J. Annu. Rev.

Activated TβRI phosphorylates receptor-associated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3), which then bind Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus where they regulate transcription of target genes (3Zhang Y. Derynck R.

TGFβ exhibits a tumor suppressor activity, and components of its signaling pathway are frequently mutated or silenced in colon and pancreatic cancers (1Massague J. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, it was recently reported that inhibition of autocrine TGFβ signaling in carcinoma cells reduces cell invasiveness and tumor metastases (9Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr.

These effects of TGFβ are associated with its ability to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stimulate cell migration. The EMT induced by TGFβ results in the disruption of the polarized morphology of epithelial cells, formation of actin stress fibers, and enhancement of cell migration (8Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C.

Two species of TβRI, Alk2 and Alk5, have been implicated in the induction of EMT by TGFβ in mammary epithelial cells (11Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J.

It has also been reported that high levels of ectopic Smad2 and Smad3 can induce some features of EMT in mammary epithelial cells in the context of expression of an activated type I receptor (12Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, considering the complexity of TGFβ signaling (3Zhang Y. Derynck R.

For example, members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors have been shown to induce EMT and promote tumor invasiveness (17Kustikova O. Kramerov D. Grigorian M. Berezin V. Bock E. Lukanidin E.

In addition, several other downstream signaling pathways can also be activated by TGFβ, including p38Mapk (21Ravanti L. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways can potentially contribute to TGFβ1-mediated EMT, but their significance for EMT and cell migration mediated by TGFβ remains unclear. In this study, we used the NMuMG mammary epithelial cell line as a model for TGFβ1-induced EMT (11Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. Lopez A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Two metastatic breast tumor cell lines, 4T1 and EMT6, that express high levels of TGFβ ligands and TGFβ receptors were used in transcription and migration studies. We report that TGFβ-induced EMT and cell migration depend on the PI3K-Akt pathway. We also show that the phosphorylation of Smad2 and transcriptional responses induced by TGFβ are inhibited by pharmacological and molecular antagonists of the PI3K-Akt pathway. TGFβ1 can induce phosphorylation and activation of Akt/PKB in a PI3K-dependent manner, and this activation requires the Rho GTPase function. Taken together, our data suggest that PI3K-Akt signaling is required for the morphogenic, transcriptional, and migratory activities of TGFβ. TGFβ1 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and EGF from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA).

Fendly (Genentech, Inc.) and has been described previously (26Lucas C. Bald L.N. Fendly B.M. Mora-Worms M. Figari I.S. Patzer E.J. Palladino M.A. J.

Adenovirus vectors encoding a dominant-negative mutant of Akt (AxAktK179D), a mutant regulatory subunit of p85 (AxΔp85), and a constitutively active myristoylated mutant of p110 (AxMyr-p110) were kindly provided by W. Ogawa (Kobe University School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan) (28Kotani K. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Kitamura T. Ueno H. Sano W. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Plasmid vectors encoding Q61LRhoA and N19RhoA mutants were obtained from Dr. Lynn Cross (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A plasmid vector encoding a GST-GSK3β peptide fusion protein was a gift from C. L. Van Den Berg (University of Colorado, Denver). NMuMG cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml insulin. 4T1 tumor cells were provided by F. Miller (Karmanos Cancer Center, Detroit, MI) and EMT6 tumor cells by B. Teicher (Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN); both were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS. For adenoviral infection of NMuMG and 4T1 cells, 105cells/well in 6-well plates were transduced with adenovirus vectors at 10–100 plaque-forming units/cell as described by Sakaueet al. (29Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More than 90% of the NMuMG cells infected at a similar multiplicity of infection with an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (Adβ-Gal) exhibited blue staining. Infected cells were subjected to further treatment 24–48 h later. Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined by the Bradford method. Protein extracts (50 μg/lane) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (100 mA, 2.5 h). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer (containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies in TBST plus 1% milk for 16 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in TBST and immunoreactive bands visualized by ECL (Pierce). Akt/PKB was precipitated from protein extracts (150 μg) with GST-GSK-3β fusion protein immobilized on agarose beads (Sigma) or GST-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. An in vitro kinase reaction was performed by adding 10 μCi of [ γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μm PKA peptide inhibitor (Calbiochem). Reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer and heating followed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Quantitative analysis of32P-labeled bands was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). NMuMG, 4T1, and EMT6 cells (0.5 × 106) were seeded in 60-mm dish and transfected the following day with 0.5 μg/ml p3TP-Lux (provided by J. Massague, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) or p(CAGA)12-Lux (provided by J.-M. Gauthier, Laboratoire Glaxo Wellcome, Les Ulis Cedex, France), each with 0.002 μg/ml pCMV-Rl (Promega) using 4 μl of FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The next day, cells were seeded in equal amounts in 24-well dishes and incubated for 16 h in low serum (0.5–2%) followed by treatment with 1 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 4 or 16 h. Firefly luciferase (Luc) andRenilla reniformis luciferase (RlLuc) activities in cell lysates were determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Luc activity was normalized to RlLuc activity and presented as relative luciferase units. All assays were done in triplicate wells, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. NMuMG cells (105cells/well) were grown in DMEM, 5% FBS on glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) for 24 h before treatment with 2 ng/ml TGFβ1. Cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min at −20 °C or with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. For permeabilization, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS after each treatment. Cells were blocked with 3% milk in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% milk/PBS (1/300 for ZO-1, 1/500 for integrin β1, and 1/2000 for E-cadherin), and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (1/500) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted onto 25 × 75-mm microslides (VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA) using AquaPolyMount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Fluorescent images were captured using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD digital camera from a Zeiss Axiophot upright microscope. 4T1 and EMT6 tumor cells (4 × 104/well) were plated in DMEM, 10%FBS in the upper chamber of 8-μm pore (24-well) transwells (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated alone or with variable concentrations of TGFβ1 in the absence or presence of LY294002 or the TGFβ1-neutralizing 2G7 IgG2. Three days later, the cells that had migrated through pores and reattached to the lower chamber were trypsinized and cell numbers measured in a Coulter counter. TGFβ1 induced a mesenchymal transition in NMuMG cells within 24 h. Cells treated with 2 ng/ml TGFβ1 changed their shape from a cuboidal to a more elongated form (Fig. 1 A, DIC). Concomitantly, TGFβ1 induced the delocalization of E-cadherin from adherens junctions, ZO-1 from tight junctions, and the delocalization of integrin β1 from the cell surface (Fig. 1). There were no detectable differences in the intracellular staining of E-cadherin, ZO-1, and integrin β1 between treated and untreated cells. In addition, no detectable changes in E-cadherin were found by immunoblot analysis of whole cell extract (Fig. 1 B). To determine the signaling pathways that contribute to TGFβ-induced EMT, we examined the ability of different pharmacological agents to block the changes in cell morphology and in localization of epithelial markers at cell junctions. We found that LY294002, a synthetic inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K (30Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked the morphological transition, the delocalization of ZO-1 from cell junctions, and the reorganization of actin fibers (Fig.2 A). Inhibitors of MEK1/2 (PD098059 (Fig. 2 A) and U0126), c-jun N-terminal kinase (curcumin), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), phospholipase C (U73122), Rac1 (SCH51344), MLCK (myosin light chain kinase; ML7), and PP2A (okadaic acid) did not affect TGFβ-mediated transition (data not shown), suggesting that signaling pathways associated with these molecules may not contribute to EMT mediated by TGFβ1. Inhibition of EMT by LY294002 suggested that PI3K is involved in EMT induced by TGFβ1. To further test this hypothesis, NMuMG cells were infected with adenovirus encoding a constitutively active mutant of p110 (ca-p110), the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Cells expressing Myc-tagged ca-p110 showed a higher level phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, confirming its functional activity (Fig. 2 B). Similar to exogenous TGFβ1, infection with the ca-p110 virus resulted in the delocalization of ZO-1 from tight junctions. However, the cells retained their epithelial morphology, whereas infection with a β-galactosidase adenovirus (Axβ-Gal) did not alter cell morphology nor ZO-1 staining at adherens junctions (Fig. 2 B). Finally, we examined whether Akt/PKB, a downstream effector of PI3K, would affect EMT. Transduction of NMuMG cells using a dominant-negative mutant Akt (AktK179D) adenovirus inhibited TGFβ-induced delocalization of ZO-1 from tight junctions as well as changes in cell morphology (Fig. 2 C). These data suggest that the PI3K-Akt pathway is required for some of the phenotypic hallmarks associated with TGFβ-mediated EMT. To further test that the PI3K pathway is activated by TGFβ1, we examined the phosphorylation status and kinase activity of Akt. Immunoblot analyses with antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of Akt showed that TGFβ induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 within 30 min, achieving a detectable maximum at 2 h (Fig.3 A). Phosphorylation of Ser-473 Akt was inhibited by 20 μm LY294002 (Fig.3 A, last lane), indicating that Akt activation requires PI3K function. The activity of Akt/PKB was measured using an in vitro kinase assay with GST-GSK3β fusion protein containing GSK-3β peptide in frame with GST and immobilized on agarose beads as a substrate. Treatment of NMuMG cells with TGFβ1 for 2 h stimulated a 4-fold induction in the incorporation of 32P into GST-GSK3β (Fig. 3 B). Next, we tested the TGFβ1 dose dependence of phosphorylation of Akt and Smad2. Treatment with 0.5 ng/ml (20 pm) TGFβ1 was sufficient to induce a maximal phosphorylation for both Ser-473 Akt and Smad2 (Fig. 3 C). TGFβ1 and EGF, a known agonist of PI3K, induced similar levels of Ser-473 Akt phosphorylation. EGF induced activating phosphorylation of ERK1/2, whereas TGFβ1 did not stimulate ERK activation at any concentration tested (Fig. 3 C). Recent studies have suggested that RhoA is involved in TGFβ1-mediated transcription (22Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 23Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and that TGFβ1 can activate RhoA in NMuMG cells. 2N. A. Bhowmick, M. Ghiassi, A. V. Bakin, M. Aakre, C. A. Lundquist, M. E. Engel, C. L. Arteaga, and H. L. Moses, submitted for publication. Therefore, we tested whether RhoA GTPase affected the activation of PI3K-Akt mediated by TGFβ1. NMuMG cells transiently transfected with a dominant-negative RhoA mutant (N19RhoA) showed a significantly reduced level of Akt phosphorylation compared with a control (Fig. 3 D). Transfection of the constitutively active form of RhoA (Q61LRhoA) resulted in an increase of basal phosphorylation of Akt (Fig.3 E). These results suggest that RhoA may be involved in TGFβ1-mediated activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. TGFβ transcriptional responses can be controlled through the subcellular localization of Smads. It has been shown that SARA, a recently identified mediator of TGFβ signaling, controls recruitment of Smad2 to TGFβ receptors (31Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The function of SARA depends on its FYVE homology domain, which binds phosphatidylinositols phosphorylated by PI3K (31Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In addition, recent data have suggested that microtubules (MTs) may control Smad-dependent TGFβ1 transcriptional responses (32Dong C. Li Z. Alvarez R. Feng X.H. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PI3K associates tightly with α- and β-tubulins (33Kapeller R. Toker A. Cantley L.C.

Therefore, we next examined whether PI3K is involved in the regulation of TGFβ-mediated transcription. Two TGFβ-responsive reporter constructs were used in transcriptional assays: p3TP-Lux, containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of three 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response elements and a fragment of the PAI-1 promoter (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar), and p(CAGA)12-Lux, a reporter gene containing 12 repeats of Smad binding sequences from the PAI-1 promoter (35Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). In NMuMG cells transiently transfected with p3TP-Lux, TGFβ-mediated induction of luciferase was inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner at 4 and 16 h (Fig.4 A). Similar results were obtained with 4T1 and EMT6 mammary tumor cell lines (data not shown). LY294002 also inhibited TGFβ-stimulated reporter activity in both NMuMG and 4T1 cells transfected with p(CAGA)12-Lux (Fig.4 B). We next examined whether an adenovirus vector encoding a dominant-negative mutant of p85 (dn-p85), the regulatory subunit of PI3K, would emulate the effects of LY294002. Expression of dn-p85 significantly reduced a basal phosphorylation of Ser-473 Akt (Fig.2 B), confirming its functional activity. TGFβ-induced p3TP-Lux reporter activity was reduced by 75% in both NMuMG and 4T1 cells infected with the dn-p85 adenovirus vector but not with a control adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Fig. 4 C). Finally, transient transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of Akt (AktK179M) markedly inhibited TGFβ-induced p3TP-Lux transcription (Fig.4 D). These data suggest that the PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in TGFβ transcriptional responses. The transcriptional data using the p(CAGA)12Lux reporter (Fig.4 B) suggested that PI3K is involved in the control of Smad-dependent transcription. Therefore, we examined the effect of PI3K blockade on TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Smad2. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific to Smad2 phosphorylated at the C terminus showed that C terminus phosphorylation of Smad2 was induced by TGFβ1 within 15 min, reaching a maximum by 1 h. However, co-incubation with 20 μm LY294002 markedly reduced ligand-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation without detectable changes in total Smad2 protein levels (Fig.5 A). At the same time, phosphorylation of Ser-473 Akt was completely blocked by LY294002 (Fig.5 B). The induction of the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 and phosphorylation of Ser-473 Akt in response to TGFβ1 appears to occur with similar kinetics and TGFβ1 dose dependence (Figs. 3 and 5). To test whether the PI3K-Akt pathway is directly involved in the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2, NMuMG cells were transfected with dn-Akt followed by TGFβ1 treatment and immunoblot analysis of C terminus phosphorylation of Smad2. The level of Smad2 phosphorylation was similar in control cells and cells transfected with dn-Akt, suggesting that Akt is not involved in C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 5 C). Infection of cells with ca-p110 also did not induce ligand-independent phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 5 D). TGFβ1 can stimulate the migration of tumor and nontumor cells (7Hojo M. Morimoto T.

We report the identification of enteric organisms (nonvirulent Salmonella strains) whose direct interaction with model human epithelia attenuate synthesis of inflammatory effector molecules elicited by diverse proinflammatory stimuli. This immunosuppressive effect involves inhibition of the inhibitor kappaB/nuclear factor kappaB (IkappaB/NF-kappaB) pathway by blockade of IkappaB-alpha degradation, which prevents subsequent nuclear translocation of active NF-kappaB dimer. Although phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha occurs, subsequent polyubiquitination necessary for regulated IkappaB-alpha degradation is completely abrogated. These data suggest that prokaryotic determinants could be responsible for the unique tolerance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to proinflammatory stimuli."

RNase protection assay detected mRNA for PPARγ1 but not that for the adipocyte-specific γ2 isoform in HSC isolated from sham-operated rats, whereas the transcripts for neither isoforms were detectable in HSC from cholestatic liver fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed a 70% reduction in PPARγ mRNA level in HSC from BDL. Nuclear extracts from BDL cells showed an expected diminution of binding to PPAR-responsive element, whereas NF-κB and AP-1 binding were increased. Treatment of cultured-activated HSC with ligands for PPARγ (10 μm15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15dPGJ2); 0.1∼10 μm BRL49653) inhibited DNA and collagen synthesis without affecting the cell viability. Suppression of HSC collagen by 15dPGJ2 was abrogated 70% by the concomitant treatment with a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662). HSC DNA and collagen synthesis were inhibited by WY14643 at the concentrations known to activate both PPARα and γ (>100 μm) but not at those that only activate PPARα (<10 μm) or by a synthetic PPARα-selective agonist (GW9578). 15dPGJ2 reduced α1(I) procollagen, smooth muscle α-actin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA levels while inducing matrix metalloproteinase-3 and CD36. 15dPGJ2 and BRL49653 inhibited α1(I) procollagen promoter activity. Tumor necrosis factor α (10 ng/ml) reduced PPARγ mRNA, and this effect was prevented by the treatment with 15dPGJ2. These results demonstrate that HSC activation is associated with the reductions in PPARγ expression and PPAR-responsive element binding in vivo and is reversed by the treatment with PPARγ ligands in vitro.

Hepatology. 1998; 28: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis of the multifaceted cellular changes in HSC activation, increasing efforts have been made to characterize alterations in specific gene regulation or intracellular signaling that may confer some of the activation events. Such examples include up-regulation of autocrine cytokines such as TGF-β (5Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bachem M.G. Meyer D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 302-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and their receptors (18Friedman S.L. Yamasaki G. Wong L. J. Biol.

Invest. 1994; 94: 1563-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In particular, the evidence for the pivotal role of TGF-β in liver fibrogenesis is compelling, as exemplified by a recent demonstration of amelioration of experimental liver fibrosis by an adenovirus vector expressing the dominant negative TGF-β type II receptor (20Qi Z. Atsuchi N. Ooshima A. Takeshita A. Ueno H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2345-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Early genes induced during activation of HSC may be associated with induction of this fibrogenic cytokine. One such example is a Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor, Zf9, which was recently shown to transactivate promoters for both TGF-β1 and type I and II TGF-β receptors (21Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the changes in the cellular content of retinoids may favor induction of TGF-β. Depletion of retinoids occurs in activation of HSC both in culture (4Friedman S.L. Wei S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G947-G952PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (5Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to precede induction of TGF-β1 and matrix genes (5Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). All-trans and 9-cis retinoic acids (RA), biologically active metabolites of vitamin A, are also depleted in activated HSC isolated from experimental biliary liver fibrosis (22Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAR and RXR serve as nuclear receptors for RA, and their levels are also reduced in activated HSC (22Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RAR and RXR are known to antagonize AP-1 promoter activities of TGF-β1 (23Salbert G. Fanjul A. Piedrafita F.J. Lu X.P. Kim S.J. Tran P. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and metalloproteinases (24Pan L. Eckhoff C. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,25Pektovich M. Brand N.J. Krust A. Chambon P. Nature. 1987; 330: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) in a RA-dependent manner. Thus, it is plausible that deficiencies of RA, RAR, and RXR may permissively up-regulate AP-1 activity in activated HSC via suppressed RA-mediated, negative cross-coupling of this transcription factor. In fact the treatment of cultured HSC with all-trans RA causes suppression of cell proliferation, collagen, and TGF-β production (26Davis B.H. Kramer R.T. Davidson N.O. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). On the contrary, 9-cis RA (27Okuno M. Moriwaki H. Imai S. Muto Y. Kawada N. Suzuki Y. Kojima S. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 913-921PubMed Google Scholar) and 9,13-di-cis-RA (28Imai S. Okuno M. Moriwaki H. Muto Y. Murakiami K. Shudo K. Suzuki Y. Kojima S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 41: 102-106Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are shown to activate latent TGF-β via up-regulation of tissue plasminogen activator. These conflicting effects may be due to the recently demonstrated differential effects of the RA isomers on HSC (29Hellemans K. Grinko I. Rombouts K. Schuppan D. Geerts A. Gut. 1999; 45: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or complex responses rendered by RA, particularly via RXR. RXR heterodimerizes with the members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, such as vitamin D receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR), and farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR) (30Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). Since RXR serves as a ligand-dependent, active partner for some of these receptors such as PPAR and LXR, the reduced levels of 9-cis RA and RXR, as previously shown by us in HSC from cholestatic livers (22Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may limit activities of the transcription factors. In particular, we hypothesized whether PPARγ expression might be suppressed in activated HSC. This hypothesis was inspired by the recent demonstration of leptin induction in culture-activated HSC (31Potter J.J. Womack L. Mezey E. Anania F.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 244: 178-182Google Scholar). Leptin, a 16-kDa protein most exclusively expressed in adipose tissue, is the product of the ob gene, which suppresses food intake, increases metabolic rate, and reduces fat depot size (See Ref.32Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar for review). The deficiency of leptin or its receptor is associated with the obesity in mice and human. Thus, the finding that leptin expression is induced in culture-activated HSC suggests the possibility that HSC may share the adipocyte phenotype. In fact, quiescent HSC is characterized by ample intracellular storage of lipids including fat-soluble vitamin A, and activation of HSC causes depletion of lipid droplets and transdifferentiation to myofibroblastic phenotype. These changes resemble transdifferentiation of 3T3-L1 cells that possess the potential to differentiate into either fibroblasts (preadipocytes) or adipocytes. With appropriate stimulation with fetal calf serum, dexamethasone, insulin, etc., 3T3-L1 cells undergo adipocyte differentiation driven by transcription factors such as PPARγ, C/EBP, and ADD1/SREBP1(32). Conversely, suppressed activities of these transcription factors result in fibroblastic differentiation (32Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined expression of PPARγ isoforms in quiescent HSC isolated from normal rats and activated HSC from experimental biliary liver fibrosis. RNase protection assay revealed expression of γ1 isoform in quiescent HSC but not that of the adipocyte-specific γ2 form, providing no support to the hypothesis that HSC share the adipogenic phenotype. However, we disclosed marked reductions in expression of PPARγ and PPAR response element (PPRE) binding in the in vivo activated HSC. Furthermore, the treatment of culture-activated HSC with PPARγ ligands (15dPGJ2 and BRL49653) reversed biochemical features of HSC activation. In particular, the ligands inhibited α1(I) procollagen promoter activity, its mRNA expression, and collagen production by the cells, and the inhibition by 15dPGJ2 was shown to be blocked by a PPARγ antagonist, confirming the involvement of PPARγ. These results suggest the pivotal roles of PPARγ in molecular regulation of HSC activation in liver fibrogenesis. Bile duct ligation was performed using male Wister rats weighing 550–650 g by aseptic ligation and scission of the common bile duct (BDL) as described previously (22Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another group of rats was sham-operated by exposing the common bile duct without ligation or scission as a control (sham). The animal protocol in this study was approved by the Institutional Care and Use Committee of the University of Southern California. Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from BDL, sham, and normal rats by the method previously described (5Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ohata M. Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was perfused in situ first with calcium-free minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by 0.62% Pronase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.0125% type IV collagenase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For rats cholestatic for 19 days, a mixture of 0.02% type IV collagenase and 0.04% type I collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used because of the extremely fibrotic condition of the livers. The liver was carefully removed and minced with scissors. The digested liver was further incubated in a shaker-incubator with 0.035% pronase and 62.5 units/ml DNase (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 at 37 °C for 30 min. It was then filtered through gauze, and parenchymal cells were removed by low speed centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was laid on top of the four density gradients (1.035, 1.045, 1.058, and 1.085) of arabinogalactan (LARCOLL, Sigma) and centrifuged at 21,400 rpm for 45 min at 25 °C using Beckman SW41-Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). The interface between the media and the density 1.035 was recovered as a pure HSC fraction. The purity of isolated HSC were examined by phase contrast microscopy and ultraviolet-excited fluorescence microscopy and the viability by trypan blue exclusion. Isolated HSC from normal rats were cultured in six-well plates with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin and amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cultures were maintained for 3–4 days or 6–7 days before tested for effects of PPAR ligands. By these time points the cells began to show or already showed morphological features of culture-activated HSC as described previously (1Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 13Rockey D.C. Boyles J.K. Gabbiani G. Friedman S.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1992; 24: 193-203PubMed Google Scholar). For DNA and collagen synthesis analyses, HSC were seeded in 24-well plates with the aforementioned media. For morphological examination of HSC, the cells were cultured onto 10-mm2coverslips placed in 6-well plates for 7 days before testing the effects of 15dPGJ2 or BRL49653. To assess the effects of PPARα and PPARγ ligands on HSC in vitro, cultured HSC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free media. The cells were then treated with 15dPGJ2(1∼10 μm, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), BRL49653 (0.1∼10 μm, a gift from Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC), or WY14643 (1∼250 μm, Biomol) or vehicle alone (Me2SO for WY14643 and BRL49653 or ethanol for 15dPGJ2) for 18 h. These cells were examined for DNA and collagen synthesis, morphological analysis, and mRNA expression for various activation maker genes as described below. To test the PPARγ dependence of 15dPGJ2-mediated effect on HSC collagen synthesis, the cells were concomitantly incubated with a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 (33Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M.

DNA synthesis was determined as incorporation of [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml) into HSC DNA as described previously (9Matsuoka M. Zhang M.Y. Tsukamoto H.

Collagen synthesis was determined by incorporation of [3H]proline (10 μCi/ml) into collagenase-sensitive peptides in the presence of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-aminopropionitrile fumarate (50 μg/ml) as described (17Wang S.C.

Total RNA was extracted from isolated HSC by the guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) and nuclear protein by the method of Schreiber et al. (36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). RNA and nuclear protein concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm and a Bradford assay, respectively. RNase protection assay was performed for PPARγ1 and -γ2 transcripts using an approach previously described (37Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). A partial PPARγ cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using the rat PPARγ2-specific primers, which amplified a region that includes 90 base pairs of the PPARγ2 transcript and 185 base pairs common to both PPARγ1 and γ2. The cDNA was ligated into the PGEM-3 vector for generation of an antisense RNA probe. The assay was performed using32P-labeled RNA probe, 5 or 10 μg of RNA from HSC isolated from BDL and sham, and a RNase protection assay kit from Torrey Pines Biolabs, Inc. (San Diego, CA). As a control, L32 was used. For RT-PCR analysis for HSC activation marker genes, 2 μg of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using 600 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15as a primer at 37 °C for 60 min. The synthesized cDNA were amplified using specific sets of primers for PPARα, (CCTTTTTGTGGCTGCTAT, TCCCTGCTCTCCTGTATG), PPARγ (ATTCTGGCCCACCAACTTCGG, TGGAAGCCTGATGCTTTATCCCCA), smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) (TGTGCTGGACTCTGGAGATG, GATCACCTGCCCATCAGG), α1(I) procollagen (17Wang S.C.

Lin M. Satre M. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G589-G596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each PCR mixture contained 0.4 μm of a set of specific primers, 0.2 μm each dNTP, 2.5 unitsTaq polymerase, 1.5 μm MgCl2, and 2 μl of cDNA except for β-actin, for which 1 μl was used. PCR procedure consisted of 20 cycles (α-SMA, α1(I) procollagen, MCP-1, and β-actin) or 30–35 cycles (PPARα, PPARγ, MMP-3, and MMP-13) of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 90 s, with initial denaturation of sample cDNA at 94 °C for 3 min before PCR and additional extension period of 10 min after the last cycle. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.004% ethidium bromide and visualized under UV transiluminator. The densitometric analysis of PCR products was performed by the computer software, ImageQuant for Power Macintosh v1.2 (Molecular Dynamics), and standardized by the β-actin. Nuclear protein extract (10–20 μg) was incubated with a reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 200 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) on ice for 10 min. One to two ng of a32P-labeled double-stranded ARE-7 (PPRE) (38Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 272: G1355-G1364PubMed Google Scholar) oligonuleotides were added and incubated for an additional 20 min. The reaction mixture was then resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. For supershift assay, we have used antisera against PPARγ (kindly provided by Dr. Ronald M. Evans, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) and polyclonal antibodies against P65, P50, c-Fos, and c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To examine whether PPARα and -γ ligands have effects on collagen gene promoter activity, cultured HSC after the first passage were co-transfected with a collagen reporter gene plasmid (pGLCO2) that contains 2,200 base pairs of the murine α1(I) collagen gene 5′-flanking region ligand to the luciferase reporter gene (40Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar) and a PPARγ expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Ron Evans, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA and Dr. Henry Sucov, Institute for Genetic Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The cells were serum-starved (0.2% fetal calf serum, 24 h) and then treated with 15dPGJ2 (1 and 10 μm), BRL49653 (10 μm) for 24 h before their lysate was collected for luciferase assay. Liposomes were prepared using 1 μg of the reporter gene plasmid and 2 μg of the expression vector along with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) The cells were incubated with the liposomes for 3 h, the liposome mixture was removed, and fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was added for incubation for 15 h. To investigate the effects of PPARγ ligand on the actin cytoskeleton and HSC morphology, cells cultured onto glass coverslips were exposed to 15dPGJ2 (1 and 10 μm) BRL49653 (1 and 10 μm), or carrier (ethanol). Actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes were stained, and differential interference contrast images were acquired as described previously (16Yee Jr., H.F. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, stress fibers were labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin, which binds to filamentous actin with high specificity. Focal adhesion complexes were labeled with an antibody directed against vinculin, a prominent component of the complex. A fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody was used to stain the focal adhesion complexes. Standard rhodamine and fluorescein filters (Chroma, Brattleboro, VT) were employed. Epifluorescence and differential interference contrast images were acquired digitally. The morphological analysis was performed by a blinded observer. To assess the effects of PPAR ligands on cultured HSC viability, we performed SYTOX® green nucleic acid staining (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) for necrosis and Hoechst staining (Sigma) for apoptosis. HSC were cultured in 24-well plates, treated with 15dPGJ2(1∼10 μm), BRL49653 (0.1∼10 μm), or WY14643 (100∼250 μm) for 18 h from day 6 to day 7 of primary cultures, washed gently with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained according to the manufacturer's suggested protocols. Two hundred cells were analyzed in triplicates, and the incidence of necrosis and apoptosis was expressed as the percentage of total cells examined. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance for the difference between the groups was assessed using Student's t test. Using a sensitive RNase protection assay that allowed simultaneous quantification of mRNA for both isoforms (37Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), we first examined expression of PPARγ isoforms in freshly isolated normal and in vivo activated HSC. As shown in Fig. 1, the assay detected abundant expression of both γ2 and γ1 isoforms in RNA extracted from rat epididymal fat (second lane). Liver tissue also expressed both isoforms but at much less levels (thirdlane). HSC isolated from sham-operated rats, expressed only γ1 mRNA (fourth lane), and neither γ1 nor γ2 isoform was detectable in HSC from 1-week BDL animals (fifthlane). We also tested up to 10 μg of RNA for HSC from sham and BDL rats with basically same results. Thus, these data demonstrated that normal rat HSC express γ1 mRNA, the isoform that is generally expressed in various tissues (37Vidal-Puig A. Jimenez-Linan M. Lowell B.B. Hamann A. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Flier J.S. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2553-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), but not the γ2 isoform, which is more selectively expressed in adipocytes. Furthermore, HSC from experimental biliary liver fibrosis (BDL) appeared to be depleted of PPARγ1 expression. Since the RNase protection assay failed to detect PPARγ transcripts in HSC from 1-week BDL, we next performed RT-PCR to amplify the mRNA. This PCR did not distinguish the isoforms and amplified both. After 35 cycles, we were able to detect PPARγ in HSC from BDL. However, the level of PPARγ expression was reduced as compared with HSC from sham, whereas mRNA expression for α1(I) collagen and α-SMA was induced (Fig.2 A). Next, we examined HSC from BDL rats at 19 days after the surgery. Similarly, the PPARγ level was conspicuously reduced in BDL animals (Fig.2 B). In addition, PPARα mRNA level was also decreased in these animals (Fig. 2 B). Semi-quantitative analysis of the PCR densitometric data revealed approximately 70–80% reduction in PPARα and PPARγ mRNA expression in HSC from the 19-day BDL animals (Fig. 2 C). To assess the consequence of the observed depletion of PPARγ and -α mRNA levels, nuclear extra"
https://openalex.org/W2040865177,"E-cadherins are well characterized cell surface molecules expressed in epithelial cells, which play a major role in cell adhesion through the establishment of calcium-dependent homophilic interactions at sites of cell-cell contacts. They are also integral components of morphogenetic programs controlling the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of epithelia. Accumulated evidence indicates that the E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion system is highly regulated from inside the cells by a number of intracellular signaling pathways. Recently available information suggests that E-cadherins may also play a role in the transduction of signals from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm. However, the nature of the biochemical routes regulated by E-cadherins is still largely unknown. In this study, we set out to explore the possibility that E-cadherins may regulate the activity of MAPK, a key signaling pathway involved in cell fate decisions, upon the formation of cell-cell contacts among neighboring cells. By using an immortalized non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell line, HaCat, as a model system, we provide evidence that the assembly of calcium-dependent adherens junctions leads to a rapid and remarkable increase in the state of activation of MAPK and that this event is mediated by E-cadherins. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherins stimulate the MAPK pathway through the ligand-independent activation of epidermal growth factor receptors and the consequent activation of a biochemical route leading to the stimulation of MAPKs. These findings suggest that E-cadherins can initiate outside-in signal transducing pathways through the engagement of tyrosine kinase receptors for epidermal growth factor, thus providing a novel molecular mechanism whereby these cell adhesion molecules may ultimately control the fate of normal and transformed epithelial cells."

The present study indicates that MPP+-induced ROS formation is not mitochondrial in origin but results from intracellular dopamine (DA) oxidation. Although a mean lethal dose of MPP+ led to ROS production in identified dopaminergic neurons, toxic doses of the Complex I inhibitor rotenone did not. Concurrent with ROS formation, MPP+ redistributed vesicular DA to the cytoplasm prior to its extrusion from the cell by reverse transport via the DA transporter. MPP+-induced DA redistribution was also associated with cell death. Depleting cells of newly synthesized and/or stored DA significantly attenuated both superoxide production and cell death, whereas enhancing intracellular DA content exacerbated dopaminergic sensitivity to MPP+. Lastly, depleting cells of DA in the presence of succinate completely abolished MPP+-induced cell death. Thus, MPP+neurotoxicity is a multi-component process involving both mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generated by vesicular DA displacement. These results suggest that in the presence of a Complex I defect, misregulation of DA storage could lead to the loss of nigrostriatal neurons in Parkinson's disease.

Although the underlying cellular and molecular events in Parkinson's disease are still unknown, post-mortem studies suggest that both oxidative stress and impaired energy metabolism are involved (for review see Ref. 1Bowling A.C. Beal M.F. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1151-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Because the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been shown to produce Parkinsonian symptoms in primates and rodents (for review see Ref. 2Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Move. Disord. 1998; 13 (Suppl. 1): 35-38PubMed Google Scholar), it has been extensively used as an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Thus, elucidation of its mode of action has been of paramount importance in understanding and potentially treating this disorder. Toward this end, studies have indicated that l-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the active metabolite of MPTP, can block electron transport by binding to the same site as the classic Complex I inhibitor, rotenone, leading to a loss of ATP production (3Nicklas W.J.

Rotenone or MPP+ also produces superoxide anions in submitochondrial particles (8Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 9Turrens J.F.

Neural Transm. 1996; 103: 987-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), adding further support to the basic premise that MPP+ acts primarily as a mitochondrial toxin. However, MPP+ does affect other processes. For example, MPP+ rapidly induces DA release and subsequent formation of hydroxyl radicals both in vivo and in vitro(12Markstein R. Lahaye D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 106: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Pileblad E. Nissbrandt H. Carlsson A. J.

General Section. 1992; 89: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because the timing of this process is comparable with exocytosis (18Clarke P.B. Reuben M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the deleterious effects of extracellular DA oxidation may actually precede mitochondrial dysfunction, which occurs more slowly (6Denton T. Howard B.D. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Chan P. DeLanney L.E. Irwin I. Langston J.W. Di Monte D. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rapidity of this process suggests that MPP+ releases DA from intracellular pools versustoxin-induced degeneration of dopaminergic terminals. From what intracellular pool does MPP+ release DA? In addition to being taken up by the plasma membrane DA transporter (DAT; Ref. 20Javitch J.A. D'Amato R.J. Strittmatter S.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2173-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), MPP+ also undergoes high affinity uptake by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2; Refs. 21Del Zompo M. Piccardi M.P. Ruiu S. Corsini G.U. Vaccari A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 202: 293-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Del Zompo M. Piccardi M.P. Ruiu S. Corsini G.U. Vaccari A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7231-7237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, fractionation studies in chromaffin cells have shown that MPP+ is predominantly localized within catecholaminergic vesicles with only negligible amounts found in mitochondria (24Reinhard Jr., J.F. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Viveros O.H. Daniels A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8160-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because VMAT2 overexpressing cell lines are resistant to MPP+ (25Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 26Liu Y. Roghani A. Edwards R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9074-9078Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), sequestration within vesicles appears to play a protective role. Consistent with this hypothesis, heterozygous VMAT2 knock-out mice display increased susceptibility to MPTP (27Takahashi N. Miner L.L. Sora I. Ujike H. Revay R.S. Kostic V. Jackson-Lewis V. Przedborski S. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9938-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 28Gainetdinov R.R. Fumagalli F. Wang Y.M. Jones S.R. Levey A.I. Miller G.W. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1973-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A consequence of sequestration, however, might be the displacement of DA from vesicular stores. Once in the cytoplasm, DA would be readily autoxidized (for review see Ref. 29Fornstedt B. Acta Neurol. Scandinavica. Suppl. 1990; 129: 12-14PubMed Google Scholar) or deaminated (30Maker H.S. Weiss C. Silides D.J. Cohen G. J. Neurochem. 1981; 36: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to produce hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and reactive quinone species capable of covalently modifying cellular macromolecules (31Graham D.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1978; 14: 633-643PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, MPP+-mediated displacement of DA from secretory vesicles could not only lead to cytoplasmic DA oxidation and generation of free radicals but also to extracellular DA release and oxidation, both of which could contribute to dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Given the alternative and possibly overlapping hypotheses as to the source and sequelae of MPP+-induced free radicals, the present study used free radical sensitive fluorophores together with pharmacological and molecular techniques to determine the role of DA in MPP+-mediated toxicity in primary dopaminergic neurons. Cultures of murine (CF1; Charles River Laboratories) mesencephalic neurons were prepared as described previously (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/glass microwell plate (1.25 × 103 cells/mm2). For DA release/content assays, cells were plated at a density of 400,000 cells/16-mm well (2 × 103 cells/mm2). Experiments were conducted after 6 days in vitro unless otherwise specified. MPP+ iodide,dl-α-methyl-p-tyrosine (MPT), mazindol, nifedipine, and reserpine were purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Dihydroethidium (DHE), rotenone, 3-hydroxytyramine (dopamine), 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (DHT), and succinate were obtained from Sigma. Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) and rhodamine 123 (R123) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The C3 isomer of malonic C60 was a kind gift from Dr. L. Dugan (Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine; Ref. 33Dugan L.L. Turetsky D.M. Du C. Lobner D. Wheeler M. Almli C.R. Shen C.K. Luh T.Y. Choi D.W. Lin T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9434-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). [7,8-3H]Dopamine was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. C3 was dissolved in water, DHT was dissolved in 1% ascorbic acid, and mazindol was first dissolved in 50 mm HCl and then diluted in medium. Reserpine, rotenone, and the fluorophores were dissolved in Me2SO as stock solutions and then diluted in medium such that the final concentration of Me2SO was <0.1%. Controls for each drug condition consisted of sister cultures treated with the vehicle used to dissolve that drug. To monitor intracellular superoxide formation in response to MPP+ and rotenone, we used the redox-sensitive dye DHE, which is converted into fluorescent ethidium by superoxide anions (34Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Budd S.L. Castilho R.F. Nicholls D.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 36Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with DHE for 20 min at 37 °C, rinsed, fixed, and processed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunocytochemistry. For TH staining, an alkaline phosphatase-mediated color reaction was used instead of fluorophore conjugation to prevent bleed-through fluorescence from the TH staining procedure. TH positive neurons were identified at 60× using differential interference contrast. Cellular DHE fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 595 nm) was imaged using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Noran Odyssey) and measured using an image analysis system (Metamorph, Universal Imaging). Measurements were normalized to DHE fluorescence from untreated dopaminergic neurons. Although pretreatment with MPT or reserpine decreased basal DHE fluorescence by 18 and 22%, respectively, their attenuation of MPP+-induced oxidation was greater than could be accounted for by this decrease. To ensure that rotenone does not induce the production of other ROS, like hydroxyl and peroxynitrite, we used the fluorescent dye DHR as described previously (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dopaminergic neurons were identified with the autofluorescent serotonin analog DHT, stained with 15 μm DHR for 20 min at 37 °C, and imaged (excitation, 488 nm; emission, >515 nm). Cells were then fixed and stained for TH, and field relocation was used to confirm that DHT cells were indeed dopaminergic. To exclude the possibility that enhanced DHE fluorescence was an artifact of decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm; Ref. 35Budd S.L. Castilho R.F. Nicholls D.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we monitored changes in ΔΨm following both rotenone and MPP+treatment using the fluorescent, potentiometric dye R123. Cells were stained with DHT and 0.3 μm R123 and imaged exactly as described previously (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure extracellular and intracellular DA levels, all drug treatments were performed in 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer solution/0.01%l-cysteine. To measure extracellular DA, the culture medium was removed and filtered with a 0.1-μm nylon filter. For measurement of intracellular DA, 175 μl of 0.1 nperchloric acid/0.01% l-cysteine was added to each well after medium removal. Cells were freeze-thawed, and the perchloric acid lysates were filtered. Samples were stored on ice or frozen at −80 °C until use. A 100-μl aliquot from each sample was then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Coulochem electrochemical detector (ESA, Bedford, MA) and an ESA catecholamine HR-80 reverse phase column (37Owens G.C. Johnson R. Bunge R.P. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 38Tang L. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 475-479PubMed Google Scholar). The mobile phase consisted of 100 mmNaH2PO4·H20, 80 mg/liter EDTA, 250 mg/liter heptasulfonic acid, and 6% methanol titrated to pH 2.5. Peaks were identified by retention times set to known standards. To measure DA release, cells were loaded with 2.4 μCi/ml [3H]DA/Krebs-Ringer solution for 20 min at 37 °C and washed 3 times for 3 min. Radioactive counts from a wash sample were measured using a Beckman scintillation counter and used as a control for basal levels of [3H]DA release. Cells were then treated with 1 μm MPP+ for 10 min, and the amount of [3H]DA released during this time period was counted. Cultures were then washed extensively and maintained in [3H]DA-free Krebs-Ringer solution. Extracellular [3H]DA was measured after an additional 10, 30, and 50 min. The amount of spontaneous [3H]DA released at equivalent time periods in vehicle-treated wells was subtracted from the amount of [3H]DA released at each treatment time point. Following medium collection, cells were lysed in 0.1n perchloric acid by freeze-thawing, and residual, intracellular [3H]DA was measured. To determine dopaminergic cell viability following MPP+ treatment, mesencephalic cultures were processed for TH immunoreactivity and counted as described previously (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, six consecutive fields were assayed per dish leading to the quantification of 200–300 TH neurons/experiment. Experiments were repeated 3–5 times using cultures isolated from independent dissections. Descriptive statistics (means ± S.E.) of cell survival counts were calculated with the statistical package GraphPad Prism Software. Cell survival curves were generated using the means ± S.E. with data collected from at least three separate experiments. The significance of effects between control and drug conditions was determined by one- or two-way factor ANOVA as indicated and post-hoc Student's t tests (GraphPad Prism Software). Overproduction of ROS has been proposed to be an important mechanism underlying the cytotoxicity of MPP+ (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Przedborski S. Kostic V. Jackson-Lewis V. Naini A.B. Simonetti S. Fahn S. Carlson E. Epstein C.J. Cadet J.L. J.

In support of this model, our previous studies have shown that doses of MPP+ capable of killing 70% of cultured dopaminergic neurons produced an early, 3-fold increase in superoxide radicals (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that mitochondria are a major cellular source of ROS (for review see Ref. 42Richter C. Gogvadze V. Laffranchi R. Schlapbach R. Schweizer M. Suter M. Walter P. Yaffee M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and that MPP+ is thought to block Complex I activity, it has been hypothesized that MPP+-induced ROS are mitochondrial in origin. Because MPP+ and rotenone are thought to bind to the same site on Complex I (5Ramsay R.R. Krueger M.J. Youngster S.K. Gluck M.R. Casida J.E. Singer T.P. J.

Although high concentrations of rotenone have been shown to induce superoxide production in vitro and in vivo(8Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 9Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 10Hasegawa E. Takeshige K.

Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), other studies have suggested the converse (44Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 45Rottenberg H. Wu S. Biochim. Biophys.

To determine whether rotenone mimicked MPP+-induced changes in mitochondrial function, we monitored mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and free radical production in response to this drug. Specific changes in dopaminergic neurons were determined by either preloading cells with the monoaminergic-specific, autofluorescent dye DHT as described previously (32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by post-hoc identifying cells using TH immunocytochemistry. For example, the ethidium cation released from DHE, a dye widely used to monitor superoxide production (34Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Budd S.L. Castilho R.F. Nicholls D.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 36Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), can be stably intercalated into DNA. This property allowed DHE-treated cultures to be subsequently stained for TH. Fields containing TH positive cells were then imaged by confocal microscopy. Low doses (5–50 nm) of rotenone killed dopaminergic neurons (LD50 = 20 ± 5.2 nm) with a similar time course and morphology to MPP+ (Fig. 1 and Ref. 32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the loss of cell viability, rotenone-treated dopaminergic neurons did not exhibit an increase in intracellular superoxide levels at any time point studied (Fig. 2, A and C). Moreover, subtoxic doses of rotenone as well as doses capable of killing up to 75% of the dopaminergic population had no effect on superoxide generation (not shown). In contrast, dopaminergic neurons treated with a mean lethal dose of MPP+ exhibited a robust increase in superoxide that reached a plateau between 1 and 3 h (Fig. 2, A and B, and Ref. 32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DHE fluorescence was punctate in appearance and localized to mitochondria.Figure 2MPP+ but not rotenone induces ROS although neither drug depolarizes ΔΨm. A, mesencephalic cultures were exposed to 1 μmMPP+ or 20 nm rotenone for 20 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h and incubated with DHE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were subsequently stained for TH, and fields containing dopaminergic neurons were imaged by confocal microscopy.

Castilho R.F. Nicholls D.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we monitored changes in ΔΨm following both rotenone and MPP+ treatment using the fluorescent, potentiometric dye R123. No significant change in ΔΨmwas observed in cells treated with MPP+ (Fig. 2 B), whereas rotenone-treated cells displayed a small, significant increase in ΔΨm after 3 h of drug exposure (Fig. 2 C). The latter finding is similar to reports by others suggesting that low (nM) to moderate (<5 μm) doses of rotenone have either no effect on ΔΨm (45Rottenberg H. Wu S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 46Chinopoulos C. Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or lead to a modest hyperpolarization (47Mokhova E.N. Rozovskaya I.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 48Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These data support earlier observations that following Complex I blockade ΔΨm is maintained by hydrolysis of glycolytic ATP via reversal of the ATP synthase (44Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 49Scott I.D. Nicholls D.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Because ΔΨm was not dissipated by MPP+ or rotenone, we used the fluorescent dye DHR as an independent measure of free radical formation (50Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophysics. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 51Dugan L.L. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M. Handran S.D. Rothman S.M. Lin T.S. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6377-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown previously, MPP+ exposure led to a significant increase in DHR fluorescence in identified dopaminergic neurons, whereas rotenone led to a modest but significant decrease in DHR oxidation (Fig. 3). Therefore, because the classic Complex I inhibitor rotenone did not induce ROS as indicated by two independent methods, we conclude that MPP+-induced superoxide does not arise from blockade of electron transport. Numerous slice and in vivo studies have shown that MPP+induces a massive, rapid outflow of DA that can subsequently be oxidized (13Pileblad E. Nissbrandt H. Carlsson A. J. Neural Transm. 1984; 60: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Chang G.D. Ramirez V.D. Brain Res. 1986; 368: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Rollema H. Damsma G.

Brain Res. 1988; 443: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to assess whether this process also occurred in our simplified dopaminergic culture system and, if so, what the source and export mode of DA might be. Following treatment with 1 μm MPP+, rapid reductions in intracellular DA were observed that remained depressed for >16 h (not shown). Concomitantly, extracellular DA levels rose (Fig. 4 A). Brief (5 min) pretreatment with 10 μm reserpine, a VMAT2 inhibitor, almost completely blocked MPP+-induced DA release (Fig. 4 B), whereas lower doses of reserpine (10 and 100 nm) did not. In agreement with striatal slice studies (14Schmidt C.J. Matsuda L.A. Gibb J.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 103: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 53Pileblad E. Carlsson A. Neuropharmacology. 1985; 24: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), pretreatment with the general calcium channel blocker, CdCl2 (100 μm), or the specific calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, did not affect MPP+-induced DA release excluding a Ca2+-dependent, exocytic process (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, 10 μmmazindol, a DAT inhibitor, significantly blocked toxin-mediated release suggesting that, upon vesicular displacement, DA is extruded from the cell by reverse transport via the plasma membrane DAT (Fig. 4 C). Predictably, DAT blockade was accompanied by an increase in intracellular DA content (Fig. 4 D). Thus, in this paradigm, MPP+ redistributes vesicular DA to the cytoplasm followed by its outward transport through the DAT. Because redistributed DA can be easily autoxidized to produce a variety of ROS, including superoxide anions, we hypothesized that MPP+-induced superoxide production arises from DA metabolism. To test this hypothesis, cells were depleted of both stored and newly synthesized DA using the VMAT2 blocker reserpine and the TH inhibitor MPT. Incubation of cells with either 100 μm MPT or 10 nm reserpine for 3 h led to 75–80% depletion of intracellular DA (DA content with MPT was 24.72% ± 5.91 of control, with reserpine 22.54% ± 2.02 of control). Because reserpine and MPT concentrations exceeding 100 nm and 1 mm, respectively, were toxic over a prolonged period of time, the minimum effective dose needed to deplete DA was used. MPP+ treatment resulted in a significant increase in superoxide that could be fully blocked by the general free radical scavenger, carboxyfullerene isomer C3 (Fig. 5, A and B, and Ref. 33Dugan L.L. Turetsky D.M. Du C. Lobner D. Wheeler M. Almli C.R. Shen C.K. Luh T.Y. Choi D.W. Lin T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9434-9439Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with reserpine or MPT also blocked DHE fluorescence, suggesting that redistributed DA is the major contributor to MPP+-generated superoxide (Fig. 5,A and B). In this set of experiments, MPP+ led to a lower increase in superoxide formation than previously observed (Fig. 2 and Ref. 32Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was correlated with decreased toxicity (<50%; not shown). Presumably this was due to lot-to-lot variation in the toxin because 1 μmMPP+ typically killed 50–70% of dopaminergic neurons. To further test the hypothesis that DA oxidati"

We obtained simultaneous recordings of action potentials from large subsets of VNO neurons. These cells responded to components of urine by increasing their firing rate. This chemosensory activation required phospholipase C function. Unlike most other sensory neurons, VNO neurons did not adapt under prolonged stimulus exposure. The full time course of the VNO spiking response is captured by a simple quantitative model of ligand binding. Many individual VNO neurons were strongly selective for either male or female mouse urine, with the effective concentrations differing as much as a thousandfold.

When the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 was treated with cadmium for 12 h, evidence of apoptotic features, including change in nuclear morphology, DNA fragmentation, formation of DNA ladder in agarose gel electrophoresis, and phosphatidylserine externalization, were obtained. Moreover, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was observed in the cadmium-treated cells and was inhibited by a broad caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK). Caspase inhibitors suppressed the DNA fragmentation in the order of Z-VAD-FMK > caspase-8 inhibitor > caspase-3 inhibitor.

The toxicity of cadmium as an industrial pollutant and a food contaminant, and as one of the major components in cigarette smoke is well established (1Morselt A.F. Toxicology. 1991; 70: 1-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cadmium can cause a number of lesions in many organs, such as the kidney, the testis, the lung, the liver, the brain, the bone, the blood system, etc. (2W. H. O.Environmental Health Criteria 134: Cadmium. 1st Ed. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland1992Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of toxicity of cadmium is not yet clear. Recently, several reports have shown that cadmium can induce apoptosis of many tissues and cells both in vivo andin vitro, such as the cells of the respiratory system (3Hart B.A. Lee C.H. Shukla G.S. Shukla A. Osier M. Eneman J.D. Chiu J.F. Toxicology. 1999; 133: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the testis (4Zhou T. Zhou G. Song W. Eguchi N. Lu W. Lundin E. Jin T. Nordberg G.

Toxicology. 1998; 128: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), etc. This evidence indicates that apoptosis probably plays a very important role in acute and chronic intoxication with cadmium. Further research on this aspect of cadmium would have significance in the prevention and cure of the diseases induced by cadmium. Apoptosis is a fundamental form of cell death, and it plays an essential role in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Apoptosis disorders are associated with many diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative disease, toxin-induced disease, etc. (12Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the apoptotic process, caspases, a family of asparate proteases, lie in a pivotal position (13Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Two independent pathways of apical caspases activation, receptor-intermediated caspase 8 and mitochondria-cytochromec intermediated caspase 9 activation, converge on the activation of executing caspases, key substrate cleavage, and apoptotic death (14Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is very important in maintaining the normal function of the cell. Increases and decreases in calcium ion are possible causes of apoptosis (15McConkey D.J. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 16Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). The radius of Cd2+, a common form of free cadmium in the body, is very similar to that of Ca2+ (0.099 and 0.097 nm, respectively). Cd2+ not only competitively inhibits the influx of Ca2+ (17Swandullar D. Armstrong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1736-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) but also causes the increase of [Ca2+]i through inhibiting Ca2+-ATPase on the membrane of the depot of calcium (18Visser G.J. Peters P.H. Theuvenet A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, cadmium can activate or inhibit some calcium-related enzymes instead of Ca2+ (19Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Thus, investigation on the role of interactions of calcium ions in cadmium-induced apoptosis is important for understanding the mechanism of toxicity of cadmium. In this study, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by cadmium in human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells, which possess the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (20Kimura C. Zhao Q.L. Kondo T. Amatsu M. Fujiwara Y. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 239: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was investigated. We herein show that two independent pathways, the Ca2+-calpain pathway and the caspase-mitochondria pathway, are probably involved in the regulation of cadmium-induced apoptosis.

Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bid, Bad, IP3Rs 1, 2, and 3, and β-actin monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. U937 cells obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resource Bank were grown in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Apoptosis in U937 cells was induced with cadmium chloride. Some cells were pretreated with caspase inhibitors (100 μm) or calpain inhibitor I and II (20 and 50 μm) for 2 h prior to exposure to cadmium. Quantitative DNA fragmentation assay was carried out according to the method of Sellins and Cohen (21Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of DNA ladder was examined in 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis (22Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell morphology was examined by Giemsa staining. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization of apoptosis was determined by two-color analysis of Annexin V/FITC binding and propidium iodide (PI) uptake using flow cytometry (EPICS XLTM Coulter, Beckman) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After treatment for 6 h, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with Ca2+-free HEPES-buffered Ringer solution (HR; pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.13 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mmglucose, and 10 mm HEPES). The buffer was supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin Fraction V, 2% minimal Eagle's essential amino acids, and 2 mml-glutamine. About 3 × 105 cells in 1 ml of HR were loaded with Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Then an aliquot of cell suspension (10 μl) was transferred to a glass bottom dish coated with Cell-Tak and left for 10 min. After addition of HR to the chamber, digital imaging by Fura-2 fluorescence (ratio of 340 nm/380 nm at 510 nm) was carried out with an inverted microscope (TE300; Nikon) and a digital image processor (Argus 50 CA; Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) (23Kondo T. Kano E. Habara Y. Kanno T. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After treatment with cadmium, cells were stained with 40 nm DiOC6(3) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 1% fetal bovine serum for 15 min at 37 °C, then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested for flow cytometry (24Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Hirsch T. Gomez-Monterrey I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Control and Cd2+-treated cells were collected and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed at a density of 106 cells/50 μl of lysis buffer (1 mTris-HCl, 5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min. After brief sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein content in the supernatant was measured using a Bio-Rad protein system. Western blot analyses of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, Bid, Bad, IP3Rs 1, 2, and 3, and β-actin were performed using specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (see above), as described previously (25Zhao Q.-L. Kondo T. Noda A. Fujiwara Y. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results of examinations of DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder formation, observation of cell morphology, and PS externalization consistently revealed that cadmium induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Nonrandom DNA fragmentation has been regarded as one of the typical end points of apoptosis (26Khodarev N.N. Sokolova I.A. Vaughan A.T. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 73: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A illustrates that DNA fragmentation induced by cadmium was concentration-dependent and time-dependent; DNA fragmentation increased with increasing concentrations of cadmium up to 100 μm after 6, 12, and 24 h of exposure to cadmium but decreased beyond 100 μm. However, no DNA fragmentation increased after 3 h of treatment. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation culminated 12 h after treatment with cadmium. Thus, 100 μm cadmium and 12 h of treatment were often used in this study. After cadmium treatment for 12 h, observation of DNA ladder formation and morphological changes supported the evidence of DNA fragmentation (Figs. 1 B and2, C and D). The observation of cell morphology illustrated that cadmium-treated cells underwent prominent cytoplasmic aggregation, nucleatic condensation, and fragmentation, which were typical signs of apoptotic features. Morphological change (including PI staining) showed that at concentrations of more than 100 μm, the number of necrotic cells apparently increased (data not shown).Figure 1Cadmium-induced DNA fragmentation in U937 cells. A, U937 cells were treated with cadmium at final concentrations indicated for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Then DNA fragmentation assay was carried out according to the method of Sellins and Cohen (21Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3199-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented as the means ± S.D. (n = 4). B, U937 cells were treated with 100 μm cadmium for 12 h, and DNA was extracted from control and cadmium-treated cells.

These data represent three experiments.C and D, after exposure to 0 (C) or 100 μm (D) cadmium for 12 h, cells were collected for Giemsa staining and then examined under a microscope at a magnification of 10 × 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PS externalization is an early symbol of apoptosis (27Denecker G. Dooms H. Van Loo G. Vercammen D. Grooten J. Fiers W. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry using Annexin V/FITC and PI double staining revealed that after exposure to cadmium, cells with externalized PS significantly increased depending on cadmium concentration and exposure time. At 6 h, early apoptotic cells (only Annexin V/FITC staining) were predominantly observed; as time progressed or as the concentration increased, secondary necrotic cells in a later stage of apoptosis (double Annexin/FITC V and PI staining) were in the main position. These results indicate that at later stages of apoptosis, the plasma membrane was damaged by cadmium (Fig. 2, A and B). To elucidate the effect of the interaction between Ca2+ and Cd2+ in apoptosis induced by cadmium, we used Fura-2, which is derived from Fura-2/AM through esterase in cells, to determine the change in ion concentration of the cells. Fluorescence in cells treated for 6 h with cadmium became much stronger than that in control cells, and this change showed a dose-effect relationship. Unfortunately, the excitation response of Fura-2 to Cd2+ is almost an exact match to that of Fura-2 to Ca2+. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish Ca2+ from Cd2+ (28Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar). Verapamil, a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel inhibitor (10el Azzouzi B. Tsangaris G.T. Pellegrini O. Manuel Y. Benveniste J. Thomas Y. Toxicology. 1994; 88: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), reduced fluorescence of Fura-2 in cells; moreover, 70 μm verapamil delayed DNA fragmentation induced by cadmium. These results indicated that cadmium probably entered into U937 cell via voltage-dependent calcium channels, and verapamil inhibited this passage, resulting in delayed DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3). After combined treatment of cadmium and verapamil, the increased fluorescence (cells indicating a ratio higher than 1.6) appeared to indicate intracellular Ca2+ release induced by cadmium, because verapamil blocks both Ca2+ and Cd2+ entry into the cells. To further determine the contribution of [Ca2+]ito the increase in ion concentration, we used a cell-permeable, specific Cd2+ chelator (TPEN, Cd2+ Ka = 1016.33; Ca2+ Ka = 104.47), and fluorescence in cells significantly decreased, but it did not completely reverse the fluorescence of Fura-2 in cells, even though the concentration of TPEN increased to 100 μm. These results suggest that in addition to augmentation of [Cd2+]i, [Ca2+]i was probably elevated (Fig. 4 A). Because cadmium competitively inhibits Ca2+influx (18Visser G.J. Peters P.H. Theuvenet A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mechanism of [Ca2+]i increase in cells exposed to cadmium has not been elucidated. In some apoptotic systems, elevation of [Ca2+]i was mediated through IP3Rs (25Zhao Q.-L. Kondo T. Noda A. Fujiwara Y. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Khan A.A. Soloski M.K. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabtini D.M. Li S.H. Ross A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In our study, therefore, the expression of IP3R subtypes was investigated at 12 h after cadmium treatment (Fig. 4 B). The expression of IP3R1 was apparently enhanced in a dose-dependent manner, but IP3R2 and IP3R3 were not detected. These results demonstrated that, probably via the IP3R1 pathway, cadmium induced the release of calcium into the cytoplasm from its intracellular depot, such as endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) did not affect the expression of IP3R1. Calcium ion can act on multiple targets to trigger apoptosis (14Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Recently, calpain, calcium-dependent protease has been considered as a possible target through which elevated calcium triggers apoptosis (30Carafoli E. Molinari M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Calpain inhibitor I significantly reduced DNA fragmentation by 40% at low concentrations, and there was little difference between 20 and 50 μm. However, calpain inhibitor II was not effective until its concentration reached 50 μm. The results, therefore, indicate that calpain may take part in the Ca2+-dependent pathway of apoptosis induced by cadmium (see Fig. 6 A). In many systems, apoptosis is associated with the loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (Δψm), which may be regarded as a limiting factor in the apoptotic pathway (31Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Mut. Res. 1999; 434: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To observe the change in Δψm in cells exposed to cadmium, DiOC6(3), a mitochondria-specific and voltage-dependent dye, was employed. After U937 cells were exposed to cadmium for 12 h, Δψm was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C). However, at 3 and 6 h, the loss of Δψm was indiscernible. Although it has been reported that cadmium was able to cause the loss of Δψm via oxidant injury (32Rickan L.E. Yamano T. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2000; 14: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 33Yang C.F. Shen H.M. Shen Y. Zhuang Z.X. Ong C.N. Environ. Health. Perspect. 1997; 105: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), no significant increase in intracellular oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide or superoxide, in the cadmium-treated cells was observed by flow cytometry with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium in our study (data not shown). Because of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in the cadmium-treated cells, it was speculated that caspases may play an essential role in the process of cadmium-triggered apoptosis. First, Z-VAD-FMK (caspase inhibitor I) and Boc-D-FMK (caspase inhibitor III), two kinds of broad spectrum, irreversible caspase inhibitors, were used. Z-VAD-FMK almost completely inhibited cadmium-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 B); Boc-D-FMK also showed a similar result (data not shown). Moreover, Z-VAD-FMK also inhibited the loss of Δψm. These results suggest that cadmium probably triggers apoptosis of U937 cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. To determine which kinds of caspases take effect in apoptosis induced by cadmium, a series of inhibitors, caspase-1 inhibitor VI (Z-YVAD-FMK), caspase-2 inhibitor I (Z-VDVAD-FMK), caspase-3 inhibitor II (Z-DEVD-FMK), caspase-5 inhibitor I (Z-WEHD-FMK), caspase-6 inhibitor I (Z-VEID-FMK), caspase-8 inhibitor II (Z-IETD-FMK), and caspase-9 inhibitor I (Z-LEHD-FMK), were employed for preventing DNA fragmentation in apoptosis. The results revealed that both caspase-8 inhibitor and caspase-3 inhibitor were able to prevent cadmium-induced DNA fragmentation. Moreover, caspase-8 inhibitor was more effective than caspase-3 inhibitor in this respect (Fig. 6). Cleavage of Bid is important for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in CD95-induced apoptosis (34Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). Bid was present as a ∼26-kDa protein in U937 cells (Fig. 7 A). The proform of Bid slowly decreased depending on the cadmium concentration. At the same time, caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) both inhibited the cleavage of Bid induced by 100 μm cadmium. A member of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-xL, significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner, and at the same time, Bcl-xS, which is the cleaving product of Bcl-xL, slowly appeared as Bcl-xL was reduced. It has been reported that Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS have completely contrary effects; the former inhibits but the latter promotes apoptosis (35Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 B). This evidence is consistent with our results. Caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) did not affect the expression of Bcl-xL. In contrast, no change in the expression of Bcl-2/Bax proteins was apparent in cadmium-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (Fig. 7 C), although Bcl-2/Bax has been regarded as the regulator of the release of cytochromec in apoptosis (36Otlvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar). Bad expression was not detectable in U937 cells treated with cadmium, although Bcl-xL can counteract the effect of Bax (37Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and be sequestered by Bad in cytosol (38Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The present study shows that cadmium is able to induce apoptosis in U937 cells, and in this process, there may be two different and independent pathways for inducing apoptosis by cadmium. One is the Ca2+-calpain-dependent pathway, and the other is the caspase-dependent pathway. In recent years, the effect of IP3R in apoptosis has been the focus of attention. The elevation of and selective expression of IP3R subtype involved in apoptosis are due to many stimuli, such as anti-immunoglobulin M, dexamethasone (29Khan A.A. Soloski M.K. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabtini D.M. Li S.H. Ross A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), irradiation (25Zhao Q.-L. Kondo T. Noda A. Fujiwara Y. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), B-cell antigen receptor (39Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), etc. On the other hand, cells with failure in Ca2+ elevation owing to deficient IP3R1 or IP3R2 are resistant to apoptosis by dexamethasone, irradiation, or Fas ligand in U937 cells (40Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Our study reveals that cadmium is able to up-regulate the expression of IP3R1 but not IP3R2 or IP3R3 in U937 cells. It has been reported that a majority of IP3R1 was distributed on the surface of endoplasmic reticulum (41Harnick D.J. Jayaraman T. Ma Y. Mulieri P. Go L.O. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2833-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, because of competitive inhibition of Ca2+ influx via the calcium channel and the expression of IP3R1 in U937 cells, the elevation of calcium ion caused by cadmium possibly derives from endoplasmic reticulum. Verapamil delayed cadmium-induced DNA fragmentation, probably because it inhibited the Cd2+influx via the Ca2+ channel so that the IP3R1 up-regulation was extended. Of course, the possibility should not be excluded that cadmium in cells may directly mobilize Ca2+or enhance Ca2+ mobilization, because cadmium can inhibit all types of Ca2+-ATPase (19Beyersmann D. Hechtenberg S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 42Verbost P.M. Senden M.H. van Os C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 902: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 43Zhang G.H. Yamaguchi M. Kimura S. Higham S. Kraus-Friedmann N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2184-2189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calpain is a family of Ca2+-dependent cystein proteases whose members are expressed ubiquitously (44Ono Y. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Calpain has been reported to be involved in several models of apoptosis and to take effect as a target of Ca2+-dependent activation (45Vanags D.M. Pörn-Area M.I. Coppola S. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31075-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 46Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, calpain plays an essential role in apoptosis because of cadmium, because calpain inhibitors inhibited the DNA fragmentation induced by cadmium in our study. Furthermore, calpain inhibitor I was more potent than calpain inhibitor II. In addition, in addition to calpain, calcium ions are able to activate other targets to trigger apoptosis, such as Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, whose involvement has been shown in UV-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. On the other hand, the other effects of cadmium in cells should be considered. Cd2+ not only causes Ca2+ elevation but also activates some calcium-related enzymes, for example, protein kinase C (47Long G.J. Toxicol. Lett. 1997; 91: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (48Wang Z. Templeton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 73-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), calmodulin-dependent kinase (49Kostrzewska A. Sobieszek A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), etc. Hence, further research is necessary to determine whether cadmium can directly activate apoptotic proteases (calpain, calcium-dependent endonuclease, etc.) instead of calcium. The caspase family is divided into two groups: one group, derived from procaspase with long predomains (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10), is called “initiator” or “upstream” caspases, and the other, which is derived from precursor with short predomains is called “effector” or “downstream” caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7, and -14) (50Li H.L. Yuan J.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In our study, Z-VAD-FMK (broad spectrum inhibitor) inhibited DNA fragmentation and PS externalization induced by cadmium, suggesting that caspase may be involved in the process of cadmium-triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, caspase-8 and -3 inhibitors also inhibit cadmium-induced DNA fragmentation, but caspase-2, -6, -7, and -9 inhibitors do not. Therefore, we hypothesize that probably caspase-8 is the most apical caspase in cadmium-induced apoptosis, and finally signal converges to caspase-3. According to previous reports, caspase-8 not only directly cleaves and activates caspase-3 (51Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) but also indirectly activates caspase-3 by inducing cytochrome c release (52Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). According to observations, the loss of Δψm because of cadmium seems to support this evidence. Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member containing BH3domain, can be cleaved by caspase-8, and the cleaved Bid, the carboxyl-terminal fragment, translocates to mitochondria to induce the release of cytochrome c, which is 500 times more numerous than Bax (53Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). In our study, the decrease in the proform of Bid means that it is cleaved in cadmium-induced apoptosis, and Z-VAD-FMK and caspase-8 inhibitor block this cleavage. This suggests that the cleavage of Bid is caspase-8-dependent. Besides Bid, other Bcl-2 family members are associated with the release of cytochrome c. For example, Bax promotes cytochrome c release, but Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL counteract the effect of Bax and inhibit the release of cytochrome c (37Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 54Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl-xL can itself bind to cytochrome c and Apaf-1 to prevent apoptosis (55Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Israels S. Pocinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 56Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In cadmium-induced apoptosis, the change in Bcl-2 and Bax is not apparent, but the level of Bcl-xL apparently decreases in a concentration-dependent manner, and Bcl-xS, which is the product of Bcl-xL cleavage and which promotes apoptosis (36Otlvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5878) Google Scholar), increases along with the decrease in Bcl-xL. Bad, another Bcl-2 family members that sequesters Bcl-xL, was not detected in U937 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Bid and Bcl-xL are possibly involved in the caspase-dependent pathway of cadmium-induced apoptosis, resulting in cytochrome c release and enhancement of the apoptotic process. Although no reports have been published showing the activation of caspase-8 induced by cadmium, it is speculated that cadmium may activate caspase-8 by elevating the expression of Fas ligand. This is not only because caspase-8 is a key component of the Fas/APO 1 death receptor-triggered apoptosis pathway (53Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar), but also because many other apoptotic pathways initiated by distinct stimuli require Fas engagement. For instance, cell apoptosis triggered by anticancer drugs (57Harwood F.G. Kasibhatla S. Petak I. Vernes R. Green D.R. Houghton J.A. J. Biol.

Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5414-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated by up-regulation of Fas L and its interaction with Fas. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that cadmium activates caspase-8 via a pathway independent of Fas L, such as activated Lck (62Belka C. Marini P. Lepple-Wienhues A. Budach W. Jekle A. Los M. Lang F. Schulze-Osthoff K. Gulbins E. Bamberg M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4983-4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further study is necessary to elucidate the mechanism. In summary, possibly via two different pathways, cadmium induces apoptosis in U937 cells (Fig. 8). In addition, because caspase degrades calpastatin, which is an endogenous inhibitor of calpain (63Kato M. Nonaka T. Maki M. Kikuchi H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and promotes the Ca2+-calpain pathway and because the Bcl-2 family and Ca2+ act on each other (64Kuo T.H. Kim H.R. Zhu L., Yu, Y. Lin H.M. Tsang W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), they may complement each other."
https://openalex.org/W2089199332,"Familial prion diseases are thought to result from a change in structure of the mutant prion protein (PrP), which takes a pathogenic conformation. We have examined the role of molecular chaperones in the folding of normal and mutant PrP Q217R (PrP217) in transfected neuroblastoma cells. In a previous report we showed that, although most of the PrP217 forms escape the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system and aggregate in post-Golgi compartments, a significant proportion of PrP217 retains the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidyl inositol signal peptide (PrP32), and does not exit the endoplasmic reticulum (Singh, N., Zanusso, G., Chen, S. G., Fujioka, H., Richardson, S., Gambetti, P., and Petersen, R. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28461–28470). We have now studied the folding and turnover of PrP32 to understand the mechanism by which abnormal PrP forms cause cellular toxicity in our cell culture model and in the human brain carrying the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease Q217R mutation. In this report, we show that PrP32 remains associated with the chaperone BiP for an abnormally prolonged period of time and is degraded by the proteasomal pathway. This study is the first demonstration that BiP is chaperoning the folding of PrP and plays a role in maintaining the quality control in the PrP maturation pathway. Our data provide new insight into the diverse pathways of mutant PrP metabolism and neurotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2063753173,"The existence of a general relation between population density and body size in animal assemblages has been debated because of known biases and ambiguities in the published data and data handling. Using new comprehensive data sets from two geographically separated stream communities that encompass 448 and 260 invertebrate taxa with a wide range of body sizes, we show that an inverse proportionality between density and body size is a consistent feature in these communities. The scaling across taxa is not statistically different between the two systems, indicating a convergent pattern of communities. Variation in the regression slope among different taxonomic groups indicates that these communities are not governed universally by a single ecological or energetic rule."
https://openalex.org/W2075744249,"The tissue or glandular kallikreins (KLK) are members of a highly conserved multigene family encoding serine proteases that are central to many biological processes. The rodent KLK families are large, highly conserved and clustered at one locus. The human KLK gene family is clustered on chromosome 19q13.3–13.4, and until recently consisted of just three members. However, recent studies have identified up to 11 new members of the KLK family that are less conserved than their rodent counterparts. Using a Southern blot and sequence analysis of 10 BACs and cosmids spanning approximately 400 kilobases (kb) either side of the original KLK 60-kb locus, we demonstrated that these genes also lie adjacent to this. We have also clarified the position of several microsatellite markers in relation to the extended KLK locus. Moreover, from Southern blot analysis of the cosmids and BACs with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe to the histidine-encoding region of serine proteases, we have shown that there are no other serine protease genes approximately 400 kb centromeric and 220 kb telomeric of the extended locus. We performed an extensive analysis of the expression patterns of these genes by poly(A)+ RNA dot blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and demonstrated a diverse pattern of expression. Of interest are clusters of genes with high prostate (KLK2–4) and pancreatic (KLK6–13) expression suggesting evolutionary conservation of elements conferring tissue specificity. From these findings, it is likely that the humanKLK gene family consists of just 14 clustered genes within 300 kb and thus is of a comparable size to the rodent families (13–24 genes within 310 and 480 kb, respectively). In contrast to the rodent families, the newest members of the human KLK family are much less conserved in sequence (23–44% at the protein level) and appear to consist of at least four subfamilies.

These findings highlight the involvement of the KLK family in a number of different and complex enzymic pathways that underlie several important biological functions. The wide range of potential functions of these enzymes is emphasized by their diverse, yet specific, tissue expression patterns. WhereasKLK2 and KLK3 are primarily expressed at high levels in the secretory epithelium of the prostatic ducts and have been implicated in normal prostatic function as well as in cancer progression (8Rittenhouse H.G.

This diverse functionality is underscored by the ubiquitous expression pattern observed for KLK1 in the rat (9MacDonald R.J. Southard-Smith E.M. Kroon E. J. Biol.

Indeed, Southern blot analysis of a human genomic library, using a monkey KLK cDNA with 92–95% homology to humanKLK cDNAs (28Lin F.K. Lin C.H. Chou C.C. Chen K. Lu H.S. Bacheller W. Herrera C. Jones T. Chao J. Chao L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicated that there may be as many as 19 human KLK genes (29Murray S.R. Chao J. Lin F.-K. Chao L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1990; 15: S7-S16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number ofKLK-related serine protease gene sequences have been detected that lie telomeric to the original KLK locus, thus expanding the human KLK gene family (30Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Diamandis E.P. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 2843-2852PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physical mapping of this locus has not yet been described and the definitive size of the family is not clear. In addition, the location of the various microsatellite markers in the KLK locus is not clear. In this study, we have physically mapped the serine protease genes clustered at the KLK locus and defined the position of key microsatellite markers. We have also confirmed the order and orientation of the 10 putative new members of the human KLKfamily which span approximately 300 kb across the KLK locus on chromosome 19q13.4. We have further determined that no other serine protease genes are present within the regions surrounding theKLK locus. In addition, extensive gene expression studies have identified the most abundant sites of expression for these genes and a diverse tissue specificity of expression similar to the rodentKLK family. Also, phylogenetic analysis of the 14 serine proteases encoded by the KLK genes of this locus demonstrated the extent of divergence within the expanded family and suggested that there are at least four human KLKsubfamilies. Four cosmids (R32740, R31381,F22702, and R28781) and six BAC clones (BC772576, BC778306, BC33747, BC85745, BC349237, and BC892989), that spanned the classicalKLK locus (KLK1–3) and approximately 400 kb either side of this region, were used in the following studies. Five hundred-ml cultures of Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml kanamycin or 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol, were inoculated with the BAC and cosmid clones, respectively, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. DNA was then extracted using the alkaline lysis method, followed by RNase A digestion and ethanol precipitation. Twenty μg of DNA from the set of 10 BAC and cosmid clones were digested overnight at 37 °C with the restriction enzyme EcoRI, then separated electrophoretically on a 1% agarose gel. The gel was treated with 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH for 30 min to denature the DNA, rinsed briefly in distilled water, followed by a 30-min incubation in neutralization buffer (1.5 mNaCl, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The DNA was capillary blotted onto Hybond NTM nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight in 20 × SSC then cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. Membranes were hybridized with a32P-random labeled cDNA probe (Ambion), or a32P-end labeled gene-specific oligonucleotide probe (TableI), or a 32P-end labeled degenerate oligonucleotide probe to the highly conserved regions spanning either the catalytic histidine codon (GGTSCTSACAGCYGCCCAYTG; 16-fold degeneracy; S = G or C, Y = C or T) or the the catalytic serine codon (CAGIGGICCICCIGARTCAAC; 512-fold degeneracy; I = inosine, r = A or G) characteristic of serine proteases. Hybridization was performed overnight in ExpressHybTM solution (CLONTECH) at 42 or 55 °C for oligonucleotide and cDNA probes, respectively. Blots were washed in 1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS up to 55 °C, then exposed to x-ray film (AGFA Curix Ortho) at −80 °C.Table ISouthern blot probesGeneDNA/oligonucleotide probesKLK1/KLK15′-CTGGACGTGGGCTTTTTCGCAC-3′KLK2/KLK25′-TCTAAGGCTTTGATGCTTCAG-3′KLK3/KLK35′-GGTATTTCAGGTCAGCCACAG-3′KLK4/KLK45′-CTACCGTGCTGCAGTGCGTG-3′KLK5/KLKL25′-AGTGCACTTGGGGGCTCTTGGTT-3′KLK6/protease M5′-TGTCCTGGTCATGGCTGGC-3′ (RT-PCR)5′-AATCACCATCTGCTGTCTTGC-3′KLK7/SCCE5′-GCCCAGGTGCACGGTGTACTC-3′KLK8/Neuropsin5′-CAATGATCTGCCAGGCTGA-3′ (RT-PCR)5′-GAGCCCCAGGATGTGATGCCC-3′KLK9/KLKL3RT-PCR product (678 bp)5′-CCCCCAGCCTGAGATGAGACACT-3′KLK10/Nes15′-GCCGTGGTGCCCCAGCCAGCA-3′ (RT-PCR)5′-GGTAAACACCCCACGAGAGGA-3′KLK11/TLSP5′-GGTGATGGAGACTGGCGA-3′KLK12/KLKL55′-AGGTCGTGCTCGTGGCTCGTC-3′KLK13/KLKL4EST clone AA002101 EcoRI/HindIII digest (1500 bp)5′-AGGGGTTAGGCGGTTGTTGTGG-3′KLK14/KLKL6EST clone AI935298 EcoRI/HindIII digest (750 bp)5′-TGTTCACGCATTGCAGAGAGG-3′Southern blot analysis of chromosome 19q cosmid/BACEcoRI-digested DNA was performed using 32P-end labeled oligonucleotide probes for KLK5–8 andKLK10–12, and 32P random-labeled cDNA probes for KLK9 and KLK13–14.

Approximately 320 kb of draft sequence of chromosome 19q13.3-13.4 (available at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the DOE Joint Genome Institute website), beginning ∼50 kb upstream of where two of the original KLK genes (KLK2–3) were localized and searched with the conserved peptide sequences spanning the catalytic histidine, aspartate, and serine residues of KLK serine proteases (WVLTAAHC, HDLMLLKL, and GDSGGPL; catalytic residue underlined). This was performed using the data base creating tool and the tBLASTN algorithm available at the Australian National Genome Information Service. In addition, the cDNA sequence of each of the serine proteases, KLK1(accession number X13561), KLK2 (accession number S39329),KLK3 (accession number M26663), KLK4 (accession number AF113141), KLK5 1 (KLKL2, accession numberAF135028), KLK6 (Protease M, accession number U62801),KLK7 (SCCE, accession number L33404), KLK8(neuropsin, accession number AB009849), KLK9 (KLKL3, accession number AF135026), KLK10 (Nes1, accession numberAF024605), KLK11 (TLSP, accession number AB012917),KLK12 (KLKL5, accession number AF135025), KLK13(KLKL4,accession number AF135024), and KLK14 (KLKL6, accession number AF161221), was aligned against this genomic sequence using the BLASTN algorithm available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. BLASTN searches were also performed against the draft chromosome 19q13.3-13.4 sequence using microsatellite marker sequences between 272.77 and 276.46cR3000 at interval D19S425-D19S418. Marker sequences used were: WI-9055 andM21896, U37672, stSG39975, sts-S39329, WI-20869, stSG30247, stSG32045, stSG1457, stSG3375, stSG372, sts-H71236, SGC35527, U37672, stSG30429, sts-AA028917, and L12214. The computer software DNAStar (Lasergene) was used to construct an EcoRI restriction enzyme map of this sequence. These data were then used in conjunction with the data obtained by physical mapping and the EcoRI map available at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory website to determine the exact position of each gene and to reconstruct a definitiveEcoRI map of this region. Multiple alignment of deduced protein sequences was performed using the Eclustal tool available at Australian National Genome Information Service. The percentage identity between each of the 14 kallikreins was calculated using the Homologies tool on the Australian National Genome Information Service website. Phylogenetic studies were also performed via the Australian National Genome Information Service website. A distance matrix between the structures of the proteases was computed from the alignment using the Dayhoff program of the Phylip package (31Felsenstein J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 521-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The Neighbor-joining method was then used to construct a tree from the distance matrix. ForKLK1–4, 32P-end labeled oligonucleotides were used to probe a CLONTECH Master blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from 50 different human tissues. Hybridizations were performed overnight in ExpressHybTMsolution (CLONTECH) at 42 °C. ForKLK6–11 DNA fragments used in the poly(A)+ RNA dot blot analyses were obtained by RT-PCR using the primers detailed in Table II. RT-PCR was performed as described below for the screening of the cancer cell lines. Amplicons were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and ligated into pGEM-T or pGEM-T Easy (Promega). DNA insert orientation was examined by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion analysis. ForKLK5 and KLK12–14, probes were generated from EST clones accession number W07551, accession numbers AI394679,AA002101, and AI935298 (Genome Systems Inc), respectively. Prior to radioactive labeling each construct was linearized before transcription using T7, T3, or SP6 RNA polymerase as appropriate to generate an antisense cRNA. Radiolabeled cRNA probes were generated from these clones by incorporation of [32P]UTP (Geneworks) using a StripEzTM kit (Ambion) and hybridized, in UltrahybTM solution (Ambion), to a Multiple Tissue Expression array (CLONTECH) containing poly(A)+ RNA from 76 different human tissues and cell lines at 65 °C overnight. All blots were washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS up to 70 °C, and signals were detected by exposure of the blot to x-ray film (AGFA Curix Ortho) for 1–7 days at −80 °C. Control blots, containing DNA for each of the 14 kallikreins, were included in each hybridization to confirm the specificity of the radiolabeled probes.Table IIPCR primersGenePCR primersProduct sizeKLK1/KLK1Forward 5′-TGGAGAACCACACCCGCCAAG-3′468 bpReverse 5′-ACGGCGACAGAAGGCTTATTG-3′KLK2/KLK2Forward 5′-GCCTAAAGAAGAATAGCCAGGT-3′375 bpReverse 5′-CTCAGACTAAGCTCTAGCACAC-3′KLK3/KLK3Forward 5′-GCATCAGGAACAAAAGCGTGA-3′138 bpReverse 5′-CCTGAGGAATCGATTCTTCAG-3′KLK4/KLK4Forward 5′-GCGGCACTGGTCATGGAAAAGG-3′526 bpReverse 5′-CAAGGCCCTGCAAGTACCCG-3′KLK5/KLKL2Forward 5′-GAGCTGGGGCCGGGGAAGAC-3′657 bpReverse 5′-TGGGCCGGGCACAAGGGTAA-3′KLK6/Protease MForward 5′-GAGCGGCCATGAAGAAGC-3′459 bpReverse 5′-AATCACCATCTGCTGTCTTGC-3′KLK7/SCCEForward 5′-GCCCAGGGTGACAAGATTATT-3′569 bpReverse 5′-GTACCTCTGCACACCAACGG-3′KLK8/NeuropsinForward 5′-TACTCTGTGGCGGTGTCCTTG-3′523 bpReverse 5′-GAGCCCCAGGATGTGATGCCC-3′KLK9/KLKL3Forward 5′-GGCCGGCCTCTTCCACCTTAC-3′678 bpReverse 5′-GCGCGGGCTCAGTTCTCCAT-3′KLK10/Nes1Forward 5′-GCGGAAACAAGCCACTGTGGG-3′486 bpReverse 5′-GGTAAACACCCCACGAGAGGA-3′KLK11/TLSPForward 5′-CCGCTACATAGTTCACCTGG-3′284 bpReverse 5′-AGGTGTGAGGCAGGCGTAACT-3′KLK12/KLKL5Forward 5′-TGGCAGACAAAGAGACAAGGT-3′944/815 bpReverse 5′-CTTAGAAGGGCTGGCAGGAG-3′KLK13/KLKL4Forward 5′-CTACACCTGCTTCCCCCACTCTCA-3′617 bpReverse 5′-GCCGGTCAGGTTGCCCACAT-3′KLK14/KLKL6Forward 5′-CTGGGCAAGCACAACCTGAG-3′517 bpReverse 5′-GCATCGTTTCCTCAATCCAGC-3′Primer pairs used for the detection of the 14 KLK genes by RT-PCR and for the generation of DNA fragments for KLK6–11, used in poly(A)+ RNA dot blot analyses.

The percent difference in sequence between an individual primer and each of the 14 genes for all primers used averaged 74%. The following cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection: T47D (breast cancer cell line); HaCAT (keratinocyte cell line); OVCAR-3 (ovarian cancer cell line); HEC1A, Ishikawa, and KLE (endometrial cancer cell lines); and DU145, PC3, and LNCaP (prostate cancer cell lines). An additional prostate cell line, ALVA41, was obtained from Dr. A. Nakla, St Luke's Hospital, New York. The normal kidney tissue samples and the renal carcinoma cell lines, Caki1 and SN12k1, were a gift from Dr. David Nicol, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. The prostate tissue samples were obtained during surgery by Dr. Robert Gardiner, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Brisbane. The ovarian cancer cell line, PEO1, was obtained from Dr. Michael McGuckin, Mater Medical Research Institute, Brisbane. Salivary gland tissue total RNA was purchased from CLONTECH and the human salivary gland cell line was obtained from Dr. Ray MacDonald, University of Texas, South-Western Medical Center, Dallas, TX. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% deactivated fetal calf serum and supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin G and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (CSL Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Total RNA was extracted from the cell lines using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction. The cDNA was subsequently diluted 5-fold and PCR was then performed in a reaction mixture containing 1 μl of cDNA, 25 ng of each primer (Table II), 0.1 mm dNTPs (containing dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP), 2 μl of 10 × reaction buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.5 units of platinum Taq (Life Technologies), and sterile water to 20 μl. The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 5 min to activate the polymerase, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62–68 °C for 1 min (depending on the target gene), 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Ten μl of the PCR mixture was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The resulting amplicons were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using digoxigenin 3′ end-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Table I), internal to the PCR primers used, in EasyHybTMsolution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 37 °C. Washes were performed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C. In addition, for each kallikrein cDNA primer pair at least one band of the predicted size was excised from a second 2% agarose gel following electrophoresis. The DNA recovered from each band was sequenced to determine the specificity of the PCR products. Gene-specific olionucleotides, used as probes in the genomic and/or RT-PCR Southern blot analyses (Table I) were selected from regions with maximum dyshomology among the kallikreins based on a multiple sequence alignment of the 14 cDNAs. The primers used in the PCR reactions (Table II) were designed to span at least one intron for each of the 14 genes. The primer pairs were chosen for their compatibility (i.e. no hairpin stem loops and similar melting temperatures) and were found to be specific for the gene in question upon BLAST analysis. In addition, the percent difference for each primer/probe as compared with those of all the 14 genes was calculated and found to range from 50 to 95%. The average percent divergence for the oligonucleotides used as probes in the Southern blot experiments was 70% whereas the average for the primers used in the PCR was 74%.

https://openalex.org/W2093203710,"The lung is composed of a series of branching conducting airways that terminate in grape-like clusters of delicate gas-exchanging airspaces called pulmonary alveoli. Maintenance of alveolar patency at end expiration requires pulmonary surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and proteins that coats the epithelial surface and reduces surface tension. The surfactant lining is exposed to the highest ambient oxygen tension of any internal interface and encounters a variety of oxidizing toxicants including ozone and trace metals contained within the 10 kl of air that is respired daily. The pathophysiological consequences of surfactant oxidation in humans and experimental animals include airspace collapse, reduced lung compliance, and impaired gas exchange. We now report that the hydrophilic surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) directly protect surfactant phospholipids and macrophages from oxidative damage. Both proteins block accumulation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and conjugated dienes during copper-induced oxidation of surfactant lipids or low density lipoprotein particles by a mechanism that does not involve metal chelation or oxidative modification of the proteins. Low density lipoprotein oxidation is instantaneously arrested upon SP-A or SP-D addition, suggesting direct interference with free radical formation or propagation. The antioxidant activity of SP-A maps to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein, which, like SP-D, contains a C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain. These results indicate that SP-A and SP-D, which are ubiquitous among air breathing organisms, could contribute to the protection of the lung from oxidative stresses due to atmospheric or supplemental oxygen, air pollutants, and lung inflammation.

By weight, surfactant is composed of 90% phospholipids and 10% protein, including the hydrophilic surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D), and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins B (SP-B) and C (SP-C) (1Goerke J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). After secretion into the ELF, the components of surfactant form membranes at the air-liquid interface that spread readily and compress poorly during cyclical respiratory expansion and contraction of the alveolus. These properties of surfactant result in enhanced lung compliance during inspiration, which reduces the work of breathing, and very low alveolar surface tension at end expiration, which helps to maintain airspace patency. Exposure of surfactant to ambient oxygen and potent environmental oxidants such as ozone results in peroxidation of unsaturated phospholipids, surfactant inactivation, airspace collapse, and impaired gas exchange (2Matalon S. Holm B.A. Notter R.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 62: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Antioxidant protection of surfactant phospholipids in the ELF has classically been attributed to low molecular mass components urate, ascorbate, and reduced glutathione and to proteinaceous antioxidants superoxide dismutase and catalase (3Macnee W. Rahman I. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160 (suppl.): 58-65Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The serum apolipoproteins apoE and apoAIV, which are intimately associated with lipid aggregates including chylomicrons, low density lipoproteins (LDL), and high density lipoproteins, have been reported to prevent lipid peroxidation and to protect against the development of atherosclerosis (4Qin X. Swertfeger D.K. Zheng S. Hui D.Y. Tso P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1836-H1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hayek T. Oiknine J. Brook J.G. Aviram M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 201: 1567-1574Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to determine if the surfactant-associated proteins contribute to the prevention of lipid oxidation in the airspaces of the lung. Surfactant proteins A and D are the pulmonary members of the collectin family of proteins, which also includes the serum proteins mannose-binding proteins A (MBP-A) and C (MBP-C), bovine conglutinin, and CL-43 (6Lawson P.R. Reid K.B. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Like all collectins, SP-A and SP-D have similar basic structural organization including an N-terminal segment with one or two interchain disulfide bonds, a collagen-like domain of Gly-X-Y repeats containing hydroxylated amino acids, an amphipathic helical “neck” region, and a C-terminal, C-type lectin domain (CLD) (7Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Trimerization occurs by triple helix formation in the collagen-like domain and bundled α-helical coiled-coil formation in the neck region. At the level of quarternary structure, however, the pulmonary collectins diverge. Variably glycosylated subunits of SP-A (apparent molecular mass range 26–38 kDa) assemble into a hexamer of trimers that are disulfide-linked at the N terminus and laterally associated through the first portion of the collagen-like domain, forming a flower bouquet-like structure with an estimated mass of 600,000 kDa (8Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For SP-D, four trimers composed of glycosylated 42-kDa subunits form a 500,000-kDa cruciform-shaped oligomer joined by disulfide bonds at the N terminus (9Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins bind calcium ions at two or three sites within the CLD (10Haagsman H.P. Sargeant T. Hauschka P. Benson B.J. Hawgood S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8894-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 255-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Data from sedimentation, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analyses indicate that SP-D resides primarily in the aqueous compartment of the ELF, while SP-A is intimately associated with surfactant lipid membranes and aggregates (12Wright J.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 931-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The unifying functional theme for the collectins is innate host defense, and several laboratories have reported that the pulmonary collectins aggregate and opsonize diverse microbial species and enhance the clearance of microorganisms from the lungs of mice (13Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, the pulmonary collectins also perform specialized roles in the structure and function of pulmonary surfactant. Experimental data suggest that SP-A protects the surface activity of surfactant from serum protein inhibitors (14Cockshutt A.M. Weitz J. Possmayer F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8424-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), contributes to stability of surfactant aggregates such as tubular myelin (15Suzuki Y. Fujita Y. Kogishi K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and inhibits the activity of some phospholipases A2 (16Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Am. J.

Today. 1999; 5: 244-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), while SP-D appears to be required for the maintenance of surfactant homeostasis and lung structure (18Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Almost all reported SP-A and SP-D ligand binding properties require calcium, but neither protein has been reported to have enzymatic activity or to be associated with metals other than calcium. Here we demonstrate that SP-A and SP-D also have potent, direct phospholipid and cellular antioxidant properties. Substrates for lipid oxidation included mixtures of natural and synthetic glycerophospholipids that are found in pulmonary surfactant and human LDL. The model surfactant lipids, composed of egg phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and 1-oleoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1:1:0.15:0.15, w/w/w/w, respectively) (Avanti Polar Lipids) were mixed in chloroform and dried to a film under nitrogen. Following resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline or 0.15 m NaCl, multilamellar vesicles were generated by vigorous vortexing for 5 min. LDL were isolated from the plasma of normal blood donors by density gradient ultracentrifugation (density = 1.019–1.063 g/ml), as described previously (4Qin X. Swertfeger D.K. Zheng S. Hui D.Y. Tso P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1836-H1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stored in saline-EDTA. Prior to use, EDTA was removed by dialysis to equilibrium against at least 2000 volumes of saline, and the concentration of LDL in mg of LDL-associated protein was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Native SP-A and SP-D were isolated from the alveolar wash of rats that had been pretreated with intratracheal silica to enhance the collectin yield (20Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). After overnight centrifugation at 40,000 × g, rat SP-D was purified from the supernatant by maltose-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and rat SP-A was purified from the pellet by NaBr flotation, butanol extraction, and mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography (21McCormack F.X.

Wild-type and mutant recombinant rat SP-A, SP-D, and MBP were synthesized using baculovirus vectors and purified by carbohydrate-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (21McCormack F.X.

Mouse SP-D purified from granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/SP-A null mice by maltose-Sepharose affinity chromatography was a gift from J. Whitsett (Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH). Human SP-A purified from the alveolar lavage of patients with alveolar proteinosis (AP-SP-A) was isolated by repeated washings of the surfactant pellet with buffer containing 0.9% NaCl and 2 mmCa2+, followed by elution of SP-A with 4 mmEDTA, dialysis, and Ca2+-dependent adsorption to a mannose-Sepharose column (modified from Ref. 24Suwabe A. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). AP-SP-A was examined for the presence of lipid soluble antioxidants by isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography (Genox Corp.). The lower detection limits included the following: lutein, 20 ng/ml; zeaxanthin, 10 ng/ml; cryptoxanthin, 10 ng/ml; α-carotene, 10 ng/ml; β-carotene, 10 ng/ml; retinol, 60 ng/ml; retinyl-palmitate, 10 ng/ml; α-tocopherol, 1 μg/ml; δ-tocopherol, 10 ng/ml; γ-tocopherol, 250 ng/ml. The purity of all proteins was verified to be >95% by 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To ensure that the collectin reagents used were free of diffusable contaminants including EDTA, all proteins were dialyzed to equilibrium against at least 400 volumes of buffer (5 mm Tris for SP-A and AP-SP-A and 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl for SP-D and MBP), with at least three buffer exchanges. For some experiments, rat SP-A and rat SP-D were alkylated by incubation with 0.5 m iodoacetamide at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h and then extensively dialyzed. To examine the role of metal ion chelation in the collectin antioxidant function, two methods were used to presaturate the SP-A and SP-D with copper sulfate. The collectins were concentrated and incubated with 66–70 μmcopper sulfate (CuSO4) for 1 h at 4 °C or equilibrium-dialyzed overnight against more than 10,000 volumes of a 20 μm copper sulfate, 5 mm Tris solution at 4 °C. The pretreated proteins were then added directly to solutions containing lipid substrates and 10 μm CuSO4as outlined below. Stock solutions of 10 mm CuSO4 were freshly prepared daily. Reaction mixtures composed of 1 mg/ml surfactant lipids or 150 μg/ml LDL, 10 μm CuSO4, and putative antioxidant proteins or controls were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline or 0.9% saline. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 4 h for LDL and 24 h for surfactant lipids (25Gelvan D. Saltman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Control reactions that included LDL only, copper only, or protein controls of bovine serum albumin (BSA), rat IgG, recombinant MBP, rat serum, or human complement C1q were also performed. In some experiments, alternative oxidant stimuli were used. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) (50 μm) or ferric pyrophosphate (FePPi) (1 μm) plus ascorbic acid (0.25 mm) was incubated with the model surfactant lipids for 24 h in 0.9% saline. The free radical generator, 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH) (Aldrich) was incubated with surfactant lipids or LDL for 0.5–3 h. In all cases, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were measured using a method adapted from Gelvan and Saltman (25Gelvan D. Saltman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Samples and 0–10 μm 1,1,3,3-methylmalondialdehyde standards were developed by the addition of a solution composed of 0.375% thiobarbituric acid, 15% trichloroacetic acid, and 0.25 n HCl at a volume ratio of 1:2 of sample/developer. Following incubation at 95 °C for 30 min and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, an aliquot was read in a spectrophotometer using a 540-nm filter. An absorption scan (500–570 nm) of both the malondialdehyde-TBA adducts and the lipid-aldehyde TBA adducts indicated that the absorbance at 540 nm was representative of the peak obtained at the absorption maximum at 532 nm (not shown). For continuous assessment of lipid oxidation, the accumulation of conjugated dienes during LDL oxidation was monitored spectrophotometrically (26Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radical Med. Biol. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). Mixtures of 50 μg/ml LDL, 10 μm copper, and various amounts of surfactant proteins or control proteins were placed in quartz cuvettes and allowed to oxidize at room temperature over 335 min. Conjugated diene formation was assessed by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 234 nm in a spectrophotometer. Proteins were analyzed for oxidative modification of amino acid side groups that occur during lipid oxidation (27Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.G. Ahn B.W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). Briefly, carbonyl-containing protein adducts in reaction mixtures of 150 μg/ml LDL, 10 μm CuSO4, native or iodoacetamide-treated SP-A or SP-D, and BSA were derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (Oxyblot; Intergen). After size fractionation by 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, protein species were electrophorectically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was sequentially incubated with a rabbit anti-DNP IgG and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were developed by horseradish peroxidase-dependent oxidation of a chemiluminescent substrate and visualized using autoradiography. A murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was adhered to 24-well plates (2 × 104cells/well) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS overnight at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. After washing, the cells were incubated with 40 μm tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BOOH) in serum-free Ham's F-12 for 24 h in the presence of various concentrations of the surfactant proteins or BSA. Viability was assessed by exclusion of the vital dye, trypan blue. The ability of SP-A and SP-D to inhibit the copper-induced oxidation of a mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids found in surfactant was assessed by measuring the accumulation of TBARS during a 24-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 1). Native SP-A isolated from rat lungs inhibited oxidation of surfactant lipids in a dose-dependent fashion that was half-maximal at a concentration of 5.1 μg/ml (IC50 = 8.4 nm, assuming a mass of 600 kDa) and complete at 10.0 μg/ml (Fig. 1 a). Native SP-D also inhibited copper-induced surfactant lipid oxidation in a dose-dependent manner with maximal protection observed at doses equal to or greater than 0.5 μg/ml (Fig. 1 a). The IC50 for protection by SP-D was 0.1 μg/ml (IC50 = 0.2 nm, assuming a mass of 500 kDa), or approximately 35-fold lower than SP-A, and 100-fold lower than the antioxidant serum lipoprotein apoAIV (IC50≈ 50 nm) (4Qin X. Swertfeger D.K. Zheng S. Hui D.Y. Tso P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1836-H1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory concentrations for both lung proteins were well below their physiologic ELF levels, estimated to be 300–1800 μg/ml for SP-A and 36–216 μg/ml for SP-D (12Wright J.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 931-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Alkylation of SP-A with iodoacetamide completely blocked the antioxidant effects of the protein, even when the modified protein was added at concentrations that were 5-fold greater than the inhibitory level (Fig. 1 b). There was no protection from oxidation by control proteins albumin, rat serum, or the structurally similar molecule, C1q, at concentrations of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1 b). However, BSA exhibited dose-dependent inhibition at 100, 200, and 500 μg/ml, and rat serum partially inhibited oxidation at 500 μg/ml. A BSA concentration of 200 μg/ml or rat serum concentration of 500 μg/ml was required to achieve the same level of inhibition of oxidation that occurred with about 5.0 μg/ml SP-A or 0.1–0.2 μg/ml SP-D. These data indicate that the two hydrophilic surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-D, protect surfactant lipids from copper-induced oxidation in vitro, at physiologically relevant concentrations. Both SP-A and SP-D exhibited very similar antioxidant activity when LDL particles, which include unsaturated phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters, were used as the substrates for lipid oxidation (Fig. 2). The IC50 values for inhibition of copper-induced oxidation of LDL for SP-A and SP-D were 4.8 μg/ml (7.9 nm) and 0.1 μg/ml (0.3 nm), respectively, and complete inhibition of oxidation occurred at 10 and 1 μg/ml, respectively. In contrast, 20 μg/ml of the highly homologous collectin, recombinant rat mannose-binding protein A (rMBP) did not inhibit LDL oxidation (Fig. 2 b). Rat serum, albumin, C1q, and IgG had also no effect on LDL lipid oxidation at concentrations of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 2 b). Only approximately 2.5 μg/ml SP-A or 0.05 μg/ml SP-D was required to provide the same level of antioxidant protection as 500 μg/ml of rat serum. In the absence of oxidation inhibitors, the absolute TBARS level following a 4-h incubation with 10 μm copper was over 3 times greater for LDL than for surfactant lipids. For this reason, LDL was used as the lipid substrate for kinetic experiments and mutagenesis studies of the collectin antioxidant activities. The temporal relationship between the addition of SP-A or SP-D and the inhibition of LDL oxidation was determined spectrophotometrically by continuously monitoring conjugated diene accumulation associated with exposure to copper (26Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radical Med. Biol. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2136) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the oxidation-dependent rearrangement of 1,4-pentadienyl double bonds of LDL lipids to 1,3-butadienyl double bonds, which absorb in the ultraviolet range. In the presence of 10 μm copper at room temperature, LDL particles resist oxidation for up to 100 min as endogenous antioxidants such as α-tocopherol are consumed (Fig. 3). At that point, the rate of oxidation increases in proportion to the concentration of initiating radicals, reaching a plateau when all unsaturated fatty acids are consumed. When SP-A (Fig. 3 a) or SP-D (Fig. 3 b) proteins were included at zero time, they blocked the accumulation of conjugated dienes in a dose-dependent manner. With increasing surfactant protein concentrations, the predominant change was a decrease in the slope during the rapid oxidation phase, consistent with inhibition of free radical chain initiation or with free radical chain termination. The concentrations of SP-A and SP-D that prevented conjugated diene formation were very similar to those that were required to block TBARS formation. When fully suppressive concentrations of SP-A (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 c) or SP-D (1 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 d) were added at various time points during the propagation phase of oxidation, conjugated diene formation was completely arrested at the point of addition. The kinetics of oxidation inhibition by the collectins were distinctly different from those of 2 mm EDTA, which blocked conjugated diene accumulation only after a significant lag period (Fig. 3 d, inset). These data indicate that SP-A and SP-D directly interfere with lipid oxidation. Exposure of cultured mammalian cells to t-BOOH promotes a variety of toxic events including depletion of glutathione, mitochondrial dysfunction, and peroxidation of membrane lipids (28Sestili P. Brambilla L. Cantoni O. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine if SP-A and SP-D protect cells from oxidative stress, RAW 264.7 murine macrophages were exposed to 40 μm t-BOOH for 24 h in the presence of SP-A or SP-D at concentrations from 0.01 to 50 μg/ml (Fig. 4). Cell death was assessed by staining cells with the vital dye, trypan blue. We found that both SP-A and SP-D protected RAW cells from t-BOOH-induced death in a dose-dependent fashion that was half-maximal at concentrations of 0.52 μg/ml for SP-A and 0.56 μg/ml for SP-D and that reached a plateau at a concentration of approximately 1 μg/ml for both proteins. These data indicate that both SP-A and SP-D protect macrophages from oxidant stress. To determine the domain(s) of SP-A that are responsible for protection from copper-induced oxidation of LDL and synthetic lipids, we tested the activity of mutant recombinant SP-As containing deletions in N-terminal domains in the TBARS assay (Fig. 5). Wild type recombinant SP-A inhibited copper-induced oxidation of LDL to the half-maximal point at 2.1 μg/ml and to basal levels at 5.0 μg/ml. A mutant SP-A containing a deletion of the collagen-like region (ΔG8–P80) (21McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J.J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) but retaining the N-terminal segment and interchain disulfide bonds was nearly as active as the wild type recombinant protein (IC50 = 2.8 μg/ml). A non-disulfide-cross-linked trimeric construct composed solely of the neck and CLD region of the protein (ΔN1–P80) (23McCormack F.X. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3173-3183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was also a potent antioxidant, with an IC50 of 6.7 μg/ml. Although carbohydrates are known to have antioxidant properties, the protection of lipids by SP-A was not attributable to the oligosaccharide attached to Asn187, since a nonglycosylated neck and CLD construct containing an N187S mutation also inhibited both LDL and surfactant lipid oxidation (ΔN1-P80,N187S) (Figs. 1 b and 2 b). We conclude that the antioxidant activity of SP-A is localized to the polypeptide sequences in the C-terminal (neck + CLD) domains of the protein. Several experiments were performed to evaluate the role of collectin-mediated copper chelation in the prevention of lipid oxidation (Figs. 6 and7). First, the ability of SP-A to inhibit the oxidation of surfactant lipids in the presence of 2 mmCa2+ was assessed. Saturation of SP-A's known metal binding site in this manner had no effect on the antioxidant properties of the protein (Fig. 6). Second, SP-A retained activity and was equally efficacious in the oxidant assay whether extensively dialyzed against either 5 mm Tris or 20 μm copper sulfate (Fig. 6). Third, presaturation of SP-A and SP-D with 66–70 μm for 1 h before the addition to the reaction mixtures containing 10.0 μm copper and model surfactant lipids also had no effect on the antioxidant activity of either protein (Fig. 6). Fourth, SP-A inhibited lipid peroxidation by alternative oxidants, including ferric chloride and ferric pyrophosphate plus ascorbic acid (Fig. 7). However, SP-A did not inhibit LDL oxidation induced by the soluble free radical generator, AAPH, at 1, 5, 10, or 25 mm concentrations (not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that the lung collectins protect lipids from oxidation by a mechanism that is neither specific to copper or dependent on protein-mediated chelation of copper.Figure 7Inhibition of iron-induced oxidation of model surfactant lipids by SP-A. Model surfactant lipids were incubated with ferric chloride or ferric pyrophosphate plus ascorbic acid in the presence of the indicated concentrations of SP-A. Lipid peroxidation was quantified by TBARS assay and expressed as a fraction of lipid oxidation in the absence of surfactant proteins. Data are means ± S.E., n = 3–4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine if the surfactant proteins act as sinks for reactive lipid intermediates, we assessed covalent modification of SP-A and SP-D during LDL oxidation using a Western analysis technique that detects carbonyl adducts (27Levine R.L.

Oxidation of LDL produced a dense high molecular weight band that corresponded to B-100, the 514-kDa protein component of LDL, and several smaller bands. Incubation with 10 μg/ml SP-A or 1 μg/ml of SP-D blocked LDL oxidation without the appearance of oxidized protein species at the expected molecular masses for SP-A or SP-"

Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) plays a key role in the release of arachidonic acid as the substrate of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or COX-2. We found that the level of cPLA2 mRNA was markedly elevated in the polyps and correlated with the polyp size in the small intestine of theApc Δ716 knockout mouse, a model for human familial adenomatous polyposis. To determine the role of cPLA2 in intestinal tumorigenesis, we then introduced a cPLA2 gene mutation intoApc Δ716 mice. In the compound mutant mice, the size of the small intestinal polyps was reduced significantly, although the numbers remained unchanged. These results provide direct genetic evidence that cPLA2 plays a key role in the expansion of polyps in the small intestine rather than in the initiation process. In contrast, colonic polyps were not affected in either size or number. Interestingly, group X sPLA2 was constitutively expressed in the colon at much higher levels than in the small intestine. These results suggest that in the colon, group X sPLA2 supplies arachidonic acid in both the normal epithelium and the polyps even in the absence of cPLA2.

PGH2, the major product of the COX enzymes, is converted further by separate PG synthases to a variety of PGs, which play significant roles in tumorigenesis, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and angiogenesis (10Smith W.L.

Furthermore, treating Apc Δ716 mice with a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduces the polyp number and size more efficiently than treatment with sulindac, which inhibits both COX isoenzymes (16Oshima M.

These results indicate that lack or inhibition of COX-2 efficiently suppresses tumorigenesis inApc Δ716 mice.On the other hand, the development of intestinal polyps in theMin mouse is influenced by the genetic background of theMom1 locus on chromosome 4, where a group IIA sPLA2 gene (Pla2g2a) is located (20Dietrich W.F.

If group IIA sPLA2 plays a major role in the production of PGs in the polyp stromal cells where COX-2 is induced, the Min polyps in the AKR/J background are expected to be larger and more numerous than those in C57BL/6 or 129/Sv. On the contrary, both the number and size are smaller in AKR/J (23Gould K.A. Dietrich W.F. Borenstein N. Lander E.S. Dove W.F. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In several human colorectal cancers, it is cPLA2 that is up-regulated (24Dimberg J. Samuelsson A. Hugander A. Soderkvist P. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3283-3287PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to COX-2 induction, the higher levels of cPLA2 and AA may explain why human cancers synthesize increased amounts of PGs (25Soydan A.S. Gaffen J.D. Weech P.K. Tremblay N.M. Kargman S.

The C57BL/6 strain, which lacks the group IIA sPLA2 gene (Pla2g2a), does not show any major phenotypes, except that the polyp number and size are increased when the Apc Min mutation is introduced (21MacPhee M.

In addition, the level of cPLA2 mRNA correlates with the size of the polyps in theApc Δ716 small intestine. Because the level of group V sPLA2 mRNA is not affected significantly in intestinal polyps (Fig. 4), cPLA2 and group X sPLA2 appear to be the key regulators of AA supplies to the COX enzymes in the small intestine of the C57BL/6J strain, in which group IIA sPLA2 is mutated.We have demonstrated that the mutation in the cPLA2gene reduces the size but not the number of small intestinal polyps. Thus, cPLA2 appears to play a significant role in polyp expansion rather than in the initiation process. Although the reduction in polyp growth could have been caused by apoptosis in the cPLA2 mutants, there was no significant difference in the apoptotic index of the adenoma epithelium between the cPLA2homozygous and wild-type mice (data not shown). On the other hand, we reported earlier that a mutation in the COX-2 gene (Ptgs2) reduces both the size and the number of small intestinal polyps (16Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H.

Clinical Significance and Potential of Selective COX-2 Inhibitor. William Harvey Press, London1998: 129-139Google Scholar). We also reported that the polyp number correlates with the frequency of LOH in the Apc locus (27Oshima M. Oshima H. Kitagawa K. Kobayashi M. Itakura C. Taketo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4482-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the COX-2 mutation may affect not only polyp expansion but also the frequency of Apc LOH.In the colon, on the other hand, the mutation in the cPLA2gene does not affect either the number or size of polyps, which is in clear contrast with the colonic phenotype of the COX-2 mutant mice (16Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar,19Taketo M.M. Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Clinical Significance and Potential of Selective COX-2 Inhibitor. William Harvey Press, London1998: 129-139Google Scholar). This difference suggests that AA is supplied in the colon by a source other than cPLA2. In addition to cPLA2and group IIA sPLA2, groups V and X sPLA2s play significant roles in the release of AA in mammalian cells stimulated byA23187 or fetal calf serum/interleukin-1β (29Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Higashio K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita M. Arai H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Our results indicate that group X sPLA2 contributes to the release of AA in colonic polyps as well as in the normal epithelium (Fig. 4). Consistent with this interpretation, the small focal ulcerative lesions developed only in the small intestine, where group X sPLA2 mRNA was not induced in the absence of cPLA2. In addition, COX-2 mRNA was strongly induced also in cPLA2-negative colonic polyps (data not shown). These results collectively suggest that sufficient amounts of PGs are synthesized in the colon to support polyp expansion and to protect the mucosa from ulceration.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a mutation in the cPLA2 gene causes a reduction in polyp size in the small intestine. These results provide direct genetic evidence that cPLA2 plays a key role in the expansion of intestinal polyps rather than in their initiation process. Arachidonic acid (AA)1is a precursor for biosynthesis of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. In the unstimulated mammalian cell membrane, AA is esterified at thesn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (1Holtzman M.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Free AA is released upon activation of phospholipase A2(PLA2), in response to various extracellular stimuli such as cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters, mitogens, antigens, or endotoxins (2Dennis E.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S32-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain structurally diverse forms of PLA2, including cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2), secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), and Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (3Tischfield J.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, COX enzymes use free AA released by different phospholipases in certain cell types (6Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

PGH2, the major product of the COX enzymes, is converted further by separate PG synthases to a variety of PGs, which play significant roles in tumorigenesis, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and angiogenesis (10Smith W.L.

In human familial adenomatous polyposis, the tissue level of PGE2 is increased (13Rigas B. Goldman I.S. Levine L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 518-523PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yang V.W. Shields J.M.

In human colorectal cancer, the amount of COX-2 mRNA correlates with the size of the tumor (15Fujita T. Matsui M. Takaku K. Uetake H. Ichikawa W. Taketo M.M. Sugihara K. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4823-4826PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, COX-2 expression is induced in polyps ofApc Δ716 mice and Minmice, models for human familial adenomatous polyposis (16Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M.

Clinical Significance and Potential of Selective COX-2 Inhibitor. William Harvey Press, London1998: 129-139Google Scholar). Interestingly, a COX-2 null mutation significantly reduces the number and size of intestinal polyps inApc Δ716 mice (16Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treating Apc Δ716 mice with a selective COX-2 inhibitor reduces the polyp number and size more efficiently than treatment with sulindac, which inhibits both COX isoenzymes (16Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). These results indicate that lack or inhibition of COX-2 efficiently suppresses tumorigenesis inApc Δ716 mice. On the other hand, the development of intestinal polyps in theMin mouse is influenced by the genetic background of theMom1 locus on chromosome 4, where a group IIA sPLA2 gene (Pla2g2a) is located (20Dietrich W.F.

Mouse strains C57BL/6 and 129/Sv carry a homozygous mutation in thePla2g2a gene, but AKR/J and Balb/c are wild type forPla2g2a (21MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R.A. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). If group IIA sPLA2 plays a major role in the production of PGs in the polyp stromal cells where COX-2 is induced, the Min polyps in the AKR/J background are expected to be larger and more numerous than those in C57BL/6 or 129/Sv. On the contrary, both the number and size are smaller in AKR/J (23Gould K.A. Dietrich W.F. Borenstein N. Lander E.S. Dove W.F. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In several human colorectal cancers, it is cPLA2 that is up-regulated (24Dimberg J. Samuelsson A. Hugander A. Soderkvist P. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 3283-3287PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to COX-2 induction, the higher levels of cPLA2 and AA may explain why human cancers synthesize increased amounts of PGs (25Soydan A.S. Gaffen J.D. Weech P.K. Tremblay N.M. Kargman S. O'Neill G. Bennett A. Tavares I.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 1508-1512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the role of cPLA2 in intestinal tumorigenesis, we constructed compound mutant mice for both cPLA2 (26Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K.

Group V sPLA2 is more widely expressed than group IIA sPLA2 in mouse tissues (40Sawada H. Murakami M. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Kudo I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The C57BL/6 strain, which lacks the group IIA sPLA2 gene (Pla2g2a), does not show any major phenotypes, except that the polyp number and size are increased when the Apc Min mutation is introduced (21MacPhee M.

In addition, the level of cPLA2 mRNA correlates with the size of the polyps in theApc Δ716 small intestine. Because the level of group V sPLA2 mRNA is not affected significantly in intestinal polyps (Fig. 4), cPLA2 and group X sPLA2 appear to be the key regulators of AA supplies to the COX enzymes in the small intestine of the C57BL/6J strain, in which group IIA sPLA2 is mutated.We have demonstrated that the mutation in the cPLA2gene reduces the size but not the number of small intestinal polyps. Thus, cPLA2 appears to play a significant role in polyp expansion rather than in the initiation process. Although the reduction in polyp growth could have been caused by apoptosis in the cPLA2 mutants, there was no significant difference in the apoptotic index of the adenoma epithelium between the cPLA2homozygous and wild-type mice (data not shown). On the other hand, we reported earlier that a mutation in the COX-2 gene (Ptgs2) reduces both the size and the number of small intestinal polyps (16Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H.

It is therefore possible that the COX-2 mutation may affect not only polyp expansion but also the frequency of Apc LOH.In the colon, on the other hand, the mutation in the cPLA2gene does not affect either the number or size of polyps, which is in clear contrast with the colonic phenotype of the COX-2 mutant mice (16Oshima M.

This difference suggests that AA is supplied in the colon by a source other than cPLA2. In addition to cPLA2and group IIA sPLA2, groups V and X sPLA2s play significant roles in the release of AA in mammalian cells stimulated byA23187 or fetal calf serum/interleukin-1β (29Murakami M.

These results collectively suggest that sufficient amounts of PGs are synthesized in the colon to support polyp expansion and to protect the mucosa from ulceration. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a mutation in the cPLA2 gene causes a reduction in polyp size in the small intestine. These results provide direct genetic evidence that cPLA2 plays a key role in the expansion of intestinal polyps rather than in their initiation process. We thank Drs. K.

https://openalex.org/W1522162436,"Abstract An active multiglycosyltransferase system involved in the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose to various glycoprotein acceptors was found in the rat small intestinal mucosa. The present studies are concerned with the subcellular localization of these glycosyltransferases. Satisfactory isolation of smooth and rough surfaced microsomes from the intestinal mucosa was obtained by modifying the method of Dallner (Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand Suppl., 166, 1 (1963)). Kinetic studies, performed to establish optimum conditions for quantitative assays of the glycosyltransferases, were linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time. Smooth surfaced microsomes were the main submicrosomal loci for the glycosyltransferases; for example 95% of total microsomal polypeptidyl:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity was found in the smooth surfaced microsomes. The results of alkaline borohydride treatment and acid hydrolysis indicated that N-acetylgalactosamine was incorporated into the heat-treated rough surfaced microsomal acceptors primarily at the protein to carbohydrate linkages while in the case of the heat-treated smooth surfaced microsomal acceptors, this sugar was probably added to positions more distal in the polysaccharide moiety. Immunodiffusion showed that only the smooth surfaced microsomes contained a component immunologically identical with purified rat small intestinal mucin. These results suggest that both stepwise glycosylation and probably the attainment of an immunological identity of rat small intestinal mucin occur in the smooth surfaced microsomes."

However, widely different concentrations of La3+ and Gd3+ have reportedly been required for block of TRP3 channels in various expression systems. The present study provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy. After overexpression of TRP3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whole-cell currents through TRP3 were reversibly inhibited by La3+with an EC50 of 4 μm. For comparison, the organic blocker SKF96365 required an EC50 of 8 μm. Gd3+ blocked with an EC50 of 0.1 μm, but this block was slow in onset and was not reversible after wash-out. When the two lanthanides were added to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches, block was achieved with considerably lower concentrations (EC50 for La3+, 0.02 μm; EC50 for Gd3+, 0.02 μm). Uptake of La3+into the cytosol of Chinese hamster ovary cells was demonstrated with intracellular fura-2. We conclude that lanthanides block TRP3 more potently from the cytosolic than from the extracellular side of the plasma membrane and that uptake of lanthanides will largely affect the apparent EC50 values after extracellular application.

Although it is generally accepted that in many cells, the predominant signal for Ca2+ influx is the depletion of intracellular calcium stores (1Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms are not known in detail. Furthermore, the molecular structure of the Ca2+ channels permitting Ca2+entry across the plasma membrane has not been clarified. Proteins of the recently discovered TRP1family may be an essential part of these channels because antisense constructs of several TRP cDNAs inhibit store-operated Ca2+ influx (2Zhu X. Jiang M.

Heterologous expression of several members of the TRP family leads to the appearance of Ca2+-permeable cation channels (7Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) but these exhibit properties not congruent with those of channels mediating store-operated Ca2+ influx, particularly the Ca2+-selective calcium release activated calcium current (Icrac) channels (8Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 9Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of corresponding TRP orthologues in different cell types by different research groups resulted in ion currents that obeyed different regulatory principles. For example, TRP3 was initially characterized as a constitutively active, store-independent, Ca2+-regulated channel (10Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strubing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) but was also described as being regulated by diacylglycerol (11Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest a store-dependent mechanism for the activation of TRP3 (2Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar,12Preuss K.D. Noller J.K. Krause E. Gobel A. Schulz I.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, an important regulation of TRP3 occurs through its interaction with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (14Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar,15Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This interaction occurs at a defined region of TRP3 localized within the C-terminal tail that extends into the cytosol (16Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). A recent report (17Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) on this interaction indicates that overexpressed TRP3 channels are not activated by store-emptying alone. In light of these discrepant results on the regulation of TRP3, a detailed functional and biophysical characterization would be desirable for any study on heterologously expressed TRP family members, to clarify whether identical channels are expressed in the respective expression systems. In general, important tools for the characterization of ion channels are channel blockers. Unfortunately, there are no specific inhibitors known for any particular member of the TRP family. A widely used compound is SKF96365, but it is not specific because it inhibits Ca2+ entry channels at similar concentrations and effectivities as it inhibits other channels such as Cl− and cation channels (18Franzius D. Hoth M. Penner R. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Whether SKF96365 can be used to discriminate between various Ca2+ channels or between channels appearing after overexpression of members of the TRP family has not been determined in detail. In the absence of specific organic blockers, many researchers have resorted to the ions of the lanthanides gadolinium (Gd3+) and lanthanum (La3+). They block a wide range of Ca2+-permeable channels; however, the sensitivity to Gd3+ and La3+ may vary between different channels such that the sensitivity to lanthanides has been used as part of the characterization of overexpressed TRP channels. In the case of TRP3, however, discrepancies in this sensitivity have been reported. Zhu et al. (2Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) required 250 μmLa3+ for an inhibition by 30–40% of Ca2+entry through TRP3 channels expressed in COS-M6 cells; a complete block was achieved with 1 mm. The same authors induced a complete inhibition with 150 μm La3+ when TRP3 was expressed in HEK293 cells (19Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). An EC50 of 24 μm was estimated for the inhibition of TRP3 by La3+ in cultured bovine pulmonary endothelial cells (20Kamouchi M. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. Wissenbach U. Mamin A. Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), in line with a report that 50 μm abolished TRP3 currents in porcine aortic endothelial cells (21Balzer M. Lintschinger B. Groschner K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Considerably lower concentrations (10 μm) induced a complete inhibition of TRP3 in COS-1 cells (12Preuss K.D. Noller J.K. Krause E. Gobel A. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Gd3+ inhibited TRP3-related Ca2+ entry completely in HEK293 cells at a concentration of 200 μm, but 10 μm in the bath could be used to discriminate Ca2+ entry pathways endogenous in these cells from that attributable to TRP3, which was still apparent in the presence of 10 μm Gd3+ in the bath (19Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). When we tested the effects of the two lanthanides on TRP3 expressed in CHO cells, we were surprised to notice that the concentrations required for block were markedly lower than reported anywhere else in the literature. Although the effects of lanthanides are attributed to an action strictly confined to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (22Evans C.H. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. 1st Ed. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar), we examined block by Gd3+ and La3+ on the cytosolic side of TRP3 channels in inside-out patches. Concentrations were effective that were even lower than those required during extracellular application. Furthermore, entry of La3+ was directly demonstrated in fura-2-loaded cells. We propose that lanthanides may act on TRP3 from the intracellular side and that the extracellular concentrations at which lanthanides inhibit Ca2+ entry may be largely influenced by their cell-specific uptake rates. CHO cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 0.259 g/literN-acetyl-l-alanyl-l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of <103 cells/mm2. Expression vectors containing the genes of interest were imported into the cells either by intranuclear microinjection as described (10Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strubing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or by transfection (TransFast transfection reagent; Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The solution for injection contained 0.3 μg/μl reporter plasmid pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) and 1.5 μg/μl expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands) carrying the TRP3 cDNA. For transfection we used the TRP3-pcDNA3 vector in which the neomycin resistance was replaced by the cDNA of EGFP. Thus, TRP3 (under the control of cytomegalovirus promotor) and EGFP (under the control of SV40 promotor) were expressed from the same vector construct. Transfection was performed following the instructions of the manufacturer. After injection or transfection, cells were kept in culture medium for 18–27 h. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the whole-cell configuration as well as in the inside-out configuration as described (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). CHO cells exhibiting EGFP fluorescence were chosen for the experiments. For whole-cell measurements, the solutions contained (mm): standard bath (“N”): NaCl 140, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 1.2, glucose 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.4. NMDG bath (“NMDG”) was the same as standard bath, but NMDG was substituted for Na+. Pipette solution contained: CsCl2 140, MgCl2 2, EGTA 0.1, ATP 0.3, GTP 0.03, HEPES 10, pH 7.2. For inside-out patches, the solutions contained (mm): bath: sodium isethionate 120, hemi-calcium gluconate 11.86, hemi-magnesium gluconate 2, EGTA 10, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4; pipette: CsCl 120, hemi-calcium gluconate 3.6, hemi-magnesium gluconate 2, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4. Osmolarity was adjusted to 300 ± 10 mosm/kg using mannitol; the osmolarity difference between bath and pipette solution was kept below 5 mosm/kg. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) was first dissolved in Me2SO and then added to the bath solution. The final concentration of OAG in the bath was 100 μm; the concentration of Me2SO was 1%. SKF96365, GdCl3, or LaCl3 were added to the bath solution at concentrations as indicated. The holding potential was set to −60 mV. The membrane current was recorded with a Heka EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier using Heka's Pulse software (Heka Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). In whole-cell mode, currents were filtered at 1 kHz, in inside-out mode at 3 kHz; the sampling rates were set appropriately. NPo was calculated with IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, NY). Measurements were performed using a digital imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Germany). Fura-2 was excited with light of wavelength λex = 360 nm, and emission was measured at λem = 510 nm. For in vitro experiments, fura-2 salt (Calbiochem) was dissolved in nominally Ca- and Mg-free PBS ([fura-2] = 20 μm). Forin vivo experiments, CHO cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in fura-2/AM (Calbiochem) as described (24Dippel E. Kalkbrenner F. Wittig B. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); during measurements, the cells were kept in nominally Ca- and Mg-free PBS. Additionally, spectra of fura-2 in the presence of various concentrations of La3+ were obtained in a RF-5001PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu). Expression of TRP3 in CHO cells resulted in markedly enhanced whole-cell cation currents, in comparison to those in control CHO cells. Currents reached a maximum right after obtaining the whole cell configuration and declined steadily over several minutes. Inward currents were mostly carried by Na+ but also to a minor part by Ca2+ and disappeared when extracellular Na+ was substituted with the large impermeant cation NMDG (Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with our previous report on functional characterization of TRP3 (10Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strubing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To analyze the effects of lanthanides and SKF96365, we first determined the inhibition of currents by NMDG in each experiment. This defined the amplitude of cation currents. Thereafter, the normal bath was restored. Then, the cells were exposed to various concentrations of the inhibitors. In some experiments, the inhibitors were washed out to test for reversibility of the block. To quantify inhibition in a situation when currents decline spontaneously, we performed a graphical extrapolation of the currents from time periods when no inhibitor was present to the time in the presence of the inhibitors, thereby obtaining current values expected to be present if inhibitors had been absent. Actual currents in the presence of inhibitors were divided by these extrapolated current values, yielding the relative inhibition. The inhibition of TRP3 currents by La3+ (Fig.1 A) and SKF96365 (Fig. 1 B) was clearly distinct from the spontaneous current decline because it occurred much faster and was dependent on the concentration of the respective substance. An EC50 value of 4 μm was assessed for La3+ (Fig. 2 A). This inhibition could be reversed by wash-out of La3+ (Fig.1 A). SKF96365 did not completely block the currents even at the maximal concentrations applied (30 μm); the EC50 value was estimated to be 8 μm (Fig.2 B). Like SKF96365 and La3+, Gd3+ at concentrations between 1 and 30 μm induced a rapid inhibition of TRP3 currents (data not shown). This inhibition was complete since no further current depression was evoked by NMDG. Wash-out of Gd3+ did not lead to a recovery of the currents. When lower concentrations (0.1–0.3 μm) of Gd3+ were used (Fig. 1 C), inhibition of the currents occurred slowly although still distinctly faster than the spontaneous decline. The absolute amplitude of the currents in the presence of these low concentrations was above that after substitution of extracellular cations with NMDG, indicating a partial inhibition by Gd3+. The EC50 was estimated to be 0.1 μm (Fig.2 C). The peculiar kinetics of the Gd3+ effects could be explained if the action of the ion on TRP3 channels occurred from the cytosolic side of the membrane after a slow entry of Gd3+into the cell. To test this hypothesis directly, we performed experiments with inside-out patches in which the cytosolic side of the patches was exposed to Gd3+ concentrations from 30 nm to 1 μm. As reported (10Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strubing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), TRP3 channels in inside-out patches from CHO cells are characterized by a spontaneous channel activity right after obtaining the inside-out configuration and a decline of the activity over 3–6 min. Since it has been reported that a “rigorous” wash abolishes channel activity (14Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), exchange of the bath was performed by a slow exchange of the bath volume over 15–20 s, which did not cause rapid changes in channel activities. Since channel activity was low in most patches and is difficult to quantify due to the short open times (mean open time ≤0.2 ms according to Ref. 10Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strubing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), effects of higher Gd3+ concentrations (i.e. 0.1 and 1 μm) were analyzed in patches stimulated with the membrane-permeable diacylglycerol analogue OAG. OAG considerably stimulated TRP3 channels for about 2 min (Fig.3 A), in accordance with the report by Hofmann et al. (11Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Addition of Gd3+at 1 μm (5 out of 5) and 0.1 μm (10 out of 10) to those patches abolished channel activity within a few seconds (Fig. 3 B). Wash-out of Gd3+ did not restore channel activity, even in the continuous presence of OAG (data not shown). For a quantification of the concentration dependence of Gd3+, unstimulated patches were used because the time course of OAG-induced stimulations was too variable to allow calculation of relative inhibitions. Each patch was consecutively exposed to two increasing concentrations of Gd3+ (0.03 and 0.1 μm or 0.3 and 1.0 μm) for time periods of 40–50 s each. Afterward, a Gd3+-free bath was reestablished. Gd3+ induced inhibitions of channel openings as fast as the bath exchange was performed, in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs.4 and5 A). Again, wash-out of Gd3+ failed to restore channel activity. The same result was obtained when patches were exposed to only one concentration (0.1 μm) of Gd3+ for a short (20 s) time (data not shown). To test whether this observation indicates a long-lasting inhibition of TRP3 channels by Gd3+ or, alternatively, may reflect spontaneous complete decline of channel activity, the same protocol was performed with La3+ (0.03–1 μm) as inhibitor applied to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches (Fig.6). There was a concentration-dependent reduction of TRP3 channel activity (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to the experiments involving Gd3+, removal of La3+ led to a restoration of channel activity that may be considered complete if the spontaneous inactivation of the channels is taken into consideration (Fig. 6). Estimated EC50 values are 0.02 μmGd3+ and 0.02 μm La3+.Figure 5Concentration-dependent block by Gd3+ and La3+ in inside-out patch-clamp experiments. (Each data point represents two or three experiments; error bars denote S.E.) EC50 values were assessed by fitting the data with the variable-slope sigmoidal dose-response function.

Figure shows channel activity, expressed as NPo over time. At thearrows, the bath solutions were changed as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate that La3+ actually enters the cytosol of CHO cells, we performed experiments with fura-2. A shift in the excitation spectrum of fura-2 by lanthanum has been described (25Kwan C.Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 678-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in fluorescence at excitation wavelengths from 300 to 350 nm. At 360 nm, we found that La3+ led to a concentration-dependent decrease in the fluorescence of fura-2 in vitro (Fig.7 A). At shorter excitation wavelengths, the previously described increase in fluorescence was reproduced but we were unable to discriminate between the effects of La3+ and those of contaminating Ca2+ (Fig.7 B). Therefore, we used an excitation wavelength of 360 nm (the isosbestic wavelength for Ca2+ in the absence of La3+) to examine the effects of La3+ on cells loaded with fura-2 after incubation with fura-2/AM. Addition of La3+ to the bath evoked a rapid decrease in the fluorescence of the cells. This effect was reversible after wash of the cells (Fig. 7 C). Thus, CHO cells are able to take up and to extrude La3+ at rates compatible with the observed block of TRP3 currents in whole-cell experiments. We did not detect any sizeable decrease of fura-2 fluorescence after addition of Gd3+ in vitro; therefore, a similar demonstration of Gd3+ uptake into CHO cells was not possible. The important findings of this study are that the cations Gd3+ and La3+ inhibit TRP3 currents when applied from the extracellular as well as from the intracellular side of the cell membrane. Concentrations of either ion that evoked half-maximal inhibitions from outside were consistently found to inhibit TRP3 channels completely when added to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches. Intracellular block by lanthanides may be of particular relevance in CHO cells because entry of La3+ was directly demonstrated. Therefore, the experimentally determined potency of extracellular Gd3+ and La3+ on TRP3 channels will be strongly influenced by the rate with which extracellular and intracellular concentrations reach an equilibrium. This may be of general importance in attempts to characterize TRP3 and possibly other TRP channels after heterologous expression. Discrepancies of results between various expression systems may simply reflect differences in the uptake and extrusion rate of Gd3+ and La3+, rather than differences in the expressed gene products. When comparing the extracellular effects of Gd3+ with that of La3+, Gd3+-induced current inhibitions were much slower in onset. Gd3+ block was slow even in comparison with SKF96365, which otherwise proved to be an unsuitable pharmacological tool because of its high EC50, which precluded preparation of solutions that would evoke a complete inhibition of TRP3. In contrast to the results with extracellular Gd3+, Gd3+ applied to the cytosolic side of inside-out patches evoked its effects without any delay other than that attributable to the time required for the bath exchange. The block by Gd3+ was irreversible over the observation times of this study. This may indicate a long lasting binding of Gd3+ to the TRP3 protein at low concentrations. Our results suggest that, whenever entry of Gd3+ and La3+ into cells occurs, it will certainly enhance blocking effects on TRP3. It may be asked whether inhibition of TRP3 currents by lanthanides is completely due to intracellular rather than extracellular action. However, it cannot be deduced from our experiments whether entry is essentially required and to what extent block from the outside takes place. An experimental protocol to exclude extracellular effects would require outside-out patches. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect TRP3 channel activity in those patches. The reason for that failure may be the noise level, which was considerably higher than in inside-out patches. Under these circumstances, analysis of channel openings of TRP3 is impossible since the mean open time is extremely short. Even if experiments with outside-out patches were successful, they might not definitely rule out a strictly intracellular action of Gd3+, because transmembrane pathways for Gd3+ may be present in isolated patches as well as in whole cell preparations. Taken together, the evidence cannot exclude extracellular effects of Gd3+, but if they are present, they are certainly weaker than the intracellular ones. In the case of La3+, the differences of equipotent extracellular and intracellular concentrations were more pronounced than in experiments with Gd3+. Thus, even a relatively small rate of La3+ uptake may account for La3+block. At the same time, reversibility of the extracellular effects would be achieved by a modest extrusion rate. Interestingly, lanthanides are likely to be chelated by Ca2+ chelators such as EGTA and fura-2 (22Evans C.H. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. 1st Ed. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar), despite the fact that they differ from Ca2+ in their valency. In experiments where La3+ inhibited Ca2+ entry at extracellular concentrations of 0.5 μm, addition of EGTA (10 μm) to the bath completely abolished this effect (26Aussel C. Marhaba R. Pelassy C. Breittmayer J.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 313(Pt 3): 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A reported (27Caldwell R.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C619-C621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) dissociation constant for the Gd-EGTA complex (log K = −17.5) would mean that practically all Gd3+ was bound to EGTA in our experiments with inside-out patches when the EGTA concentration in the cytosolic bath was 10 mm. EGTA was also used in the pipette solution of whole-cell current measurements and should therefore be present in the cytosol. Considerable chelation would moreover be expected by cytosolic fura-2. Therefore, the blocking species in our experiments might be lanthanide complexes rather then lanthanide ions. A similar mechanism has been proposed by Caldwell et al. (27Caldwell R.A. Clemo H.F. Baumgarten C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C619-C621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for effects of Gd3+ in the presence of phosphate and bicarbonate (28Hansen D.E. Borganelli M. Stacy Jr., G.P.

Le Guennec J.Y. White E. Exp. Physiol. 1997; 82: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). (Phosphate and bicarbonate anions are known to form complexes with lanthanide ions (Ref. 32Martell A.E. Smith R.E. Critical Stability Constants: Inorganic Complexes. 1st Ed. Plenum Press, New York1976Google Scholar).) Effects of La3+ and of Gd3+ are frequently considered to be strictly confined to the extracellular space because cell membranes are believed to be impermeable for these ions (22Evans C.H. Biochemistry of the Lanthanides. 1st Ed. Plenum Press, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). However, there are exceptions reported for red blood cells (33Cheng Y. Huo Q. Lu J. Li R. Wang K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 447-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as myocardial cells (34Peeters G.A. Kohmoto O. Barry W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C351-C357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, the fluorescence of intracellular fura-2 in CHO cells was decreased after addition of La3+ to the bath, as was the fluorescence of fura-2in vitro by La3+. As excitation wavelength in the experiments with cells, we chose the isosbestic wavelength of fura-2 for Ca2+ in the absence of La3+. Therefore, any decrease in the intracellular Ca2+concentration that a block of Ca2+ influx might induce would minimally affect the fluorescence of fura-2. Furthermore, the experiments were performed in nominally Ca-free bath (estimated Ca2+ concentration 50 μm) in which block of Ca2+ channels is expected to have no instant effects on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Therefore, the experiments demonstrate that La3+ rapidly enters CHO cells and is also quickly extruded from the cytosol after wash. Since these findings were obtained in wild-type CHO cells, transmembrane movements of La3+ are not dependent on expression of TRP3. The changes of fluorescence occurred as rapidly as block of TRP3 currents by La3+. Whereas these experiments provide information about the time over which cytosolic concentrations of La3+change, they do not allow a quantification of these concentrations. The cytosolic concentration of fura-2 would be important for the calculation of La3+ concentrations but is not known under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, it is safe to conclude that La3+ enters CHO cells in concentrations relevant for block of TRP3 channels. One of the disturbing points of the literature on members of the TRP family is the apparent inconsistency of results reported by different research groups. For studies that performed an overexpression of TRP proteins, this raises the question whether cation channels formed by the overexpressed gene products are identical. However, when channels are characterized by means of block with lanthanides, our present study emphasizes that conflicting results may be explained not by differences in the channel structure but by different transmembrane transport rates of lanthanides. We propose that any quantification of block by lanthanides should include a discrimination of extracellular and intracellular effects. We thank Ilinca Ionescu for technical assistance."

Such proteins include the activator of G-protein signaling AGS3, the AGS3-related protein PINS inDrosophila melanogaster, two members of the RGS family of proteins, and three proteins (LGN, Pcp2, and Rap1GAP) isolated in yeast two-hybrid screens using Giα or Goα as bait. Rat AGS3 was isolated in a yeast-based functional screen designed to identify receptor-independent activators of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M.

The AGS3-related protein PINS is required for asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts in D. melanogaster, where it is found complexed with Gi/Go (3Yu F.W. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X.H. Chia W.

Some insight as to how PINS may regulate Gi/Go is provided by studies with AGS3 (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

The action of AGS3 as a G-protein activator in the yeast-based system was independent of nucleotide exchange as it was not antagonized by overexpression of RGS4, and it was still observed following replacement of Giα2 with Giα2-G204A, a mutant that is deficient in making the transition to the GTP-bound state (1Takesono A.

Both of these manipulations effectively prevent receptor-mediated activation of G-protein signaling in the yeast system and block the action of AGS1, which was isolated in the same screen and apparently behaves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for heterotrimeric G-proteins (5Cismowski M.

These data indicate that the interaction of AGS3 with G-protein influences a unique control mechanism within the activation/deactivation cycle of heterotrimeric G-proteins.

AGS3-GPR effectively competed with Gβγ subunits for binding to Gtα and inhibited guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) binding to Giα1.2 Such an activity likely has significance in a number of aspects of G-protein-mediated signaling events and presents a novel opportunity to control the basal activity of G-protein signaling, as well as influence receptor-mediated activation of G-protein. These observations also raise many interesting questions relative to basic aspects of G-protein structure/function and alternative modes of regulation and functional roles for G-protein signaling systems in the cell. To address these issues, we generated a series of peptides based upon the consensus GPR motif in AGS3 and evaluated their effects on the nucleotide binding properties of Giα. A 28-amino acid GPR peptide effectively blocked the interaction of AGS3 with Giα and inhibited GTPγS binding to Giα by a mechanism that involved stabilization of the GDP-bound conformation of Giα. The GPR consensus peptide also blocked receptor coupling to Giαβγ indicating that although the AGS3-GPR peptide stabilized the GDP-bound conformation of Giα, this conformation of GiαGDP was not recognized by a G-protein-coupled receptor. 35S-GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol),3H-GDP (29.6 Ci/mmol), and 3H-5-hydroxy tryptamine (HT) (21.8 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

The GPR domain of AGS3 (Pro463-Ser650) containing the four GPR motifs was generated as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein by polymerase chain reaction using the full-length cDNA of AGS3 as a template. The AGS3-Pro463-Ser650segment was also cloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to generate an amino-terminal His-tagged protein. His-tagged AGS3 was expressed in and purified from bacteria using a nickel affinity matrix (ProBond™ resin; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The His-tagged AGS3 was eluted from the matrix with imidazole and desalted by centrifugation as with the GST fusion protein (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S.

The interaction of GST-AGS3-GPR and HIS-tagged AGS3-GPR with G-proteins was assessed by protein interaction experiments using purified G-protein as described previously (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All purified G-proteins used in these studies were isolated in the GDP-bound form, and G-protein interaction assays contained 10 μm GDP. A separate series of protein interaction experiments were designed to determine whether the Giα complexed with AGS3 contained bound GDP. Giα1 (100 nm) was loaded with 3H-GDP (0.5 μm; 2.0 × 104 dpm/pmol) by incubation for 20 min at 24 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm adenosine triphosphate, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The 3H-GDP-loaded Giα1 was incubated with 300 nm GST or GST-AGS3-GPR in the presence and absence of 10 μm GPR peptide and processed as described (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M.

The washed resin containing bound proteins was transferred to vials for measurement of 3H-GDP by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. GTPγS binding assays were generally conducted as described (9Ross M. Higashijima T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). G-proteins (100 nm) were preincubated for 20 min at 24 °C in the presence and absence of GPR peptides. Binding assays (duplicate determinations) were initiated by addition of 0.5 μm GTPγS (4.0 × 104 dpm/pmol), and incubations (total volume = 50 μl) were continued for 30 min at 24 °C. Both preincubations and GTPγS binding assays were conducted in binding buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through nitrocellulose filters with 4 × 4-ml washes of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C). Radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was defined by 100 μm GTPγS. Giα1 (100 nm) was loaded with 3H-GDP (0.5 μm; 2 × 104 dpm/pmol) by incubation for 20 min at 24 °C in binding buffer without MgCl2. 45-μl aliquots of the preincubation mixture (∼500,000 dpm) were then added to incubation tubes containing 5 μl of vehicle or peptide, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 24 °C. Two sets of tubes were set up for each time point to be analyzed. Each set contained duplicate samples for determination of total binding, nonspecific binding, or binding in the presence of peptide. For each time point, one set of tubes served as an internal time control, whereas the other set received added GTPγS or GDP to initiate dissociation. Data are expressed as % of control, where control represents the level of 3H-GDP binding at each time point in the set of tubes that did not receive added nucleotide to initiate dissociation. The amount of3H-GDP bound following the 20-min preincubation (∼30,000 dpm) was identical to that observed at the 30-min incubation time point following addition of vehicle or peptide. 3H-GDP dissociation was initiated by addition of GTPγS or GDP in a volume of 5 μl (final concentration, 100 μm). Reactions were terminated at specified time points by rapid filtration through nitrocellulose filters (BA85; Schleicher & Shuell) with 4 × 4-ml washes of stop buffer. Radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was defined by 100 μm GDP. Sf9 cell membranes expressing 5-HT1A receptors were reconstituted with Gαβγ, and high affinity agonist binding was measured with3H-5-HT as described previously (8Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M.

Membrane aliquots (100 μg of membrane protein, 85 nm receptor) were preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C with G-proteins (2125 nm Gαβγ) with or without GPR peptides in a total volume of 17 μl (reconstitution buffer, 5 mm NaHEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 500 nm GDP, 0.04% CHAPS, pH 7.5). The reconstitution mixtures were then diluted 10-fold with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and 50 μl were added to binding tubes (total volume = 150 μl) containing 2 nm3H-5-HT. The final concentrations of receptor, G-protein, and peptide in the binding tubes were 2.8 nm, 70.8 nm, and 114 μm, respectively. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm 5-HT. Binding reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 1.5 h and terminated by filtration over Whatman GF/C FP200 filters using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were rinsed thrice with 4 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.5, at 4 °C), placed in 4.5 ml of CytoScint, and counted to constant error in a scintillation counter. The ∼20-amino acid GPR motif is repeated four times in AGS3-related proteins, with the exception of the three repeats found in the Drosophila protein PINS (Fig.1). Alignment of the four GPR repeats from five species revealed a GPR consensus sequence (Fig. 1). The GPR consensus sequence is characterized by the upstream negative charge (Glu-Glu) and hydrophobic cluster (Phe-Phe), Leu/Met10, Leu/Ile11, Gln15, Ser/Ala16, Arg18, Met/Leu19, and the Asp-Asp-Gln-Arg sequence at the carboxyl end of the motif. Helical wheel and Chou-Fasman analysis indicated that this region is capable of existing as an amphipathic helix. Each of the GPR motifs illustrated in Fig. 1 possess a varying number of Proline residues just after and in some cases before the core consensus sequence, which may exert an important influence within the overall organization of the four GPR motifs. As part of an effort to define the structural basis of the interaction of AGS3 with Giα and the functional consequences of this interaction, we asked whether a consensus sequence peptide effectively interacted with Giα. The core GPR consensus sequence was bracketed by additional residues (three amino terminus, five carboxyl terminus) derived from AGS3-GPR-IV, and the carboxyl terminus was amidated (Fig. 1). The 28-amino acid GPR consensus peptide completely blocked the binding of Giα1 or Giα2 to GST-AGS3-GPR with an IC50 of ∼200 nm (Fig. 2 A andB). The GPR consensus peptide also inhibited GTPγS binding to Giα1 and Giα2 (IC50 ∼200 nm) (Fig. 2,C and D) consistent with the preferential binding of AGS3 to Giα in the presence of GDP (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of the GPR consensus peptide on GTPγS binding was selective for Giα as it only minimally affected nucleotide binding to Goα or brain G-protein (Fig. 2 D). The activity of the GPR consensus peptide in both the protein interaction assays and GTPγS binding assays was lost upon substitution of Phe for the highly conserved Arg23 (Fig. 2, B, C, andD). However, substitution of Ala for the invariant Gln15 did not alter the activity of the GPR peptide (Fig.2 B). 4Y. K. Peterson and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. Similar results were obtained when these amino acid substitutions were made in the context of GST-AGS3 fusion protein, which contained the terminal 74 amino acids of AGS3 including part of GPR-III and all of GPR-IV (Fig. 1) (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).2 We then addressed the mechanism by which the GPR consensus peptide inhibited GTPγS binding to Giα2 and determined the effect of the GPR motif on receptor coupling to G-protein. The inhibition of GTPγS binding to Giα by the GPR consensus peptide may reflect a reduction in the rate of nucleotide exchange. Indeed, the rate of GDP dissociation was markedly diminished in the presence of the GPR consensus peptide (Fig.3 A). 5M. Natochin, B. Lester, Y. K. Peterson, M. L. Bernard, S. M. Lanier, and N. O. Artemyev, submitted for publication. The R23F mutation, which eliminated the effectiveness of the peptide to block interaction of AGS3 with Giα and GTPγS binding to Giα, also did not alter GDP dissociation (Fig. 3 A). The inhibition of GDP dissociation by the GPR consensus peptide suggests that the GPR motif is stabilizing the GDP-bound conformation of Giα. To address this issue we evaluated the interaction of GST-AGS3-GPR with Giα2, which had been preloaded with 3H-GDP. Subsequent analysis of the G-protein complexed with AGS3-GPR on the glutathione affinity matrix indicated that the nucleotide binding site of G-protein bound to AGS3 indeed contained GDP (Fig. 3 B). GiαGDP binding to AGS3-GPR was blocked by the GPR consensus peptide (Fig.3 B) consistent with the ability of this peptide to inhibit interaction of GST-AGS3-GPR with Giα1/2 (Fig. 2, A andB). The stabilization of the GDP-bound conformation of Giα by the GPR consensus peptide indicates that the AGS3-GPR motif can influence subunit interactions by interfering with Gβγ binding to Giα.2 This apparent effect may account for the results obtained in protein interaction assays using GST-AGS3-GPR and brain lysates, where Gβγ is absent from the AGS3-Giα complex (1Takesono A.

The influence of the GPR motif on subunit interactions would have significant implications for signal processing. First, interaction of the AGS3-GPR motif with Gαβγ would release Gβγ for regulation of downstream signaling events, while stabilizing GαGDP(1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P.

Such a mode of signal input may be of utility where there is a need for selective regulation of Gβγ-sensitive effectors. The time frame for termination of such a signaling event (i.e.reassociation of Gβγ with GiαGDP) likely differs from that of a more typical signaling event in which there has been an exchange of nucleotide bound to Giα, and signal termination involves GTP hydrolysis along with subunit reassociation. A second implication of stabilization of GαGDP by a GPR domain is related to receptor G-protein coupling. We addressed this issue experimentally using a membrane assay system where receptor-G-protein coupling is reflected as high affinity binding of agonists. The high affinity binding of agonist observed upon reconstitution of the membrane-bound 5-HT1 receptor with Giαβγ was inhibited by addition of the GPR peptide (Fig. 4). This action of the GPR peptide was not observed with the R23F peptide and was selective for Gi versus Go (Fig. 4). The influence of the single amino acid substitution on the bioactivity of the GPR both within the context of a short peptide and a GST fusion protein containing an additional 74 amino acids of AGS3 sequence strongly suggest a relatively discrete and specific surface interaction with Giα (Fig. 2) (1Takesono A.

Graber, unpublished observations. Helical wheel projections and 3D models indicated that when the GPR consensus peptide is fixed in an α helical conformation, the Phe8, Ala12, Gln15, Met19, and Arg23 residues are on the same face of the helix. On this face of the helix is a hydrophobic sector defined by Phe8, Ala12, and Met19 that is bound by polar residues, which may be involved in charge pairing to residues in Giα. As was the case for the R23F substitution, disruption of this hydrophobic sector by substitution of Arg for Phe8 also resulted in a loss of activity for the GST-AGS3-GPR fusion protein in GTPγS binding and protein interaction assays (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).2 Thus, either extension (R23F substitution) or shortening (F8R) of the hydrophobic sector on this face of the helix resulted in a loss of bioactivity for the GPR motif. In contrast, strengthening of this hydrophobic sector by substitution of Ala for Gln15 did not alter the activity of the GPR peptide. These data indicate an important role for a spatially constrained hydrophobic stretch of ∼16.6 Å that is key for peptide interaction with Giα. The inability of receptor to productively couple to GαGDP-GPR is of interest. The GαGDPconformation stabilized by the GPR peptide may differ from that stabilized by Gβγ in such a manner that the receptor cannot recognize Gα. Indeed, the orientations of the amino and carboxyl domains of Giα1, which are important interaction sites with receptor, are quite different in the GiαGDP and GiαGDPβγ structures (11Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguezlluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G.

In addition to such differences in the structural orientation of Giα domains interacting with receptor, it is likely that receptor contact points on Gβγ also play a role in receptor-mediated activation of guanine nucleotide exchange (14Wu G.

Alternatively, the receptor may indeed interact with the GαGDP-GPR complex, but this interaction stabilizes a receptor conformation with low affinity for agonist (19Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Physiol. Res. 1997; 46: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimately, one may think of the GαGDP-GPR complex as a type of dimeric G-protein, and it is not clear what might provide signal input to such a complex. Although the GPR motif is present in several proteins that interact with Gα and/or regulate nucleotide binding/hydrolysis (1Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).2,5 Pcp2, which contains two GPR motifs based upon this consensus sequence, actually appears to increase the dissociation of GDP from Goα (21Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, there are either subtle differences in this motif or other residues outside of this motif that play a key role in the specific functional output gendered by interaction of the GPR motif with Gα. Of note is the selective effects of the AGS3-GPR peptide for Giα versusGoα in both nucleotide binding assays and the analysis of receptor coupling to G-proteins. Further dissection of the structural basis for this selectivity will provide clues as to the site of interaction of the GPR peptide with Giα and the mechanism by which it stabilizes the GDP-bound conformation. One prominent area of sequence divergence between Goα and Giα encompasses switch IV, a region implicated in the formation of Gi1αGDP multimers (11Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The role of AGS3 as a GDI is an unexpected concept for heterotrimeric G-proteins, although such proteins serve similar regulator roles for Ras-related G-proteins. Proteins containing the AGS3-GPR motif may promote dissociation of Gα and Gβγ in the absence of nucleotide exchange and present an opportunity for selective control of Giα- and Gβγ−regulated effector systems. GPR-containing proteins likely play a role in regulating basal activity of G-protein signaling systems in the cell and provide alternative modes of signal input to G-protein signaling systems that may either augment, complement, or antagonize G-protein activation by GPCRs.

When compared with wild-type controls, SR Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ release in myocytes of SERCA2 heterozygous mice were decreased by ∼40–60% and ∼30–40%, respectively, and the rate of myocyte shortening and relengthening were each decreased by ∼40%.

To examine the effects of decreased SERCA2 activity on cardiac function, we have recently developed a transgenic mouse model with a null allele of the SERCA2 gene (5Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although complete loss of SERCA function in homozygous animals is embryonic lethal, disruption of one copy of the SERCA2 gene results in decreased cardiac SERCA2 mRNA (∼45%), protein (∼35%), and SR Ca2+ uptake (∼35%) (5Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Because SERCA2 activity controls both the rate of calcium removal and the amount of calcium stores available within the SR, we hypothesize that the level of SERCA2 activity is a critical determinant of cardiac contractility. Therefore, one goal of this study is to determine if reduced SERCA2 levels compromise cardiac contractility by directly altering calcium handling and contractile functions of individual myocytes during excitation-contraction coupling. During excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ entry through the l-type Ca2+ channel activates Ca2+ release from SR Ca2+ stores, via the ryanodine receptor (RyR). This rise in cytosolic Ca2+initiates muscle contraction. In the relaxation phases most of the released Ca2+ is subsequently resequestered into the SR by SERCA, the activity of which is closely regulated by its interaction with PLB. In addition, the released Ca2+ is also extruded via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (6Barry W. Bridge J.H. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesize that chronic loss of SERCA2 in SERCA2 heterozygous hearts may be partially compensated by altered expression of other proteins involved in calcium homeostasis during muscle contraction and relaxation. To test this hypothesis, we have examined expression of several proteins known to be important in the control of calcium transients in the heart. Alternatively, decreased contractility in heterozygous hearts may be associated with changes in the expression of contractile proteins, such as switching between α- and β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms, which occurs during cardiac hypertrophy (7Vikstrom K.L. Bohlmeyer T. Factor S.M. Leinwand L.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms in SERCA2-deficient hearts. We have previously demonstrated that a decreased SERCA2 level in heterozygous hearts results in impaired cardiac function in vivo (5Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J.

In this study, we show that, despite multiple changes in expression and function of other calcium-handling proteins (such as PLB, triadin, and NCX), peak calcium transients and SR calcium stores of SERCA2-deficient myocytes are significantly diminished and contractile function is impaired. These data suggest that changes in other calcium-handling proteins are functionally insufficient to completely compensate for the loss of the calcium pump protein and that the level of SERCA protein is an important critical regulator of cardiac function. As described previously, gene targeting was used to delete part of the promoter, the transcript initiation site, and the first two coding exons of the SERCA2 gene (5Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H.

The homogenate proteins were separated on 6–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (for RyR and α- and β-MHC). Membranes were probed with these primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-PLB antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-RyR antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-triadin (isoform 3) antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-NCX antibody (all from Affinity Bioreagents Inc.), polyclonal rabbit anti-calsequestrin antibody (Swant, Switzerland), mouse monoclonal anti-sarcomeric actin antibody (Sigma), polyclonal rabbit antibody specific to SERCA2a (gift of Dr. Frank Wuytack) (14Eggermont J.A.

After separation on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the homogenate protein was transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were incubated with PLB-phosphoserine 16 (1:10,000 dilution) and PLB-phosphothreonine 17 (1:5000 dilution) antibodies. ECL and quantitation of the signals were carried out as described above. Both the high molecular weight form of PLB (PLBH) and the low molecular weight form of PLB (PLBL) were quantified, and the ratio of PLBH to PLBL was measured. To measure the relative ratio of PLB to SERCA protein, the signals of PLBH and SERCA2a from the same membrane were quantitated.

Intracellular calcium transients were measured as described previously (2Loukianov E. Ji Y. Grupp I.L. Kirkpatrick D.L. Baker D.L. Loukianova T. Grupp G. Lytton J. Walsh R.A. Periasamy M. Circ.

After loading, cells were washed and resuspended in Ca2+ free Tyrode's buffer. Cytosolic free calcium was measured by ratio imaging of 340- to 380-nm excitation fluorescence of Fura-2 AM (emission wavelength, 510 nm), using a photoscan dual spectrophotometer (Photon Tech, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an Olympus IMT-2 UV fluorescence microscope with UV-transparent optics. Cells were selected for use if they were quiescent when unstimulated, and contracted robustly upon field stimulation. Cells were perfused with Sanguinetti solution (in mm: NaCl 112, KCl 5, CaCl2 0.5, MgSO4 1.2, NaH2PO 2, NaHCO3 28, glucose 10), bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2, and field-stimulated at 0.25 Hz (Grass SD9 stimulator) until twitch characteristics were repeatable, indicating stable Ca2+ loading of the SR. Following field stimulation protocols, cells were exposed to ionomycin, EGTA, and Mn2+ to determine background fluorescence and dye compartmentalization. The intracellular Ca2+ kinetics were analyzed using Origin 4.1 (Microcal Software). The mechanical properties of myocytes were measured as described previously (2Loukianov E. Ji Y. Grupp I.L.

Briefly, cells were placed in a well on the stage of an inverted microscope and perfused continuously with oxygenated physiological buffer. Myocytes were field-stimulated at 0.25 Hz, or at 0.5 Hz for at least 40 s per pacing rate. Cell images were videotaped, and myocyte length, percentage of shortening, and peak rates of shortening (+dL/dt) and relengthening (−dL/dt) were quantitated by comparison with a calibrated micrometer on the microscope stage. At least five cells were examined per mouse, and the values were averaged for mechanical parameters and Ca2+ kinetics. Statistical analysis was based on the number of animals rather than the number of cells. A solenoid perfusion system (W. Barry Co., Boulder, CO) was used to rapidly apply 10 mm caffeine to induce release of SR Ca2+ and assess the SR Ca2+ load (21Yao A. Su Z. Monaka A. Zubair I. Lu L. Philipson K.D. Bridge J.H.B.

Cells were perfused with Sanguinetti solution and field-stimulated at 0.25 Hz until twitch characteristics stabilized before each caffeine application. Caffeine was then applied for 10 s. The amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient was used as an index of SR Ca2+ content (23Smith G.L. Valdeo-lmillos M. Eisner D.A. Allen D.G. J. Gen.

Na+-Ca2+ exchanger currents were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques as described previously (25Beuckelmann D. Wier W. J. Physiol.

External solution contained (in mm): NaCl 135, CaCl2 2, CsCl 10, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10, pH 7.3, and pipette solution contained (in mm): CsCl 135, MgCl2 2, NaCl 15, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA; Molecular probes) 0.05, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2). Ryanodine (0.01 mm) and nifedipine (0.01 mm) were included in the external solution to block SR Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry through the L-type Ca2+ channel. The Ni2+-sensitive current was obtained by subtracting current records obtained during exposure to 5 mmNi2+ from the control record, which was measured in the absence of Ni2+. Recordings were done using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), interfaced to a personal computer. Data were stored in the computer for analysis using custom-written software. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and statistically evaluated by the ANOVA test followed by the Student t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be the threshold for statistical significant. We have recently shown that disruption of one copy of the SERCA2 gene results in decreased SERCA2 mRNA (∼45%), protein (∼35%), and SR Ca2+ uptake (∼35%) and that these changes are associated in vivo with impaired cardiac performance (5Periasamy M.

To determine whether this decrease in SERCA pump level affects myocyte Ca2+ homeostasis on a beat-to-beat basis, cytosolic Ca2+ transients were measured. Left ventricular myocytes isolated from wild-type and heterozygous hearts were loaded with Fura-2 AM, and the Ca2+ signals during electrical pacing at 0.25 Hz were measured. The baseline cytosolic calcium level was not significantly different between wild-type and heterozygous cells. But the peak amplitudes of calcium transients were decreased by ∼30–40% in heterozygous myocytes (Fig.1 A, TableI), indicating that the absolute amount of Ca2+ available for myofibrillar contractility was decreased. However, the rate of Ca2+ decline as fitted by exponential decay (τ) in heterozygous myocytes was not different from that of wild-type myocytes (Fig. 1 A, Table I), suggesting no significant difference in the rate of Ca2+ removal from the cytosol.Table ICalcium transient and contractile parameters of isolated myocytes from wild-type and SERCA2 heterozygous heartsParameterWild-typeHeterozygousCalcium transients Calcium amplitude (340 nm/380 nm, units)1.21 ± 0.100.86 ± 0.08 a τ of Ca2+decay (s)0.36 ± 0.050.37 ± 0.02SR Ca2+load CAC 1-cCAC, calcium amplitude in the presence of 10 mm caffeine.

Data were obtained from four to seven wild-type or heterozygous mice, at least five myocytes were measured from each mouse. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significant is shown asa p < 0.05, andb p < 0.01. Because SERCA2 heterozygous myocytes showed a significant decrease in Ca2+ amplitude upon twitch stimulation, we next determined whether the decrease in Ca2+ amplitude was due to a decrease in SR Ca2+stores or due to a decrease in Ca2+ efflux from the SR. Fura-2 AM-loaded myocytes were exposed to caffeine, and peak Ca2+ transients were measured. We found that amplitudes of the Ca2+ transients in the presence of caffeine were decreased ∼40–60% in heterozygous myocytes relative to the transients observed in wild-type cells (Table I). Because caffeine binding opens the RyR, causing Ca2+ release from the SR, the amplitude of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient can be used as an index of SR Ca2+ content (23Smith G.L. Valdeo-lmillos M. Eisner D.A. Allen D.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 92: 351-368Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Bassani J.W.M. Bassani R.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 476: 279-293Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Our data show that reduced SERCA activity leads to significantly decreased RyR-releasable SR Ca2+ stores in heterozygous myocytes. To determine whether the observed changes in SR Ca2+ transport affect cardiac contractility, mechanical properties of isolated cardiomyocytes were examined. There was no significant difference in the resting cell length between wild-type and heterozygous myocytes. However, there was ∼30% decrease in the percentage of cell shortening in heterozygous myocytes (Fig. 1 B, Table I). In addition, the rate of cell shortening (+dL/dt), as well as the rate of cell relengthening (−dL/dt) was significantly decreased (∼ 40%) in heterozygous myocytes (Fig. 1 B, Table I). These data demonstrate that a reduction in SERCA2 results in decreased cytosolic Ca2+ transients and SR Ca2+ load and that these alterations can directly affect contractile function of the individual myocyte. Alterations in the expression levels of myosin heavy chain isoforms α- and β-MHC can be an important determinant of the dynamic function of the myocardium and are correlated with the maximum velocity of muscle shortening (28Schwartz K.

J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be argued that the impaired myocyte contraction and relaxation in heterozygous hearts is also due to a switch in myosin heavy chain isoform expression. In addition, induction of β-MHC has been reported to be a marker of cardiac hypertrophy (7Vikstrom K.L. Bohlmeyer T. Factor S.M. Leinwand L.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a condition that is also associated with decreased levels of SERCA pump expression (30Arai M. Matsui H. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the expression levels of α-MHC and β-MHC in SERCA2 heterozygous hearts. Our results showed that the expression levels of both isoforms were unchanged (α-MHC, 107 ± 2%; β-MHC, 107 ± 1% in heterozygous hearts"
https://openalex.org/W2035743526,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades are involved in transmitting signals that are generated at the cell surface into the cytosol and nucleus and consist of three sequentially acting enzymes: a MAP kinase, an upstream MAP/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), and a MEK kinase (MEKK). Protein-protein interactions within these cascades provide a mechanism to control the localization and function of the proteins. MEKK1 is implicated in activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathways. We showed previously that MEKK1 binds directly to JNK/SAPK. In this study we demonstrate that endogenous MEKK1 binds to endogenous ERK2, MEK1, and another MEKK level kinase, Raf-1, suggesting that it can assemble all three proteins of the ERK2 MAP kinase module."

Nuclease digestion and sedimentation studies indicate that H5 binding and the resulting constraint of entering and exiting nucleosomal DNA occur to the same extent in both tailless and intact chromatin arrays.

Hansen J.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1996; 6: 149-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nucleosomal arrays make up the structural core of chromatin filaments and higher order chromosomal fibers, which also contain numerous structural and functional proteins bound to the array, e.g. linker histones, transcription factors, and histone acetyltransferases (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure & Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Under physiological salt conditions in vitro, nucleosomal arrays are in equilibrium between decondensed and highly condensed conformational states (1Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1996; 6: 149-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The condensation process involves a complex series of hierarchical folding and oligomerization transitions (4Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 230: 136-139Google Scholar), indicating that the tail domains are absolutely required for nucleosomal array condensation. However, the folded states of nucleosomal arrays are not intrinsically stable (4Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E.

Thus, although the core histone N termini mediate the concerted series of steps that result in nucleosomal array condensation, the tail domains alone are not sufficient to stabilize the highly condensed structures whose formation they specify. Much less is known about the functions of the core histone N termini when other proteins are present to form chromatin arrays. In some cases, the tail domains directly interact with chromatin-associated proteins to regulate biological function, while other chromatin-associated proteins do not require the tail domains to bind to nucleosomal arrays (Refs. 12Hecht A.

In particular, it is unclear whether the multiple essential functions mediated by the core histone N termini during condensation of nucleosomal arrays are altered when linker histones are bound to the array (23Ramakrishnan V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1998; 7: 215-230Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To better understand the relationships between linker histones and the core histone tail domains during salt-dependent condensation, histone H5 has been assembled into defined nucleosomal array model systems (28Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 29Carruthers L.M. Tse C. Walker III, K.P. Hansen J.C.

Crane-Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The resulting “intact” and “tailless” chromatin arrays were characterized by a combination of hydrodynamic and electrophoretic techniques under salt conditions where the structure of intact chromatin arrays ranged from unfolded to highly condensed. Results indicate that binding of histone H5 to tailless nucleosomal arrays constrains the entering and exiting nucleosomal DNA in the same way as intact chromatin arrays. Nevertheless, tailless chromatin arrays are unable to form higher order folded structures or to oligomerize in MgCl2. These results have provided insight into the mechanism of chromatin condensation by demonstrating that the core histone N termini perform the same functions independent of linker histones being bound to the nucleosomal array. They also have revealed a potential molecular basis through which linker histones can simultaneously influence the biological activity of the chromatin fiber at both the higher order (i.e. global) and nucleosomal (i.e. local) levels.

Reconstitutes assembled from native and trypsinized core histone octamers are referred to as intact and tailless nucleosomal arrays, respectively. Intact nucleosomal arrays were separated from supersaturated histone-nucleic acid complexes (33Hansen J.C. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the differential solubility method described previously (11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Tailless nucleosomal arrays cannot be purified by this method since they do not oligomerize (Refs. 8Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 10Moore S.C. Ausio J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 230: 136-139Google Scholar; see Fig. 3). In these cases, sedimentation velocity in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mm Na2EDTA, 2.5 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, low salt buffer (TE buffer) was used to define the fraction of the tailless nucleosomal array population that sedimented at >24 S and hence was supersaturated with trypsinized core histones (8Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This fraction of the boundaries subsequently was excluded from sedimentation analysis of folding to allow direct comparison of the behavior of intact and tailless preparations (Ref. 8Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar; see next section and figure legends).Figure 3Tailless 208-12 chromatin arrays are unable to oligomerize in MgCl2.

Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The samples were then mixed, incubated on ice for 3 h, dialyzed against 1 liter of TE buffer for 4 h, and then overnight against 1 liter of fresh TE. Intact or tailless nucleosomal arrays that have become assembled with histone H5 by this protocol are referred to as intact or tailless chromatin arrays, respectively. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using either a Beckman XL-A or XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with scanner optics. The initial sample absorbance at 260 nm was between 0.6 and 0.8. Samples were equilibrated in the analytical ultracentrifuge chamber under vacuum for 1 h at 21 °C prior to sedimentation at 22 000 rpm. Boundaries were analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (34van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 35Carruthers L.M. Schirf V.R.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 62-72Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using the UltraScan data analysis program (version 2.99). Processed data were plotted as boundary fraction versus s 20,w to yield the integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients,G(s), of the saturated and subsaturated arrays present in the sample. Preparations of intact nucleosomal and chromatin array were free of supersaturated contaminants, and in these cases the program was set to analyze 100% of the boundaries. To remove contributions to the G(s) distribution resulting from supersaturated contaminants in the tailless preparations (which sedimented as the fastest 5–15% of the various samples and consequently skew data interpretation), the upper 5–15% of the boundaries formed by tailless nucleosomal and chromatin arrays were not analyzed (see above). Average sedimentation coefficients (s ave) were determined from the rate of sedimentation at the boundary midpoint, i.e. boundary fraction = 0.5 of the integral distribution plot. Electrophoretic mobilities (μ) of 208-12 nucleosomal and chromatin arrays were determined using 0.2–1.0% agarose multigels as described (36Hansen J.C. Kreider I.K. Demeler B. Fletcher T.M.

Briefly, 9–18-lane running gels encased in a 1.5% agarose frame were cast in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mmEDTA, pH 7.8, running buffer (E buffer). Samples were simultaneously electrophoresed in each running gel at 1 V/cm for 8 h, and visualized by UV illumination after ethidium bromide staining. The average gel pore radius (Pe), as well as the gel-free μ (μo) and effective radius (Re) of the nucleosomal and chromatin arrays were obtained from the experimentally measured electrophoretic mobility (μ) as described (36Hansen J.C. Kreider I.K. Demeler B. Fletcher T.M. Methods Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 62-72Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Fletcher T.M. Krishnan U. Serwer P. Hansen J.C.

When working with defined 5 S rDNA model systems, the degree to which the rDNA template is saturated with core histone octamers is a central issue (6Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Only 208-12 nucleosomal and chromatin arrays that are saturated with 12 histone octamers/DNA template can form the maximally folded ∼55 S state (6Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Furthermore, saturated arrays oligomerize at lower MgCl2 concentrations than subsaturated arrays (7Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, in order to study condensation of intact and tailless chromatin arrays, it first was necessary to obtain highly enriched preparations of saturated nucleosomal arrays (6Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The extent of template saturation after reconstitution was ascertained using a combination of sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge and electrophoresis in agarose multigels (11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 38Fletcher T.M. Serwer P. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10859-10863Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Samples initially were subjected to boundary sedimentation velocity analysis under low salt conditions (TE buffer). It is known from previous studies that saturated intact 208-12 nucleosomal arrays in TE buffer sediment at 29–30 S (4Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while saturated tailless nucleosomal arrays sediment at 23–24 S (8Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The lower sedimentation coefficient of the tailless arrays in TE buffer is due primarily to unwrapping of the peripheral nucleosomal DNA and the subsequent lengthening of the decondensed array in low salt (5Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tse C. Hansen J.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients,i.e. G(s) distributions, in TE of typical preparations of intact and tailless nucleosomal arrays used in the present studies are shown in Fig. 1. The intact reconstitutes sedimented between 27 and 30 S, with ∼60% of the sample ranging between 29 and 30 S. The tailless nucleosomal arrays ranged from 20 to 24 S, with 50% of the sample sedimenting between 23 and 24 S. Essentially identical results were obtained with the three different nucleosomal array samples used during these studies. To independently verify the results of the sedimentation experiments, quantitative agarose multigels (36Hansen J.C. Kreider I.K. Demeler B. Fletcher T.M. Methods Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 62-72Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Fletcher T.M. Krishnan U. Serwer P. Hansen J.C.

Biol. 1997; 119: 113-126Google Scholar) were used to measure the gel-free mobility (μo) and effective radius (Re) of the nucleosomal arrays. The μo and Re obtained from the multigel analysis reflect the average properties of all arrays present in the sample, and as such these parameters can be directly compared with the average sedimentation coefficient measured at boundary fraction = 0.5 of the G(s) distribution (38Fletcher T.M. Serwer P. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10859-10863Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42Tse C. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12169-12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, if ≥50% of a sample is saturated with stoichiometric amounts of core histone octamers and linker histones, the sedimentation and electrophoretic approaches together provide highly complimentary information about the solution properties of saturated nucleosomal and chromatin arrays. The μo and Re of the nucleosomal arrays used in these studies (TableI) in each case were very close to the values determined previously for intact (11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 37Fletcher T.M. Krishnan U. Serwer P. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2226-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and tailless (9Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) nucleosomal arrays saturated with 12 histone octamers/208-12 DNA. Cumulatively, the hydrodynamic and electrophoretic data (Fig. 1, TableI) indicate that saturated nucleosomal arrays comprise ∼50% of both the intact and tailless nucleosomal array preparations, while the remainder consists of slightly subsaturated arrays that contain 1–2 octamer-free rDNA repeats/array. Importantly, because of the ability to determine the G(s) distribution of the entire chromatin sample by sedimentation velocity, the presence of both saturated and slightly subsaturated nucleosomal arrays in the same sample allows simultaneous comparison of the differential folding behavior of these two array types in the same experiment (Ref. 11Carruthers L.M.

Open table in a new tab Histone H5 binding was achieved by incubating H5 molecules with intact or tailless nucleosomal arrays in 50 mm NaCl at a molar ratio of ∼1.3 H5/rDNA repeat, followed by dialysis into TE (11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Chromatin arrays are decondensed in TE buffer, which allows subsequent examination of linker histone organization and function at the nucleosomal level (11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). H5 binding to each type of array initially was examined using native agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A). Incubation of H5 with intact nucleosomal arrays resulted in a discrete slower migrating band (compare lanes 1 and2), as observed previously (11Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The less positively charged tailless nucleosomal arrays (lane 3) migrated faster than intact nucleosomal arrays (lane 1), also consistent with previous observations (5Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When H5 was mixed with tailless nucleosomal arrays, the mobility was reduced on the order of that seen after H5 binding to intact nucleosomal arrays (comparelanes 3 and 4 with lanes 1 and 2). These results demonstrate that H5 binds to both intact and tailless nucleosomal arrays, although they provide no information about the specificity of the interactions. Consequently, native and tailless chromatin arrays next were digested extensively with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to produce mononucleosome-sized particles. Kinetically stable protection of ∼165 bp of nucleosomal DNA from MNase digestion is a well established standard for proper linker histone binding to nucleosome core particles and chromatin arrays (43Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978;"

We have expressed and purified apoE3 and apoE4 from Escherichia coli and compared their hydrodynamic properties by gel permeation liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, circular dichroism, and sedimentation methods. Sedimentation velocity experiments, employing a new method for determining the size distribution of polydisperse macromolecules in solution (Schuck, P. (2000) Biophys.

In a lipid-free environment, apoE3 and apoE4 exist as a slow equilibrium mixture of monomer, tetramer, octamer, and a small proportion of higher oligomers. Both sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments indicate that apoE4 has a greater propensity to self-associate. We also demonstrate that apoE3 and apoE4 oligomers dissociate significantly in the presence of dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine micelles (20 mm) and to a lesser extent at submicellar concentrations (4 mm). The α-helical content for both isoforms was almost identical (50%) in the presence and absence of dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine.

ApoE comprises two domains, referred to as the amino-terminal (residues 20–165) and carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 225–299) (10Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

In comparison to apoE3, the apoE4 NH2-terminal structure has an additional salt bridge between arginine 112 and glutamate 109, causing a displacement of the arginine 61 side chain (13Dong L.-M.

Unlike the NH2-terminal domain, the structure of the COOH-terminal domain of apoE is unknown, although a proteolytic fragment comprising residues 223–272 has recently been crystallized (14Forstner M.

Studies employing a thrombolytic fragment of apoE3 (residues 216–299) or COOH-terminal truncated forms have shown that the COOH-terminal region of apoE mediates lipoprotein attachment and self-association (15Aggerbeck L.P.

Further work has demonstrated that an amphipathic peptide spanning residues 263–286 of apoE binds dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles with similar affinity to full-length apoE (17Sparrow J.T. Sparrow D.A. Fernando G. Culwell A.R. Kovar M. Gotto Jr., A.M.

Perugini M.A. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation, cross-linking, and gel permeation liquid chromatography studies demonstrate that human apoE of unspecified phenotype self-associates primarily to a tetramer in the absence of lipid (20Yokoyama S.

However, a significant difference in this latter study was the observation that apoE3, in a time-dependent manner, self-associated to a mixture of tetramer (Stokes radius = 6.6 nm) and a species with a Stokes radius of 8.5 nm or larger (15Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This larger species is suggested to be an octamer on the basis of sedimentation equilibrium analysis (15Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, fluorescence anisotropy measurements have revealed that the kinetics of apoE denaturation are heterogeneous, consistent with a monomer-tetramer-higher oligomer equilibria (21Dergunov A.D. Shuvaev V.V. Yanushevskaja E.V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1992; 373: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The higher oligomer was noted to be present primarily in aged preparations. Most other exchangeable apolipoproteins also self-associate in the absence of lipid (22Osborne Jr., J.C. Lee N.S. Powell G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the state of association of lipid-bound apolipoproteins. This is primarily because of experimental difficulties in studying the solution properties of apolipoproteins bound to large native lipoproteins, synthetic lipid bilayers, or lipid emulsions. A possible way of overcoming this experimentally is to use a short chain phospholipid, such as dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC), which forms micelles rather than bilayers in solution. DHPC has the chemical structure of a phospholipid and exists as monomers in equilibrium with micelles comprising approximately 40 molecules (CMC, 12.7–14.3 mm) (23Tausk R.J.M. Karmiggelt J. Oudshoorn C. Overbeek J.T.G. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 1: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,24Burns Jr., R.A. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3100-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have firstly compared the self-association of lipid-free apoE3 and apoE4 by native gel permeation chromatography, capillary electrophoresis and sedimentation studies. We have utilized sedimentation velocity experiments to resolve the heterogeneous subunit structures of apoE3 and apoE4, employing a new method for determining the continuous size distribution of polydisperse macromolecules in solution. We also report the effects of the short chain phospholipid, DHPC, on the state of association of apoE3 and apoE4 oligomers. pGEX-3X plasmids containing human cDNA for full-length apoE3 and apoE4 were kindly provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, University of California, San Francisco, CA). The apoE-containing vectors were transformed into the UT5600 strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen, MadisonW̧I). Luria broth (100 ml) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Amresco) was inoculated with a single colony and grown overnight at 37 °C. This culture was then used to inoculate 3 × 2 liters of the same media and grown to late-log phase (A 600 nm = 1.0), before induction with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Astral, Sydney, Australia) for 30 min at 37 °C. Maximal induction of protein expression occurred at 30 min, as determined by GST enzymatic activity using the GST Detection Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,860 ×g for 15 min (4 °C); resuspended in 20 ml of 15% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF, pH 7.4; and lysed by sonication using a 9.5-mm titanium probe (MSE Soniprep 150). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 26,900 × g to remove debris and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). ApoE-GST fusion proteins were batch purified by incubating dialyzed cell lysate with 10 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 1 h. Bound material was pelleted by low speed centrifugation (2,230 × g) at 4 °C for 5 min and washed thoroughly with 3 × 40 ml of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in Buffer A, followed by three washes with 40 ml of Buffer A. The apoE moiety was cleaved directly from bound GST by incubating with 100 μg of factor Xa (New England Biolabs) in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, for 16 h at room temperature. The supernatant, collected after centrifugation at 2,230 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm PMSF, pH 7.4, and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions containing apoE (as assessed by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated by loading onto a Source Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted at 1.0 ml/min using a 0–1.0m NaCl gradient. ApoE3 eluted at 0.53 m NaCl and apoE4 at 0.52 m NaCl. Purity of apoE3 and apoE4 (assessed by SDS-PAGE) was estimated to be >98%. The molar masses of purified apoE3 and apoE4 (34,245 and 34,297, respectively) determined by electrospray mass spectrometry agree well with theoretical values and known differences between the amino acid compositions of the isoforms. Typical yields of purified apoE3 and apoE4 were 0.5–1.0 mg/liter of culture. Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fast performance liquid chromatography was conducted at room temperature in 100 mmNaCl and 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was calibrated with individual aliquots (1.0 mg/ml) of blue dextran (mass = 2,000 kDa), thyroglobulin (mass = 669 kDa), ferritin (mass = 440 kDa), aldolase (mass = 158 kDa), ovalbumin (mass = 43 kDa), and cytochrome c (mass = 12.4 kDa) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Partition coefficients (K av) were calculated from the relationship: K av = (Ve −V 0)/(Vc −V 0), where V e = elution volume of sample, V 0 = void volume, andVc = total column volume. Experiments were conducted at 500 V/cm with normal polarity and 23 °C using a Beckman P/ACE system 5010, equipped with a Laser Module 488, UV absorbance detector, and Beckman P/ACE station software (version 1.0). Capillaries were of fused silica (Beckman) with inner diameter of 75 μm and total length of 50 cm. Liquid borate capillary performance run buffer, pH 8.35 (Beckman), was employed as electrolyte. The capillary was equilibrated at 20 p.s.i. in 1 n HCl for 5 min, deionized water for 2 min, 0.1 n NaOH capillary regenerator solution (Beckman) for 10 min, deionized water for 2 min, followed by a 5-min wash in run buffer. Samples (30 μl) were injected in the absence or presence of 1% (w/v) SDS for 5 s at 0.5 p.s.i. and electropherograms were monitored at 214 nm. A Beckman Optima model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric absorbance optical detection system was used for all sedimentation experiments. Samples (100 μl) and reference (120 μl) solutions were loaded into a conventional double-sector filled epon centerpiece (pathlength 1.2 cm) with quartz windows and mounted in a Beckman An-60 Ti rotor. Data was collected at 230 nm with five averages, at time intervals of 240 min and radial intervals of 0.001 cm, until sedimentation equilibrium was attained. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C with rotor velocities of 10,000 rpm and 16,000 rpm. For calculation of weight average molar masses, base-line offsets were obtained by high speed depletion at 50,000 rpm for at least 3 h. Solvent densities were measured at 20 °C in an Anton Paar model DMA 02 C precision density meter equipped with a water bath, or computed using the program SEDNTERP (25Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar), kindly supplied by David Hayes (Magdalen College, Warner, NH), Tom Laue (University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH), and John Philo (Alliance Protein Laboratories, Thousand Oaks, CA). Molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm (44,500m−1 cm−1) and partial specific volumes (v) of apoE3 and apoE4 (0.732 ml/g) were calculated from amino acid composition (25Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Global nonlinear least square best-fits were obtained by fitting sedimentation equilibrium absorbance data at two speeds or concentrations to a mixture of up to three species and a base-line offset using the program MATLAB. Estimates of the weight-average molar mass (M r) were obtained from the nonlinear least squares best-fits to a single species according to Equation 1. A(r)=A(r0)expω22RTMr(1−νρ)(r2−r02)+EEquation 1 A(r) is the absorbance at radiusr, A(r 0) is the absorbance at the reference radius r0 , ω is the rotor angular velocity, R the gas constant, T the temperature, M r the weight-average molar mass, ν the partial specific volume of the solute, ρ is the solvent density, and E the base-line offset. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Prior to centrifugation, samples at either 35 or 150 μg/ml were exhaustively dialyzed (>20 h) into 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Samples (300–400 μl) and reference (320–420 μl) solutions were loaded into a conventional double-sector quartz cell and mounted in a Beckman An-60 Ti rotor. Experiments were conducted at 20 °C and a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm. Data were collected in continuous mode, at a single wavelength, time interval of 300 s, and a step size of 0.003 cm without averaging. Multiple scans at different time points were fitted to a single species, a monomer-tetramer-octamer rapid self-association, or to a continuous size distribution (see below) using the program SEDFIT (which is available from the authors on request). The sedimentation velocity analysis with a model for rapid reversible monomer-tetramer-octamer self-association was performed by calculating finite element solutions of the Lamm equation according to methods described by Claverie (26Claverie J.-M. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 843-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), combined with local weight-average sedimentation coefficients and gradient-average diffusion coefficients (27Cox D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 129: 106-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and a two-step propagation scheme as described by Schuck (28Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For each simulation, a table for the concentration dependence ofs(c tot) andD(c tot) was calculated (27Cox D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 129: 106-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with monomer concentrations in 1000 logarithmically spaced increments between 10−5 and 102. During the simulations, linear interpolation between the table entries at the calculated total concentrations was used. For testing the numerical precision of this approach, the approach of sedimentation equilibrium at low speed was simulated, for which the concentration profiles converged within 10−4 to the thermodynamically predicted distributions, with association constants within 10−3 of the correct values. Although the procedure used is conceptually very similar to those outlined by Claverie (26Claverie J.-M. Biopolymers. 1976; 15: 843-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Cox (27Cox D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 129: 106-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), because of the larger time intervals enabled by the propagation scheme and because of enhanced computational power of a current desktop PC, the algorithm is fast enough to allow modeling of experimental data by nonlinear regression with the Simplex routine, treating the association constants and the species sedimentation coefficients as floating parameters. The continuous size (mass or sedimentation coefficient) distribution of non-interacting polymers can be determined using finite element solutions of the Lamm equation combined with size distribution analysis techniques by regularization (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). In brief, the experimentally observed sedimentation profiles are described as a superposition of the contributions of each subpopulation c(M) of particles with masses between M and M +dM by the integral equation, Equation 2. a(r,t)≅∫c(M)L(M,D,r,t)dMEquation 2 a(r,t) represents the experimentally observed signal at radius r and timet;L(M,D,r,t) denotes the sedimentation profile of an ideally sedimenting monodisperse species of molar mass M and diffusion coefficient D, calculated as the solution to the Lamm equation (30Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Astr. Fys. 1929; 21B: 1-4Google Scholar). Analogously, the size distribution can be calculated as a sedimentation coefficient distribution, c(s), according to Equation 3.a(r,t)≅∫c(s)L(s,D,r,t)dsEquation 3 The distributions were calculated using maximum entropy regularization, selecting the most parsimonious distribution within a predefined confidence level P for the quality of the fit. A frictional ratio (f/f 0) representing the ratio of the frictional coefficient to that of an anhydrous sphere was employed, together with the Stokes-Einstein and the Svedberg equation, for estimating the diffusion coefficients D for all species. Unless stated otherwise all size distributions were solved on a radial grid of 300 radius values between the meniscus and bottom, a confidence level of p = 0.95, an anhydrous frictional ratio of f/f 0 = 1.0, and a resolutionN of 200 sedimentation coefficients between 0.2 and 25 S, respectively. For Monte Carlo statistical analysis, 1,000 synthetic data sets were generated, based on the best-fit size distribution, each with different normally distributed noise. For each point in the distribution, the mean and the quantiles enclosing 95% of the values from the analyses of the simulated distributions were determined. Spectra were obtained using an Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer equipped with a Peltier cell water bath. Spectra of sample dissolved in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were recorded at 20 °C using 1-mm quartz cuvettes with a wavelength range of 190–250 nm at a step size of 0.5 nm. Signal averaging time was 1.0 s, and the slit bandwidth was 1.5 nm. Data were smoothed by nonlinear least squares fitting to a third order polynomial incorporating a window size of 20 points. The randomness of the differences between data and fit was tested statistically by determining the ratio of the mean square difference or conventional variance (s 2) to the mean square successive difference (d 2). For all spectra, 1.5 < s 2/d 2 < 2.5 (the ratio for a truly random fit = 2). The mean residue ellipticity ([θ]) at each wavelength was calculated from [θ] =MRW·θλ /10·l·c, where MRW is the mean residue weight,θλ is the measured ellipticity in degrees at wavelength λ, l is the cuvette pathlength (0.1 cm), and c is the protein concentration in g/ml. The α-helix content (15Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.-S.C. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222 nm) according to Equation 4. %α­helix=−([θ] 222nm+2340)/303Equation 4 To compare the hydrodynamic properties of apoE3 and apoE4, we first employed fast protein gel permeation liquid chromatography (Fig.1). In a lipid-free environment, both apoE3 and apoE4 elute as similar, relatively broad peaks. Taken from the ordinate maximum of the chromatograms, the partition coefficients of apoE3 and apoE4 are calculated to be 0.52 and 0.53, respectively, corresponding to molar masses of approximately 110,000, relative to standard proteins. Given that the monomeric molar mass of apoE is approximately 34,250, this suggests that both apoE3 and apoE4 exist as trimers and/or tetramers. Furthermore, the broadness and structure of the peaks suggest the presence of a mixture of oligomers, which are stable on the time scale of the experiment. A small proportion of high molar mass aggregate is also observed eluting near the void volume of the column in both the apoE3 and apoE4 chromatograms.Figure 3Sedimentation velocity of human apoE3.Absorbance at 230 nm was plotted versus position from center of rotation at time intervals of 360 s. The initial protein concentration was 150 μg/ml, and centrifugation was conducted at a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm and 20 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Solid lines represent nonlinear best fits to a single species with s = 7.75 S, D = 24.1 × 10−7cm2/s, and M = 29.4 kDa (panel A) and continuous sedimentation-distribution (panel B) calculated forf/f 0 = 1.2 in the absence of regularization, according to Equation 3 (29Schuck P.

Fig. 2shows the electropherogram of apoE4 in the absence and presence of SDS. In the absence of the anionic detergent, the electropherogram of apoE4 is relatively broad, consistent with the fast performance liquid chromatography results (Fig. 1). The addition of 1% (w/v) SDS to the apoE4 sample causes considerable retention time shifts and peak narrowing, attributed to the binding of SDS to apoE4, changing the charge state of the protein and causing dissociation of higher oligomers to monomers (Fig. 2, dashed lines). The small peaks at approximately 3.5 and 16 min are attributed to base-line components present in the sample buffer, whereas the peaks at 6–7 min may indicate residual self-association in the presence of SDS. Identical results were obtained with the apoE3 isoform (data not shown). Despite evidence of heterogeneity in gel permeation chromatograms and capillary electropherograms, these techniques were unable to resolve the oligomeric structures of apoE3 and apoE4 because of the diffusional broadening of the retention time profiles. To learn more about the oligomeric structures of apoE3 and apoE4, we conducted sedimentation studies in the analytical ultracentrifuge, employing a new method for determining the size distribution of polydisperse macromolecules, which can deconvolute the effects of diffusion (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data of apoE3 at 360-s intervals show a time-dependent broadening of the sedimentation boundary (Fig. 3). Thesolid lines in panel Arepresent the best-fit sedimentation profiles assuming a single component, corresponding to an apparent molar mass (M) of 29,400, sedimentation coefficient (s) of 7.75 S, and diffusion coefficient (D) of 24.1 × 10−7 cm2/s. The poor distribution of residuals (Fig. 3 A, inset) and the unphysical combination of the relative high value for s and low value for M (or high value for D) are clearly results of the broadening of the sedimentation boundary due to underlying heterogeneity. For comparison, the best-fit sedimentation profiles to a continuous size distribution calculated in the absence of regularization (Equation 3) are shown in Fig. 3 B(solid lines). The fit to the continuous size distribution model (r.m.s.d. = 0.00459) is significantly better than the fit to the single species model (r.m.s.d. = 0.0366). This is also reflected in the more random distribution of residuals (Fig.3 B, inset), compared with the residuals from the single-component best-fit (Fig. 3 A, inset). As previously reported (29Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar), calculated size distribution without regularization can be governed by the noise in the data and produce unreliable levels of detail and artifacts. To investigate the effect of regularization, the solution to the continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution of apoE3 was also determined with regularizatio"

Several CC chemokines including eotaxin (CCL-11), eotaxin-2 (CCL-24), RANTES (CCL-5), and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3, CCL-7) and 4 (MCP-4, CCL-13) are potent eosinophil chemotactic and activating peptides acting through CC chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3).

However, the excessive recruitment of such cells often exacerbates tissue damage, slows healing, and in some cases leads to host death. Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment may be an appropriate therapeutic strategy in a number of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, reperfusion injury, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Chemokines are a superfamily of approximately 30 distinct small secreted proteins, and additional members continue to be identified (1Baggiolini M. Moser B. Clark-Lewis I.

They are classified into two major groups, CXC and CC, based on the position of the first two of their four invariant cysteines (3Schall T. Thompson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 2nd Ed.

The actions of chemokines are mediated via interactions with 7-TM1 G protein-coupled receptors on the surface of immune and inflammatory cells. To date, 18 unique chemokine receptors, including 11 CC chemokine receptors, have been cloned (4Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 5Mackay C.R.

The properties of the chemokines suggest that they are essential for leukocyte trafficking and inflammatory processes and thus are important components in a number of disease states (6Baggiolini M.

Upon activation, eosinophils release lipid mediators, cytotoxic proteins, oxygen metabolites, and cytokines, all of which have the potential to produce pathophysiology. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated the presence of eosinophils or eosinophil-specific products in inflamed lung biopsy tissues in human asthma (10Leung D.Y. J. Allergy Clin.

Five CCR3 ligands have been shown to induce eosinophil transendothelial migration using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This migration is inhibited by pretreatment with anti-CCR3. In addition, a human lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B), stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines, has been shown to produce eotaxin and MCP-4 (15Stellato C. Matsukura S. Fal A. White J. Beck L.A.

The above delineated studies provided a rationale to identify selective antagonists of CCR3, which could be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of eosinophil-mediated diseases. Here, the identification and initial characterization of the first potent and selective non-peptide small molecule antagonists of CCR3 is described. These compounds were utilized to demonstrate that inhibition of CCR3 is sufficient to prevent eotaxin-, eotaxin-2-, and MCP-4-induced eosinophil chemotaxisin vitro. Potent and selective CCR3 antagonists, like SB-328437, should be useful to help define the pathophysiological role of CCR3 and eosinophils in allergic diseases. CCR3, which was initially identified from an expressed sequence tag library, and was obtained from Human Genome Sciences (Rockville, MD). The expressed sequence tag was converted to a full-length cDNA and subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCDN, and stably expressed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Stable clonal lines, produced by serial dilution in selection medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml), were screened for eotaxin-induced Ca2+ mobilization to identify the best responding cell line. CCR3 Ca2+ mobilization studies were carried out using Fluo 3-loaded RBL-2H3-CCR3 cells and a microtiter plate-based assay using a fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). RBL-2H3-CCR3 cells were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) in T-150 flasks with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were removed from the T-150 flask by removing the medium and then treating the cells with 5 ml of Versene (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum and then plated into sterile 96-well black ViewPlatesTM (Packard, Meriden, CT) at 40,000 cells/well and incubated for 18–24 h. On the day of assay, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 100 μl of Earle's mimimal essential medium with Earle's salts containing l-glutamine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 4 μm Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3/AM; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and 1.5 mmsulfinpyrazone. Plates were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, medium was aspirated and replaced with the same medium without Fluo-3/AM, and plates were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times and incubated at 37 °C in 100 μl of assay buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.03 mmKH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with 1.5 mm sulfinpyrazone. Plates were placed into FLIPR for analysis as described previously (32Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M. Jenkins O. Murdock P.R.

The maximal change in fluorescence after agonist addition was quantitated. The percentage of maximal agonist-induced Ca2+mobilization was determined for each concentration of antagonist, and the IC50 is defined as the concentration of test compound that inhibits 50% of the maximal response induced by 33 nmeotaxin (Peprotech, Rock Hill, NJ). Calcium mobilization assays using freshly isolated monocytes loaded with Fura-2 and stimulated with RANTES (10 nm), MCP-1 (2 nm), and MIP-1α (CCL-3, 10 nm) were utilized to assess functional selectivity of antagonists (33Macphee C.H.

Binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates containing 1 × 105 human eosinophils/well in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Assay buffer (RPMI 1640; 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.08% CHAPS) and compounds were added at the indicated concentrations in a volume of 25 μl; the final Me2SO concentration was <1%. Binding was initiated by the addition (25 μl) of either125I-eotaxin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2,200 Ci/mmol) or125I-MCP-4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 2,000 Ci/mmol), 0.2 nm final concentration. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the plate was harvested using a 96-well filtermate harvester (Packard) onto a Unifilter-96 GF/C (Packard) filtermate blocked with 1% polyethylenimine (Sigma) and washed eight times (0.2 ml/wash) with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in 0.5 mNaCl. The filter plate was dried, and the bottom was sealed. Microscint-20 (Packard) (50 μl) was placed into each well, and the plate was sealed with Topseal. The plate was counted using a Packard TopCount NXT. Other binding assays used to assess selectivity were performed according to previously published reports (C5a (35Rollins T.E. Siciliano S.

Briefly, for the measurement of chemotaxis, lower chambers were filled with 30 μl of eotaxin (3.3 nm), MCP-4 (10 nm), or C5a (10 nm) separated from the upper chamber by a 5-μm polycarbonate filter (Poretics, Livermore, CA). Into the upper chambers was placed 50 μl of an eosinophil suspension (3 × 106 cells/ml) in PAGCM buffer (147 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.4) with 0.03% human serum albumin, 0.1%p-glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2), with vehicle (control) or in the presence of antagonist, at the indicated concentrations. Antagonists were dissolved at 10 mm in Me2SO and diluted in PAGCM to the desired concentration; the final Me2SO concentration was <0.1%. Eosinophil migration proceeded for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, after which the chamber was disassembled. Following fixation of the filter (75% methanol) and staining (Diff-Quick), the migrated cells were counted in four successive high power fields. Bis(pyridine)iodonium(I) tetrafluoroborate (41Barluenga J. Rodriguez M.A. Campos P.J. J. Org.

The solution was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 1 h. Aqueous saturated Na2S2O3 was poured into the flask, and the product was extracted with CH2Cl2.

The resulting mixture was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was azeotroped twice from dryN,N-dimethylformamide. The resulting solid was stirred with iodomethane (0.4 g, 3.1 mmol) inN,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) for 3 h before the addition of water.

A high throughput screen was configured using RBL-2H3-CCR3 cells and a FLIPR-based 96-well calcium mobilization assay utilizing eotaxin as the activating ligand (42Sullivan E. Tucker E.M. Dale I.L.

One compound identified in this screen was a diiodotyrosine ester, SK&F-l-45523 (Fig.1 A), which selectively inhibited eotaxin-induced calcium mobilization in RBL-2H3-CCR3 cells with an IC50 of 9 μm (data not shown). In the125I-eotaxin radioligand binding assay, binding to human eosinophils was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 800 ± 108 nm (Fig.2 A). The difference in potency of SK&F-l-45523 between the binding and Ca2+assay presumably reflects a difference in the configuration of the assays and the concentrations of eotaxin used in the two assays. Replacement of the l- configuration of tyrosine in SK&F-l-45523 with the corresponding nonnaturald-amino acid led to a total loss of activity, suggesting that the natural antipode was essential for compound interaction with CCR3.Figure 2A, competition binding of125I-eotaxin by SK&F-l-45523, SB-297006, and SB-328437 in human eosinophils.

In addition, all three antagonists inhibited binding of 125I-MCP-4 to human eosinophils with IC50 values of 360 ± 64 nm, 44 ± 14.4, and 7 ± 0.5 nm for SK&F-l-45523, SB-297006, and SB-328437, respectively (Fig.2 B). To determine the specificity of these compounds for CCR3, we assessed whether these compounds could inhibit the binding of a number of agonists to their respective cognate 7-TM receptors. At concentrations up to 33 μm, SB-297006 failed to significantly inhibit the binding of 125I-IL-8 to CHO-CXCR1 cell or CHO-CXCR2 cell membranes, 125I-SLC (CCL-21) to HEK-293-CCR7 membranes, or [3H]LTD4 to guinea pig lung membranes (Fig. 3). A number of other receptors were similarly insensitive at a single concentration (10 or 33 μm) of SB-297006 or SB-328437 (TableI) in Ca2+ mobilization or binding assays. SB-297006 and SB-328437 were therefore, at a minimum, 250-fold selective for CCR3 over the other 7-TM receptors tested.Table ISB-297006 and SB-328437 were tested for their ability to inhibit ligand binding or function in either whole cell (whole) or membrane (membr.) assays using the appropriate 125 I-labeled (eotaxin, MIP-1α, IL-8, SLC, C3a), 3 H-labeled (LTD4) or cold ligands in functional assaysLigand (receptor)Assay designAssay configuration cell typeSB-297006 IC50RatioSB-328437 IC50RatioμmμmEotaxin (CCR3)BindingEosinophils (whole)0.03910.0041IL-8 (CXCR1)BindingCHO (membr.)>27>700>27>6750IL-8 (CXCR2)BindingCHO (membr.)>27>700>27>6750RANTESCa2+Monocyte (whole)>10>250MCP-1Ca2+Monocyte (whole)>10>250MIP-1αCa2+Monocyte (whole)>10>250MIP-1α (CCR1)BindingHEK-293 (membr.)>10>250C5a (C5aR)Ca2+RBL-2H3 (whole)>33>850>10>2500SLC (CCR7)BindingHEK-293 (membr.)>33>850>33>8250LTD4Bindinggp-trachea>10>256>10>2500C3a (C3aR)BindingRBL-2H3 (whole)>33>850Eotaxin, C5a, IL-8, MIP-1α, and C3a binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whole cell calcium mobilization assays used the ligand and cell types indicated.

Mutational analysis on the yeast Cox17 reveals three of the seven cysteinyl residues to be critical for Cox17 function, and these three residues are present in a Cys-Cys-Xaa-Cys sequence motif. Single substitution of any of these three cysteines with serines results in a nonfunctional cytochrome oxidase complex. Cells harboring such a mutation fail to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources and have no cytochrome c oxidase activity in isolated mitochondria. Wild-type Cox17 purified as untagged protein binds three Cu(I) ions/molecule. Mutant proteins lacking only one of these critical Cys residues retain the ability to bind three Cu(I) ions and are imported within the mitochondria. In contrast, Cox17 molecules with a double Cys → Ser mutation exhibit no Cu(I) binding but are still localized to the mitochondria. Thus, mitochondrial uptake of Cox17 is not restricted to the Cu(I) conformer of Cox17. COX17 was originally cloned by virtue of complementation of a mutant containing a nonfunctional Cys → Tyr substitution at codon 57. The mutant C57Y Cox17 fails to accumulate within the mitochondria but retains the ability to bind three Cu(I) ions. A C57S Cox17 variant is functional, and a quadruple Cox17 mutant with C16S/C36S/C47S/C57S substitutions binds three Cu(I) ions. Thus, only three cysteinyl residues are important for the ligation of three Cu(I) ions. A novel mode of Cu(I) binding is predicted.

Delivery and insertion of Cu ions into the oxidase appear to require at least three proteins, Cox17, Sco1, and Cox11 (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Two Cu ions are inserted into cytochrome oxidase subunit II forming the binuclear CuAsite, and a single Cu ion into subunit I forming the binuclear Cu-heme a3 reaction center (2Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Because subunits I and II are mitochondrially synthesized, Cu ions must be delivered from the cytoplasm and inserted within the mitochondrion. Cells harboring a mutant COX17 gene are respiratory-deficient but synthesize both mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded cytochrome oxidase subunits (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Cox17 was implicated in copper ion delivery to mitochondria by the observation that the respiratory defect of cox17Δ cells was suppressed by high exogenous Cu(II) levels (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Exogenous Cu(II) did not rescue a subset of other cytochrome oxidase mutants (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Two observations are consistent with the predicted role of Cox17 as a Cu shuttle protein. First, Cox17 is an 8057-dalton polypeptide localized in the cytosol and intermitochondrial membrane space (13Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Second, Cox17 is a Cu(I)-binding protein with at least two Cu(I) ions bound in a polycopper cluster (14Srinivasan C. Posewitz M.C. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochem. 1998; 37: 7572-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cox17 has been proposed to shuttle Cu ions to the mitochondria and transfer Cu to Sco1 as an intermediate step in Cu donation to cytochrome oxidase (10Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sco1 was implicated in copper ion delivery by the observation that the respiratory-deficient phenotype ofcox17-1 cells harboring a Cys → Tyr substitution in Cox17 was suppressed by high copy SCO1 or the homologousSCO2 gene (10Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sco1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein important specifically in cytochrome oxidase assembly (15Buchwald P. Krummeck G. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells lacking a functional Sco1 are defective in cytochrome oxidase activity; this phenotype is not reversed by high exogenous copper (10Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells lacking a functional Sco2 are respiratory competent (10Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 16Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 211: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The proposed transfer of Cu(I) ions from Cox17 to Sco1 is supported by the mutational analysis of Sco1 in which substitutions in the potential metal binding motif, CXXXC, abolish Sco1 function (11Rentzsch N. Krummeck-WeiB G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human Sco1 homologs are known, and mutations in human SCO2 result in cytochrome oxidase deficiency and a fatal cardioencephalomyopathy (17Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Papadopolou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishion I. Sadlock J.E. et al.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Cu metallation of the CuB site may require the Cox11 protein. Cox11 was recently shown to be important for CuBsite formation in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (12Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cox11 is a 28-kDa mitochondrial membrane polypeptide essential for the accumulation of oxidase subunit I (8Tzagoloff A. Capitanio N. Nobrega M.P. Gatti D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). If yeast Cox11 is a metallochaperone for the CuBsite of cytochrome oxidase, the possibility exists that CuCox17 delivers Cu(I) to both Sco1 and Cox11 for subsequent donation to the CuA and CuB sites, respectively. Previously, we demonstrated that Cox17 bound Cu(I) within a polycopper cluster with predominantly thiolate ligands (14Srinivasan C. Posewitz M.C. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochem. 1998; 37: 7572-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). If Cox17 donates Cu ions, the prediction is that mutations of the Cox17 Cu-binding thiolates would abrogate function. Here, we test this prediction by mutagenesis of the seven cysteinyl residues in Cox17. We show that only three of the seven cysteinyl residues are essential for Cox17 function and that substitution of multiple essential cysteines with serines abolishes copper ion binding. Strain W303 and the isogenic cox17Δ strain (MATα, ade2-1, his3-1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1–1, ura3–1, Δcox17::TRP1) were used in all studies. Thecox17Δ strain was generously provided by Dr. A. Tzagoloff (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were cultured in complete medium (SC) lacking uracil to ensure maintenance of plasmids. Culture plates containing 2.5% bacto agar (Difco Laboratories) and either 3% glycerol or 2% glucose were used to assess the respiratory competency of cells harboringcox17 mutants. DNA transformations were performed using a lithium acetate protocol. The SacI/KpnI fragment of YEp-pRS426 containing the MET25 promoter and CYC1terminator was excised and cloned into the YCp-based vector pRS316 withURA3 selection (19Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). COX17 and mutants were cloned into the modified pRS316, designated YCpCOX17, to yield low copy expression plasmids. Methionine levels were altered in the growth medium to modulate expression levels. Cells were cultured in medium containing 134 μm methionine to partially repress expression of the MET25/COX17 fusions. Cells cultured in this medium exhibit approximately 60% of the maximal expression observed in cells cultured in medium without methionine (19Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). ForEscherichia coli expression, COX17 or mutant genes were PCR1-amplified to include 5′ NdeI and 3′ BamHI sites. The first five codons of each PCR product were optimized for E. coliexpression (20Anderson S.G.E. Kurland C.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 198-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting DNA products were subcloned into theE. coli (BL21) expression vector pAED4, which is a derivative of the T7-based expression vector, pET-3a (21Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendoff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). COX17 point mutations were constructed using PCR primers containing mismatches at the appropriate codon. Because of the small size of the gene, each of the mutants could be constructed by varying the 5′ or the 3′ oligonucleotide PCR primer. Each of the COX17 gene variants was verified by sequencing. Mitochondria were isolated from S. cerevisiae as described previously (22Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (23Bradford N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Five μg of total mitochondrial protein were added to 100 μl of cytochrome c reactions (45 μm cytochrome c, 50 mm phosphate, 0.1% deoxycholate). Oxidation of reduced cytochrome c(prereduced with sodium dithionite) was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 550 nm for 3 min. Reaction rates were normalized to total mitochondrial protein. Similar data were obtained if cytochrome oxidase activity was normalized to mitochondrial DNA or succinate dehydrogenase activity. Potassium ferricyanide was added to each reaction at the end of 3 min to measure the background absorbance of the oxidized cytochrome c. Two New Zealand White rabbits (Western Oregon Rabbitry) were injected subcutaneously with 365 μg of purified Cox17 protein emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco Laboratories). After 4 weeks, the rabbits were boosted with 365 μg of protein mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. A second booster shot was administered 2 weeks later with 182 μg of protein. After 12 days, serum was obtained by final bleeding. Mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial supernatant proteins (10 μg, as determined by the Bradford assay) were separated on 16% acrylamide gels in the Laemmli buffer system. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the blots probed with polyclonal antibodies against Cox17 or monoclonal antibodies to mitochondrial porin and phosphoglycerate kinase (Molecular Probes) at a 1:5000 dilution. As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (for Cox17) or a goat anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used at a 1:3000 dilution. Cox17 protein was visualized with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by autoradiography. Porin and phosphoglycerate kinase proteins were detected either with the ECL reagents or after the addition of 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 10 ml of methanol, 50 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 1 ml of 30 mg/ml 4-chloro-1-naphthol (dissolved in absolute ethanol). Cox17 was expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli. BL 21 cells harboring the pAED-COX17 plasmid were grown to an A 600 nm of 0.4–0.6 prior to incubation with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional 3 h. Copper sulfate was added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1.4 mm at 1 h prior to cell harvest. The cell pellet was washed with 0.25 m sucrose to remove any spuriously bound Cu(II). The cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and stored at −70 °C. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing and repeated sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a low protein-binding 0.45 μm filter and loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 DEAE column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with lysis buffer. Chromatography was done using a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography unit. The protein was eluted by a 600-ml 0–0.4 m KCl gradient. Fractions containing Cox17 were combined, diluted two-fold, and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was then eluted with a 20–200 mm phosphate gradient (pH 7.0). The fractions containing Cox17 were concentrated and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a G-75 Superdex 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl. The mass of Cox17 was assessed by electrospray mass spectrometry done at The Scripps Research Institute mass spectrometry facility. Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 5.7 N HCl containing 0.1% phenol in vacuo at 100 °C. The analysis was performed on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. The copper concentration of the protein samples was measured using a PerkinElmer (AAnalyst 100) atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Dialysis was performed in size exclusion buffer using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes with a 3,350-dalton cutoff (Pierce). Yeast Cox17 contains seven cysteinyl residues as shown in Fig.1, yet only six of these are conserved between species. Cys16 is the one cysteinyl residue in yeast Cox17 not conserved in other species. Yeast COX17was mutated to generate variants with single Cys → Ser substitutions. The substitution at Cys57 was made to a Tyr as that was the original mutation in the cox17–1 mutant that led to the cloning of the gene (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Mutant COX17 genes were reintroduced into cox17Δ cells on a YCp plasmid under the inducible MET25 promoter and terminator. TheMET25 promoter was used to enable evaluation of Cox17 function under both low expression (high methionine levels) and high expression (no added methionine) conditions. Cells lacking a functional Cox17 are respiratory-deficient because of the lack of cytochrome c oxidase function but grow well on fermentable carbon sources (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The respiratory defect of cox17Δ cells was reversed in cells harboring episomal wild-type COX17cultured in methionine-containing medium to limit expression of theMET25 promoter (Fig. 2). In addition, cells harboring mutant COX17 with Cys → Ser substitutions at codons 16, 36, and 47 were also respiratory competent, suggesting that these three cysteinyl residues are not critical forin vivo Cox17 function. Although the C36S Cox17 mutant grew on glycerol, the growth was reproducibly impaired relative to cells containing the wild-type protein. In contrast, cells harboringCOX17 with Cys → Ser substitutions at codons 23, 24, and 26 failed to grow with glycerol as the sole carbon source. It was reported previously that cells with the C57Y substitution fail to grow on glycerol (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, Cys23, Cys24, Cys26, and Cys57 appear essential for Cox17 function. Mutant cox17 cells with mutations in these four essential cysteines also failed to grow when the mutant genes were overexpressed (minus methionine), so failure to grow was not due to expression levels. The mutant proteins accumulated to approximately similar levels as determined by Western analysis (Fig.3).Figure 2Complementation ofΔ cox17 cells by mutant cox17genes. W303Δcox17 cells were transformed with low copy plasmids containing cox17 variants under the control of the MET25 promoter. Transformants were cultured on synthetic medium containing methionine but lacking uracil and containing 2% glucose or 3% glycerol. Serial dilutions of cells are shown from left to right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Western analysis of Cox17 comparing presence of Cox17 variants in the mitochondria (mito) and the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) representing the cytoplasmic fraction. Mitochondria were isolated from W303Δcox17 cells transformed withcox17 variants. Protein gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a polyclonal anti-Cox17 antibody or monoclonal antibodies to either porin, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, or cytosolic phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Wild-type cells were transformed with the mutant cox17 genes to ensure that mutations did not have a dominant negative effect on growth. All transformants of wild-type cells grew well on glycerol in either medium with high methionine or no added methionine (Fig.4). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was quantified in mitochondria isolated from each transformant (Fig. 5). As expected, cox17Δ cells with wild-type, C16S, C36S, and C47S Cox17 exhibit near normal levels of cytochrome coxidase activity. Consistent with the lack of growth on glycerol, cells with C23S, C24S, C26S, and C57Y show greatly reduced oxidase activity with respect to the wild-type control. The remaining cytochromec oxidase activity seen with C57Y Cox17 cells was inhibited by KCN and was not augmented by overexpression of the mutant (data not shown). Mutations resulting in the substitution of the two nonessential conserved cysteines (Cys36 and Cys47) or all three nonessential cysteines (Cys16, Cys36, and Cys47) to serines were engineered to determine whether these cysteines had any synergistic effect in Cox17. Cells harboring the double or triple cox17 mutants grew well on glycerol (Fig. 1) and had appreciable cytochrome c oxidase activity (Fig. 5). The weak glycerol growth of the C36S Cox17 single mutant was not observed with the triple mutant. The inability of C57Y mutant Cox17 to support growth of cells on glycerol may arise from the nonconservative substitution. A C57S substitution was engineered in Cox17, and cells harboring this mutant Cox17 were glycerol prototrophs, unlike the glycerol auxotrophy for the C57Y mutant (Fig. 6 A). C57S Cox17 cells exhibited wild-type cytochrome oxidase activity in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 6 B). Thus, Cox17 is functional with either a Cys or Ser at position 57. Only Cys23, Cys24, and Cys26 are essential cysteinyl residues for Cox17 function. Western analysis was carried out to verify that the mutant Cox17 proteins that failed to rescue nonfermentable growth of transformedcox17Δ cells were expressed (Fig. 3). The analysis was carried out in cells cultured in methionine medium to limitCOX17 expression. Cox17 was detected in the cytosol ofcox17Δ cells transformed with each of the mutants, although Cox17 protein levels were slightly attenuated for the three essential Cys mutants. Cox17 is co-localized in the cytosol and the intermitochondrial membrane space with 60% of the protein localized to the intermitochondrial membrane space (13Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofCOX17 results in an increase in the total cellular content of Cox17 but a lesser elevation in the mitochondrial content (13Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, the mitochondrial content of Cox17 is limited. In the present experiments with COX17 expressed episomally, total Cox17 levels are elevated at least 4-fold relative to Cox17 levels in wild-type cells expressing COX17 chromosomally, and the percentage of total Cox17 within mitochondria is about 10%, a percentage similar to that seen previously with overexpressed Cox17 (13Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mutant Cox17 molecules with individual Cys → Ser substitutions at the three essential Cys positions (positions 23, 24, and 26) were also co-localized within the mitochondria, although the mitochondrial level of C26S Cox17 was partially attenuated relative to the wild-type protein. The only Cox17 mutant that failed to accumulate significantly within the mitochondria was the C57Y variant (Fig. 3). The C57Y mutant protein showed consistently attenuated mitochondrial levels, although the protein was abundant in the cytosol. The residual levels of C57Y Cox17 in the mitochondrial were at levels comparable with cytoplasmic contamination. Substitution of Cys57 with Ser resulted in a mutant Cox17 that was functional, but protein levels were lower than wild-type Cox17 or the C57Y mutant protein in both the mitochondria and the cytosol (Fig. 7). The attenuated level of the C57S Cox17 was not because of poor reactivity with the antisera, as the antisera recognized purified C57S Cox17 (data not shown). Mutant Cox17 proteins were purified to evaluate Cu(I) binding. Recombinant wild-type Cox17 purified without any purification tags bound 2.8 Cu ions/monomer (Table I). The Cu binding stoichiometry was not significantly altered in any of the single mutants (Table I). Mutant Cox17 molecules with one of the three essential Cys residues mutated to Ser bound the same quantity of Cu as the wild-type protein. However, Cu binding was abolished in Cox17 with a double C23S/C24S substitution.Table ICox17 and the mutant variants were purified as untagged molecules by conventional chromatography. The Cu binding stoichiometry was determined in the purified samples by a combination of atomic absorption spectrometry and quantitative amino acid analysis. The values shown represent the bound Cu content of each protein done in triplicate for one or more isolates.

Mitochondria were isolated from cells harboring the non-Cu-binding mutant Cox17 with the double C23S/C24S substitution. Western analysis of the mitochondrial extract and post-mitochondrial supernatant revealed the mutant protein was present in both compartments (Fig. 7). Thus, mitochondrial localization of Cox17 is not dependent on Cu loading of Cox17. Yeast Cox17 contains seven cysteinyl residues, only six of which are conserved in fungi and animals. Three of the conserved cysteinyl residues (Cys36, Cys47, and Cys57) are nonessential in that substitution of any one of these cysteines with serines results in a functional cytochrome oxidase complex. Likewise, replacement of the nonconserved Cys16 with a Ser does not perturb cytochrome oxidase function. The nonessential Cys residues do not appear to have a synergistic effect in that cells containing a mutant Cox17 with a triple C16S/C36S/C47S substitution have a functional cytochrome oxidase. Only three cysteinyl residues in Cox17 are essential, and these three residues are present in a Cys-Cys-Xaa-Cys sequence motif. Single substitution of any of these three cysteines with serines results in a nonfunctional cytochrome oxidase complex. Cells harboring these mutant Cox17 molecules exhibit no cytochrome c oxidase activity in purified mitochondria and fail to grow on medium with nonfermentable carbon sources. These mutants likely represent a loss of function, as wild-type cells containing one of the Cox17 mutants at varying expression levels failed to exhibit any dominant negative effects on cytochrome oxidase function. Although a Cys → Ser substitution at sequence position 57 is functional, a Cys → Tyr substitution in Cox17 was shown previously to result in non-respiratory cells (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Cells harboring C57Y Cox17 exhibit residual cytochrome c oxidase activity, and therefore partial functionality exists in the mutant protein. As Tyr is less chemically related to Cys than Ser, the Tyr substitution likely perturbs some function of Cox17. The C57Y Cox17 mutant binds the same number of Cu ions, yet fails to accumulate within the mitochondria. The low mitochondrial content of the C57Y Cox17 may arise from impeded mitochondrial entry or reduced stability. The C-terminal segment of Cox17, including Cys57, may be part of an important mitochondrial targeting sequence. Most mitochondrial proteins are localized to the mitochondria through an N-terminal target sequence (24Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), although a series of molecules are known to contain internal or C-terminal targeting sequences (25Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Lee C.M. Sedman J. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20937-20942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A second metabolite transporter, ATP/ADP translocase, which functions as an ADP/ATP carrier, is targeted for mitochondrial uptake via the TOM (translocation of the outermembrane) translocation complex by an internal signal motif (27Leuenberger D. Bally N.A. Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the nonfunctional status of the C57Y Cox17 relates primarily to low mitochondrial uptake or stability, as only minimal quantities of the functional C57S are found in mitochondria. Episomal expression of COX17 in these studies led to a 4-fold increase in total cellular Cox17, and therefore only a fraction of Cox17 in the mitochondria in the present studies is necessary for its function. An additional function of Cox17 is likely to be impaired in the C57Y Cox17 mutant. A second candidate function of Cox17 is the donation of Cu(I) ions in the mitochondrial intermitochondrial membrane space, presumably resulting from docking to the Sco1 accessory protein. The C-terminal portion of Cox17 containing Cys57 may be important in docking. Two observations are consistent with this prediction. First, overexpression of theSCO1 homolog, SCO2, efficiently suppresses the respiratory defects of cox17-1 cells harboring the C57Y Cox17 mutation but not cox17Δ cells (10Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The residual cytochrome oxidase activity in cox17-1 cells may relate to limited functional interactions with Sco1/Sco2. It is conceivable that the C57S mutant Cox17 interacts better with Sco1 than the C57Y protein. Weak interactions of Cox17 with Sco1 may result in Cox17 instability and degradation. Second, a hemagglutinin epitope tag at the C-terminal end of Cox17 impairs Cox17 function, although mitochondrial uptake and Cu(I) binding are normal (data not shown). In contrast, an N-terminal HA epitope-tagged Cox17 is functional and accumulates normally within the mitochondria. The mitochondrial localization of Cox17 is consistent with the postulate that Cox17 functions in copper ion insertion into cytochrome oxidase. Curiously, only minimal quantities of the functional C57S mutant Cox17 are found in mitochondria. The interpretation of this result is unclear. Cox17 may be functional without mitochondrial targeting. Alternatively, Cox17 levels in the intermitochondrial membrane space may be in excess of what is required for function; therefore, only a fraction of the protein in this compartment is critical for function. Nothing is known of the fate of mitochondrially localized Cox17. If Cox17 shuttles Cu(I) ions to the mitochondria, it is unclear whether the apo-protein shuttles out of mitochondria or is degraded. Low mitochondrial accumulation of C57S Cox17 may relate to reduced stability of the protein in the intermitochondrial membrane space. The prediction that Cox17 functions as the mitochondrial copper metallochaperone rests largely on the observed suppression of the glycerol auxotrophy of cox17 cells by exogenous copper salts (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The proposed model for Cox17 function involves Cu ion shuttling to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and subsequent transfer of bound Cu ions to subunit II of cytochrome oxidase, perhaps via Sco1 (13Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial uptake of Cox17 is not restricted to the Cu(I) conformer of Cox17, as the non-copper binding mutant Cox17 with the double C23S/C24S substitution localizes normally to mitochondria. This important result negates a model that Cu(I) binding induces a conformer in Cox17 competent for mitochondrial entry. The copper content of Cox17 purified as an untagged molecule (3 mol eq) is higher than the 2 mol eq stoichiometry observed previously for GST-Cox17 fusion (14Srinivasan C. Posewitz M.C. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochem. 1998; 37: 7572-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The biophysical properties of CuCox17 purified as a GST fusion differ from those of the untagged CuCox17 complex even when the GST moiety is removed. 2D. Heaton, G. N. George, and D. R. Winge, unpublished observation. We had proposed that the two Cu(I) ions bound to Cox17 purified as a GST fusion exist within a binuclear thiolate center with either four or five thiolate ligands (14Srinivasan C. Posewitz M.C. George G.N. Winge D.R. Biochem. 1998; 37: 7572-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the copper thiolate center in Cox17 is more complex than that proposed originally for the GST fusion protein.2 Evidence will be presented elsewhere that the three Cu(I) ions in CuCox17 are bound within a polycopper cluster. The present mutagenesis data are consistent with only three cysteinyl residues being important for ligation of three Cu(I) ions. Additional studies are necessary to determine the Cu(I) binding geometry and whether other non-thiolate ligands are involved in Cu coordination. Because the copper content is not altered with single Cys substitutions in the three critical residues, Cys23, Cys24, and Cys26, the prediction is that Cu(I) binding in the single mutants occurs in an altered center with coordination by one or more of the nonessential Cys residues for ligation. The nonessential Cys residues may be spatially close to the essential three residues and may facilitate Cu release through ligand exchange reactions, as proposed for the transfer of Cu(I) from the Atx1 metallochaperone to Ccc2 (28Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V.O. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Biophysical characterization of the Cu(I) complexes of the single Cox17 mutants with changes at Cys23, Cys24, or Cys26 reveals a distinct change in the polycopper center.2 It is likely that Cys23, Cys24, and Cys26 are essential because of Cu(I) ligation, as the C23S/C24S double mutant fails to bind Cu(I). However, the possibility remains that the three cysteine residues are important in other aspects of Cox17 function, such as protein docking within the intermembrane space. As details emerge on the interactions of Cox17 within the intermembrane space, additional studies with the mutants may be insightful in elucidating the physiological significance of the three important cysteine residues.

Members of the IκB family contain multiple conserved ankyrin repeat domains that interact with NF-κB factors such that their nuclear localization sequences (NLS)1 are masked, leading to cytoplasmic retention of the complex.

IκBα is composed of a surface-exposed N-terminal domain, a central region containing six ankyrin repeat domains, and a highly acidic C-terminal domain. Upon stimulation of cells with appropriate signals such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1, a signaling cascade is initiated leading to activation of two IκBα kinases, IKK-1 and IKK-2, which phosphorylate IκBα on Ser-32 and Ser-36 (26DiDonato J.A.

An efficient nuclear export of IκBα is therefore essential not only in the post-induction repression of transcription but also for maintaining a low level of IκBα in the nuclear compartment, thus allowing NF-κB to be transcriptionally active upon cell activation (43Huang T.T.

The inhibitory function of IκBα in the nucleus is primarily limited by its ability to translocate into this compartment.

Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), indicating that an additional mechanism accounts for the cytoplasmic localization of the complex NF-κB/IκBα. It has been recently reported that an NES located in the N-terminal domain of IκBα (which was not in the NF-κB/IκBα structure) participates to the cytoplasmic localization of inactive NF-κB/IκBα complexes (43Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar,44Tam W. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) by inducing an efficient export of the complex out of the nucleus. In addition, the N-terminal region of IκBα has also been proposed to directly or indirectly affect the p50 NLS accessibility and function, thus limiting nuclear import of NF-κB/IκBα complexes (43Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 58Latimer M. Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Drutskaya M. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2640-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the N-terminal domain of IκBα contains a sequence responsible for the cytoplasmic localization of both IκBα and pyruvate kinase containing the SV40 large T antigen NLS (PK-NLS). When fused to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), this motif also prevents the hormone-induced nuclear translocation of GR, indicating its ability to promote cytoplasmic retention of a reporter protein. This sequence, called a cytoplasmic retention sequence (CRS), is recognized by G3BP2, a cytoplasmic protein whose function was so far unknown. G3BP2 not only interacts with IκBα but also with IκBα/NF-κB complexes. G3BP2 is composed by an N-terminal domain homologous to the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2), followed by an acidic domain; a domain containing five PXXP motifs, suggesting that G3BP2 could interact with SH3-containing proteins; and a C-terminal domain containing different RNA-binding motifs. The acidic domain is sufficient for the interaction of G3BP2 with the IκBα CRS, although an additional binding site likely exists. Overexpression of G3BP2 directly promotes retention of IκBα in the cytoplasm, indicating that subcellular distribution of IκBα and NF-κB/IκBα complexes likely results from a equilibrium between nuclear import, nuclear export, and cytoplasmic retention. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε were either purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or kindly provided by Weil et al. (59Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-p65 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GST was provided by J. L. Teillaud. The previously described anti-SV5 tag monoclonal antibody (60Hanke T. Szawlowski P. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. R. E. Randall. The anti-Myc tag is the murine monoclonal antibody 9E10. Anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and corresponded to a mixture of two mouse monoclonal antibodies (clones 7.1 and 13.1). Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-GR was provided by D. DeFranco. Anti-G3BP2 is a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a peptide encompassing amino acids 225–245 of murine G3BP2 and antigen affinity purified. This antibody is specific for G3BP2 and does not recognize G3BP1 (data not shown). cDNAs encoding for Myc-tagged versions of PK or PK fused the SV40 NLS region (NLS-PK) were cloned into theHindIII/KpnI restriction sites of the pcDNA3 vector (61Bachelerie F. Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Rousset D. Thomas D. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2883-2893PubMed Google Scholar). The indicated fragments of IκBα were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pcDNA3-IκBα ctag vector (39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template and cloned into theKpnI/BamHI restriction sites of NLS-PK encoding vector. Deletion mutants of IκBα were obtained by amplification of corresponding cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction using the pcDNA3-IκBα ctag vector (39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template and cloned into theBamHI/XbaI restriction sites of pcDNA3 (In Vitrogen). The pSTC-TK-GR3–795 expression plasmid encoding for amino acids 4–795 of rat GR and the IκBα NES ()-GR were kindly provided by Dr. D. DeFranco (62Defranco D.B. Madan A.P. Tang Y. Chandran U.R.

To construct the IκBα 37–55-GR chimera, the IκBα 37–55 fragment containing a BamHI site at each termini was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in theBamHI site preceding the fourth amino acid of GR in pSTC-TK-GR3–795. cDNA encoding for human G3BP2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human brain cDNAs library and sequenced, according to the GenBankTM sequence (accession number AF051311). G3BP2 cDNA was subcloned either into BamHI restriction site in pAcHLT-B plasmid for expression in baculovirus or intoBglII/XbaI restriction sites in pSV2 plasmid. cDNAs encoding for human G3BP2 or deletion mutants of G3BP2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the pSV2 vector containing the cDNA of human G3BP2 as template and cloned into theBglII/XbaI restriction sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) or into theBamHI/XbaI restrictions sites of pcDNA3-Myc-His (In Vitrogen). HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation as described (39Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the chimeric proteins was transfected in 5 × 106 HeLa cells. After transfection, cells were seeded in 4 wells of 6 wells plates for immunofluorescence analysis or in 10-cm dishes for immunoprecipitation and incubation continued for 24 h. Cells transfected with GR expression plasmids were grown in DMEM plus 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum and treated for 1 h with 1 μm cycloheximide prior hormone addition. For hormone treatments, transfected cells were incubated with 10−7corticosterone for 1 h in phenol red-free DMEM without fetal calf serum. When indicated, hormone was removed by washing cells three times with phenol red-free DMEM and then incubated with this medium for 2 h. Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (Pharmingen). HeLa cells were plated on coverslips 24 h before the experiments. After washing in serum-free medium, cells were infected with the vT7 recombinant vaccinia virus (64Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G.

Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Infection was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 25 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. After removal of the inoculum, cells were cotransfected using DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with pcDNA3-IκBα ctag vector (1 μg) and either empty pcDNA3 (2 μg) or pcDNA3-G3BP2 (2 μg). Transfection was carried out in serum-free medium in the presence of 10 mm hydroxyurea to inhibit maturation of vaccinia particles. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and once with buffer S (115 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.3, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C and then treated with 2 μg/ml streptolysin O (SLO) (53Rodriguez M.S. Thompson J. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9108-9115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in Buffer S for 5 min at 37 °C. SLO supernatant was kept on ice, cells were washed two times with buffer S containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and the resulting washing volume was mixed with SLO supernatant. Alternatively, for large scale preparation of cell extracts, cells were lyzed in buffer T (2% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.6). SLO or Triton X-100 extracts were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the supernatants and incubated for 5 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed, boiled for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and silver staining (66Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) or Western blotting revealed with chemiluminescence protein immunoblotting reagents (POD, Roche Molecular Biochemicals or ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For indirect immunofluorescence analysis, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Alternatively, cells were treated for 5 min at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml SLO in buffer S, washed in buffer S, permeabilized for 7 min at 37 °C, and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Primary antibodies were applied for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany). Images were acquired either with a CCD camera (Princeton) or using confocal laser scanning microscopy with a TCS4D or NT-SP confocal microscope based on a DM microscope interfaced with a mixed gas argon-krypton laser (Leica Laser Technik). Fluorescence acquisitions were performed with the 488- and 568-nm laser lines to excite FITC and Texas Red dyes, respectively, with a ×100 oil immersion PL APO objective. Quantifications were performed using the IP Lab software. cDNA encoding for an His-tagged G3BP2 was subcloned in pAcHLT-B (Pharmingen). Sequences were recombined into Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. To generate the recombinant virus, 2 μg of transfer vector plasmid was cotransfected with 0.25 μg of linearized Baculogold baculovirus (Pharmingen) DNA into Sf9 cells. Transfection was carried out following instructions from the manufacturer (Pharmingen). To produce G3BP2 protein, Sf9 cells were infected at the multiplicity of 1 and harvested 72 h after infection. Cellular pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and centrifuged. Protein quantification was performed on the supernatant by the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce). 1.5 μg of GST or 3 μg GST- IκBα fusion proteins were immobilized on 25 μl of glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with 500 ng of baculovirus expressed G3BP2 for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were then washed three times in binding buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. It has been clearly shown that the ankyrin repeats of IκBα are responsible for the nuclear import of IκBα (54Sachdev S. Hoffmann A. Hannink M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2524-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Turpin P. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6804-6812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This domain also participates in the interaction with NF-κB and masks the NLS of NF-κB p65. Such a mutual masking of the sequences responsible for the nuclear import of both proteins contributes to the cytoplasmic retention of the NF-κB/IκBα complex. To determine whether the cytoplasmic localization of IκBα or NF-κB/IκBα complex could be ensured by an additional mechanism, we analyzed the subcellular localization of wt and mutant forms of IκBα. HeLa cells were therefore transiently transfected with plasmid encoding tagged versions of wild type (wt) and deletion mutants of IκBα, and the localization of the resulting proteins was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-tag antibody. As described previously, wt IκBα was distributed throughout the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig.1, top panel). Deletion of the C-terminal amino acids 256–317 did not affect the localization of the resulting protein (data not shown). In contrast, a mutant form of IκBα lacking amino acids 1–68 was mainly localized in the nucleus with a small fraction expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, middle panel). To analyze whether this nuclear expression was significant or just resulted from passive diffusion because of the small size of this IκBα deletion mutant, IκBα () was expressed as a fusion protein with the GFP. As shown in Fig. 1 (bottom panel), the resulting fusion protein was also mainly expressed in the nucleus.Figure 1Intracellular distribution of wt or deletion mutants of IκBα.HeLa cells were transfected with a SV5-tagged version of either wt IκBα or deletion mutant of IκBα () or the fusion protein GFP-IκBα (). Transfected cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-SV5 tag monoclonal antibody, followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and photographs correspond to the accumulation of four optical sections in one projection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the N-terminal domain of IκBα was sufficient to promote cytoplasmic retention, residues 1–67 of IκBα were fused to an artificial nuclear protein consisting of Myc-tagged PK containing the SV40 large T antigen NLS (Fig.2 A). Subcellular distribution of the resulting protein in transiently transfected HeLa cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-Myc antibody. In contrast to NLS-PK, which was exclusively expressed in the nuclear compartment, NLS-PK-IκBα (1–67) was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, with a significant fraction accumulated at the nuclear envelope, but only a small amount of this protein was found in the nucleus (Fig. 2 B and Table I).

Cox-2 deficiency results in defective ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization; the latter of which can be restored in part by the prostacyclin analog carbaprostacyclin. Uterine Cox-2 expression during early pregnancy shows distinct localization and kinetics in the uterine luminal epithelium and underlying stromal cells, suggesting that expression is tightly regulated. Several intracellular signaling cascades including ERK, p38, and JNK are implicated in vitro as critical components of regulated Cox-2 expression in response to mitogens, growth factors, and cytokines. We investigated the involvement of these signaling pathways during Cox-2 induction in vivo by monitoring uterine kinase activity after intraluminal application of a deciduogenic stimulus. Our results show that the ERK and p38 pathways are activated in uterine preparations as early as 5-min post-stimulation. ERK activation was sustained for several hours with a return to baseline levels by 4 h. p38 activation was rapid with a peak at 5-min post-stimulation and returned to near baseline levels after 45 min. Systemic administration of a MEK inhibitor completely inhibited ERK activation, but did not affect early (2 h) luminal epithelial or late (24 h) stromal Cox-2 expression and only modestly affected decidualization. In contrast, administration of a p38 inhibitor modestly inhibited early Cox-2 expression in the luminal epithelium, while dramatically diminishing late stromal expression. In parallel, induced stromal peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor-δ (PPARδ) expression is blunted by p38 inhibition. p38 inhibition also significantly inhibited decidualization. These results suggest that p38, but not ERK, activation is required for induced Cox-2 and PPARδ expression during decidualization. In addition, inhibition of p38 led to decreased decidualization suggesting that an intracrine prostanoid pathway consisting of Cox-2, prostacyclin, and PPARδ is required for maintenance of early pregnancy.

PGs also contribute to cellular functions such as proliferation and differentiation (1Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York, NY1992: 1127-1137Google Scholar). The rate-limiting reaction in the biosynthesis of PGs from arachidonic acid is catalyzed by the enzyme prostaglandin G/H synthase (E.C. 1.14.99.1; cyclooxygenase; Cox, PGHS) (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two distinct Cox isozymes have been identified. Cox-1 is constitutively expressed and is reported to be critical for cytoprotective and homeostatic functions, whereas Cox-2 is inducible and is the major isozyme found in inflammatory and proliferating cell types (3DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies in mice show thatCox-1 null females display a defect in parturition but are otherwise normal (4Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Tiano H.F. Loftin C.D. Ghanayem B.I. Chulada P.C.

Cox-2-deficient animals, on the other hand, display reduced longevity because of developmental renal dysplasia, and females are infertile (5Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D. Focht R.J. Johnson J.J. Jaffee B.D.

The infertility defect in Cox-2 null females, although surprising upon first inspection, is consistent with the known physiological importance of PGs in the reproductive processes (7O'Grady J.P. Caldwell B.V. Auletta F.J. Speroff L. Prostaglandins. 1972; 1: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, Sirois and Richards (8Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6382-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified a novel form of cyclooxygenase from ovarian follicular granulosa cells that displayed properties distinct from the well studied seminal vesicle Cox enzyme. This novel Cox isozyme was hormonally inducible and required for ovulation. Its identity with Cox-2 has now been established (9Sirois S. Levy L.O. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol.

The infertility phenotype observed in Cox-2-deficient female mice further substantiates the important role of Cox-2 in early pregnancy. Indeed, Cox-2 deficiency affects all stages of early pregnancy leading to failure in ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization (11Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuck J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Consistent with the regulated expression of Cox-2 during ovulation as well as during inflammation, uterine Cox-2 expression during early pregnancy shows distinct kinetics and localization (11Lim H.

In the mouse, coordinated effects of progesterone (P4) and estrogen regulate the establishment of a receptive uterus for supporting implantation (13Huet-Hudson Y.M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1638-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Increasing levels of P4 from newly formed corpora lutea from day 3 of pregnancy direct stromal cell proliferation, which is further potentiated by ovarian estrogen secretion in the morning of day 4. In contrast, the luminal epithelium becomes differentiated on day 4 for interactions with the blastocyst during the attachment reaction, which occurs at 2200–2300 h on this day. The first conspicuous sign of the implantation process is an increased endometrial vascular permeability at the sites of blastocyst apposition (14Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Geiger S. Handbook of Physiology. Am. Physiol. Soc., Washington, D. C.1973: 187-215Google Scholar, 15Paria B.C. Huet-Hudson Y.M. Dey S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 40: 10159-10162Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This coincides with the initial attachment reaction between the blastocyst trophectoderm and uterine luminal epithelium, resulting in the adherence and penetration by trophoblast cells through the underlying basement membrane. The attachment reaction is rapidly followed by proliferation and differentiation of stromal cells into decidual cells (decidualization). The decidual reaction can also be elicited experimentally by the application of a mechanical trauma to the uterus or an intraluminal infusion of a small amount of oil in pseudopregnant or steroid hormonally prepared mice. This experimentally induced decidualization (deciduoma) has widely been used to study the events that occur during early pregnancy (11Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuck J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 12Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). On the morning of day 4 of pregnancy, uterine Cox-2 expression is undetectable in the uterine epithelium of pregnant or pseudopregnant mice. However, Cox-2 is expressed in the luminal epithelium and underlying stroma at the site of blastocyst apposition during the attachment reaction on day 4 night (16Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wary J. Dey S.K. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 147: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, initiation of the uterine decidual reaction experimentally by intraluminal infusion of oil (a deciduogenic stimulus) at 1000 h on day 4 of pseudopregnancy results in specific accumulation of Cox-2 mRNA in the luminal epithelium of the oil-infused horn within 2 h followed by a marked decline to undetectable levels by 1800 h. Surprisingly, Cox-2 expression reappears at 2400 h post-stimulation, but its localization is in the uterine stroma. This is similar to the localization and kinetic profile observed for Cox-2 in the uterus during normal embryo implantation (11Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuck J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 12Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the stromal Cox-2 expression observed during implantation and decidualization coincides in time and place with that of the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-δ (PPARδ) (12Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The restoration of dedicualization in Cox-2null mice by a prostacyclin analog cPGI (carbaprostacyclin) that binds PPARδ suggests that an intracrine Cox-2-prostacyclin-PPARδ signaling network exists in the uterus to support early pregnancy (12Lim H.

The unique kinetic and expression profiles observed for Cox-2 and PPARδ during early pregnancy suggests that expression of these two genes is tightly regulated. Multiple signaling cascades are thought to be involved in the regulated expression of Cox-2. The MAP kinase signaling cascades of ERK, JNK, and p38 as well as the NF-κB pathway have been implicated as critical components contributing to regulated Cox-2 expression in response to mitogens, growth factors, and cytokines (17Dean J.L.E. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 18Scherle P.A. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Daulerio A.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Similarly, the p38 MAP kinase cascade is also implicated in the induced expression of PPARγ during adipogenesis in vitro. The presence of either a dominant-negative mutant of p38 or a p38 inhibitor prevented adipocyte differentiation and impaired PPARγ expression (20Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the involvement of various signaling pathways leading to Cox-2 and PPARδ expression in the mouse uterus in vivo after intraluminal application of a deciduogenic stimulus. Our results show that p38, but not ERK, JNK, or NF-κB, activation is required for induced Cox-2 and PPARδ expression during the decidualization reaction in the uterus. In addition, inhibition of p38 leads to a decreased decidualization reaction, suggesting that p38 signaling is critical for establishing a receptive uterus during early pregnancy perhaps via regulation of uterine Cox-2 and PPARδ induction. All of the mice (129/B6) were housed in the animal care facility at the University of Kansas Medical Center in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards for the care and use of experimental animals. Pseudopregnancy was produced by mating females with vasectomized males of the same strain (Day 1=vaginal plug). To induce decidual cell reaction (Fig.1), sesame oil (25 μl) was infused in one uterine horn on day 4 of pseudopregnancy; the non-infused contralateral horn served as a control. ERK inhibitor (SL327 or U0126) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580) was dissolved first in absolute ethanol followed by dilution in 40% polyethylene glycol. Mice were injected with specific inhibitors intraperitoneally 30 min before and/or various times after intraluminal infusion of oil. The control animals received only the vehicle. Mice were killed at different times to process infused and non-infused uterine horns for various assays. Uterine weights of the infused and non-infused horns were recorded on day 8 and the fold increases in uterine weights were used as an index of decidualization (11Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuck J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared from uterine tissues at various times after oil infusion. Tissue was collected and homogenized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin). The samples were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min in the cold. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and protein concentrations were determined. These extracts were used for kinase assays and Western blot analysis. Lysates (50 μg/sample) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Protein was electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with a solution of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were probed with a polyclonal phosphospecific antibody against ERK, p38, or IκB (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) or JNK (Promega, Madison, WI) followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (New England BioLabs). Washes following incubation with the antibodies were done in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Bands were detected using chemiluminescent detection reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer. Lysates (100 μg/sample) were incubated with 10 μg of an anti-MAPKAP kinase-2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) on a rocking platform at 4 °C. After 3 h, 50 μl of a protein A/G-agarose slurry was added (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and tubes were rocked for another 1 h at 4 °C. Agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min., washed three times with lysis buffer and washed once with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0 buffer. Immunoprecipitations were resuspended in 75 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, containing 2 μg of hsp27 (Stressgen Biotechnology, Victoria, BC Canada). Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μm ATP plus 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 12% Tris-glycine gel, dried, and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager. Polyclonal phosphospecific antibodies against ERK or p38 were used for immunohistochemistry. Immunolocalization was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen sections using a Zymed Laboratories Inc.-Histostain-SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) as described previously (11Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuck J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The protocol followed the procedure as described previously (21Das S.K. Wang K.-N. Duria B.C. Durmin D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen sections (10 μm) were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 4 °C. After prehybridization, sections were hybridized at 45 °C for 4 h in 50% formamide buffer containing 35S-labeled sense or antisense cRNA probes for Cox-2 or PPARδ (12Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). After hybridization and washings, sections were incubated with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min, and RNase A-resistant hybrids were detected by autoradiography using Kodak NTB-2 liquid emulsion. Sections were post-stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections hybridized with sense probes served as negative controls. All reagents not specifically described were of the highest quality commercially available. U0126, SL327 and SB203580 were provided by the DuPont Pharmaceuticals Chemical and Physical Sciences Department. Our first experiments were to determine which signaling pathways were activated in the uterus during decidualization. We monitored the activation status of intracellular signaling cascades in uterine extracts using phosphospecific antibodies to several MAP kinases along with IκB. As seen in Fig.2, ERK (panel A), p38 (panel B), and JNK (panel C) showed an increased phosphorylation state indicative of activation with the onset of an oil-induced decidual cell reaction. The ERK and p38 pathways were activated in uterine preparations as early as 5-min post-stimulation. ERK activation was sustained for several hours with a return to baseline levels by 4 h (data not shown). The activation of p38 was rapid with a peak at 15-min post-stimulation and returning to near baseline levels after 45 min. JNK phosphorylation proceeded on a more relaxed time frame with elevated levels not observed until 45-min post-treatment. In contrast to the MAP kinase cascades, the level of uterine phosphorylated IκB (Fig. 2,panel D) remained unaffected by the application of the deciduogenic stimulus, suggesting that the NF-κB pathway is not activated under this condition. ERK and p38 activation have been implicated in the induction of Cox-2 in inflammatory cell types. In fact, pharmacological inhibition of p38 by SB203580 or inhibition of ERK activation by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, blocks lipopolysaccharide-included Cox-2 expression in monocytes (17Dean J.L.E. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 18Scherle P.A. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Daulerio A.J. Covington M.B. Nurnberg S.A. Magolda R.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 273: 5681-5686Google Scholar). Given the utility of these agents to specifically block individual kinase cascades, we employed these agents to investigate the role of p38 and ERK activation in the regulation of Cox-2 expression in the uterus. To test whether the MAP kinase inhibitors could influence the regulated expression of Cox-2 in vivo, we administered the selective kinase inhibitors systemically and monitored kinase activity in extracts of uteri isolated 15-min post-stimulation by intraluminal oil infusion. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 3 A. Administration of the MEK inhibitor, U0126, blocked ERK activation detected in the uterine extracts. Similarly, another MEK inhibitor, SL327, was just as or even more effective than U0126 in preventing uterine ERK activation by this treatment. The specificity of SL327 toward various kinase enzymes is shown in Table I along with data for U0126 for comparison. It can be seen that SL327 is a highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitor. The pharmacological properties of SL327 favor its use in systemic dosing paradigms, 2J. M. Trzaskos and P. A. Scherle, unpublished observations. thus, all further studies were done using this MEK inhibitor.Figure 2Effects of oil-induced decidualization on MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways.Uterine extracts were obtained at various times from the control non-infused (hatched bar) horns, or oil-infused (solid black bar) horns to induce decidualization. Western analyses were performed on these extracts as described under “Materials and Methods” using phosphospecific antibodies for ERK (A), p38 (B), JNK (C), or IκB (D).

Immunohistochemical localization of activated phospho-ERK in the uterus following oil stimulation is shown in Fig. 3 B (panels a and b). Clearly, phospho-ERK was detected primarily in the uterine glandular and luminal epithelia 15 min after oil treatment. Critical for our further studies was the demonstration that this specific staining was markedly abrogated by SL327 (Fig.3 B, panels c and d). Collectively, these results indicate that SL327 effectively blocks ERK activation in the uterus at the onset of the decidual reaction. We next turned our attention to the p38 MAP kinase pathway. p38 is known to activate a number of substrates through phosphorylation. MAPKAP kinase is a p38 substrate that undergoes phosphorylation by p38 subsequent to its activation (22Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation status and kinase activity of MAPKAP kinase have been used to monitor the activity of p38 under various physiological states. We monitored MAPKAP kinase activity and p38 phosphorylation status as a measure of p38 activity in the uterus following intraluminal oil infusion. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 4. MAPKAP kinase activity measured in the extracts of uteri isolated 15-min post-stimulation with oil was elevated over control (non-infused uterine lysates) levels. Systemic administration of SB203580 blocked the activation of MAPKAP kinase activity indicating that p38 was inhibited (Fig. 4 A). Immunohistochemical localization of activated phospho-p38 in the uterus is shown in Fig. 4 B. Immunostaining was primarily localized in the glandular epithelium in the non-infused uterine sections. However, with the initiation of decidual cell reaction by intraluminal oil infusion, distinct accumulation of activated p38 was noted in the uterine stroma in addition to the glandular epithelium by 15 min after oil infusion. The specific staining in the stroma was completely abrogated by SB203580. This is consistent with previous findings showing that SB203580 can inhibit stimulus-induced phosphorylation of p38 in addition to blocking its kinase activity (23Frantz B. Klatt T. Pang M. Parson J.

Collectively, these results indicate that SB203580 effectively inhibits p38 in the uterus during the initiation of decidualization.

To understand better this phenomenon, we have investigated the DNA content of MN induced by Tax. Using an approach that we termed FISHI,fluorescent in situhybridization and incorporation, we attempted to characterize MN with centric or acentric DNA fragments for the presence or absence of free 3′-OH ends. Free 3′-OH ends were defined as those ends accessible to in situ addition of digoxigenin-dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. MN were also assessed for centromeric sequences using standard fluorescent in situhybridization (FISH). Combining these results, we determined that Tax oncoprotein increased the frequency of MN containing centric DNA with free 3′-OH and decreased the frequency of MN containing DNA fragments that had incorporation-inaccessible 3′-ends. Recently, it has been suggested that intracellular DNA breaks without detectable 3′-OH ends are stabilized by the protective addition of telomeric caps, while breaks with freely detectable 3′-OH are uncapped and are labile to degradation, incomplete replication, and loss during cell division. Accordingly, based on increased detection of free 3′-OH-containing DNA fragments, we concluded that HTLV-I Tax interferes with protective cellular mechanism(s) used normally for stabilizing DNA breaks.

Sonik A. Stindl R. Rasnick D. Duesberg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3236-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Despite this, it suffices to say that salient hallmarks of cancer cells include genetic and phenotypic instability. Hence, not surprisingly, it has been suggested that human tumors may contain 100,000 or more mutations (2Perucho M. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar) with genomic instability in cancers arising from two broad mechanisms: loss of mismatch repair function and infidelity of chromosomal segregation (reviewed in Ref. 3Loeb K.R. Loeb L.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In view of the link between mutations and cancers, it is attractive to consider that perhaps transforming viruses exert pathology through increasing cellular mutability. Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)1 and the leukemia engendered by this virus, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), describe an important model system for studying human cancers. ATL cells are well known for heightened burden of damaged DNA (reviewed in Ref. 4Kibler K.V. Jeang K.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 903-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Previously, we have implicated the HTLV-I-encoded oncoprotein, Tax, in cellular DNA damage by correlating increased formation of micronuclei (MN) in cells (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Semmes O.J. Majone F. Cantemir C. Turchetto L. Hjelle B. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1996; 217: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with the synthesis of this viral protein. MN are small nuclei-like bodies found outside the main nucleus produced as consequences of chromosomal damage (7Majone F. Brunetti R. Fumagalli O. Gabriele M. Levis A.G. Mutat. Res. 1990; 224: 147-151Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Majone F. Tonetto S. Soligo C. Panozzo M. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutage. 1992; 12: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). They exist at a low prevalence in cells ambiently and can be induced ex vivo by genotoxic compounds with different mechanisms of action. Aneuploidogenic agents produce MN with whole chromosomes or centric chromosomal fragments, while clastogenic compounds induce MN that contain acentric fragments (8Majone F. Tonetto S. Soligo C. Panozzo M. Teratog. Carcinog. Mutage. 1992; 12: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MN induced by HTLV-I Tax was previously verified by fluorescent stainings with human antikinetochore antibodies (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to contain both aneuploidogenic (i.e. kinetochore(+)) and clastogenic (i.e. kinetochore(−)) changes (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these results is that this viral oncoprotein affects both the mismatch repair (clastogenic) and the fidelity of chromosomal segregation (aneuploidogenic) functions postulated to be deficient in human cancers. Mechanistically, the aneuploidogenic effect of Tax was recently proposed to stem from its abrogation in cells of a human mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (9Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). As yet, the clastogenic effect of Tax remains molecularly unexplained. In yeast, several proteins, such as yKu (10Driller L. Wellinger R.J. Larrivee M. Kremmer E. Jaklin S. Feldmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24921-24927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and SIR (11Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), have recently been shown to associate with telomeric TG-rich repeats. These proteins serve to protect the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes from degradation and end-end fusion. Ku and SIR proteins can be released from telomeres and be recruited rapidly to new breaks in chromosomes, suggesting a role for these proteins also in the stabilization and preservation of DNA ends generated by unexpected (and perhaps exogenously induced) cleavages (11Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 12Matsumoto T. Fukui K. Niwa O. Sugawara N. Szostak J.W. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, yeast strains deficient for yKu and SIR proteins are hypersensitive to clastogenic agents (11Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 12Matsumoto T. Fukui K. Niwa O. Sugawara N. Szostak J.W. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One corollary of these observations is that termini of new breaks unprotected by telomeres with associated Ku, SIR, and/or other factors are labile. Such ends may not be efficiently repaired and may progress to larger lesions ultimately resulting in gross chromosomal aberrations which could provide the initiating basis for transformation (3Loeb K.R. Loeb L.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To explain its clastogenic effect, we asked here whether DNA breaks found in the presence of Tax exist with unprotected (free 3′-OH) or telomere-capped ends. Using in situ cytogenetic techniques (FISH and FISHI) and probes specific for centromeres or telomeres (13Matera A.G. Ward D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 535-539Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar,14Miller M. Nusse M. Mutagenesis. 1993; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we have characterized the nature of damaged DNA in Tax-expressing cells. Our finding that Tax disproportionately induces unprotected (free 3′-OH) DNA ends provides a molecular explanation for the clastogenic effect of this oncoprotein.

Telomeric probe was either purchased commercially (Oncor) or synthesized as six repetitive copies of the 5′-TTAGGG-3′ hexamers in sense or antisense orientations. Two-color FISH was applied to detect simultaneously centromeric and telomeric DNA sequences in interphase preparations of HeLa cells. Cells cultured on slides were fixed in 70% formamide in 2× SSC (20× SSC = 0.3 m trisodium citrate dihydrate and 3 m NaCl) at 70 °C for 2 min. The samples were then chilled in 70% ethanol at −20 °C. After dehydration and air drying, 30 μl of denaturated (heated at 70 °C for 5 min) hybridization mixture (50% formamide in 2× SSC) containing 2 ng/μl DIG-labeled probe were layered onto each slide. Coverslips were applied and sealed with rubber cement, and hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 37 °C in a moist chamber. Afterward, the slides were washed in 50% formamide in 2× SSC at 43 °C (15 min) and then in 2× SSC at 37 °C (8 min) followed by brief washing in TNT (0.1M Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20) and treatment with 100 μl of TNB (0.1m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% blocking reagent; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Milan, Italy) for 30 min at 37 °C to prevent nonspecific antibody binding. After coverslip removal, DIG-labeled sequences were detected using a fluorescence-based amplification of signal. This was achieved by incubation with mouse monoclonal anti-DIG antibody (0.5 μg/ml), DIG-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 2 μg/ml) and FITC-conjugated sheep anti-DIG antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 2 μg/ml). Final 3 × 5-min washes with TNT were followed by dehydration of the slides with ethanol. Slides were counterstained with 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide in an antifade solution and visualized using wavelength-specific filters (Zeiss, filter set 25). DIG-labeled centromeric DNA sequences (15 ng) and biotinylated telomeric DNA probe (15 ng) were simultaneously hybridized to interphase spreads. The DIG-labeled centromeric probe was detected with TRITC (red) following the amplification procedure described above. The biotinylated telomeric probe was labeled with FITC (green) by incubation with FITC-conjugated avidin (Sigma, Milan, Italy) and up to three rounds of amplification by biotinylated anti-avidin (Oncor). Nuclei and micronuclei were counterstained using DAPI (blue) in an antifade solution and viewed through specific filter (Zeiss, filter set 25). The three fluorescent dyes (FITC, TRITC, and DAPI) could be simultaneously viewed and photographed through a triple bandpass filter (Zeiss, filter set 25). Photographs of nuclei and micronuclei were taken on Kodak P 1600 color slide film (5–10-s exposure) on a Zeiss Axiosce microscope using a 100 × 1.3 n.a. objective. For each hybridization, more than 3000 samplings were scored. FISHI detects simultaneously a DNA probe (visualized by standard FISH) and the presence of free 3′-OH DNA ends (visualized by in situ incorporation of DIG-dUTP). We used a biotinylated centromeric DNA probe, an oligomeric DNA probe labeled with biotin, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme. For some experiments, the 3′-end of the probe was blocked with cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine). FISHI was performed as described above for FISH up to the post-hybridization wash steps. At that point, the slides were washed in PBD (phosphate-buffered detergent, Oncor) and were then treated for in situ incorporation using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme (TdT). As substrates for TdT, DIG-11-dUTP, and DIG-dATP were used. This incorporation reaction contained the following: 10 μl of a buffer with 1 mpotassium cacodylate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.6 (4 °C), 1.25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm CoCl2; 0.2 μl of a solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) containing TdT (25 units/μl), 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol (v/v), pH 6.6 (4 °C); 1 μl of DIG-11-dUTP (1 mm) mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 38 μl of distilled water to a final volume of 50 μl. Cells were incubated in this reaction buffer at 37 °C for 1 h in a Hepes-buffered saline moist environment. Then the slides were treated with Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin visualization of DIG-dUTP was obtained by incubation (30 min at room temperature) with anti-DIG antibody (1:50) labeled with FITC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Finally 3 × 5-min washes with 0.1% Triton and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in Hepes-buffered saline were performed. Visualization of biotinylated centromeric DNA probe was obtained by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated avidin (Sigma) followed by three rounds of amplification using biotinylated anti-avidin (Oncor). Slides were counterstained with DAPI in an antifade solution and photographed through specific filters. For each data point, over 3000 samplings were counted; all points were replicated in at least two independent experiments. Statistical analyses on the frequencies of cytogenetic effects between control, and cells expressing Tax were quantitated using the G test (15Sokal P. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1991Google Scholar). To characterize the nature of DNA damage induced by Tax (i.e. centric, acentric, telomeric, nontelomeric fragments), we first assessed probes to be used in FISH. Fig.1 (top) shows HeLa cells in metaphase stained with propidium iodide (left) followed by FISH with a centromere-specific oligonucleotide (right). The DNA probe contained alphoid sequences, which specifically recognize the centromeres of human and mouse chromosomes (13Matera A.G. Ward D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 535-539Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hybridization by probe was expected to produce a signal for every chromosome, and indeed the visualized signals were located at precise positions expected for centromeres (Fig. 1, top right). Next, we verified our telomere probe. Consistent with that previously reported (14Miller M. Nusse M. Mutagenesis. 1993; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the telomere probe provided two clearly unambiguous telomeric signals for virtually all chromosomes (98% of expected telomeres were identified; Fig. 1, bottom right). FISH can reveal whether damaged DNA contains/lacks centromeres and/or telomeres. In addition to this information, we wanted to understand more about the state of DNA breaks in Tax-associated MN. Recent findings in eukaryotic systems (11Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M.

Cell. 1991; 67: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) suggest that a normal response by cells to de novoDNA strand breakages is to stabilize breaks by the addition of a telomeric cap, which contains both telomere repeats and telomere-associated proteins. Telomeric capping could be envisioned as a first step in the repair process, protecting new breaks from further instabilities and progressive enlargements. Based on previous knowledge of clastogenic damage produced by Tax (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Semmes O.J. Majone F. Cantemir C. Turchetto L. Hjelle B. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1996; 217: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we surmised that this oncoprotein could subvert the protective telomeric capping mechanism. To address the above hypothesis, we asked whether it could be determined if DNA breaks are/are not capped. We reasoned that capped ends might be relatively refractory to incorporation of DIG-dUTP by TdT, while noncapped ends would be more accessible. If one could couple incorporation of DIG-dUTP with standard FISH analysis (i.e.FISHI), potentially one could define whether DNA fragments are centric, acentric, telomere-containing, or telomere-free, as well as whether the broken ends might be capped or uncapped. Currently, to our knowledge, simultaneous visualization of FISH with TdT end incorporation (i.e. FISHI) has not been done. To establish conditions for FISHI, a biotin-dUTP-labeled probe for detecting acrocentric chromosomes was hybridized to metaphase HeLa nucleus (Fig.2 B). The same nucleus was then subjected to DIG-dUTP incorporation using TdT (Fig. 2 C) to label free 3′-OH associated with the ends of the hybridized probes (see schematic, Fig. 2, top). A merged visualization of probe-specific signal with DIG-specific signal showed tight co-localization (Fig. 2 D), verifying that FISHI technique (TdT incorporation performed simultaneously with FISH) could indeed specifically identify free 3′-OH DNA ends. More than the ability to detect 3′-OH ends associated with probes used for FISH, our goal was to visualize intrachromosomal breaks with accessible 3′-OH. To distinguish probe-associated from intrachromosomal TdT signals, we next “sealed” each hybridizing oligonucleotide with one molecule of cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine) at its 3′-end. The presence of an H instead of an OH group in cordycepin effectively eliminates incorporation at the 3′-ends of probes. Hence, TdT-mediated incorporation of DIG-dUTP, if any, would occur elsewhere, presumptively at damaged cellular DNA with free 3′-OH (Fig.3, top schematic). Accordingly, we performed FISHI using cordycepin-sealed biotin-labeled centromeric DNA probe on interphase HeLa nuclei (Fig. 3). Here, incorporated DIG-dUTP appeared as green spots, while centromeric probe signal was yellow. Consistent with the inability of cordycepin probes to incorporate DIG-dUTP, the green and yellow signals did not overlap (Fig. 3 B). These results established an ability to characterize intracellular DNA by FISH and TdT end incorporation (FISHI) simultaneously. We next ascertained that our TdT-mediated DIG-dUTP incorporation assay could quantitatively reflect intracellular DNA breaks. Treatment of cells with clastogenic agents should produce strand breakages, which should correlate with increased signals from TdT incorporation. We incubated HeLa cells with mitomycin C, an inter-/intrastrand cross-linking agent known to cause DNA breaks (20Fiumicino S. Martinelli S. Colussi C. Aquilina G. Leonetti C. Crescenzi M. Bignami M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Compared with mock-treated cells (Fig. 4 A), treatment with 0.1 μm mitomycin C for 24 h led to a 10–20-fold increase in TdT-mediated signals (Fig. 4 B), providing a correlation between expected increase in strand breakages with heightened DIG-dUTP incorporation. The above conditions established for FISH and FISHI afforded us techniques to analyze better Tax-induced DNA damage. Previously, we had used transiently transfected cells to study DNA damage (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Semmes O.J. Majone F. Cantemir C. Turchetto L. Hjelle B. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1996; 217: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, in such approach, efficiency of transfection could not be higher than 10–20% of all cells (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Semmes O.J. Majone F. Cantemir C. Turchetto L. Hjelle B. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1996; 217: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To more reproducibly assess effects, we created a HeLa-Tax cell line, using neomycin resistance co-selection, which constitutively expresses an integrated cytomegalovirus-Tax gene (data not shown). Consistent with our previous findings (5Majone F. Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. Virology. 1993; 193: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the selected HeLa-Tax cells had a 6–10% increased prevalence of MN over parental HeLa cells (data not shown). MN from HeLa-Tax and ambient MN from HeLa cells were assessed for the nature of their DNA content. By definition MN contain damaged DNA. We surveyed MN for the presence of centromeric (Cen), telomeric (Te), and TdT-accessible incorporation (TI) of DIG-dUTP. Fig.5 A shows that approximately 25% of Tax-induced MN contained centromeric and telomeric signals (Cen(+)Te(+)), indicating with high probability the presence in MN of an intact whole chromosome (group 1). This fraction was not significantly different from that observed for control cells (C, Fig. 5 A). Additionally, in Tax-expressing cells, the fraction of MN without centromeric and telomeric (Cen(−)Te(−); Fig. 5 A, group 4) signals, which likely represents acentric interstitial fragments, was also insignificantly different from that for control cells. Based on these results, we concluded that neither MN containing complete chromosomes (e.g. Cen(+)Te(+)) nor MN with acentric interstitial fragments (Cen(−)Te(−)) are Tax-specific consequences in HeLa cells. On the other hand, Tax-expressing cells, compared with controls, had significantly higher frequency of Cen(+)Te(−) MN (Fig. 5A, group 2). Hence, under these experimental conditions, the aneuploidogenic effects of Tax (9Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) are largely restricted to centric fragments of chromosomes and not to intact chromosomes, since the fraction of Cen(+)Te(+) MN was not substantially different in Tax-expressing versus control cells (Fig. 5 A,group 1). Last, the type of DNA damage described by telomere-only MN (Cen(−)Te(+); Fig. 5 A, group 3) was significantly less frequent in Tax-expressing cells. These MN can contain either the natural end(s) of a chromosome or an interstitial fragment which has been “repaired” by telomeric capping. The latter would be consistent with the model that eukaryotic chromosomal breaks are “healed” by the addition of telomeric repeats (11Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 12Matsumoto T. Fukui K. Niwa O. Sugawara N. Szostak J.W. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1991; 67: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with “telomerized” ends being more stable than counterpart unprotected ends. This reduced frequency of telomere-alone signals suggests a Tax oncoprotein-mediated repression of the telomeric capping function. The reduced frequency of MN with telomere-alone signal and the increased frequency of MN with centromere-alone signal (Fig.5 A) could potentially be explained mechanistically through the de novo generation of interstitial fragments that are not repaired by telomeric capping. To address this possibility in greater detail, we next queried for the status of TdT incorporation (TI) in Tax and control MN (Fig. 5 B). Because TI of DIG-dUTP requires accessible 3′-OH DNA ends, MN negative for TI have chromosomal DNA with inaccessible 3′-OH ends. One cause of inaccessibility would be if the ends were capped by telomeric repeats with associated proteins (11Martin S.G. Laroche T. Suka N. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 621-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 12Matsumoto T. Fukui K. Niwa O. Sugawara N. Szostak J.W. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Pologe L.G. Ravrech J.W. Cell. 1988; 55: 869-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Gilley D.

Biol. 1989; 9: 3931-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Yu G.L. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We, thus, interrogated Tax-expressing cells for frequency of MN, which were either positive (TI+; Fig. 5 B, groups 1 and3) or negative (TI−; Fig. 5 B,groups 2 and 4) for incorporation of DIG-dUTP. The frequency of TI(−) MN in HeLa-Tax cells was indeed found to be significantly lower than that observed for control cells. Hence, one interpretation is that DNA breaks in control, but not Tax, cells are stabilized by telomeric capping. Consistent with this interpretation, a significant difference between control and Tax cells for Cen(+)TI(−) MN (Fig. 5 B, group 2) was also observed. To check that findings in epithelial cells also generally hold for T-lymphocytes (the relevant cell types for HTLV-I), we compared DNA damage (Fig. 5 C) in Jurkat (a transformed T-cell line unrelated to HTLV-I) and HTLV-I-transformed C8166-45 cells, which express abundant amounts of Tax protein (21Jeang K.T. Derse D. Matocha M. Sharma O. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6277-6278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In TI readouts, Tax-expressing T-cells (C8166-45) compared with Jurkat cells showed statistically significant increased frequency of TI(+) MN (Fig.5 C, group 3) and decreased frequency of Cen(−)TI(−) MN (Fig. 5 C, group 4). Thus, as in HeLa cells (Fig. 5, A and B), Tax expression in T-cells increases substantially TdT-mediated DIG-dUTP incorporation, supporting a general property of this oncoprotein in abrogating intracellular telomeric capping at DNA breaks. Here, we describe a FISHI technique to study the nature of DNA damage induced by a retroviral oncoprotein, Tax. In cells, based on the presence/absence of in situ incorporation at the 3′-ends of DNA fragments and on the simultaneous hybridization of centromeric/telomeric probe, we could define several classes of DNA damage, including whole chromosomes (Cen(+)Te(+)TI(−)), centric fragment (Cen(+)TI(+)), and acentric fragment (Cen(−)). A salient observation from our work is that in situ incorporation of DIG-dUTP correlated negatively with in situ hybridization by telomere-specific probe. Thus, relative ability to generate a TI signal is indicative of a telomere-free DNA break, while telomeric capping (as indicated by positive hybridization to telomere-specific probe), which is thought to stabilize breaks, adversely affects TI. Relevant to cancer biology, our findings here help to extend generally the idea that retroviral oncogenes, like mutagens, may work commonly through heightened genomic mutability to effect transformation. Specifically, regarding HTLV-I and Tax, the current results help to explain the clastogenic changes in ATL cells not resolved by a previous study (9Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Thus, FISH and FISHI findings mutually confirm and reveal that in Tax-expressing cells there is a significant decrease in the frequency of centric fragments with accessible 3′-OH DNA ends (FISHI; Fig. 5 B, group 2) and a significant increase in centric fragments without telomeric signals (FISH; Fig. 5 A,group 2). There was also a significant decrease in frequency of acentric fragments with telomeres (FISH; Fig. 5 A,group 3) and acentric DNA without DIG-dUTP incorporation (FISHI; Fig. 5 B, group 4). Collectively, these findings indicate that the increased prevalence of DNA strand breaks seen in ATL and in Tax-expressing cells is less likely explained by oncogene-induced increased incidence in strand breakages as by oncogene-mediated suppression of a DNA end-stabilizing mechanism (i.e. telomeric capping). This study provides the first detailed characterization of DNA breaks induced by a viral oncoportein. Our conclusions add to the growing body of evidence of an operationally defined mutator phenotype for Tax-expressing cells (22Jeang K.T. Widen S.G. Semmes O.J. Wilson S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 1082-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Kao S.Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miyake H. Suzuki T. Hirai H.

To characterize the sites of arrestin that interact with rhodopsin, we have utilized a spectrophotometric peptide competition assay. It is based on the stabilization of the active intermediates metarhodopsin II (MII) and phosphorylated MII by Gt and arrestin, respectively (extra MII monitor). The protocol involves native disc membranes and three sets of peptides 10–30 amino acids in length spanning the arrestin sequence. In the absence of arrestin, not one of the peptides by itself had an effect on the amount of MII formed. However, inhibition of arrestin-dependent extra MII was found for the peptides at residues 11–30 and 51–70 (IC50 < 100 μm) and residues 231–260 (IC50 < 200 μm). A similar pattern of inhibition by arrestin peptides was seen when arrestin was replaced by Gt or the farnesylated Gtγ C-terminal peptide. Only arrestin-(11–30) inhibited MII·Gt less (IC50 = 300 μm) than phosphorylated MII·arrestin. We interpreted the data by competition of the arrestin peptides for interaction sites at rhodopsin, exposed in the MII conformation and specific for both arrestin and Gt. The arrestin sites are located in both the C- and N-terminal domains of the arrestin structure. Arrestin blocks the interaction of rhodopsin with the G protein transducin (Gt).

The arrestin sites are located in both the C- and N-terminal domains of the arrestin structure. metarhodopsin II metarhodopsin I 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane G protein-coupled receptors enable eukaryotic cells to respond to a large variety of extracellular signals, including hormones, odorants, and light (1Baldwin J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). One of the best studied G protein-coupled receptor-initiated signaling pathways is the visual cascade in retinal rods (2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is initiated by the absorption of a photon in the visual receptor (rhodopsin) and subsequent isomerization of the 11-cis-retinal, which is covalently attached to Lys296 in the seventh transmembrane helix of the receptor. Via a series of transient intermediates, rhodopsin converts in milliseconds into metarhodopsin II (MII),1 the form of rhodopsin that interacts with the heterotrimeric G protein transducin (Gt). This interaction initiates the intermolecular transduction of the light signal by catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange in the nucleotide-binding site of the G protein and in turn activates the G protein-coupled effector, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase. Hydrolysis of cGMP leads to the closure of plasma membrane cation channels and hyperpolarization of the membrane (3Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The deactivation of rhodopsin starts with the binding of a rhodopsin kinase to photoactivated rhodopsin (4Pulvermüller A. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14082-14088Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rapid phosphorylation of the receptor at C-terminal sites (5Palczewski K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) increases its affinity for arrestin (6Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (, and references therein): 5738-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Biochemical (7Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and electrophysiological (8Xu J. Dodd R.L. Makino C.L. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Nature. 1997; 389: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) evidence has been accumulated that visual arrestins deactivate the visual cascade by direct competition with the G protein for the active receptor. However, the mechanism of interaction underlying the quench is still not well understood. UV-visible spectroscopy has shown that, to bind arrestin, the light activation of rhodopsin must proceed up to the MII conformation, in which the Schiff base bond of the retinal to the apoprotein is still intact but deprotonated (9Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Only after MII formation and phosphorylation of the receptor, arrestin interacts rapidly with the receptor. Although the catalytic activity of MII for the G protein is quenched, arrestin binding (and phosphorylation) stabilizes MII at the expense of its tautomeric forms (6Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (, and references therein): 5738-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A conformational difference in arrestin and/or rhodopsin on interaction was earlier suggested by the unusually high apparent activation energy of the rhodopsin-arrestin interaction (9Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Later studies have indeed shown that binding of arrestin to the active receptor protects arrestin against limited proteolysis (10Palczewski K. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lysine acetylation (11Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2428-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that rhodopsin-bound arrestin adopts a conformation (Ab) that is different from that of free inactive arrestin (Ai). Investigations employing protein engineering (12Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated peptides (14Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have provided evidence for a sequential mechanism, in which the contact of the negatively charged regions of phosphorylated rhodopsin with the cationic region acts as a trigger, switching arrestin into its active conformation and allowing interaction with the rhodopsin-binding sites exposed on photoactivation. A highly cationic region near the center of the arrestin sequence, beginning with residue 163, was proposed to mediate the interaction with the phosphorylated rhodopsin site, thus enabling the contact with other interaction sites exposed in the MII state (10Palczewski K. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arg175 (within the putative recognition site for the phosphorylated site(s) on rhodopsin) was identified as a key residue for arrestin to distinguish between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated rhodopsin (15Gurevich V.V.

Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), a central region in arrestin localized between the N- and C-terminal domains of the molecule. It may act as a fulcrum for the conversion of inactive arrestin (Ai) to active bound arrestin (Ab) (19Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11451-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The conformational switch is additionally controlled by the arrestin C terminus (20Palczewski K.

When it is lacking, as in a splice variant of arrestin (p44), the short arrestin binds both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of MII and even C-terminally truncated rhodopsin (22Palczewski K.

Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and spectroscopic data (25Wilson C.J. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have suggested that in the inactive arrestin state(s), negatively charged C-terminal residues interact with positively charged residues on the N-terminal region and that this interaction is broken upon binding to phosphorylated MII. In this study, we have attempted to identify specific sites of arrestin that become exposed by the conformational switch, leading to their interaction with the respective receptor sites in the MII conformation. The technique applied is based on the spectrophotometric MII stabilization assay (9Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and on competition with peptides derived from arrestin and Gt. Peptide competition has already been applied in previous studies to map regions of interaction in the receptor-arrestin complex. Studies with peptides from the surface-exposed sequences of rhodopsin suggested a role of different loop structures in the interaction (26Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Schepers T. Hamm H.E. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding the interactive domains in arrestin, Hargrave and co-workers (27Smith W.C. McDowell J.H. Dugger D.R. Miller R. Arendt A. Popp M.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have employed a library of peptides covering the entire sequence. Based on phage-display and phosphodiesterase activation data, they localized one of the principal regions of interaction within residues 109–130 and found indications of additional sites in their data (27Smith W.C. McDowell J.H. Dugger D.R. Miller R. Arendt A. Popp M.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We will indeed provide evidence that more than one region (namely three) in the arrestin molecule is involved in receptor binding. Employing the sensitive MII stabilization assay and peptide competition not only with arrestin, but also with Gt and Gt-derived peptides, we can measure with unprecedented specificity. Based on the data from three sets of overlapping synthetic 10–30-residue peptides spanning the arrestin sequence, we propose a model locating the receptor-binding regions of arrestin in each of the two domains of the molecule. Radioactive [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Sigma. 11-cis-Retinal was generously provided by Dr. R. K. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina). Rod outer segments were purified from fresh dark-adapted bovine retinas obtained from a local slaughterhouse using the discontinuous sucrose gradient method described by Papermaster (28Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Retinas were dissected, and rod outer segments were isolated under dim red illumination. All subsequent procedures were performed at 0–5 °C, and the rod outer segments were stored frozen at −80 °C until used. Rhodopsin was prepared by removing the soluble and membrane-associated proteins from the disc membrane by repetitive washes with a low ionic strength buffer (29Kühn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All purification steps were performed under dim red illumination, and the membrane suspension was stored at −80 °C until used. Phosphorylated opsin was prepared from washed disc membranes as described previously by Wilden and Kühn (30Wilden U. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To remove retinaloxime from the membrane-bound phosphorylated opsin, the membranes were treated with urea and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (31Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An average stoichiometry of ∼1.5 phosphates/opsin was determined using radioactive [γ-32P]ATP as a tracer. Phosphorylated rhodopsin was prepared by regeneration of phosphorylated opsin with 11-cis-retinal (32Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated opsin was suspended in 10 mm BisTris propane (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. A 3-fold molar excess of 11-cis-retinal was added in the dark to the sample, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. After regeneration, phosphorylated membranes were centrifuged (45,000 ×g for 20 min), washed four times with 10 mmBisTris propane (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl to remove excess 11-cis-retinal, and stored at −80 °C. Arrestin was purified from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas as described by Heck et al.(33Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transducin was isolated from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas according to Heck and Hofmann (34Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy withN-[1H-benzotriazol(1-yl)(dimethylamino)methylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate-N-oxide activation (Fastmoc, 0.1-mmol small-scale cycles) on an ABI Model 433A peptide synthesizer. The peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Immediately before the experiments, the peptides were dissolved in deionized water to obtain stock solutions of 2 mm, and pH was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH. Farnesylation of Gtγ-derived peptides was carried out as described (35Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1937-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The concentrations of rhodopsin and phosphorylated rhodopsin were determined spectrophotometrically at 498 nm as described previously (23Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Purified arrestin was determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm, assuming a molar absorption coefficient of E 0.1% = 0.638 (36Palczewski K. Riazance-Lawrence J.H. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and a molecular mass of 45,300 Da. Purified transducin (Gt) concentration was determined using the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Formation of the photoproduct metarhodopsin II (γmax = 380 nm) was assayed using the two-wavelength technique (9Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 471-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This technique minimizes scattering artifacts by comparing the flash-induced changes in the absorbance at 380 and 417 nm. The absorbance change at 417 nm (MI isosbestic to MII) serves as a reference for determining the level of MII. The two-wavelength spectrophotometer (2-nm slit width; UV 300, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) was equipped with thermostatted cuvettes (2-mm path length), temperature regulation (circulator G/D8, Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), and a green photoflash (filtered to 500 ± 20 nm). When photolyzed rhodopsin in its native disc membrane is cooled to temperatures at which the equilibrium is on the MI side (below 5 °C and pH 8.0) (39Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), any specific binding of protein or peptide to MII causes enhanced formation of MII (extra MII). Extra MII provides a kinetic and stoichiometric measure for the complex between photoactivated rhodopsin and the interactive polypeptide (40Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 810: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The enhancement by arrestin of the MII photoproduct formed after a flash of light (extra MII) is specific for prephosphorylated rhodopsin and is not seen with unphosphorylated rhodopsin (9Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 23Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows two examples of how synthetic peptides derived from the arrestin sequence influence the formation of extra MII from prephosphorylated samples. The arrestin peptide comprising residues 11–30 (arrestin-(11–30)) reduced the amount of extra MII formed in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A, compare traces b and c); at 1000 μm, arrestin-(11–30) abolished extra MII nearly to the control level without arrestin (compare traces c ande). This effect was not observed with arrestin-(291–310); even at 1000 μm peptide, extra MII was formed as with arrestin alone (Fig. 1 B, traces a andc). None of the peptides investigated in this study stabilized MII in the absence of arrestin (e.g. Fig. 1,traces d), in contrast to transducin C-terminal peptides (Gtα-(340–350) and farnesylated Gtγ-(50–71)) (41Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The inhibition of extra MII formation by arrestin peptides indicates that they compete with their parent protein for rhodopsin-binding sites. To analyze this more quantitatively, overlapping sets of arrestin peptides with different lengths were synthesized, and their effect in the extra MII assay was measured. Each of the peptides was titrated up to a final concentration of 1000 μm. Fig.2 shows the data for two arrestin peptides from stretches 51–70 and 231–250 (arrestin-(51–70) and arrestin-(231–250), respectively). Peptides with the original sequence, but not with a scrambled sequence, exhibited a dose-dependent effect on MII formation (Fig.2 A). The hyperbolic fits to the data are consistent with a direct competitive effect of both peptides, although with different efficiency. Three sets of arrestin peptides covering the entire arrestin sequence were tested. Their IC50 values, calculated dissociation constants (K D3; see “”), and apparent Hill coefficients (n H) are listed in Table I. High values ofn H may be due to a tendency of the peptide to aggregate and therefore do not enter the calculation under “.”Figure 2Competition between synthetic arrestin peptides and arrestin or transducin for binding to photoactivated rhodopsin.

Prephosphorylated disc membranes were reconstituted with purified arrestin and various amounts of synthetic peptide.

Open table in a new tab IC50 values and the Hill coefficients (n H) were determined employing the extra MII assay (Fig. 2).K D3 values were estimated assuming the reaction scheme (Scheme 1) as described under “.” ND, not determined. Transducin forms enhanced MII complexes with photoactivated unphosphorylated rhodopsin. It is further known that arrestin inhibits the activity of photoactivated rhodopsin for the G protein (7Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether arrestin peptides can inhibit the transducin-dependent formation of extra MII. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the two peptides that competed with arrestin also competed with Gt with similar relative efficiency, providing a control for direct interaction of the peptides with rhodopsin (see “Discussion”). The question was whether arrestin peptides interfere with Gt-derived peptides in their interaction with photoactivated rhodopsin. One may expect that this can be tested by direct competition because C-terminal peptides from Gt stabilize the MII state as the holoprotein (41Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 42Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but arrestin peptides do not (Fig. 2). Fig.3 shows two examples that arrestin peptides can indeed competitively inhibit the formation of extra MII induced by Gt-derived peptides. The effect was specifically seen with the farnesylated Gtγ peptide, indicating an overlap of the respective binding sites at rhodopsin. No such inhibition was measured for the interaction with the Gtα C-terminal peptide (native and high affinity analog). As shown in Fig. 4, almost all the peptides that competed with arrestin did so with Gt and the Gtγ C-terminal peptide as well. An exception is the region near the N terminus, which showed reduced competition with Gt and the farnesylated Gtγ peptide compared with arrestin (see “Discussion”). The data provide new information on the receptor-binding sites of S-antigen, the arrestin responsible for termination of visual transduction in rods. Using overlapping sets of synthetic arrestin-derived peptides and their competition with the parent protein for the flash-activated phosphorylated receptor, we identified peptides from three regions of the arrestin sequence that competed with values <200 μm. The respective parts of the sequence are located in both the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein structure. The regions of peptide competition mark possible candidates for interaction sites with active phosphorylated rhodopsin. However, it is clear that peptide competition by itself is not specific. For example, the peptides could affect sites of intramolecular interaction, involved in conversions necessary to reach the active conformation. Since we know that such a conformational switch in arrestin occurs (see below), this latter possibility is quite realistic. A criterion was found in the comparison of arrestin with Gt and Gtpeptides. The data in Fig. 4 show that most of the peptides that competed with arrestin also competed with Gt and the farnesylated Gtγ C-terminal peptide. The loss of competition between positions 65 and 83 was also reproduced. Because intramolecular switches in arrestin and Gt are unlikely to involve homologous domains, this similarity can be taken as strong evidence for binding of arrestin and Gt or its farnesylated Gtγ peptide to the rhodopsin surface with sufficient overlap (Fig. 5). Our approach is similar to the one taken by Smith et al. (27Smith W.C. McDowell J.H. Dugger D.R. Miller R. Arendt A. Popp M.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), who employed overlapping synthetic peptides to determine regions of arrestin that bind to rhodopsin. Using a phage-display technique of arrestin fragments and Gt binding and activation assays, these authors identified a stretch comprising residues 109–130 as a site involved in the interaction with rhodopsin. Because of the low affinity of this region (IC50 = 1.1 mm), it was suggested that this portion of arrestin may be only one of several binding sites for rhodopsin (27Smith W.C. McDowell J.H. Dugger D.R. Miller R. Arendt A. Popp M.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, using the fundamentally different extra MII assay, we indeed found peptide competition with similar IC50 values in this region (Table I), but stronger competition in other regions, namely residues 11–30 and 51–70 (IC50 < 100 μm) and residues 231–250/241–260 (IC50 < 200 μm). These regions and others with lower IC50 values are located in the arrestin C- and N-terminal domains (Table I and Fig. 4). The reason for detection of these sites by our assay is probably the capturing of the interactions as they occur within seconds after the activating light flash. The region near the N terminus (residues 11–30) shows strong competition, but is conserved only in the visual arrestins, or S-antigens (43Craft C.M. Whitmore D.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This is also the region where the only significant difference between arrestin and Gt competition arises. Possible explanations include a role both in rhodopsin-arrestin interaction and in the switch mechanism (see below), in agreement with the conclusions drawn from mutational studies (19Vishnivetskiy S.A. Paz C.L. Schubert C. Hirsch J.A. Sigler P.B. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11451-11454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In any case, the lack of conservation in this region would argue for a specific role in visual arrestins. S-antigen and presumably all arrestins share with the G proteins a conformational switch, operated by the contact with the active receptor (3Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P.

Upon this interaction, intramolecular interactions, including a hydrogen-bonded network of buried ion pairs and salt bridges between charged side chains, are disrupted, leading to structural changes, possibly involving an en blocrearrangement of the N- and C-terminal domains (18Hirsch J.A.

Choe, personal communication. The sites identified in the present study are distant and do not form a flat surface. A conformational switch may thus be required to allow their simultaneous interaction with the relevant receptor loop structures. The situation is similar for the G protein Gt, where two distant sites (the C termini of the α- and γ-subunits, which are 45 Å apart) are involved in the signal transfer (41Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For arrestin and Gt (see Refs. 23Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, respectively), the simultaneous binding of two receptors at one molecule is unlikely because the titration of the complexes yields 1:1 ratios. Despite the similarity in conformational interlocking, arrestin and Gt appear to use different mechanisms of microscopic (i.e. site to site) recognition. For the G protein, it is known that the Gtα and farnesylated Gtγ C-terminal sequences have the capacity to recognize the MII species and to distinguish it from the other intermediates (41Kisselev O.G. Meyer C.K. Heck M. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4898-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 44Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). None of the numerous arrestin peptides examined displayed such specificity for the stabilization of MII (see Figs. 1 and 2 for examples). Although we took advantage of this behavior when measuring competition with the stabilizing Gt peptides, we do not yet understand its molecular basis. All we can say is that the parent arrestin protein reserves the capacity to recognize the MII conformation with high selectivity. We have identified some of the sites involved in the stable protein-protein interaction between arrestin and its receptor. However, it should be noted that this interaction may be short-lived in vivo; recent experiments in mice indicate that MII·arrestin complexes dissociate to allow the reduction of all-trans-retinal (45Palczewski K.

It remains to be studied how the necessary release of arrestin is induced and how it depends on the interaction sites identified here. We thank Dr. Peter Henklein for providing the synthetic arrestin peptides, Dr. Martin Heck for helpful discussions, Dr. Oliver Ernst for reading the manuscript, and Jana Engelmann and Ingrid Semjonow for technical assistance. The following reaction scheme (Scheme 1) was used to determine theK D3 values,MI⇌KA1MIIMII+A⇌KA2MII·AR*+P⇌KA3R*·P(R*=MI+MII)SCHEME1where A is arrestin, R* is photolyzed rhodopsin, and P represents different arrestin peptides. The solution for K D3 requires three equilibrium equations (Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3),KA1=[MII][MI]Equation 1 KA2=[MII·A][MII]·[A]Equation 2 KA3=[R*·P][R*]·[P]Equation 3 and three conservation equations (Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6),[R*] 0=[MI]+[MII]+[MII·A]+[MI·P]+[MII·P]Equation 4 [A] 0=[A]+[MII·A]Equation 5 [P] 0=[P]+[MI·P]+[MII·P]Equation 6 where [MI], [MII], [A], and [P] represent the molar concentrations of MI, MII, arrestin, and arrestin peptides, respectively. The MI-MII equilibrium constantK A1 was calculated according to Parkeset al. (39Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); K A2 was determined using the K D from the rhodopsin-arrestin complex (23Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M.

ST6 was previously shown to efficiently prevent the surface expression of CCR5 when expressed intracellularly (Steinberger, P., Andris-Widhopf, J., Buhler, B., Torbett, B. E., and Barbas, C.

Because ST6 has therapeutic potential in human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 disease, its humanization was desired to minimize the potential for immunogenicity. ST6 was humanized using a phage display-based approach. Like the parental rabbit clone, the humanized version ST6/34 efficiently prevented the surface expression of CCR5. The conserved linear peptide epitope bound by these antibodies was mapped using phage display.

Here we report the isolation of a CCR5-specific antibody, ST6, from a phage displayed antibody fragment library generated from an immune rabbit. We have previously shown that endoplasmic reticulum-targeted expression of ST6 leads to functional deletion of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 (5Steinberger P. Andris-Widhopf J. Buhler B. Torbett B.E. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Gene therapeutic delivery of this intrabody into hematopoietic stem cells of infected individuals could be used to generate a cell pool that is protected from CCR5-dependent virus infection. To reduce the likelihood of immunogenicity of the ST6 intrabody in humans, we have explored a humanization strategy based on a combination of CDR grafting and selection of human V sequences by phage display. Like ST6, the humanized antibody, ST6/34 is shown to efficiently block cell surface expression of CCR5 when expressed intracellularly with an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Most of the previously reported intracellular HIV-1 immunization strategies have been aimed at post-entry steps of the virus life cycle and seek to impair the replication of HIV-1 in infected cells (6Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 7Marasco W.A. Haseltine W.A. Chen S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We believe that a gene therapeutic approach that protects cells from infection has advantages over strategies that limit virus replication after infection of the target cell. Furthermore, we suggest that specific functional deletion of CCR5 is less likely to have negative side effects compared with strategies based on intrakines (chemokines targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum) (9Yang A.G. Bai X. Huang X.F. Yao C. Chen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11567-11572Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The chemokine ligands of CCR5 bind to other chemokine receptors, e.g. RANTES also binds to CCR1, CCR3, CCR9 (10Jung S. Littman D.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines. The consequences of inactivating a number of chemokine receptors cannot be predicted.DISCUSSIONMice have been the main source of monoclonal antibodies for the past 25 years. Two developments have recently made rabbits an interesting alternative source of monoclonal antibodies: the discovery of a fusion partner for rabbit B-cells and phage display of antibody fragments derived from immune rabbits (11Rader C. Ritter G. Nathan S. Elia M. Gout I. Jungbluth A.A. Cohen L.S. Welt S. Old L.J. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13668-13676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Ridder R. Schmitz R. Legay F. Gram H. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The therapeutic potential of both mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies is limited by their immunogenicity and requires humanization. A variety of humanization procedures have been reported for mouse monoclonal antibodies. Many of them are based on grafting of CDRs onto human frameworks (15Tang Y. Beuerlein G. Pecht G. Chilton T. Huse W.D. Watkins J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27371-27378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Presta L.G. Chen H. O'Connor S.J. Chisholm V. Meng Y.G. Krummen L. Winkler M. Ferrara N. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4593-4599PubMed Google Scholar). Generally this leads to a considerable decrease of affinity or even to complete loss of binding to the antigen (17Baca M. Presta L.G. O'Connor S.J. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10678-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, in most cases, CDR grafting is combined with changes in framework residues that are potentially important for binding to generate humanized antibodies that have affinities similar to the parental antibodies. Such an approach was successfully used in the first report of humanization of a rabbit antibody (11Rader C. Ritter G. Nathan S. Elia M. Gout I. Jungbluth A.A. Cohen L.S. Welt S. Old L.J. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13668-13676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A phage display-based selection strategy was used in this first report to combine CDR grafting and framework fine tuning to humanize a recombinant rabbit antibody recognizing the A33 colon antigen. Here we have used a different methodology based on a combination of CDR grafting and selection of V sequences from the human antibody repertoire to humanize ST6. An advantage of this type of strategy is that the humanized antibody contains minimal sequence derived from the nonhuman donor antibody. This strategy has been employed in our laboratory to humanize a murine antibody specific to the human αvβ3 integrin (18Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study the original CDR3s that generally make the most significant contribution to affinity and specificity of an antibody were preserved in the humanized antibody. Following this strategy for the humanization of ST6, we could select human light chain sequences that bound to human CCR5 in conjunction with the ST6 heavy chain fragment. We were, however, unable to select antibody fragments with human VHsequences that bound to CCR5 using this approach. We suspected that the HCDR2 of ST6 plays a crucial role in the antibody-antigen interaction and that the human VH repertoire might not contain CDR2 sequences that are similar enough to support specific binding of the humanized antibody. Therefore, a new VH library was constructed, where in addition to CDR3, a humanized CDR2 containing the W62S mutation was derived from ST6. From this library we were able to select a humanized CCR5-specific antibody named ST6/34. Affinity comparisons using Fab fragments of ST6 and ST6/34 showed a slightly higher affinity of the parental antibody. This could be due to the fact that ST6/34 was selected for binding as a scFv, whereas the original ST6 was selected from a Fab library. In agreement with this, the single chain intrabody ST6/34 prevented surface expression of CCR5 more efficiently than the ST6 intrabody. Both ST6 and ST6/34 were shown to bind the peptide sequence YYTSEP that is present in the first extracellular region of CCR5 and is available for intrabody targeting within cells as well as on the cell surface. This sequence is conserved in rhesus CCR5, explaining the cross-species reactivity of these antibodies (19Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We showed previously that intracellular expression of the parental ST6-scFv renders T-lymphocytes immune to CCR5-dependent HIV-1 infection (5Steinberger P. Andris-Widhopf J. Buhler B. Torbett B.E. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The humanized intrabody ST6/34 should have the same effect. In addition this antibody is less likely to elicit an immune response, which is a potential complication in gene therapeutic delivery of foreign proteins (20Koenig S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We believe that delivery of the ST6/34 intrabody gene to hematopoietic stem cells could have therapeutic potential in HIV-1 disease. During the course of HIV-1 infection, the virus often switches to use the other major coreceptor, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Whereas it is known that absence of functional CCR5 does not lead to any health problem (4Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A. Landau N.R. Cell. 1996; 86: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar), CXCR4 might be essential (21Zou Y.R. Kottmann A.H. Kuroda M. Taniuchi I. Littman D.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting both major coreceptors with a double functional knockout strategy might lead to unwanted side effects. Delivery of the ST6/34 intrabody gene in conjunction with genes that target viral replication (6Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 7Marasco W.A. Haseltine W.A. Chen S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 38-45PubMed Google Scholar) might be a way to generate cells that are protected from CCR5-dependent HIV-1 infection. In the case of emergence of X4 (CXCR4 using) variants, these cells would still limit virus replication upon infection.Here, ST6/34-IgG was shown to bind to cells expressing CCR5. The potential of this antibody to deliver interleukin-2 and other cytokines to resting latently HIV-1-infected CD4+T-cells is currently being evaluated. Activation of this cell pool is thought to make its virus load susceptible to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (22Chun T.W. Engel D. Mizell S.B. Hallahan C.W. Fischette M. Park S. Davey R.J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 2705-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We showed previously that intracellular expression of the parental ST6-scFv renders T-lymphocytes immune to CCR5-dependent HIV-1 infection (5Steinberger P. Andris-Widhopf J. Buhler B. Torbett B.E. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The humanized intrabody ST6/34 should have the same effect. In addition this antibody is less likely to elicit an immune response, which is a potential complication in gene therapeutic delivery of foreign proteins (20Koenig S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We believe that delivery of the ST6/34 intrabody gene to hematopoietic stem cells could have therapeutic potential in HIV-1 disease. During the course of HIV-1 infection, the virus often switches to use the other major coreceptor, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Whereas it is known that absence of functional CCR5 does not lead to any health problem (4Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting both major coreceptors with a double functional knockout strategy might lead to unwanted side effects. Delivery of the ST6/34 intrabody gene in conjunction with genes that target viral replication (6Malim M.H. Bohnlein S. Hauber J. Cullen B.R.

Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 38-45PubMed Google Scholar) might be a way to generate cells that are protected from CCR5-dependent HIV-1 infection. In the case of emergence of X4 (CXCR4 using) variants, these cells would still limit virus replication upon infection.Here, ST6/34-IgG was shown to bind to cells expressing CCR5. The potential of this antibody to deliver interleukin-2 and other cytokines to resting latently HIV-1-infected CD4+T-cells is currently being evaluated. Activation of this cell pool is thought to make its virus load susceptible to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (22Chun T.W. Engel D. Mizell S.B. Hallahan C.W. Fischette M. Park S. Davey R.J. Dybul M. Kovacs J.A. Metcalf J.A. Mican J.M. Berrey M.M. Corey L. Lane H.C. Fauci A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Mice have been the main source of monoclonal antibodies for the past 25 years. Two developments have recently made rabbits an interesting alternative source of monoclonal antibodies: the discovery of a fusion partner for rabbit B-cells and phage display of antibody fragments derived from immune rabbits (11Rader C. Ritter G. Nathan S. Elia M. Gout I. Jungbluth A.A. Cohen L.S. Welt S. Old L.J. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13668-13676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Ridder R. Schmitz R. Legay F. Gram H. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The therapeutic potential of both mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies is limited by their immunogenicity and requires humanization. A variety of humanization procedures have been reported for mouse monoclonal antibodies. Many of them are based on grafting of CDRs onto human frameworks (15Tang Y. Beuerlein G. Pecht G. Chilton T. Huse W.D. Watkins J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27371-27378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Presta L.G. Chen H. O'Connor S.J. Chisholm V. Meng Y.G. Krummen L. Winkler M. Ferrara N. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4593-4599PubMed Google Scholar). Generally this leads to a considerable decrease of affinity or even to complete loss of binding to the antigen (17Baca M. Presta L.G. O'Connor S.J. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10678-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, in most cases, CDR grafting is combined with changes in framework residues that are potentially important for binding to generate humanized antibodies that have affinities similar to the parental antibodies. Such an approach was successfully used in the first report of humanization of a rabbit antibody (11Rader C. Ritter G. Nathan S. Elia M. Gout I. Jungbluth A.A. Cohen L.S. Welt S. Old L.J. Barbas III, C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13668-13676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A phage display-based selection strategy was used in this first report to combine CDR grafting and framework fine tuning to humanize a recombinant rabbit antibody recognizing the A33 colon antigen. Here we have used a different methodology based on a combination of CDR grafting and selection of V sequences from the human antibody repertoire to humanize ST6. An advantage of this type of strategy is that the humanized antibody contains minimal sequence derived from the nonhuman donor antibody. This strategy has been employed in our laboratory to humanize a murine antibody specific to the human αvβ3 integrin (18Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study the original CDR3s that generally make the most significant contribution to affinity and specificity of an antibody were preserved in the humanized antibody. Following this strategy for the humanization of ST6, we could select human light chain sequences that bound to human CCR5 in conjunction with the ST6 heavy chain fragment. We were, however, unable to select antibody fragments with human VHsequences that bound to CCR5 using this approach. We suspected that the HCDR2 of ST6 plays a crucial role in the antibody-antigen interaction and that the human VH repertoire might not contain CDR2 sequences that are similar enough to support specific binding of the humanized antibody. Therefore, a new VH library was constructed, where in addition to CDR3, a humanized CDR2 containing the W62S mutation was derived from ST6. From this library we were able to select a humanized CCR5-specific antibody named ST6/34. Affinity comparisons using Fab fragments of ST6 and ST6/34 showed a slightly higher affinity of the parental antibody. This could be due to the fact that ST6/34 was selected for binding as a scFv, whereas the original ST6 was selected from a Fab library. In agreement with this, the single chain intrabody ST6/34 prevented surface expression of CCR5 more efficiently than the ST6 intrabody. Both ST6 and ST6/34 were shown to bind the peptide sequence YYTSEP that is present in the first extracellular region of CCR5 and is available for intrabody targeting within cells as well as on the cell surface. This sequence is conserved in rhesus CCR5, explaining the cross-species reactivity of these antibodies (19Chen Z. Zhou P. Ho D.D. Landau N.R. Marx P.A. J.

https://openalex.org/W1989633392,"Pharmacological opening of mitochondrial cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels has the chance to be a promising but still controversial cardioprotective mechanism. Physiological roles of mitochondrial KATP channels in the myocardium remain unclear. We studied the effects of diazoxide, a specific opener of these channels, on the function of rat mitochondria in situ in saponin-permeabilized fibers using an ionic medium that mimics the cytosol. In the presence of NADH-producing substrates (malate + glutamate), neither 100 μm diazoxide nor 100 μm glibenclamide (a KATP channel blocker) changed the mitochondrial respiration in the absence or presence of ADP. Because the KATP channel function could be modified by changes in adenine nucleotide concentrations near the mitochondria, we studied the effects of diazoxide and glibenclamide on the functional activity of mitochondrial kinases. Both diazoxide and glibenclamide did not change the in situ ADP sensitivity in the presence or absence of creatine (apparent K m values for ADP were, respectively, 59 ± 9 and 379 ± 45 μm). Similarly, stimulation of the mitochondrial respiration with AMP in the presence of ATP due to adenylate kinase activity was not affected by the modulators of KATP channels. However, when succinate was used as substrate, diazoxide significantly inhibited basal respiration by 22% and maximal respiration by 24%. Thus, at a cardioprotective dose, the main functional effect of diazoxide depends on respiratory substrates and seems not to be related to KATP channel activity.

Fryer R.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar and 2Baines C.P. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These substances have beneficial effects on the myocardium in various models of ischemia and induce preconditioning, which is able to protect the cardiac tissue against subsequent episodes of ischemia. This protection may be blocked by antagonists of KATP channels (glibenclamide, 5-hydroxydecanoate).The precise cellular mechanisms by which KATP openers exert their cardioprotective effects still remains under debate. Initially, it was proposed (3Noma A. Nature. 1983; 305: 147-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) that opening of sarcolemmal KATPchannels would enhance the shortening of the cardiac action potential thus inhibiting calcium entry into the cell. However, numerous studies (4Yao Z. Gross G.J. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1769-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Grover G.J. Dalonza A.J. Parham C.S. Darbenzio R.B. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Jovanovic A. Jovanovic S. Lorenz E. Terzic A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have shown an absence of correlation between action potential duration and cardioprotective action of KATP channel openers.Another site of action that has been proposed for KATPchannel openers is the recently identified mitochondrial KATP channel (7Inoue I. Nagase H. Kishi K. Higuti T. Nature. 1991; 352: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 8Paucek P. Mironova G. Mahdi F. Beavis A.D. Woldegiorgis G. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26062-26069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the K+ channel opener diazoxide that is selective for the mitochondrial channels (9Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) produced a cardioprotective effect in isolated rat hearts and that this protection was independent of sarcolemmal KATP channels. In addition, the protection could be reversed by the channel antagonists, glibenclamide and 5-hydroxydecanoate. A similar protective effect of diazoxide was shown in rabbit myocytes killed in a model of simulated ischemia (10Liu Y. Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). These results suggested that diazoxide and perhaps other KATPopeners were interacting with the mitochondrial KATPchannels to produce cardioprotection.It is unclear, however, why opening of mitochondrial KATPchannels would be cardioprotective. It has been suggested (10Liu Y. Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) that K+ influx into the mitochondrial matrix would dissipate the potential across the inner membrane and uncouple electron transfer. In addition, K+ influx would increase matrix volume (mitochondrial swelling) (11Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the KATP channels opening for the cellular energetics remains obscure.Although intracellular ATP is the endogenous inhibitor of KATP channels and a low ADP concentration serves as a channel activator (12Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Mironova G.D. Marinov B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is still a matter of debate whether changes in the intracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP, and/or in the ATP/ADP ratio could account for the transition between the ATP- (closed) and ADP-liganded (open) states. The microenvironment of the KATP channel harbors phosphotransfer enzymes (creatine kinase, adenylate kinase) that are able to transfer phosphoryls between ATP and ADP and in such a way potentially regulate KATPchannel activity (for review, see Dzeja and Terzic (13Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and references therein). It has been suggested that this activity could be regulated through interactions between different kinases (13Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, effects of modulators of KATP channels on the cellular phosphotransfer systems have not been studied yet.In the present work we investigate the effects of diazoxide and a KATP channel antagonist, glibenclamide, on mitochondrial activity in permeabilized cardiac fibers in situ in ionic medium mimicking the cytosol. Using such a model appears to be important because factors that are able to change mitochondrial volume could potentially have different effects in isolated mitochondria and in mitochondria kept in their natural environment including the cytoskeleton. Indeed, a cardioprotective effect of diazoxide could be abolished by disruption of the cytoskeleton (14Baines C.P. Liu G.S. Birincioglu M. Critz S.D. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1361-H1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because some natural compounds in the cytosol like taurine (15Han J. Kim E. Ho W.-K. Earm Y.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 2043-2050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or sulfhydryl group reducers (12Grigoriev S.M. Skarga Y.Y. Mironova G.D. Marinov B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) may affect the KATP channel state, whereas proteins can bind diazoxide (16Sellers E.M. Koch-Weser J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1974; 23: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in the present work we have tried to mimic, as closely as possible, the cellular conditions at which diazoxide exerts its protective effect. As KATP channel function can be modified by changes in adenine nucleotide concentrations near the mitochondria, we studied the effects of diazoxide and glibenclamide on respiratory parameters of the total mitochondrial population at various ADP concentrations in the presence and absence of creatine. In the latter case, the absence of ADP-regenerating creatine kinase activity near the inner mitochondrial membrane allowed us to decrease the local ADP/ATP ratio in the intermembrane space. We also investigated effects of the KATP channel modulators when another system (adenylate kinase), which regulates the local ATP/ADP ratio, was activated.RESULTSTable I shows the respiratory parameters of mitochondria in permeabilized fibers using NADH-generating substrates (glutamate + malate) in the solution R containing 116 mm K+ in the presence of either 100 μm diazoxide or its solvent 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Such a concentration of diazoxide was shown to exert a prominent cardioprotective effect (9Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J. Smith M.A. Grover G.J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1072-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 10Liu Y. Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Besides, Garlid (11Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) testing five different diazoxide concentrations found that the optimal cardioprotection took place when 100 μm diazoxide was used. Basal respiration in the absence of adenine nucleotides (V 0) was considerably (about 7-fold) augmented by stepwise increases in [ADP] (Fig. 1), thus showing a good coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation. Diazoxide changed neither basal nor maximal ADP-stimulated (V max) oxygen consumption rate. The respiratory activity of mitochondria at intermediate ADP concentrations was not modified by diazoxide as can be seen from the same values of Michaelis constant for ADP in the presence and in the absence of the KATP channel opener. Creatine considerably decreased K m for ADP due to local ADP regeneration catalyzed by mitochondrial creatine kinase. Diazoxide did not change the respiratory kinetic parameters in the presence of creatine thus indicating the insensitivity of creatine kinase to this substance (Table I).Table IParameters of mitochondrial (glutamate + malate)-supported respiration in the presence of diazoxide or glibenclamideV 0V maxACRK m(app)(−Cr)K m(app) (+Cr)μmol O2/min/g dry weightμmol O2/min/g dry weightμmμmMe2SO (8–10)4.04 ± 0.4024.7 ± 1.56.66 ± 0.96374 ± 4161 ± 10Diazoxide (8–10)3.55 ± 0.5023.5 ± 2.27.68 ± 1.22370 ± 4869 ± 9Control (9–12)5.18 ± 0.6729.6 ± 1.06.72 ± 1.05236 ± 2586 ± 7Glibenclamide (9–12)5.59 ± 0.6426.4 ± 2.05.53 ± 0.85236 ± 2593 ± 15V 0, oxygen consumption rate in the absence of ADP;V max, oxygen consumption rate in the presence of 2 mm ADP and 20 mm creatine; ACR, acceptor control ratio, V max/V 0;K m(app) (−Cr), apparent Michaelis constant of respiration for ADP in the absence of creatine;K m(app) (+Cr), apparent Michaelis constant of respiration for ADP in the presence of 20 mm creatine; numbers in parenthesis, numbers of experiments. Open table in a new tab Under our conditions, diazoxide did not exert any uncoupling action on the mitochondria in situ as can be seen from unchanged values of V 0 and acceptor control ratio (V max/V 0). We did a positive control experiment to check if uncoupling effect could be demonstrated in permeabilized fibers. Indeed, 1 μmcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP),1 a mitochondrial uncoupler, significantly increased the basal respiration rate from 6.12 ± 0.41 to 27.8 ± 3.7 μmol of O2/min/mg dry weight (n = 6; p < 0.001).We also checked the hypothesis that under our conditions, the KATP channels are already opened so that diazoxide could not have any effect. Table I shows the respiratory parameters of the permeabilized fibers in the presence of 100 μmglibenclamide, a KATP channel antagonist. Such a concentration was chosen because it was shown that theK 12 for glibenclamide's specific inhibitory effect on the KATP channels was in the micromolar range (19Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen from the table, glibenclamide did not have any effect on the mitochondrial respiration in situ. A higher glibenclamide concentration of 500 μm led to a significant inhibition of the maximal oxygen consumption rate (22.3 ± 0.2 μmol of O2/min/mg dry weight;p < 0.02 versus control) due, most probably, to nonspecific effects on the mitochondrial respiration as suggested by Garlid's group (19Jaburek M. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13578-13582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).All these experiments were carried out in the absence of added ATP, although some ATP existed near the mitochondria due to oxidative phosphorylation. This could be shown by the effect of creatine on respiration. Thus, we tested the effects of KATP channel modulators on the (glutamate + malate)-supported respiration in the presence of 200 μm exogenous ATP. This induced an increase in respiration due to endogenous ADP production by intrafiber ATPases. Diazoxide did not change the oxygen consumption rate (10.4 ± 0.6 μmol of O2/min/mg dry weight;n = 14) as compared with its control, 0.1% Me2SO (11.0 ± 1.0 μmol of O2/min/mg dry weight; n = 13). However, glibenclamide significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration (Fig.2). Without glibenclamide, addition of 200 μm ATP increased the oxygen consumption rate from 5.23 ± 0.39 to 10.8 ± 0.7 μmol of O2/min/mg dry weight (n = 12), but in the presence of the KATP channel antagonist, the respiration increased to only 8.86 ± 0.45 μmol of O2/min/mg dry weight (n = 12; p < 0.05). To check if this effect was related to the closing of KATP channels, we investigated it in the presence of 100 μm diazoxide. The results are presented in Fig. 2. Respiration in the presence of 0.1% Me2SO was taken as control. Glibenclamide markedly decreased the respiration in the presence of only 200 μmATP and in the presence of ATP + 2 mm ADP. Diazoxide did not reverse this effect.Figure 2Effects of glibenclamide or glibenclamide + diazoxide on the permeabilized fiber respiration rate in the presence of 200 μm ATP (V ATP) and 200 μm ATP + 2 mm ADP + 20 mm creatine (V max). *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We studied the effects of the KATP channel modulators on the functional activity of adenylate kinase in situ, another enzyme regulating the ADP/ATP ratio near the mitochondria and potentially capable of influencing the channel activity. Addition of 200 μm ATP induced a submaximal respiration rate that was considerably augmented by a subsequent addition of 2 mmAMP. This augmentation was evidently induced by an intrafiber ADP production due to adenylate kinase fixed to intracellular organelles like mitochondria and myofibrils. The percentage of this respiration rate increment could be taken as an index of the functional activity of cellular adenylate kinase. Table II shows that this parameter was not changed by the modulators of KATP channels. To check that respiration in the presence of ATP + AMP did not reach the saturation level, a high ADP concentration (2 mm) and 20 mm creatine were added at the end of the experiment. After this addition, the oxygen consumption rate was further increased. Note that glibenclamide in the presence of exogenous ATP consistently decreased the respiration both in the presence and in the absence of AMP or ADP.Table IIEffects of diazoxide and glibenclamide on the functional activity of adenylate kinase in situV ATPV ATP + AMP%AMPV maxμmol O2/min/g dry weightμmol O2/min/g dry weightμmol O2/min/g dry weightMe2SO (14)11.0 ± 1.018.4 ± 0.975 ± 829.4 ± 1.9Diazoxide (13)10.4 ± 0.617.5 ± 0.769 ± 427.3 ± 1.1Control (12)10.8 ± 0.718.8 ± 1.276 ± 728.1 ± 1.5Glibenclamide (12)8.9 ± 0.45 2-ap < 0.05 compared to respective control.15.0 ± 0.9 2-ap < 0.05 compared to respective control.68 ± 621.8 ± 1.2 2-bp < 0.01 compared to respective control.V ATP, oxygen consumption rate in the presence of 200 μm ATP; V ATP + AMP, oxygen consumption rate in the presence of 200 μm ATP and 2 mm AMP; %AMP, percentage of the respiration rate increase after the AMP addition, index of the adenylate kinase functional activity; V max, maximal oxygen consumption rate after addition of 2 mm ADP + 20 mmcreatine; numbers in parenthesis, numbers of experiments.2-a p < 0.05 compared to respective control.2-b p < 0.01 compared to respective control.

To test if the modulators of KATP channels could affect mitochondrial function when the respiratory chain used other reduced equivalents, this function was studied in the presence of 10 mm succinate. Complex I activity was blocked by 10 μm rotenone. Oxygen consumption rate in the absence (V 0) and in the presence of 2 mm ADP + 20 mm creatine (V max) are presented in Fig.3. Diazoxide significantly diminished the succinate-supported basal respiration by 22% and the maximal ADP-stimulated respiration by 24%. To test if such an effect is related to the KATP channel opening, 100 μmglibenclamide was added into the medium. Surprisingly, the KATP channel antagonist appeared to accentuate the diazoxide effect at least on the maximal respiration rate. Glibenclamide itself had no influence on the permeabilized fiber oxygen consumption (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effects of KATP channel modulators on the succinate-supported permeabilized fiber respiration.

In the presence of 1 μm FCCP, addition of 0.1% Me2SO decreased the respiration rate by 38 ± 4% (n = 8) whereas diazoxide + Me2SO diminished this parameter by 51 ± 2% (n = 8;p < 0.02).DISCUSSIONThe main result of this work is that neither diazoxide nor glibenclamide at relatively high concentrations (100 μm) affected the functional activity of cardiac mitochondria in situ by modulating the KATP channel activity (that is by inducing or blocking the uncoupling effect). However, these substances have other effects on mitochondria that depend on the substrate used for oxidation.The beneficial effects of KATP channel openers was proposed to be related to dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (10Liu Y. Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Opening of potassium-selective ion channels in the energized inner mitochondrial membrane, in contact with a K+-rich extramitochondrial milieu, would induce an inward potassium flux. As a consequence, the membrane potential established by the proton pump would decrease. This depolarization would accelerate electron transfer and diminish the ADP phosphorylation rate, in other words, produce an uncoupling effect. It has been suggested (10Liu Y. Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) that such a depolarization could decrease the driving force for calcium influx, promote the binding of the endogenous mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, or alter glycolytic pathways during ischemia. Our experiments in a K+-rich ionic medium mimicking the cytosol shows that neither diazoxide nor glibenclamide influences the mitochondrial (glutamate + malate)-supported respiration in the absence of ADP. Moreover, without exogenous ATP, neither diazoxide nor glibenclamide affect the respiration at various ADP concentrations both in the presence and absence of creatine. In the latter case, some ATP exists near the inner mitochondrial membrane because creatine addition markedly accelerated the respiration rate due to regeneration of ADP from ATP in the creatine kinase reaction. Such an absence of uncoupling effect on the mitochondria under various conditions makes unlikely the possibility that diazoxide-induced K+ flux into the mitochondrial matrix could induce a significant dissipation of the membrane potential. Interestingly, 100 μm diazoxide slightly depolarized the isolated liver mitochondria (20Grimmsmann T. Rustenbeck I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, in intact pancreatic B-cells this compound at the same concentration produced only minimal changes in the inner membrane potential. In intact cardiomyocytes, a dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential was recorded when a higher diazoxide concentration (300 μm) was used (20Grimmsmann T. Rustenbeck I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that even in isolated mitochondria the KATP channel openers do not always have an uncoupling action. Szewczyk et al. (22Szewczyk A. Wojcik G. Nalecz M.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 207: 126-132Google Scholar) tested five various KATP channel openers, and only one of them was able to induce depolarization of rat liver mitochondria. However, other KATP channel openers (pinacidil, cromakalim, and levcromakalim) were shown to markedly decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (23Holmuhamedov E.L. Jovanovic S. Dzeja P.P. Jovanovic A. Terzic A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1567-H1576PubMed Google Scholar). Garlid et al. (9Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Murray H.N. Darbenzio R.B. D'Alonzo A.J. Lodge N.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that KATP channel openers including diazoxide are efficient only when transmembrane mitochondrial K+ flux is inhibited by ATP and magnesium. Other authors have shown that diazoxide is able to affect the membrane potential and consequently Ca2+ uptake by isolated mitochondria in the absence of both ATP and Mg2+ (21Holmuhamedov E.L. Wang L. Terzic A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 519: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Our results clearly suggest that in the absence of exogenous ATP, modulators of KATP channels do not change the maximal glutamate + malate supported activity of in situmitochondria. These substances apparently do not affect the functional activity of cellular kinases (creatine kinase and adenylate kinase) that control the ATP/ADP ratio in the vicinity of the mitochondria and that are theoretically also able to modulate the activity of the KATP channels. One must take into account, however, that the methods used to assess the functional activity of these kinasesin situ were semiquantitative, and it is possible that these enzymes, being nonlimiting for respiration, were somehow affected by the substances tested. Even if this were the case, however, such a hypothetical inhibition would have no significant physiological effect.In the presence of exogenous ATP, however, glibenclamide significantly inhibited ADP-stimulated respiration. Evidently, this effect does not seem to be related to the activity of specific KATPchannels because diazoxide did not block such an effect of glibenclamide. As oxygen consumption by permeabilized fibers depends on the ADP/ATP ratio, in the presence of exogenous ATP any inhibition of cellular ATPase activity would slow down the respiration rate. Indeed, glibenclamide was shown to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase activity (25Ribalet B. Mirell C.J. Johnson D.G. Levin S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This could play an important role in total cellular ATPase activity when myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPases are inhibited due to low free Ca2+ concentration.In contrast to the data obtained when glutamate and malate were used as respiratory substrates, mitochondrial respiration supported by succinate was markedly inhibited by diazoxide. Interestingly, this inhibition was not dependent on the presence of ADP. Addition of glibenclamide did not block the effect of diazoxide thus suggesting again that it is not related to the KATP channel opening. Because diazoxide had no effect on (glutamate + malate)-supported respiration, it was reasonable to suggest that this substance could inhibit the oxidation of succinate. Our results are in line with those obtained by other authors (26Schäfer G. Portenhäuser R. Trolp R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1971; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27McDonald M.J. Biochem. Int. 1984; 8: 771-778PubMed Google Scholar) showing inhibition of the succinate oxidation pathway in mitochondria by diazoxide. In this context, it is interesting to mention the data obtained by Marban's group (10Liu Y. Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 28Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) concerning the effect of diazoxide on mitochondria. These authors demonstrated a considerable increase in mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence in ventricular myocytes induced by diazoxide. This effect was blocked by a high concentration (500 μm) of 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, a KATP channel antagonist, but not by glibenclamide. The authors ascribed the effect of diazoxide to a dissipation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential due to increased K+ influx. This was followed by an acceleration of the electron transfer, uncompensated by increased production of electron donors. However, our result showing inhibition of succinate-supported respiration in situ suggests that another mechanism of the flavoprotein redox state alteration may exist. By inhibiting the production of reduced equivalents, diazoxide could at least partially contribute to the elevated oxidized/reduced ratio for flavoprotein.Actually, the mechanism of the beneficial effect of diazoxide as well as other KATP channel openers is not clear. Moreover, there is not yet a clear demonstration that it is mitochondrial KATP channel opening that induces cardioprotection. Generally, such a conclusion comes from the experiments with substances known as KATP channel modulators (diazoxide, glibenclamide, 5-hydroxydecanoate), where mitochondrial channel activity itself is not determined. However, these substances may have targets other than mitochondrial KATP channels. Diazoxide, for example, is also a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (29Moore P.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1968; 150: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been shown that blockade of Ca2+ entry during diazoxide treatment of rat hearts, by inhibiting L-type Ca2+ channels with verapamil or nifedipine, completely reversed the beneficial effect of diazoxide during ischemia and reperfusion (30Wang Y. Hirai K. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effect of diazoxide is potentiated (28Sato T. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) or even mediated (30Wang Y. Hirai K. Ashraf M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Takashi E.

TNF is produced mainly by activated mononuclear phagocytes, including activated macrophages and T cells (3Jovinge S. Ares M.P. Kallin B. Nilsson J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1573-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 5Tipping P.G. Hancock W.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar), in response to inflammation, infection, and various environmental stimulations. TNF exerting a wide array of biological effects is known to be mediated through two distinct surface binding sites, a type I receptor (TNF-R1, p55–60 kDa) expressed on all cell types, and a type II receptor (TNF-R2, p75–80 kDa) expressed primarily on immune cells and macrophages (6Bazzoni F. Beutler B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). These two receptors bind TNF with high affinity but differ in their intracellular domains and thus mediate distinct cellular responses. Ligation of TNF receptor stimulates signal transduction pathways involving PI 3-kinase, PKC, MEK1, Rac1/Cdc42, PAK, ERK, JNK, and p38, etc. in various cells (7Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X.

For example, an important molecule known as TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), one of the more than 15 distinct proteins, has been identified that indirectly associated with the cytoplasmic domains of the TNF-R1 via TRADD. During the past 5 years, it has been reported that TRAF2 involves a battery of TNF-mediated signal transductions and cellular functions. Specifically, at least four proteins are associated with the cytoplasmic domains of TRAF2 that mediate rapid activation of MAPKs including JNK (10Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). In addition, another important signal transduction cascade including PKC, MEK1, and ERK can be activated through another TNF receptor-associated protein, FAN. Moreover, FAN binds to TNF-R1 at amino acids 307–321 and activates neutral sphingomyelinase activity (13Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Although TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 are independently activated in TNF signalings, the large majority of TNF-induced signaling events can be mediated solely by TNF-R1 (14Peppelenbosch M. Boone E. Jones G.E. van Deventer S.J. Haegeman G. Fiers W. Grooten J. Ridley A.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 837-845PubMed Google Scholar). Both types of TNF receptor are expressed on murine macrophage J774A.1 cells (15Kull F.C.J. Jacobs S. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5756-5760Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and we are interested in investigating the biological function and molecular mechanism for TNF receptor-mediated signaling pathways in macrophages relevant to atherosclerosis. Inflammatory cytokine TNF derived from activated macrophages plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis (5Tipping P.G. Hancock W.W. Am. J.

Specifically, TNF involved in the fatty-streak formation of atherogenesis directly and indirectly leads to the formation of advanced, complicated lipid-laden lesions of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic related vascular diseases are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized countries of the world (19Steinberg D. Gotto A.M.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 2043-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Extensive epidemiological studies in the development of human atherosclerosis, particularly the pleiotropic process in atherogenesis, remains not fully defined (16Ross R. N. Engl. J.

The plasma lipoproteins, particularly modified forms of low density lipoproteins (LDL) including oxidized LDL (OxLDL), are mainly accumulated in macrophage-derived foam cells adjacent to atherosclerotic plaque (20Steinberg D. Carew T.E. Fielding C. Fogelman A.M. Mahley R.W. Sniderman A.D. Zilversmit D.B. Circulation. 1989; 80: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Massive accumulation of foam cells in insulted blood vessels is recognized as the main damage-generating source and one of the main reasons for the development of atherosclerosis (16Ross R. N. Engl.

Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 131-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in addition to acting as the principal, inflammatory mediator of cells in the atherosclerotic plaque, they also function as scavenger cells of OxLDL. Following their migration from the blood and transformation into lipid-laden foam cells, monocyte-derived macrophages play a multifaceted role in lesion development (16Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Although the mechanisms by which macrophages transformed into foam cells are not fully characterized, both macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells overexpress macrophage scavenger receptors class A (MSR) type I and II that mediate high affinity binding and internalization of OxLDL (24Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 25Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MSR on macrophage-derived foam cells taking up oxidized LDL in human atherosclerotic lesion has been observed (18Ross R.

Both TNF production and MSR overexpression in activated macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells and the effect of TNF on MSR expression and function during atherosclerosis remain less known and studied. Specifically, the autocrine effect of TNF on MSR including activation of the signaling molecule, protein kinase, and the biological reaction related to atherosclerosis have yet to be investigated. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that TNF down-regulates MSR gene expression and protein via transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes (1Hsu H.Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, the studies of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor in reversal of the destabilizing effects of TNF on MSR message, suggest TNF-induced expression of protein(s) that accelerated MSR mRNA degradation (1Hsu H.Y.

In this report, we examined further TNF-mediated signal transductions in the regulation of MSR expression and function related to foam cell formation. Specifically, the objective of this study was to evaluate systematically the activity of TNF-mediated MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) during TNF stimulation of murine macrophage J774A.1 cells; moreover, the role of these MAPKs in the regulation of MSR expression and function were dissected. By using specific antagonism of the PKC and MEK1 with calphostin C and PD98059, respectively, in the PKC/MEK1/ERK pathway, we found that the two inhibitors blocked TNF-induced MSR expression at an early stage of TNF incubation. However, they had no reversal effect on TNF inhibition of MSR expression and function at late stage. In contrast, dominant negative mutant of JNK and specific antagonism of p38 with SB203580 reversed TNF reduction of MSR expression and function in foam cell formation. The findings support the involvement of JNK and p38 in regulating the reduction of MSR expression followed by ligation of the TNF receptors. In addition, by using a specific anti-mouse TNF-R1 agonist antibody (anti-TNF-R1 Ab), we further demonstrated that anti-TNF-R1 Ab effectively regulates MSR gene expression as well as stimulates MAPK activity (ERK, JNK, and p38) which is similar to the activity of TNF ligation-mediated transducing signals. Collectively, our current results and our previous report (1Hsu H.Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) together with the findings that TNF-R1 protects against atherosclerotic lesion development in the TNF-R1-null (p55-null) mice (17Schreyer S.A.

Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared as described (1Hsu H.Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and occasionally screened for peroxides and endotoxins. The preparation for OxLDL followed the published method as described previously (30Shinohara C. Hasumi K. Endo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL (about 2.5 mg of protein) in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 7.9 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin (buffer A) was incubated with 5 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for 48 h. OxLDL was dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl and 0.3 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for another 48 h and then filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore membrane. Total RNA was isolated from J774A.1 cells by using REZOl® C&T as per manufacturer's instruction, quantitated by A260 and A280, stored as 1 μg/μl at −80 °C, and used within 1 week. The isolated RNA was monitored by the intactness of some constitutively expressed gene GAPDH. The RT-PCR was used as described (1Hsu H.Y. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7767-7773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to detect the expression of MSR and MnSOD, respectively, in J774A.1 cells, as follows. 1 μg of RNA was mixed with 0.5 μl of 50 units/μl murine leukemia virus, 4 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, 0.5 μl of 20 units/μl RNase inhibitor, 1 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 2 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μl of 100 mmDTT, and 0.5 μl of 50 μm random hexamer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was performed at 42 °C for 30 min, at 99 °C for 5 min, and then cooled down to 4 °C for 30 min or overnight, and the product cDNA was stored at −20 °C for future PCR use. 1.5 μl of cDNA was mixed with 1.25 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 0.5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, 0.8 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 0.125 μl of 100 mm DTT, 0.25 μl of 10 pmol/μl 5′-primer and 3′-primer, and 0.125 μl of 5 units/μl AmpliTaq, then water was added to 12.5 μl for the reaction. The condition for MSR are as follows: for step 1, 94 °C, 2 min; for step 2, 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min, for 35 cycles; for step 3, 72 °C, 10 min. The conditions for MnSOD are as follows: for step 1, 94 °C, 2 min; for step 2, 94 °C, 2 min; 56 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min, for 35 cycles; for step 3, 72 °C, 10 min. The products from the PCR were examined by either 1 or 2% agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide (EtBr), and normalized by comparison to RT-PCR of mRNA of GAPDH, a constitutively expressed gene. Each EtBr-stained band was quantified using ImageQuaNT® software from a PhosphorImager® from Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA). The method for isolation of membrane protein is described elsewhere (31Persons D.A. Wilkison W.O. Bell R.M. Finn O.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 447-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, J774A.1 cells were grown in 100-mm plates to 80% confluency, washed with PBS twice, and 0.5 ml of collection buffer (CB: 20 mm HEPES, 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) was added to each plate. Cells were scraped by rubber policeman and collected into a 1.5-ml tube and broken by the sonication method (on, 3 s; off, 2 s, for 5 min). The broken cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and we saved the pellet but discarded the supernatant. 300 μl of cell lysis buffer (CB + 1% Triton X-100) was added to the pellet, mixed well, and put on and ice bath at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysed pellet was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant of membrane protein containing scavenger receptor was collected and stored at −80 °C for further Western blotting analysis. The methods for immunoblotting are described previously (32Hsu H.Y. Hajjar D.P. Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates of J774A.1 cells (25 μg of protein or as indicated) were solubilized in 10 or 12.5% of SDS-PAGE buffer. After electrophoresis, proteins on the gel were transferred to Immobilon® polyvinylidene difluoride membrane via wet transfer blotting system (Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad; transfer buffer: 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol at 250 mA for 100 min). The membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 + 1% bovine albumin, Sigma A-7030) at room temperature for 1–2 h with slow shaking. Then the membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-macrophage scavenger receptor antibody (dilution ratio 1:1,000 with 1% bovine albumin). After blotting, the membranes were washed in washing buffer (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, without 1% bovine albumin) once for 15 min followed by two washes for 5 min. The membranes were blocked again in a new blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with slow shaking and then immunoblotted with appropriate secondary antibodies in the same blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with slow shaking. The secondary antibody for MSR, a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, dilution ratio 1:1,500 with 1% bovine albumin, was used. Afterward, membranes were further washed in washing buffer once for 15 min followed by two washes for 5 min. Protein visualization on each immunoblot was developed and performed with Renaissance®, DuPont Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent, from PerkinElmer Life Sciences as described previously (32Hsu H.Y. Hajjar D.P. Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and manufacturer-provided protocols were followed. Cells were incubated with TNF or with TNF and additional chemicals, e.g. wortmannin (inhibitor of PI 3-kinase), curcumin (inhibitor of JNK), and SB203580 (inhibitor of p38) as described. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and harvested in cell lysis buffer (LB: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 205 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were left on ice for 10 min and scraped into a 1.5-ml tube, shaken for 15 s, and centrifuged (12,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein concentration of supernatant was determined, and the rest of the supernatant was saved at −80 °C for various MAPK activity assays. The methods for immunoprecipitation were as described previously with some modification (32Hsu H.Y. Hajjar D.P. Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1240-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or as described in the New England Biolabs protocols. Briefly, cell lysates stored at −80 °C as described above were normalized for protein concentration as follows: 1) for ERK activity, 200 μg of protein samples; 2) for JNK activity, 250 μg of protein samples; 3) for p38 activity, 200 μg of protein samples, respectively, and at various times were diluted with LB to 200 μl, incubated with the corresponding antibody as follows: 1) 15 μl of immobilized phospho-p44/42 MAPK (i.e. ERK, Thr-202, and Tyr-204 monoclonal antibody, 50% slurry); 2) 20 μl (2 μg) of c-Jun-(1–89) fusion protein beads; and 3) 20 μl of resuspended immobilized phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) monoclonal antibody under shaking at 4 °C for 24 h. The next day the immunoprecipitated active (phosphorylated) ERK, JNK/c-Jun complex, and p38, respectively, were microcentrifuged (12,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min, pellet washed twice with 1× LB and 1× kinase buffer (KB: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2), and then resuspended in 1× KB for the specific kinase activity assay. The manufacturer-provided protocols were followed. Briefly, 1) for ERK activity, we resuspended the immunocomplex with 50 μl of KB in the presence of 200 μm cold ATP and 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein at 30 °C for 30 min; 2) for JNK activity, we resuspended the active JNK-c-Jun complex with 50 μl of KB in the presence of 100 μm cold ATP at 30 °C for 30 min; 3) for p38 activity, we resuspended the immunocomplex with 50 μl of KB in the presence of 200 μm cold ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The individual reaction was terminated by addition of 25 μl of 3× sample buffer (SB: 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). The activity was determined by Western blotting analysis and the chemiluminescence method as described above. Specifically, 1) for ERK activity, the Elk-1 phosphorylation was measured by Western blotting of nonradioactive labeled samples using phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383) antibody. 2) For JNK activity, the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 was measured by Western blotting of nonradioactive labeled samples using phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody. 3) For p38 activity, the phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr-71 was measured by Western blotting of nonradioactive labeled samples using phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71) antibody. The individual reaction was detected by Phototope®-HRP Western Detection System via chemiluminescence. Similarly, the inhibitory effect of a specific protein kinase inhibitor on individual protein kinase was carefully monitored and examined. Measurement by PhosphorImager® of phospho-Elk-1 (Ser-383), of phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63), and of phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71) for each sample was by using Image"

Although α- and β-tubulin from Trypanosoma brucei have been well characterized, much less is known about other cytoskeleton-associated proteins in trypanosomes. Using biochemical fractionation, we demonstrate here that T lymphocyte-triggering factor (TLTF) from T. brucei is a component of the detergent-resistant and Ca2+-resistant fraction of the parasite cytoskeleton. This fraction contains the flagellar apparatus and a subset of cytoskeletal protein complexes that together function in cell motility, cytokinesis, and organelle inheritance. We also show that TLTF-related genes are present in several highly divergent eukaryotic organisms. Although the function of the corresponding proteins is not known, the mammalian TLTF-like gene (GAS11; growtharrest-specific gene 11) is up-regulated in growth-arrested cells and is a candidate tumor suppressor (Whitmore, S.

Consistent with this possibility, we show that the human GAS11 protein contains a 144-amino acid domain that co-localizes with microtubules when fused to the green fluorescent protein and expressed in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that TLTF represents a newly defined protein family, whose members contribute to cytoskeleton function in species as diverse as protozoa and mammals.

In addition to providing each cell with its unique shape and form, the cytoskeleton plays a central role in cell division, cell motility and subcellular trafficking of proteins and organelles. In most eukaryotic cells, the cytoskeleton consists of three major filament systems, microtubules, intermediate filaments, and actin microfilaments, which form an interwoven scaffolding that permeates the cytoplasmic space of the cell. In contrast, the cytoskeleton of trypanosomes is composed almost entirely of microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins and is further distinguished by the conspicuous absence of transcellular filaments (1Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Lawson D. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 49-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause African trypanosomiasis, a fatal disease commonly called African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. The two most prominent features of the trypanosome cytoskeleton are the flagellum, including the axoneme and paraflagellar rod, and a longitudinal array of cytoplasmic microtubules, collectively referred to as the subpellicular corset (2; see also Fig. 7). Two additional cytoskeletal structures observed by electron microscopy are an electron-dense filament that defines the cytoplasmic side of the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ)1 and a specialized group of four reticulum-associated microtubules adjacent to the FAZ filament (2Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3Balber A.E. Critical Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 177-201PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kohl L. Gull K. Mol. Biochem.

A, detergent-extracted cytoskeleton. The flagellum (1) and subpellicular microtubules (2) are labeled. The subpellicular microtubules are uniformly oriented with their plus-ends at the posterior of the cell (+) and their minus-ends at the anterior (−) of the cell (6Robinson D.R. Sherwin T. Ploubidou A. Byard E.H. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). B, idealized transverse section taken through the midpoint of the cell, looking from posterior to anterior. The flagellum (top) contains a typical set of “9 + 2” axoneme microtubules (7) together with a filamentous structure called the PFR (6). The PFR is connected to the axoneme and to an electron-dense filament (5) in the cytoplasm by regularly spaced cross-bridges. Immediately adjacent to this cytoplasmic filament is a specialized quartet of microtubules (3) that are subtended by a membranous tubule (4). These reticulum-associated microtubules, together with the cytoplasmic filament (5), make up a FAZ that runs from the flagellar pocket to the anterior end of the cell (2Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). C, cut-out view of the flagellar pocket area, emphasizing the cytoskeletal structures discussed in the Introduction and under “Results” and “Discussion.” The flagellar pocket (9) is formed by an invagination of the plasma membrane where the flagellum emerges from the basal body complex (8). The plasma membrane and flagellar membrane are held in close juxtaposition by electron-dense adhesion zones (10). The cytoplasmic components of the flagellum attachment zone (3, 4, and 5) extend from the flagellar pocket to the anterior end of the cell. Most subpellicular microtubules (4Kohl L. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) extend the entire length of the cell. However, the specialized quartet of FAZ microtubules (3) does not extend to the posterior side of the flagellar pocket. Although the precise location of the ends of these four microtubules is not known, they might originate from the basal body complex (dashed lines), which would give them an inverse orientation relative to the other subpellicular microtubules (2). This quartet of microtubules, together with the axoneme, paraflagellar rod, FAZ filament, and basal body complex, are resistant to detergent and Ca2+ extraction (30Robinson D. Beattie P. Sherwin T.

Science. 1988; 241: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Trypanosome α- and β-tubulin have been well characterized and are similar in sequence to those of other eukaryotes (4Kohl L. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). They are also subject to post-translational modifications that are observed in other tubulins, including acetylation, glutamylation, and reversible detyrosination (4Kohl L. Gull K. Mol. Biochem.

Despite these similarities, trypanosome microtubules exhibit a number of unusual features that make them an attractive target for the development of anti-trypanosomal drugs (1Seebeck T. Hemphill A.

These features include a highly ordered and uniformly polarized organization, extensive intermicrotubule and membrane-microtubule cross-links, and high stability at low temperatures (1Seebeck T.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Trypanosome microtubules also remain intact throughout the cell cycle (12Sherwin T. Gull K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.-Biol. Sci. 1989; 323: 573-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and are resistant to anti-microtubule agents that are effective on mammalian cells (1Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Lawson D.

Since at least some of these distinguishing features have been attributed to non-tubulin cytoskeleton-associated/microtubule-associated proteins (1Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Lawson D. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 49-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a number of biochemical and immunological approaches have been taken to identify such proteins in trypanosomes (2Gull K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 629-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 9Schneider A. Hemphill A. Wyler T. Seebeck T.

In addition to increasing our understanding of the cytoskeletal architecture of African trypanosomes, the heavy dependence of this early diverging eukaryote on microtubules for cytoskeleton function makes it likely that these efforts will facilitate the identification of novel microtubule-binding proteins (9Schneider A. Hemphill A. Wyler T. Seebeck T. Science. 1988; 241: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In previous studies (15Vaidya T. Bakhiet M. Hill K.L. Olsson T. Kristensson K. Donelson J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we showed that a fusion protein, containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to T lymphocyte-triggering factor (TLTF) from Trypanosoma brucei, is localized to punctate structures near the trypanosome flagellar pocket, a specialized invagination of the plasma membrane that forms where the flagellum emerges from the cytoplasm (16Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of TLTF identified an internal 144-amino acid domain that directs GFP to an electron-dense structure on the cytoplasmic side of the anterior flagellar pocket membrane (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analogous segment of a related human protein (GAS11) directs GFP to the extreme posterior end of the trypanosome cell (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a position that has structural features in common with the flagellar pocket (1Seebeck T. Hemphill A. Lawson D. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 49-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Hemphill A. Lawson D. Seebeck T. J. Parasitol. 1991; 77: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and corresponds to the “plus” end of the subpellicular microtubules (6Robinson D.R. Sherwin T. Ploubidou A. Byard E.H. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These results, combined with the targeting properties of TLTF targeting domain mutants, led us to suggest that TLTF interacts with the cytoskeleton (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we use biochemical fractionation to demonstrate that TLTF is associated with the trypanosome cytoskeleton. We also show that TLTF-related genes are present in a wide variety of organisms and that a related human protein (GAS11) contains a novel microtubule binding domain. Bloodstream form trypanosomes (MVAT7) (19Kim K.S. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24637-24645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were isolated with the buffy coat from the blood of an infected rat, diluted 10-fold in PBS containing 1% glucose and purified by DE52 cellulose chromatography (20Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Maintenance of insect form trypanosomes (YTAT1.1 from E. Ullu, Yale) and transient transfection with plasmids encoding GFP and TLTF-GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 1) have been described previously (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate stably transfected trypanosomes overexpressing TLTF (Fig. 2 C) or GFP (Fig. 2, A and B), YTAT1.1 trypanosomes were transfected with NotI-linearized plasmids pHD496:TLTF or pHD496:GFP, respectively, and selected for resistance to hygromycin (50 μg/ml) as described previously (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography.

To generate pHD496:GFP, the GFP coding sequence was removed from pHD:HX-GFP (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as aHindIII/BamHI fragment and inserted into theHindIII/BamHI sites of pHD496. To create pHD496:TLTF, we employed a multistep cloning strategy. The 1362-bp TLTF coding sequence has a unique HindIII site at position 1099. The last 263 bp of the TLTF coding sequence plus 120 bp of 3′-untranslated region were excised from plasmid pHD:GFP-CD (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as aHindIII/BamHI fragment and inserted into theHindIII/BamHI sites of pHD496, yielding plasmid pHD496:TLTF-CTerm. The first 1099 bp of the TLTF open reading frame was introduced into pHD496:TLTF-CTerm as follows. Polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers bearing EcoRI restriction sites was used to place EcoRI sites on both sides of the TLTF open reading frame. This polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript SK II (Stratagene), and restriction mapping was used to identify a clone in which the TLTF start codon is on the EcoRV side of the polylinker. The 5′ portion of the TLTF coding sequence was excised from this clone by digestion with HindIII. This HindIII fragment was inserted into the unique HindIII site of pHD496:TLTF-CT and checked for orientation by restriction mapping. The resulting plasmid, pHD496:TLTF, contains the entire TLTF coding sequence followed by 120 bp of the TLTF 3′-untranslated region. The sequences of all polymerase chain reaction-amplified regions and cloning site junctions were confirmed by automated fluorescent DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA sequencing facility. RNA was prepared from trypanosomes with RNeasy reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was analyzed by Northern blot analysis as described previously (22Hill K.L. Li H.H. Singer J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15060-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using32P-labeled DNA containing the entire TLTF open reading frame as a probe. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and were grown to confluence in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. DNA fragments encoding GFP or amino acids 115–258 of GAS11 fused to GFP were excised from plasmids pHD:HX-GFP and pHD:HumanHI-GFP, respectively (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These fragments were ligated into the HindIII/BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). For transfection, COS-7 cells were trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS-II (PBS containing 0.5 mmMgOAc and 0.1 mm CaCl2), and then resuspended in PBS-II at 1 × 107 cells/ml. Aliquots of 0.4 ml were placed in 0.2-cm electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) with 15 μg of plasmid DNA and electroporated with one pulse of 300 V, 250 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Transfected cells were transferred to fresh medium for 48 h and then processed for immunofluorescence. Indirect immunofluorescence assays were performed essentially as described (23Tellam J.T. James D.E. Stevens T.H. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6187-6193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in a microtubule-stabilizing buffer (24Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) prior to fixation. The monoclonal antibody E7, directed against β-tubulin, was developed by (25Chu D.T. Klymkowsky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa Department of Biological Sciences. E7 tissue culture supernatant was used at a dilution of 1:400 in PBS containing 0.1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-conjugated donkey α-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:500. Cells were visualized by laser-scanning confocal microscopy as described previously (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Omission of primary or secondary antibodies resulted in no immunofluorescence (not shown). Tubulin immunofluorescence (red) and GFP fluorescence (green) were captured on separate channels and superimposed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0.1 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Total protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (17Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-TLTF antibodies are described below. The α-BiP (26Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α-Hsp70 (cytoplasmic heat shock protein) antibodies (27McDowell M.A. Ransom D.M. Bangs J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were generously provided by J. Bangs (University of Wisconsin, Madison). The E7 α-tubulin monoclonal antibody is described above. For immunoprecipitation, procyclic trypanosomes were labeled with 100 μCi/ml 35S methionine/cysteine (Expre35S35S; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h as described (28Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After labeling, a 10-fold excess of unlabeled cysteine and methionine was added, and cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in boiling buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20), and boiled for 4 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 2 min to remove insoluble debris, and 7 × 106 cell equivalents were immunoprecipitated as described previously (29Hill K.L. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations utilized 25 μl of affinity-purified α-TLTF-TT1 or 25 μl of polyclonal α-GFP antibodies (CLONTECH). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that this quantity of α-TLTF-TT1 immunoprecipitates all TLTF in the sample (not shown). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Fractionation of hypotonically lysed trypanosomes (Fig. 3) was performed as described (26Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent-extracted cytoskeletons and Ca2+-resistant flagellar fractions (Fig. 4) were obtained according to the method of Robinson and colleagues (30Robinson D. Beattie P. Sherwin T. Gull K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All fractions were monitored by phase-contrast microscopy to ensure that lysis and detergent/CaCl2 extraction was complete. Equal cell equivalents of each fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, all antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500–1:1000.Figure 4TLTF is a component of the flagellar fraction of the trypanosome cytoskeleton. To isolate intact trypanosome cytoskeletons, whole cell lysates were prepared by extraction with 1% Nonidet P-40 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Intact cytoskeletons (P1) were separated from detergent-soluble proteins (S1) by centrifugation at 1000 ×g. These detergent-extracted cytoskeletons (P1) were further incubated with 3 mm CaCl2 to depolymerize the subpellicular cytoskeleton (30Robinson D. Beattie P. Sherwin T. Gull K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), leaving the flagellar microtubules and associated structures intact (see “Experimental Procedures”). The Ca2+-resistant flagellar fraction (P2) was separated from Ca2+-soluble proteins (S2) by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. For thetop panel, the antibody used was α-TLTF-TT1, and the positions of TLTF and the 41-kDa protein are indicated withblack and open arrowheads, respectively.

For α-TLTF-Pep4, a synthetic peptide, “Pep4” (CAAQTANIASLPRSNFE), containing the C-terminal 14 amino acids of TLTF plus two alanine spacer residues and a cysteine at the N terminus for cross-linking was synthesized by a commercial vendor, Research Genetics, Inc.

G-to-A modification in the untranslated region of exon 1 was present only in spliced HIV-1 mRNAs.

A 2-amino acid deletion in the middle of the predicted N-terminal helix (ΔQ29D30) allowed assembly of a functional V-ATPase. The results indicate that, although the N-terminal half of the G subunit is essential for V-ATPase activity, either this region is not a rigid helix or the presence of a continuous, conserved face of the helix is not essential.

V-ATPases acidify multiple compartments of the vacuolar network and, in some cells, also pump protons across the plasma membrane and out of the cytosol (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

V-ATPases are composed of two sectors: a peripheral membrane complex containing the sites of ATP binding and hydrolysis (the V1 complex) and a complex of integral membrane and tightly associated peripheral membrane proteins containing the proton pore (the V0 complex) (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 2Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol.

Recent low resolution structures of V-ATPases, derived from electron microscopy and image reconstruction, have indicated that the V1 sector is a large, rather globular complex connected to the membrane domain by at least two narrow stalks (5Wilkens S.

Nature. 1999; 401: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both the structures of the complexes and the sequences of several of the subunit genes indicate that the V-ATPases have a common evolutionary ancestor with the F-ATPases (F1F0-ATP synthases) of bacterial plasma membranes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Similar low resolution structures have been observed for F-ATPases by electron microscopy (8Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Karrasch S. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Bottcher B. Bertsche I.

The A, B, and proteolipid (c, c′, and c"") subunits of the V-ATPases have significant homology with the catalytic, regulatory, and proteolipid subunits of the F-ATPases, suggesting that the core catalytic mechanisms of the two enzyme classes probably share important properties (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 4Forgac M. J. Biol.

Comparison with the F-ATPases would indicate that the A and B (ATP binding catalytic and regulatory) subunits are present primarily in the globular head of the V-ATPases and the proteolipid subunits are embedded in the membrane (5Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The other eight subunits of the V-ATPases probably make up most of the stalk structures seen by electron microscopy (5Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). At the sequence level, these subunits are conserved among eukaryotes from yeast to plants to humans, but show limited, if any, homology with the F-ATPases (11Margolles-Clark E. Tenney K. Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These subunits are presumed to be involved in structural and functional coupling of the V1 and V0 sectors. Starting from the high resolution structure of the F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria (12Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar), major advances have been made in understanding the mechanism by which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to proton transport in F-ATPases. It is now clear that ATP hydrolysis drives rotation of the γ subunit of the F1 complex between the three different catalytic (β) subunits (13Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L.

This rotation is coupled to movement in the F0 sector that allows proton transport, although the exact mechanism of coupling is still unclear (16Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This mechanistic picture superimposes elegantly on the electron microscopic and low resolution crystallographic structures of the F1F0 complex (8Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Karrasch S. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The “central stalk” in the EM images contains the γ subunit and thus comprises the rotor, whereas the second, peripheral stalk is believed to act as a stator, which anchors the catalytic and regulatory subunits to the membrane and allows the relative rotation of the γ subunit. In the F-ATPase from Escherichia coli, the stator appears to be composed of a dimer of F0 b subunits and the F1δ subunit bound to a single α/β subunit pair (20Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Understanding the structural and functional roles of the V-ATPase stalk subunits is essential, because they may impart to V-ATPases the characteristics that distinguish them from the F-ATPases, including their activity as dedicated proton pumps rather than proton-driven ATP synthases, and their susceptibility to multiple forms of regulationin vivo. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be an excellent model system for studying the V-ATPases of all eukaryotes (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In this work, we examine the function of the yeast Vma10 protein, subunit G of the V1 sector. The yeast and bovine VMA10 genes were cloned first (21Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal halves of the G subunits were shown to have significant homology to the b subunits of F-ATPases, with the major exception that the G subunits have no transmembrane domain, whereas the b subunits of F-ATPases have at least one transmembrane domain at the N terminus (22Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hunt and Bowman (23Hunt I.E. Bowman B.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) further analyzed the regions of homology between V1 G and F0 b subunits and suggested that the N-terminal half of the G subunits may fold into an α helix in which one face is highly conserved both among G subunits and between the b and G subunits. We have addressed the functions of the N-terminal half of the yeast Vma10 protein by site-directed mutagenesis, with mutations designed to perturb and disrupt the conserved face of the predicted helix. Our results support the structural and functional importance of this region of the G subunit but indicate that it can tolerate mutations predicted to disrupt the conserved face of the α helix. Reagents for molecular biology were purchased from New England BioLabs. Concanamycin A was purchased from Wako Biochemicals. Tran35S-label and zymolyase 100T were purchased from ICN. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 (anti-myc epitope) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega. ECF substrate was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The wild-type yeast strain used was SF838-5A (24Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The congenicvma10Δ mutant contained a VMA10 allele in which the entire VMA10 open reading frame had been replaced withURA3. 2J. Liu, C. Charsky, M. Tarsio, and P. M. Kane, manuscript in preparation. The wild-type strain and vma10Δ mutant were grown in yeast extract-peptone-2% dextrose medium buffered to pH 5.0 with 50 mm sodium phosphate/50 mm sodium succinate (YEPD, pH 5.0) as described (25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-186Google Scholar). After transformation of thevma10Δ mutant with plasmids containing the wild-type or mutant gene, the cells were maintained in fully supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine (SD-leucine) (25Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-186Google Scholar). Prior to preparation of vacuoles and serial dilution for comparisons of growth rates, transformants were transferred to YEPD, pH 5.0, for growth overnight. Control experiments indicated that there was minimal plasmid loss under these conditions. The wild-type N-mycVMA10 plasmid contains a single myc epitope introduced immediately after the N-terminal methionine,2 carried in a pRS315 vector (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). A 1.5-kilobase fragment containing the N-myc VMA10 construct was excised from pRS315 with PstI and SacI and subcloned into the same sites of pALTER-1. A single-stranded DNA template was prepared using an R408 helper phage, and mutagenesis was carried out according to the manufacturer's directions. The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides are listed in Table I. All oligonucleotides were obtained from Genosys. Oligonucleotides VMA10-R25A and VMA10-Y46A also had silent mutations producing restriction enzyme sites AflII and ClaI, respectively, introduced to facilitate screening of clones. After positive identification of mutants by sequencing, the mutagenized N-mycVMA10 was excised from pALTER-1 using BamHI andXbaI and subcloned into the same sites in pRS315.VMA10-Y46A and-K55A were cloned into pRS315 usingPstI rather than BamHI and XbaI. The plasmids were transformed into SF838-5Aα vma10Δ yeast cells by the method of Elble et al. (27Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected for growth on SD-leucine medium.Figure 3Levels of V-ATPase subunits in whole cell lysates of wild-type and mutant cells. SF838-5Avma10Δ cells transformed with a low copy plasmid carrying myc-tagged wild-type VMA10 (10-myc) or myc-taggedVMA10 with the indicated mutation were grown overnight until mid-log phase in YEPD, pH 5.0, medium. A culture volume corresponding to 1 A 600 unit of each strain was removed, and cells were rapidly lysed as described (32Hallberg E.M. Shu Y. Hallberg R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3050-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies 8B1, 13D11, 7A2, and 9E10, against the 69-, 60-, 42-kDa, and myc-tagged Vma10 subunits, respectively, followed by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies, or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the 27-kDa subunit, followed by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The bound antibodies were detected using ECF substrate on a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. Lysate corresponding to 0.3 A 600 unit of the original culture was loaded for detection of the 42-kDa and myc-tagged Vma10 subunits, and lysate corresponding to 0.1A 600 units of the culture was loaded for detection of the 69-, 60-, and 27-kDa subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used for VMA10 mutagenesisOligonucleotide nameSequence (5′→3′)VMA10-E14ACCTACTACAAGCTGCAAAGGAAGCCCACGVMA10-R25AGTATCAAAGGCTGCAAAGTACAGACAAGATAAGCTTAAGCAAGCCAAVMA10-R25LGTATCAAAGGCTCTAAAGTACAGACAAGATAAGCTTAAGCAAGCCAAVMA10-E42AGATGCAGCCAAGGCAATCGACTCATACAAVMA10-Y46ACAAGGAAATCGATTCAGCCAAAATTCAAAAAGACVMA10-K50ACGACTCATACAAAATTCAG GCAGACAAGGAATTGAAGGAGVMA10-K55ACAAAAAGACAAGGAATTGGCGGAGTTTGAACAAAAGVMA10-ΔQDTCAAAGGCTAGAAAGTACAGA*AAGTTGAAGCAAGCCAAGVMA10–2xQDCTAGAAAGTACAGACAAGATCAGGATAAGTTGAAGCAAGCCAAGVMA10-ΔRQDKCGAAATAGTATCAAAGGCGAGAAAGTAC*TTGAAGCAAGCCAAGACVMA10-ΔVSCAAGCTGAAAAGGAAGCACACGAAATA*AAGGCTAGAAAGTACAGVMA10–2xVSGGAAGCCCACGAAATAGTATCAGTATCAAAGGCTAGAAAGTACAGThe base pair alterations responsible for the indicatedVMA10 mutation are shown in boldface (both copies of duplicated sequences are shown in boldface).

Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Total vacuolar protein was determined by Lowry assay (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of ATP hydrolysis at 25 °C or 37 °C were determined by the coupled enzyme assay of Lotscheret al. (30Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of 100 nm concanamycin A (31Drose S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) in the assay mixture. V-ATPase-specific hydrolysis was determined by subtracting the rate of hydrolysis in the presence of inhibitor from the rate of hydrolysis in its absence. Whole cells lysates as described by Hallberg et al. (32Hallberg E.M. Shu Y. Hallberg R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3050-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein derived from 1 A 600 unit of cells was solubilized in 100 μl of cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described (33Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblots, the 100-, 69-, 60-, and 42-kDa subunits were detected using monoclonal antibodies 10D7, 8B1, 13D11, and 7A2, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse second antibody as described (33Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The myc-tagged Vma10 protein was detected with monoclonal antibody 9E10. The 27-kDa subunit was detected with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the subunit (a generous gift from Tom Stevens) followed by goat anti-rabbit second antibody. Non-denaturing immunoprecipitations were performed as described (34Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of complexes in the different mutants was assessed by immunoprecipitation after 60 min of labeling with Tran35S-label. Disassembly and reassembly of the complexes were measured as described previously by Parra and Kane (35Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 60 min in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine, excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine were added, and then cells were transferred to YEPD, to determine the level of assembly, or YEP (yeast extract-peptone medium without added dextrose), to determine the level of disassembly, for an additional 15 min. Reassembly was induced by addition of glucose to a final concentration of 2% to cells incubated in YEP, followed by another 15-min incubation. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized and separated by SDS-PAGE as described (36Doherty R.D. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and radioactivity in the 100- and 17-kDa bands was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager. Supekova et al.(21Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) initially cloned the VMA10 genes from yeast and bovine cells and noted the homology of these subunits to the b subunit of the F0 sector of the E. coli F-ATPase. The absolute identities between the genes from the F- and V-type ATPases were not high, ranging from 17% to 31%, and the most notable difference between the b and G subunits was the absence of any predicted transmembrane domain in the G subunits (22Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hunt and Bowman (23Hunt I.E. Bowman B.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) identified regions of conservation between three V-ATPase G subunits (bovine, Neurospora crassa, and yeast) and the b subunit of the E. coli F0 complex. By modeling the N-terminal half of the b and G subunits as an α-helix, consistent with the demonstrated structure of the b subunit (48Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they showed that the conserved residues mapped predominantly to one face of the helix. In Fig. 1 A, we show a more extensive sequence comparison, including the Arabidopsis thaliana, tobacco, Manduca sexta, Caenorhabditis elegans, and human G subunit sequences along with the yeast andN. crassa G subunits and E. coli F0 b subunit. A helical wheel model of amino acids 6 through 55 of the yeast G subunit is shown in Fig. 1 B, with the circled amino acids representing those positions that are identical in at least six of the seven V-ATPase G subunits. Once again, it is clear that most conserved residues in this region of the protein map to one face of the helix. A myc-tagged version of the yeast VMA10 gene was constructed to facilitate detection of the subunit; the tagged subunit fully complemented the growth and activity defects of a vma10Δ strain (see below). To better characterize the structure and function of the yeast G subunit, we constructed several site-directed mutations in the myc-tagged VMA10 gene (10-myc). Five amino acids falling on the conserved face of the helix (Glu-14, Arg-25, Glu-42, Tyr-46, and Lys-50) and one predicted to fall on the opposite face of the helix (Lys-55) were changed to alanine. A second mutation at Arg-25, R25L, was constructed to investigate whether effects seen in the R25A mutant (see below) were attributable to the smaller size of the alanine substitution relative to the native arginine. In addition, a series of mutations designed to disrupt the conserved face of the helix by inserting or deleting 2–4 amino acids was designed. Amino acid pairs Q29D30 and V20S21 were both deleted, to form the ΔQD and ΔVS mutants, and duplicated, to form the 2xQD and 2xVS mutants, in order assess the effects of changing the “register” of the helix at two different places. In addition, a 4-amino acid deletion, removing amino acids Arg-28 to Lys-31 (ΔRQDK), was constructed. This mutation would be predicted to remove approximately one turn of an α helix, and thus would have a significant effect on the helix length but less effect on the register of the helix than the 2-amino acid deletions and insertions. The growth phenotypes of the different mutant strains are shown in Fig.2. Mutants lacking V-ATPase activity exhibit a characteristic set of growth phenotypes, including sensitivity to elevated pH and CaCl2 concentrations (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar,37Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells and vma10Δ cells carrying the N-myc-tagged wild-type VMA10 gene grow well on YEPD medium buffered to pH 5 or 7.5 as well as on YEPD, pH 7.5, containing 60 mm CaCl2. The VMA10 mutants exhibit a variety of growth phenotypes. All of the mutants grew fairly well on YEPD buffered to pH 5.0. The R25A (Fig. 2), R25L, and E42A (not shown) mutants also grew as well as wild-type (10-myc) cells on medium buffered to pH 7.5, containing 60 mm CaCl2. The E14A, K50A, and ΔQD mutants grew almost as well as did the wild-type (Fig. 2). All of the other mutants showed almost no growth on YEPD, pH 7.5, plates containing CaCl2 and thus were comparable to the untransformed vma10Δ mutant. Total protein extracts were prepared from all of the mutant strains, and the steady-state level of the myc-tagged Vma10 protein and several other V1 subunits was determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, most of the mutant strains produce near wild-type levels of the myc-tagged Vma10 protein. The steady-state levels of Vma10p appeared to be slightly lower in the 2xQD, ΔRQDK, and 2xVS mutants, but the difference in protein levels was insufficient to account for the growth defects of these mutants. Tomashek et al. (38Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the V1 subunit E (27-kDa subunit) is unstable in a vma10Δ strain, suggesting that stability of the E subunit is dependent on the presence of the G subunit. We also observed that the 27-kDa E subunit appeared to be missing in immunoblots of whole cell lysate from a vma10Δ strain (not shown). Interestingly, the 27-kDa subunit is present at low levels in both the Y46A and K55A mutants, even though the mutant G subunit is present at near-normal levels. The 69-, 60-, and 42-kDa subunits are present at very similar levels in all of the mutant strains. The apparent loss of the 42-kDa subunit from the K50A, K55A, and R25A mutants in Fig. 2 was not seen consistently. Vacuolar vesicles were prepared from all of the mutant strains. The ATPase activity in the isolated vesicles was determined by a coupled enzyme assay, and assays were conducted in the presence and absence of 100 nm concanamycin A, a specific V-ATPase inhibitor, to determine the activity specific to the V-ATPase. The results are shown in Table II. The wild-type strain (SF838-5Aα) and the congenic vma10Δ strain carrying the myc-tagged VMA10 gave comparable levels of V-ATPase activity, indicating that introduction of the myc tag did not disrupt subunit function. The E42A mutant showed levels of V-ATPase activity very similar to the myc-VMA10 strain and consistent with its wild-type growth phenotype. The levels of V-ATPase activity in the R25A and R25L mutants were consistently 15–20% higher than the activity of the corresponding wild-type (myc-VMA10) strain. In all of the other mutants, V-ATPase activity was significantly reduced. The ΔQD mutant exhibited 52% of the wild-type activity, and the K50A and K55A mutants exhibited 10.5% and 18.8% of the wild-type activity, respectively. All of the other mutants contained less than 10% of the wild-type V-ATPase activity. This was surprising, given the fact that some of these mutants appeared to be capable of complementing the growth phenotypes of the vma10Δ mutant, but we believe that this may be due to destabilization of the V-ATPase in vitro by these mutations (see below).Table IIV-ATPase activity in isolated vacuolar vesiclesStrainSpecific activitynμmol of Pi/min/mgSF838–5A2.09 ± 0.323vma10Δ/myc-VMA101.91 ± 0.2310E14A0.16 ± 0.044E42A2.08 ± 0.823Y46A0.10 ± 0.043K50A0.20 ± 0.065K55A0.36 ± 0.074R25A2.23 ± 0.585R25L2.24 ± 0.195ΔQD1.00 ± .2542xQD0.07 ± 0.044ΔRQDK0.07 ± 0.033ΔVS0.05 ± 0.0342xVS0.08 ± 0.023Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for n separate vacuole purifications.

To investigate the molecular structure and assembly of SbsB, we replaced 75 residues (mainly serine, threonine, and alanine), located throughout the primary sequence, with cysteine, which is not found in the wild-type protein. As determined by electron microscopy, 72 out of 75 mutants formed regularly-structured self-assembly products identical to wild-type, thereby proving that the replacement of most of the selected amino acids by cysteine does not dramatically alter the structure of the protein.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In two cases, the surfaces of S-layers and the constituent proteins were mapped by probing the accessibility to antibodies recognizing either S-layer-specific epitopes (15Doig P. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Trust T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 753-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or a foreign epitope, which was inserted into the S-layer protein at semirandom positions (16Bingle W.H. Nomellini J.F. Smit J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively large number of studies, little is known about the spatial location of individual residues in assembled S-layers. Knowledge about which residues are located (i) at the external surface of the S-layer lattice, (ii) at the interface between the subunits, and (iii) within the pores (Fig.1) is crucial for a better understanding of the assembly and molecular structure of S-layers. In this report, cysteine scanning mutagenesis combined with targeted chemical modification (17Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L.

Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in SbsB. SbsB is the S-layer protein of Bacillus stearothermophilus PV72/p2, a thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium (22Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7182-7189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SbsB has a molecular mass of 98 kDa and assembles into a lattice of oblique symmetry. The N terminus of SbsB (residues 34 to 212 in the preprotein sequence) encodes three S-layer homology (SLH)1 domains (11Engelhardt H. Peters J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 276-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). SLH domains were originally identified by sequence comparison (14Lupas A. Engelhardt H. Peters J. Santarius U. Volker S. Baumeister W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and have been shown to attach exoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria to the underlying cell wall (see Refs. 10Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar and11Engelhardt H. Peters J. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 276-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, and references therein). In most proteins studied so far, SLH domains specifically bind to secondary cell wall polymers (10Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and, in the case of SbsB, the polymer is composed mainly of GlcNAc and ManNAc (24Ries W. Hotzy C. Schocher I. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3892-3898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from binding the secondary cell wall polymer (10Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), the N terminus of SbsB also binds to the peptidoglycan-containing cell wall itself (25Sára M. Egelseer E.M. Dekitsch C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6780-6783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, SbsB contains a second binding region for the secondary cell wall polymer, which was mapped to amino acid positions 271–362 (25Sára M. Egelseer E.M. Dekitsch C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6780-6783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under native conditions, the N terminus (up to amino acid position 206) of SbsB can be removed by limited proteolysis, while the remainder of the SbsB polypeptide is proteolytically stable. 2Y. Wang and H. Bayley, manuscript in preparation. 2Y. Wang and H. Bayley, manuscript in preparation. A shortened version of SbsB, beginning with amino acid 200, is sufficient for S-layer formation, as studies with genetically truncated versions of SbsB have demonstrated.2 Deletions of the C terminus, however, abolish self-assembly. These data suggest the existence of a biochemically defined structural domain, which might correspond to the massive morphological domain, visible in computer-processed transmission electron micrographs of S-layer lattices from B. stearothermophilus PV72/p2 (26Ballesteros, J. A., Deupi, X., Olivella, M., Haaksma, E. E. J., and Pardo, L. (2000) Biophys. J., in press.Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to use targeted chemical modification to identify residues, which are located at the surface of the S-layer protein SbsB. By using monomeric SbsB and SbsB assembled on cell walls, we have been able to discriminate between residues which are (i) located at the surface of the monomer, (ii) positioned on the outer surface of the S-layer lattice or within the lumen of the pores, and (iii) located on the inner surface of the lattice or at the interface between assembled subunits (Fig. 1). In addition, the availability of the extensive set of surface-located cysteines will facilitate further investigations of SbsB and may allow the engineering of S-layers by targeted chemical modification to produce novel biomolecular materials. Cysteine mutations of SbsB, the S-layer protein of B. stearothermophilusPV72/p2 (23Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sára M. Kuen B. Mayer H.F. Mandl F. Schuster K.C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were made for 75 amino acid residues (31 threonine, 18 serine, 7 alanine, 5 glycine, 2 each of arginine, aspartic acid, valine, and asparagine, and 1 each of isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and lysine). The amino acids were dispersed throughout the primary sequence between positions 234 and 913 of the SbsB polypeptide. By using predominantly conservative amino acid changes (threonine, serine, and alanine), negative effects on the ability of SbsB to self-assemble were avoided. Mutation of threonine and serine also favored the identification of surface-located residues, since polar residues, such as serine and threonine, tend to be located on the surfaces of proteins (28Miller S. Janin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 29Tsai C.J. Lin S.L. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). All mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using an improved version (30Howorka S. Bayley H. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) of the recombination PCR method (31Jones D.H. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 591-601Google Scholar) with 10 PCR cycles. To facilitate the identification of cysteine mutants (see below), an NsiI restriction site (ATGCAT), which encompassed the cysteine codon (underlined), was introduced with each mutation. Isolates for mutants G273C and T617C were subjected to sequencing, which showed that no PCR errors had occurred. For the biochemical assays on the thermal stability of monomeric cysteine mutants in SDS, and on the surface accessibility of monomeric and assembled cysteine mutants by PEG-OPSS modification, two independent isolates for each mutation were used. For the electron microscopic investigation of the ability of the cysteine mutants to self-assemble, one isolate was used, unless otherwise stated. The template for the mutagenesis was pT7sbsBHis. This plasmid harbors the sbsB gene (23Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), excluding its 31-residue signal sequence, but with an additional sequence coding for a C-terminal 6xHis-tag preceded by a 15-amino acid linker (KPNSADIHHTGGRSS). The sbsB sequence in pT7sbsBHis had been amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA ofB. stearothermophilus PV72/p2. Sequencing revealed three point mutations compared with the corrected version of the published sequence of sbsB: Thr210 → Ser, Ser402 → Thr, and Lys812 → Glu. The numbers refer to the amino acid positions in the sequence of the preprotein. The corrected version of the published sequence was established after sequencing three independent isolates of the sbsB gene, which was PCR amplified from chromosomal DNA. The corrected version differed from the literature sequence (23Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at three positions (Arg139 → Ala, Gln391 → Glu, and Asp500 → Glu). All 75 SbsB cysteine mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified with Ni-NTA metal-affinity chromatography, and dialyzed to obtain self-assembly products. Unless otherwise stated, one isolate of each mutant was used. E. coli JM109(DE3) cells (Promega, Madison, WI), which had been made competent by using PEG and dimethyl sulfoxide (32Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 33Huff J.P. Grant B.J. Penning C.A. Sullivan K.F. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 570-572PubMed Google Scholar), were transformed with plasmid DNA. Bacterial cells grown in terrific broth medium (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were centrifuged, and pellets (0.35 g wet weight, corresponding to 4.5 ml of bacterial culture) were resuspended in buffer A (1 ml: 8 m urea, 0.03 mTris, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, adjusted to pH 8 with NaOH). After three freeze and thaw cycles in dry ice/ethanol the slurry was centrifuged for 20 min at 128,000 × g at room temperature. The supernatant was mixed with buffer A (400 μl) and 50% Ni-NTA-agarose (300 μl) (Qiagen, number 30210) (pre-equilibrated with buffer A). Following the manufacturers recommendations, the resin was washed and then eluted three times with buffer E (150 μl: buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole, pH 8). The three fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The first two fractions, which contained most of the S-layer protein, were combined in a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 15,000 (Spectra/Por Biotech Membranes) and dialyzed for 3 days at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1 mm DTT. The dialysis buffer was changed four times. In all cases, a white precipitate formed during the dialysis, which was analyzed by electron microscopy. Suspensions of all 75 in vivo expressed, dialyzed cysteine mutants of SbsB were examined by negative staining to visualize self-assembly products as described (35Pum D. Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5296-5303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the first isolate of one mutant did not show regular self-assembly products, two additional isolates were analyzed by electron microscopy. To obtain ultrathin sections of self-assembled Wt-SbsB, samples prepared as described in the section: “Incorporation of In Vitro Expressed SbsB Mutants into Wt-SbsB S-Layers Assembled onto Cell Wall Sacculi” were treated as reported (36Messner P. Hollaus F. Sleytr U.B. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1984; 34: 202-210Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SbsB mutants were expressed from plasmid DNA by in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) using the E. coli S30 T7 IVTT kit (Promega number L1130). The reaction volume contained the amino acid mixture minus methionine or minus cysteine (1.25 μl), premix (5 μl), and S30 mixture (3.75 μl) supplemented with 1 μg/ml rifampicin. Either 7 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1,200 Ci/mmol; corresponding to a 15 μm solution) (1 μl) or 6 μCi of [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1,000 Ci/mmol) (1 μl) and supercoiled plasmid DNA (500 ng) were added to give a final reaction volume of 12.5 μl. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then centrifuged for 5 min at 21,000 × g. The supernatant containing 35S-labeled SbsB was stored at −80 °C. Before use, the samples were thawed and centrifuged again for 5 min at 21,000 × g. An IVTT mixture containing [35S]methionine Wt-SbsB-His (70 μl) was analyzed with a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 HR 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on an ÄKTA purifier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For column washing, loading, and elution, 50 mm Na phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl was used. The absorbance of the fractions was monitored at 220 nm. The molecular weight standards used for calibration were blue dextran (M r 2,000,000), thyroglobulin (M r 669,000), ferritin (M r 440,000), aldolase (M r 158,000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, gel filtration HMW calibration kit 17-0441-01), albumin (M r 66,000) (Sigma, A-4503), and cytochromec (M r 12,400) (Sigma, C-7752). The protein in each fraction (0.5 ml) was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, taken up in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or PhosphorImager analysis (37Cheley S. Malghani M.S. Song L. Hobaugh M. Gouaux J.E. Yang J. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seventy-five [35S]methionine-labeled cysteine mutants (two independent isolates of each) were incorporated into S-layers of Wt-SbsB fromB. stearothermophilus PV72/p2 by self-assembly on peptidoglycan-containing cell wall sacculi of B. stearothermophilus of PV72/p2 (27Sára M. Kuen B. Mayer H.F. Mandl F. Schuster K.C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cysteine mutants were affinity purified by mixing IVTT mixture (12.5 μl) with 50% Ni-NTA-agarose (15 μl) (Qiagen, number 30210) and buffer A (see above), and then by following the manufacturers recommendations. Two fractions (22 μl each) were eluted with buffer E. To prepare the self-assembly products, peptidoglycan-containing cell wall sacculi (100 μg dry weight) and Wt-SbsB (25 μg, dry weight) isolated from B. stearothermophilus PV72/p2 (25Sára M. Egelseer E.M. Dekitsch C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6780-6783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were taken up in buffer E (10 μl; buffer E contains urea) and mixed with the combined eluates of the metal affinity column (approximately 5 ng of [35S]methionine-labeled cysteine mutant as determined by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis). The sample was transferred into a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut off of 15,000 (Spectra/Por Biotech Membranes) and dialyzed for 2 days at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.3 mm DTT. The dialysis buffer was changed four times. To remove excess DTT and unincorporated soluble protein, the dialysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 100 × g and the pellet washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (100 μl). The supernatants of the washing steps were pooled and retained for further analysis. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (50 μl), and used for PEG-OPSS modification as described in the section “PEG-OPSS Modification of Assembled SbsB Mutants.” For the visualization of self-assembly products by electron microscopy, samples were prepared as described above, except that the IVTT mixture was supplemented with unlabeled 15 μm methionine (1 μl) instead of radiolabeled methionine. The samples were examined as described in the section “Electron Microscopy.” To determine the extent of incorporation of each cysteine mutant into self-assembly products, the protein content of the supernatant and pellet fractions from two isolates each of all 75 mutants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The pooled washing solutions were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm (21,000 × g) and the supernatant was carefully withdrawn. Protein in the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 5%, taken up in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and analyzed along with samples of the pellet fraction by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager quantification. To assay the thermal stability of monomeric SbsB in SDS, [35S]methionine IVTT mixture (3 μl) was added to 6 × Laemmli buffer (0.35 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10.3% SDS, 30% glycerol) containing 0.1 m DTT (21 μl). Three aliquots of the solution were taken, one was left at room temperature (25 °C), and the others were incubated at 50 °C (5 min) or at 100 °C (5 min), cooled to 25 °C and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were run at 25 °C and 100 V, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. This assay was performed on two independent isolates for each mutation. Seventy-five [35S]methionine-labeled cysteine mutants (two independent isolates of each) were modified with methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) orthopyridyl disulfide,M r 5,000 (PEG-OPSS) (Shearwater Polymers, Huntsville, AL). IVTT mixture (3 μl) was diluted with 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (18 μl), followed by the addition of 2.5 mm DTT (3 μl). Three aliquots (3 × 7 μl) of this mixture were taken and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Two aliquots were chilled in an ice-water bath for 10 min, and mixed with a prechilled aqueous solution of 50 mm PEG-OPSS (2 μl). After 10 and 20 s, unreacted cysteine residues were blocked by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide (2.8 m NEM in ethanol) (2 μl). For SDS-PAGE a portion of the blocked reaction mixture (3 μl) was mixed with 6 × Laemmli buffer (8 μl) (devoid of DTT or β-mercaptoethanol) and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. To the third aliquot, 50 mm PEG-OPSS (2 μl) was added and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. A portion of this unblocked reaction mixture (3 μl) was mixed with 6 × Laemmli buffer (8 μl) (devoid of DTT or β-mercaptoethanol), heated for 5 min at 100 °C. The mixture was then supplemented with 0.5 μl of the ethanolic solution of 2.8 m NEM and heated again for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples (5 μl) were separated by SDS-PAGE for autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. [35S]Methionine-labeled cysteine mutants which had been incorporated into S-layers of Wt-SbsB from B. stearothermophilus PV72/p2 and assembled onto peptidoglycan-containing cell wall sacculi of B. stearothermophilus of PV72/p2 (see section “Incorporation ofIn Vitro Expressed SbsB Mutants into Wt-SbsB S-Layers Assembled onto Cell Wall Sacculi”) were modified with PEG-OPSS. The assay was performed on two independent isolates for all mutations. A freshly prepared suspension of cell wall sacculi with bound Wt-SbsB S-layer doped with a radioactively labeled mutant (30 μl) was mixed with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (9 μl), and 2.5 mm DTT (3 μl). Three aliquots (3 × 14 μl) of the mixture were prepared, and treated and analyzed as described in the section, “PEG-OPSS Modification of Monomeric SbsB Mutants.” The properties of 75 cysteine mutants of SbsB are reported here. With the exception of mutant R79C, the mutations were dispersed throughout the primary sequence between amino acid positions 234 and 913 of the 920-residue SbsB polypeptide. The numbers refer to the amino acid positions in the sequence of the preprotein (23Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were derived from Wt-SbsB-His, which lacks the 31-amino acid signal peptide, but carries a 6xHis tag at the C terminus attached through a 15-amino acid linker. The sequence of Wt-SbsB-His differs from the natural sequence at three codons altered by PCR errors: Thr210 → Ser, Ser402 → Thr, Lys812 → Glu. Electron microscopy showed that neither the C-terminal 6xHis tag nor the three point mutations changed the ability of the S-layer protein to self-assemble (Fig. 3 B). In the following, Wt-SbsB-His refers to this sequence. The S-layer protein SbsB isolated fromB. stearothermophilus PV72/p2 is referred to as Wt-SbsB. For the scanning mutagenesis, the residues alanine, serine, and threonine were the primary choices for the mutation to cysteine, thereby producing conservative changes that would not disrupt the native structure of SbsB. This selection was also intended to increase the likelihood of finding surface accessible residues, since polar residues, such as serine and threonine, tend to be located at the surface of proteins (28Miller S. Janin J. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 641-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 29Tsai C.J. Lin S.L. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). All 75 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR-based protocol featuring a low number of PCR cycles. Sequencing of single isolates of two different mutants showed that no PCR errors had occurred. To ease the identification of positive clones, anNsiI restriction site (ATGCAT), which encompassed the cysteine codon (underlined), was introduced with each mutation. For all mutants at least two independent isolates were generated. For the biochemical assays on the thermal stability of monomeric cysteine mutants in SDS, and on the surface accessibility of monomeric and assembled cysteine mutants by PEG-OPSS modification, two independent isolates for each mutation were used. For the assay on the ability of the cysteine mutants to self-assemble as determined by negative staining and electron microscopy, one isolate was used, unless otherwise stated. SDS-PAGE confirmed that His-tagged SbsB mutants were expressed at high levels in vivo (Fig.2 A, lane 1) and could be quantitatively removed from the cell lysate by binding to Ni-NTA resin, as exemplified by mutant G273C (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). All mutants were expressed and purified, yielding similar protein concentrations in the eluates from Ni-NTA resin, as shown for 13 different mutants (Fig. 2 B). The average total protein yield after three elutions was approximately 8 mg of SbsB protein from 4.5 ml of bacterial culture. The purified mutants were all dialyzed under the same conditions. During dialysis a white precipitate formed. To test whether self-assembly products had been formed, the precipitates of all 75 mutants were analyzed by electron microscopy following negative staining. For example, the electron micrograph of the precipitate from mutant T315C (Fig. 3 A) shows a regular pattern with oblique lattice symmetry characteristic of Wt-SbsB-His self-assembly products (Fig. 3 B). In summary, 72 out of 75 mutants had the ability to form self-assembly products like Wt-SbsB-His (Table I). Therefore, in most cases, the mutation does not dramatically alter the structure of the protein, even though the substitution to cysteine is often accompanied by a second, conservative 3The following amino acid changes were considered conservative: alanine, serine, threonine to cysteine; alanine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine to isoleucine; aspartic acid to glutamic acid; alanine to methionine; phenylalanine to leucine. All other amino acid changes were non-conservative. amino acid replacement to allow the introduction of an NsiI restriction site (ATGCAT; cysteine codon underlined). In some cases non-conservative amino acid replacements were deliberately generated to probe the conformational toleranc"

Multiple putative phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence led us to investigate whether phosphorylation effects the specificity and/or the kinetics of substrate cleavage. Only protein kinase A (PKA) treatment resulted in serine phosphorylation with a stoichiometry of 1.11 ± 0.12 mol of phosphate/mol of recombinant rat EP24.15. Mutation analysis of each putative PKA site, in vitro phosphorylation, and phosphopeptide mapping indicated serine 644 as the phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation effects on catalytic activity were assessed using physiological (GnRH, GnRH1–9, bradykinin, and neurotensin) and fluorimetric (MCA-PLGPDL-Dnp and orthoaminobenzoyl-GGFLRRV-Dnp-edn) substrates. The most dramatic change upon PKA phosphorylation was a substrate-specific, 7-fold increase in both K m andk cat for GnRH. In both rat PC12 and mouse AtT-20 cells, EP24.15 was serine-phosphorylated, and EP24.15 phosphate incorporation was enhanced by forskolin treatment, and attenuated by H89, consistent with PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Cloning of the full-length mouse EP24.15 cDNA revealed 96.7% amino acid identity to the rat sequence, and conservation at serine 644, consistent with its putative functional role. Therefore, PKA phosphorylation is suggested to play a regulatory role in EP24.15 enzyme activity. The metalloendopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15(EP24.15) is a neuropeptide-metabolizing enzyme expressed predominantly in brain, pituitary, and testis, and is implicated in several physiological processes and diseases. Multiple putative phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence led us to investigate whether phosphorylation effects the specificity and/or the kinetics of substrate cleavage. Only protein kinase A (PKA) treatment resulted in serine phosphorylation with a stoichiometry of 1.11 ± 0.12 mol of phosphate/mol of recombinant rat EP24.15. Mutation analysis of each putative PKA site, in vitro phosphorylation, and phosphopeptide mapping indicated serine 644 as the phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation effects on catalytic activity were assessed using physiological (GnRH, GnRH1–9, bradykinin, and neurotensin) and fluorimetric (MCA-PLGPDL-Dnp and orthoaminobenzoyl-GGFLRRV-Dnp-edn) substrates. The most dramatic change upon PKA phosphorylation was a substrate-specific, 7-fold increase in both K m andk cat for GnRH. In both rat PC12 and mouse AtT-20 cells, EP24.15 was serine-phosphorylated, and EP24.15 phosphate incorporation was enhanced by forskolin treatment, and attenuated by H89, consistent with PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Cloning of the full-length mouse EP24.15 cDNA revealed 96.7% amino acid identity to the rat sequence, and conservation at serine 644, consistent with its putative functional role. Therefore, PKA phosphorylation is suggested to play a regulatory role in EP24.15 enzyme activity. endopeptidase EC3.4.24.15 N-[1-(RS)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Phe-p-aminobenzoate casein kinase II dinitrophenyl gonadotropin-releasing hormone N-[2((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide-HCl endoproteinase Lys-C matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization-time of flight 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl neurotensin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cAMP-dependent protein kinase protein kinase C orthoaminobenzoyl-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Val-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-ethylenediamine 7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-d-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) Intracellular communication is a vital regulator of the fundamental processes of metabolism, growth, and differentiation in all organisms. Neuropeptides are involved in autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine signaling allowing cells to communicate without necessarily requiring close synaptic proximity (1Hardie D.G. Biochemical Messengers: Hormones, Neurotransmitters, and Growth Factors. Chapman and Hall, London1992Google Scholar). Neuropeptides are unique from other neurotransmitters in that peptides lack classical reuptake mechanisms for recycling components into the cell and terminating action. Instead, neuropeptide-metabolizing enzymes are required to extinguish the signaling action of neuropeptides. The zinc metalloendopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15(EP24.15)1 exhibits characteristics of both metabolizing and processing enzymes, and has multiple peptide substrates. One substrate, GnRH, is of critical physiological importance in reproduction. Inhibition of EP24.15 activity has been demonstrated in vivo in rat models resulting in an increased half-life of the hormone by decreased GnRH degradation and subsequent augmentation of the luteinizing hormone surge (2Lasdun A. Reznik S. Molineaux C.J. Orlowski M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 437-439Google Scholar, 3Lasdun A. Orlowski M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 1265-1271PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wu T.J.

Other important EP24.15 substrate targets include neurotensin, where inhibition of EP24.15 in mice prolonged forepaw licking latency (5Vincent B. Jiracek J. Noble F. Loog M. Roques B. Dive V. Vincent J.P. Checler F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 334: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), bradykinin (6Orlowski M. Michaud C. Chu T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 80-88Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), somatostatin1–14 (7Dahms P. Mentlein R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and nociceptin (8Montiel J.-L. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Noble F. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). EP24.15 also processes Met- and Leu-enkephalin from the enkephalin-containing peptides (9Chu T.G. Orlowski M. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the specific EP24.15 inhibition increased Met-enkephalin antinociception in rodents (10Kest B. Orlowski M. Bodnar R.J. Psychopharmacology. 1992; 106: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The enzyme has also been implicated in regulation of the cleavage of amyloid-β peptide (11Yamin R. Malgeri E. Sloane J.A. McGraw W.T. Abraham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18777-18784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the aberrant processing of which has been linked to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The regulation of EP24.15 action upon its substrates is achieved by unique elements such as thiol activation (12Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A. Tullai J.W. Margulies E.H. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17395-17399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Another regulatory mechanism may be phosphorylation, which represents an important means of neural extracellular signal transduction and biological response modulation (13Nestler E.J. Greengard P. Nature. 1983; 305: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Indeed, modulation of protease activity by phosphorylation has been demonstrated in proteasomes (14Mason G.G.F. Kendil K.B. Rivett A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and more recently, in the caspase family of proteases (15Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S.

Blood. 1998; 92: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest, treatment of rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) by a cAMP analogue decreased the specific activity of soluble EP24.15 (17Ferro E.S. Tambourgy D.V. Abreu P.A. Camargo A.C. Raw I. Ho P.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This would suggest modulation of EP24.15 protein by PKA phosphorylation, or by another kinase activated through PKA (18Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10305-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Indeed, the amino acid sequence of EP24.15 contains PKA, CKII, and PKC consensus phosphorylation motifs (20Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme may be a kinase substrate in mammalian cells. To build on the indirect observation of possible kinase influences on EP24.15 activity in rat PC12 cells (17Ferro E.S. Tambourgy D.V. Abreu P.A. Camargo A.C. Raw I. Ho P.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the role of phosphorylation upon EP24.15, specifically examining its effect on neuropeptide hydrolysis. Similarly, it would be important to determine if phosphorylation is a conserved event in other neuroendocrine/peptide hydrolysis model systems, such as in AtT-20 mouse pituitary cells. Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Rat EP24.15 (accession number P24155) was expressed and purified, and site-directed mutagenesis performed using the EP24.15 expression vector, GEX-24.15 (21Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 296-316Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as described previously (12Shrimpton C.N. Glucksman M.J. Lew R.A. Tullai J.W. Margulies E.H. Roberts J.L. Smith A.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16003-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic codon usage rules were used to prevent the use of rare codons that may hinder expression of the mutant proteins as follows: S98A (ACATCCGCGCAGCCGCCACAGAGGCTGACAAG), S106A (CTGACAAGAAGCTCGCAGAGTTTGATGTGG), S172A (TCAAGAAGAGGCTGGCCCTGCTGTGCATC), S288A (GAACATGGCCAAGACCGCTCAGACAGTAGCCACC), S398A (GACGTGCGGCTGTACGCCGTGCGTGACGCCG), S522A (GCCACTGATGCGCATGGCCCAGCATTACCG), and S644A (CATGGATTACCGGACCGCCATCCTGAGGCCG). At least two independent preparations of wild type protein and each mutant were purified and characterized, with similar homogeneity, yields, and kinetic parameters. Proteins were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C for subsequent analyses. Samples for SDS-PAGE were heated in 2 × sample buffer at 65 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Native gels were run similarly except SDS and β-mercaptoethanol were omitted from both the sample buffer and the polyacrylamide gel, and samples were not heated. After electrophoresis, the gels containing radiolabeled EP24.15 were exposed to film or to a phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for quantitation. 5–30 units of PKA/μg of EP24.15 (1 unit = amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 nmol of phosphate to Kemptide substrate LRRASLG in 1 min at 30 °C; PKA catalytic subunit, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were incubated in PKA reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). Kemptide (LRRASLG) served as positive control. 50–300 units of CKII/μg of EP24.15 (1 unit = amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 pmol of phosphate to RRREEETEEE peptide in 1 min at 30 °C; New England BioLabs) were incubated in CKII reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The peptide RRREEETEEE served as positive control. PKC was purified from Rat 6 fibroblast cell lines overexpressing PKC ε (calcium independent) or PKC β (calcium dependent) (gift of Dr. Robert Krauss, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and assays were performed as described elsewhere (24Cacace A.M. Guadagno S.N. Krauss R.S. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2095-2104PubMed Google Scholar, 25Krauss R.S. Guadangno S.N. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 1: 3117-3129Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), using 3 μg of EP24.15; each condition was assayed in triplicate. EGF receptor peptide (RKRTLRRL) served as positive control. Each kinase was incubated with or without 200 μm ATP (800 μm ATP for PKC assays) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), with the addition of trace amounts (0.04 mCi, 3000 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA). Under the assay conditions, there was no incorporation in the absence of kinase. Reactions for time course experiments were terminated by the addition of equal volumes of 0.5 mm EDTA (to prevent chemical, non-enzymatic phosphorylation from occurring upon heating) (26Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 32-33Google Scholar), sample loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to film or to a phosphorscreen for PhosphorImager analyses. Prior to inactivation of the kinase assays (described above), a 2-μl aliquot was spotted onto P81 cellulose phosphate paper (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) (representing total counts). The sample was allowed to dry, washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid (specific incorporation) (4 × 25 ml, where no more label was eluted), counted, and moles of phosphate incorporated per mole of EP24.15 ± S.E. calculated. To ensure phosphorylation saturation, controls included: decreasing substrate concentration, increasing kinase concentrations, increasing ATP concentration, and examining time course reactions by PhosphorImager analyses for time-dependent saturation of signal. There was no incorporation in the absence of kinase. Additionally, after saturation of phosphate incorporation (90 min, 10 units of PKA), an additional 10 units of PKA was added, demonstrating that saturation was not due to kinase depletion. EP24.15 enzymatic activity was determined under discontinuous assay conditions with the quenched fluorescent substrate QFS (27Crack P.J. Wu T.J. Cummins P.M. Ferro E.S. Tullai J.W. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Brain Res. 1999; 835: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and QF7 (28Juliano L. Chagas J.R. Hirata I.Y. Carmona E. Sucupira M. Oliveira E.S. Oliveira E.B. Camargo E.C.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 173: 647-652Google Scholar), as described previously with modifications. The non-phosphorylated EP24.15 enzyme (control) used for all kinetic determinations underwent identical kinase reaction conditions (described above), except that ATP was excluded. All determinations were done using two independent protein preparations and two independent phosphorylation reactions. Total substrate hydrolysis was less than 10%. 6.8 ng of EP24.15 (either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated) was incubated at 37 °C with varying amounts of QFS or QF7 (4.4–17.6 μm) in a final volume of 635 μl. Kinetic parameters (K m, V max,k cat, andk cat/K m) were evaluated using the double-reciprocal plot method of Lineweaver and Burk (29Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7963) Google Scholar). EP24.15 activity was determined under discontinuous assay conditions by quantification of substrate product peaks via high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (22Cummins P.M. Pabon A. Margulies E.H. Glucksman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16003-16009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with modifications. 5–40 ng of EP24.15 (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) was incubated at 37 °C with varying concentrations of peptide substrate (11.2 μm to 1 mm for GnRH, 10–100 μm for GnRH1–9 and NT, and 2–100 μm for bradykinin and bradykinin-amide). For NT assays, both cleavage products, NT1–8 and NT9–13, were used as standards. Total substrate hydrolysis was less than 10%. Kinetic parameters were evaluated using Lineweaver and Burk plots (29Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7963) Google Scholar). The inhibition constant of EP24.15 for the specific active site-directed inhibitor, cFP-AAF-pAB, was determined with 25 ng of EP24.15 (either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated) incubated at 37 °C with QFS (4.4 μm final concentration) and varying concentrations of cFP-AAF-pAB (0–100 nm) in reaction buffer (125 mm NaCl, 0.3 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) in a final volume of 635 μl. Reactions were terminated after 30 min by the addition of 115 μl of 0.5 m sodium formate, pH 3.5. EP24.15 activities were determined as described above and the inhibition constant or K i for phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enzyme was evaluated using the method of Dixon (30Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1959; 55: 170-171Crossref Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (grown as described previously, Ref. 17Ferro E.S. Tambourgy D.V. Abreu P.A. Camargo A.C. Raw I. Ho P.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells (grown as described previously, Ref. 31Ferro E.S. Tullai J.W. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were cultured in 6-well plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) until 70% confluent, serum-deprived for 10 h in phosphate-free media (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), and incubated in pregassed phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 6 h. For kinase activation/inhibition experiments, 100 μm forskolin (7β-acetoxy-1α,6β,9α-trihydroxy-8,13-epoxy-labd-14-en-11-one) was added 30 min prior to harvesting, and 20 μm H89 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), a PKA-selective inhibitor, was preincubated on cells for 4 h prior to forskolin activation, respectively. EP24.15 was then immunoprecipitated as described previously (31Ferro E.S. Tullai J.W. Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with the modification of RIPA buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 nm fenvalerate, 1 nm Microcystin-LR) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) in the presence of 25 μl of the affinity purified anti-EP24.15 antibody (21Glucksman M.J. Roberts J.L. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 296-316Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation reactions were electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to film or phosphorscreen for further quantitation. Immunoprecipitated, 32P-labeled EP24.15 from either PC12 or AtT-20 cells, and in vitro PKA phosphorylated EP24.15 was extracted from SDS-PAGE gels (26Van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 32-33Google Scholar). 200 μl of 6m HCl was added, tubes purged with nitrogen gas, capped, and then incubated at 110 °C for 1 h (32Niedbalski J.S. Ringer D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The hydrolyzed samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation. Hydrolyzed amino acids were mixed with phosphoamino acid standards (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P)) (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH). Samples were spotted on 20 × 20-cm2 cellulose TLC plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ), dried, and run at least 15 cm in a proprionic acid, 1 mNH4OH, isopropyl alcohol (45:17.5:17.5) solvent system (33Neufeld E. Goren H.J. Boland D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Amino acid standards were visualized using a ninhydrin spray (0.25% in acetone), and experimental phosphoamino acids visualized by autoradiography. In vitro phosphorylated EP24.15 was separated from free [γ-32P]ATP by Sephadex G75 gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Crystalline cyanogen bromide was prepared in 70% trifluoroacetic acid, and cleavage performed (34Smith B.J. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology: Basic Protein and Peptide Protocols. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 297-309Google Scholar). Cleavage fragments were chromatographed on an analytical (0.6 × 50 cm) Bio-Gel P10 Fine (Bio-Rad) column eluted isocratically in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) under denaturing conditions at 0.5 ml/min, 0.5-ml fractions were collected and radioactivity quantitated in a scintillation counter. Mass estimates of cleavage fragments were deduced by a plot of the relative elution constant (v e/v o)versus log(MW) of calibrated molecular weight standards prior to, and after the sample was chromatographed. Trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) were reconstituted and incubated (as per the manufacturer's instructions) with in vitro phosphorylated EP24.15. The digested (phospho)peptides were desalted using a ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA), divided into aliquots, and resuspended in 5 μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitirile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, with angiotensin as an internal standard. To further enhance detection of phosphorylated peptides, a portion of the peptide mixture was dissolved in a 1:1 1 mm ammonium citrate/matrix solution (35Asara J.M. Allison J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Analyses were performed at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University Protein Facility (directed by Dr. Mary Ann Gawanowicz) on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE RP, PE-PerSeptive Biosystems) in the linear mode. Each mass spectrum was averaged from a minimum of 300 measurements. Controls for the cleavage of phosphorylated peptides included, in parallel, PKA without ATP added to EP24.15, and PKA alone to determine background signal. Only unique fragments generated upon phosphorylation of EP24.15 were considered in the analyses. Proteolytic cleavage sites used for mapping and miscuts were generated by the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (36Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 37Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Link A.J. 2-D Proteome Analysis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 531-552Google Scholar). A λ ZapII mouse pituitary cDNA library was purchased (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing ∼1.5 × 106recombinants and was screened as described previously with modifications (38Pierotti A. Dong K. Glucksman M.J. Orlowski M. Roberts J.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10323-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After plaque formation, plates were overlaid first with one nitrocellulose filter (BA82 Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), for 1 min, and then a second filter was placed for 2 min. These duplicate filters were probed with the entire coding sequence for the rat EP24.15 cDNA (36Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), labeled by random priming (Rediprime II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were washed stringently to 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C. From the first screen (∼2.8 × 106 plaques), 27 positive plaques were identified. Subsequent rescreening produced 14 positive plaques which were purified, and placed through a tertiary screen. Bluescript plasmid containing the cloned inserts were excised by superinfection with R408 helper phage (36Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). cDNA inserts ranged in size from 1.1 to 2.3 kilobases. Restriction analysis and probing with 5′ and 3′ random primed labeled cDNA fragments indicated that one of the clones contained a full-length insert. This clone was sequenced in both directions using the ABI Bigdye terminator sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, South Plainfield, NJ). Data were analyzed using ABI Sequencing Analysis 3.3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and Sequencher 3.1.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI) computer programs. Sequence alignments were made with the CLUSTAL program (39Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Examination of the EP24.15 primary sequence revealed putative consensus phosphorylation sites (20Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), including those for PKA, PKC, and CKII (refer to Fig. 5). These motifs suggested that EP24.15 could be a potential substrate for phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, rat recombinant EP24.15 and control substrates were incubated with various protein kinases. Whereas the incubation of EP24.15 with PKC (both β and ε isotypes) and CKII did not cause incorporation of phosphate into the protein (versus positive control subtrates) (Fig.1 A), incubation with PKA yielded a rapid and saturable incorporation of phosphate at the correct mass of 77 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The phosphorylated residue was confirmed to be serine by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig.1 C). This incorporation yielded an overall stoichiometry of 1.11 ± 0.12 mol of phosphate/mol of EP24.15, consistent with one primary site of phosphate incorporation. A time course of phosphorylation performed (see “Experimental Procedures”) from 15 to 240 min indicated that saturation of incorporated label occurred within 90 min (data not shown) under the assay conditions. To ensure saturable labeling conditions, components of the kinase reaction were varied in an attempt to increase the molar ratio (TableI). Doubling the ATP concentration, PKA concentration, and priming the reaction with additional PKA at 90 min did not effect the stoichiometry of the reaction. These results suggested that the system was at saturation for subsequent kinetic analyses.Figure 1EP24.15 is a substrate for PKA phosphorylation.

The possibility that PKA phosphorylation of EP24.15 may effect kinetic parameters toward various substrates was examined. A significant 46% decrease in the specificity constant was observed for the QF7 fluorimetric substrate (18 × 105m−1 s−1 versus 10 × 105m−1 s−1,n = 4, p < 0.05) upon PKA phosphorylation. Another fluorimetric substrate was examined (QFS, see Table II), and following phosphorylation, a 44% decrease in the specificity constant (k cat/K m) was observed, nearly identical to the result seen with QF7. Similarly, a 38% decrease in the specificity constant was observed for GnRH1–9 (p < 0.09). The specificity constant of neurotensin also decreased, and indicated the same trend, but was not significant.Table IIEP24.15 kinetic parameters for various substrates upon in vitro PKA phosphorylationSubstrateSequenceEP24.15K mV maxk catk cat/K mμMpmol/min/ngs −1105M−1s−1QFSMca-PL:GPDL-DnpNP 2-aNP, not phosphorylated.8.9 ± 3.01.0 ± 0.151.3 ± 0.201.5P 2-bP, phosphorylated.12 ± 3.00.74 ± 0.071.0 ± 0.110.82GnRH1–9pGlu-HWSY:GLRPNP5.7 ± 0.75.6 ± 0.687.2 ± 0.6013P7.3 ± 1.0 2-cp < 0.05.4.5 ± 0.425.7 ± 0.507.8 2-dp < 0.09.GnRHpGlu-HWSY:GLRPG-NH2NP240 ± 942.5 ± 0.453.2 ± 0.600.13P1700 ± 340 2-ep < 0.01.17 ± 0.01 2-ep < 0.01.21 ± 0.01 2-ep < 0.01.0.13NTpGlu-LYENKPR:RPYILNP3.8 ± 1.44.7 ± 1.16.1 ± 1.35.8P4.8 ± 0.54.1 ± 0.995.3 ± 1.34.0GnRH, GnRH1–9, and QFS assays are outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” QFS and NT are n=2 (± S.E.) independent determinations.

Using the Pichia pastoris expression system, we now observe that, although mutants E3A (Glu-3 → Ala) or Δ(3–18) of L-CPT I have markedly lowered sensitivity to malonyl-CoA compared with the wild-type protein, the mutant Δ(1–82) generated an enzyme that had regained much of the sensitivity of wild-type CPT I. This suggests that a region antagonistic to malonyl-CoA sensitivity is present within residues 19–82 of the enzyme. This was confirmed in the construct Δ(19–30), which was found to be 50-fold more sensitive than wild-type L-CPT I. Indeed, this mutant was >4-fold more sensitive than even the native muscle (M)-CPT I isoform expressed and assayed under identical conditions. This behavior was dependent on the presence of Glu-3, with the mutant E3A-Δ(19–30) having kinetic characteristics similar to those of the E3A mutant. The increase in the sensitivity of the L-CPT I-Δ(19–30) mutant was not due to a change in the mechanism of inhibition with respect to palmitoyl-CoA, nor to any marked change of the K0.5 for this substrate. Conversely, for M-CPT I, a decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity was invariably observed with increasing deletions from Δ(3–18) to Δ(1–80). However, deletion of residues 3–18 from M-CPT I affected the Km for carnitine of this isoform, but not of L-CPT I. These observations (i) provide the first evidence for negative determinants of malonyl-CoA sensitivity within the amino-terminal segment of L-CPT I and (ii) suggest a mechanism for the inverse relationship between affinity for malonyl-CoA and for carnitine of the two isoforms of the enzyme.

Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the formation of acylcarnitines from long-chain acyl-CoA esters, thus enabling the movement of acyl moieties across intracellular membranes. CPT I exists in two isoforms (Liver andMuscle), which have considerable sequence similarity but differ greatly, and inversely, in their malonyl-CoA sensitivity andKm for carnitine (3McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 4Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is a polytopic protein, with two transmembrane (TM) segments and amino and carboxyl segments (approximately 46 and 652 residues, respectively) that are both exposed on the cytosolic aspect of the membrane (5Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the extreme amino terminus of the nascent L-CPT I is retained in the mature protein (6Kolodziej M.P. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and, moreover, that it is essential for the expression of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (5Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Zammit V.A. Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequent work with expressed CPT I constructs has confirmed these conclusions by showing that deletion of the amino-terminal highly conserved 6 amino acid residues of the L-isoform results in the loss of high affinity malonyl-CoA sensitivity (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Glu-3, and to a much lesser extent His-5, have been identified as residues within the extreme amino terminus that enable L-CPT I to bind malonyl-CoA with high affinity (9Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the E3A (Glu-3 → Ala) mutant loses malonyl-CoA sensitivity, although it has not been ascertained whether this residue contributes directly to a malonyl-CoA binding site or is required to enable the amino-terminal segment to interact effectively with the much larger carboxyl-terminal segment and maintain it in a conformation that binds malonyl-CoA optimally. That interaction between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal segments is important for the expression of malonyl-CoA sensitivity in the L-isoform was demonstrated by work in which chimeras were constructed using combinations of three segments (amino-terminal plus TM1, loop plus TM2, and carboxyl-segment) from each of L- and M-CPT I (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The precise amino-to-carboxyl pairings affected the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA and the Km for palmitoyl-CoA of the chimeric CPTs, whereas TM1-TM2 pairings affected the affinity for carnitine (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These studies highlighted our long-standing observations on the importance of the interaction of CPT I with the membrane, of which it is an integral protein, for the expression of its kinetic characteristics (12Zammit V. Corstorphine C. Kolodziej M. Fraser F. Lipids. 1998; 33: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Kolodziej M.P. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and which more recently have been confirmed by work on the reconstitution of the solubilized or purified recombinant protein in vesicles of different lipid molecular order (14Zhu H. Shi J. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 239: 498-502Google Scholar, 15McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Larger truncations extending into the protein sequence from the amino terminus of L-CPT I have, in general, shown that there is very little additional loss of either malonyl-CoA sensitivity or maximal activity compared with those already achieved in the Δ(2–6) or E3A mutants (9Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the observations made by two groups independently on the Δ(1–82) mutant of rat L-CPT I (which is active and can be considered to be the catalytic core) are at variance with each other. Thus, whereas in work by Esser et al. (16Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it was shown that this construct has considerable residual malonyl-CoA sensitivity, Shiet al. (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) could not detect any malonyl-CoA binding to a mitochondrial fraction of yeast in which the mutant was expressed, and the IC50 for malonyl-CoA was much higher than that for the parental L-CPT I. Unfortunately, these two sets of studies were performed using different yeast expression systems (Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Esser et al. (16Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Pichia pastoris in Shi et al. (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) such that a strict comparison of the two sets of data is not possible. However, we made preliminary observations on the Δ(1–82) mutant expressed in P. pastoris, which suggested that, not only is the protein expressed by this construct sensitive to malonyl-CoA but it is highly significantly more so than the E3A mutant expressed in the same yeast expression system. This observation raised the prospect that the amino-terminal segment of L-CPT I may contain two types of elements: those that are positive for malonyl-CoA sensitivity (i.e. the extreme amino terminus) and those that are negative (i.e. sequences between the highly conserved amino terminus and residue 82). Therefore, we have generated internal deletions, within the 46-residue cytosolic amino-terminal segment, but with the retention of the fully conserved residues 1–18. We find that these internal deletions result in a 50-fold increase in the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the relevant L-CPT I mutants, suggesting that, in addition to containing regions that are essential for malonyl-CoA sensitivity, the amino-terminal segment also contains other regions that strongly affect this parameter negatively. Of the many mutants of CPT I studied by various workers, these are the first to express a much more malonyl-CoA-sensitive enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll materials were obtained as described previously (11Jackson V.N.

Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except where detailed. L-Δ(1–82) was generated by digesting L-CPT I in pGAPZ with Csp45I and SphI. Following removal of the smaller restriction fragment, T4 DNA polymerase was used to convert the overhangs to blunt ends, and the plasmid was recircularized. The L-Δ(19–30) deletion mutant was generated by using two overlapping PCRs as described previously (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide pairs A and B, and C and D (see Table I) were used for the two half reactions, followed by A and D for the final PCR. The L-Δ(19–46) construct was generated in the same way using primer pairs A and E, and F and D, followed by A and D. In both cases, the PCR products were cleaved with Csp45I and AflII and used to replace the corresponding fragment of wild-type L-CPT I with an introduced silent AflII site (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) cloned into the vector pGAPZ A. The E3A variants of full-length L-CPT I and the two deletion mutants were generated by PCR using primers G and H, with the appropriate clone as template in each case. Again the PCR products were inserted into CPT I asCsp45I-AflII fragments. L- Δ(3–18) was generated using self-annealing overlapping oligonucleotides I and J. The oligonucleotides were annealed and extended using T4 DNA polymerase. The product was cleaved with NotI and BglII and cloned into CPT I in pGAPZ.Table IOligonucleotides used to generate site-directed mutantsATCTGTTCGAAGATGGCAGAGGCTCACCBCGACAGGCAGATGCCATCGGGGGCACCCCCGATGGCATCTGCCTGTCGGGGDAGATCTTGGTGCTGCGGCTCATTTTGCCGTGTTCTGETGATGCCATTCTTGCCATCGGGGGTGACGGFCCCGATGGCAAGAATGGCATCATCACTGGGTCTGTTCGAAGATGGCTGCTGCTCACCAAGCTGTGHCTGCGGCTCATTTTGCCGTGTTCTGCAAACATICACGCGGCCGCAAGATGGCTATCGATTTACGJGACAGATCTGCTTCAATGCTTCATGGCTCAGGCGTAAATCGKGGGTATTCGAACAAGATGGGGCTGGTCCLGACAAGGGCCGCACAGAATCCAMTGATACTAGTATGGCTGTTGACTTCCGGCTTAGTCGGGNGATCTTGGTGGCATGGCTGGTCTTOACACTAGTATGGCGGAAGCACACCAGGCAPTCCAGACAGGTAGATACCATCTGGGGTCACAQTGTGACCCCAGATGGTATCTACCTGTCTGGA Open table in a new tab The M-Δ(1–80) mutant was constructed by using the existing codon for methionine at position 81 in rat M-CPT I as the start codon. For deletion of the first 18 amino acids, codons for amino acids one and two were retained to maintain identical initiation codon context to the wild-type construct. M-Δ(1–80) was generated by replacing theCsp45I-HindIII fragment of M-CPT I in pGAPZ (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with a cleaved PCR product generated with primers K and L. M-Δ(3–18) was made by replacing the SpeI-AflII fragment of wild-type M-CPT I with a cleaved PCR product generated with primers M and N. M-Δ(19–30) was generated by the same means as its liver counterpart using primer pairs O and P, and Q and N. The final PCR product (primers O and N) was cloned in as aSpeI-AflII fragment as for M-Δ(3–18).Transformation of P. pastoris strain X-33, CPT I expression, and preparation of cell-free extracts was as described previously (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L-CPT I and M-CPT I-derived mutants were selected with 0.1 and 0.5 mg of zeocin/ml, respectively, except for L-CPT I-Δ(1–82) for which use of 0.5 mg of zeocin/ml was required to obtain levels of CPT activity sufficient for assay. The lower expression levels of this mutant may be due to the fact that, although the other L-CPT I constructs had the same initiation codon context, with alanine as the second amino acid (ATGG), in Δ(1–82) the presence of isoleucine as residue two defines the less optimal start codon context ATGA (18Kozak M. Gene. 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar).Secondary structure predictions for the CPT I amino-terminal regions were performed using various methods, including a consensus prediction method on the Network Protein Sequence @nalysis server on the Web. These methods predict that the amino-terminal 46 amino acids of L- and M-CPT I adopt similar structures.CPT I activity was measured using cell-free yeast extracts as described previously (11Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 483-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for determination of theKm for carnitine, palmitoyl-CoA concentration was fixed at 135 μm. For determination ofK0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA, carnitine concentration was fixed at 500 μm. For practical reasons this was the highest concentration of carnitine of sufficiently high specific activity that was feasible, but it was not always a saturating concentration. Therefore, the apparent K0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA, or the concentration of substrate that gives half the maximum activity obtained under the assay conditions, is given. The IC50 malonyl-CoA (i.e. the concentration of inhibitor that inhibits the CPT activity by 50%) was determined using 35 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 500 μm carnitine. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation for palmitoyl-CoA or carnitine as variable substrates and to an equation for simple competitive inhibition with respect to palmitoyl-CoA to obtain IC50 values for malonyl-CoA. The mechanism of inhibition by malonyl-CoA was studied by performing assays at different palmitoyl-CoA concentrations in the absence and presence of two different malonyl-CoA concentrations. Malonyl-CoA concentration dependence of activity at three different concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA (20, 35, and 70 μm) was used to construct Dixon plots and to obtainKi values.Curve fitting was carried out using Sigma-Plot software with non-linear regression analysis and Excel software using linear regression analysis. Statistical analysis was calculated using two-tailed Student's t tests.RESULTSComparison of the Properties of Native L-CPT I with Those of Δ(1–82), E3A, and Δ(3–18) MutantsMalonyl-CoA SensitivityThe most marked kinetic difference between the Δ(1–82) protein and the E3A and Δ(3–18) mutants was in the IC50 values for malonyl-CoA inhibition (Table II). That of the Δ(1–82) mutant (68 ± 1 μm) was much more similar to that of the parental protein (only 1.8-fold higher) than were those of the other mutants (5-fold higher than for native L-CPT I). This was in disagreement with previous observations of other authors (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

By contrast, the kinetic characteristics of the Δ(3–18) mutant were similar to those of E3A for all kinetic parameters, including >1.5-fold higher values (relative to the wild-type) for palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine.Mechanism of Malonyl-CoA InhibitionThe kinetic basis for the large loss in malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the E3A mutant was studied. Calculation of the Ki values for malonyl-CoA for the three constructs (native, E3A, and Δ(1–82); see Fig. 1 and Table II) showed that malonyl-CoA increased the K0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA in all three mutants, with very similar Ki values despite the 5-fold range in IC50 values (Table II). This was in contrast to the parallel increase in Ki and IC50 reported for mutants E3A and Δ(1–82) previously (9Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For all three constructs, the pattern of inhibition was competitive (Fig. 2). However, although for native L-CPT I the effect of malonyl-CoA was limited to raising theK0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 2, a andb) for mutants E3A and Δ(1–82), there was, in addition, a reproducible increase in the Vmax (Fig. 2,c and d). This type of behavior (hyperbolic inhibition) is rare for native enzymes but has been discussed in detail previously (19Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. 2nd Ed. Portland Press, London1995: 115-116Google Scholar).Figure 2Lineweaver-Burke plots for the inhibition of activity by malonyl-CoA in extracts of P. pastorisexpressing native and mutant L-CPT I proteins. Constructs were expressed in P. pastoris and CPT activity measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The malonyl-CoA concentrations used were selected according to the IC50determined previously (Table II) and were: a, L-CPT I measured at 0, 20, and 40 μm malonyl-CoA; b,L-CPT I-Δ(19–30) measured at 0, 0.5, and 1.0 μm malonyl-CoA; c, L-CPT I-E3A measured at 0, 100, and 175 μm malonyl-CoA; and d, L-CPT I Δ(1–82) measured at 0, 35, and 70 μm malonyl-CoA. Plots representative of two separate preparations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Properties of L-CPT I Mutants Bearing Internal Deletions within the Cytosolic Amino-segment: Δ(19–30) and Δ(19–46)The above data indicated that, apart from the extreme amino terminus, elements within the cytosolic amino-segment may influence malonyl-CoA sensitivity such that their deletion, as in Δ(1–82), has a rescuing effect on this parameter. The existence of such a negative element in L- but not M-CPT I could potentially provide the basis for the 50- to 100-fold difference in the IC50 for malonyl-CoA displayed by the two isoforms. Therefore, we wanted to determine which features of the cytosolic amino-terminal segment could be responsible. Algorithms for prediction of transmembrane regions, suggest that residue 46 of L-CPT I defines the limit of the extra-membranous cytosolic amino-segment before the start of the hydrophobic TM1 segment. Because residues 1–18 are fully conserved between L- and M-CPT I, we concentrated on residues 19–46. All secondary structure prediction methods based on single or multiply aligned sequences agree that residues 15–19 (TPDG) constitute a random coil or β-turn. The region between this proposed turn and the membrane-embedded sequence is predicted to form an α-helix, broken by a random coil for residues 35–38, based on the consensus of nine different prediction methods. Therefore, two mutants of L-CPT I were constructed in which residues up to, and including, the turn region (amino acids 1–18) were retained. Deletions were made between residues (19–30 or 19–46) such that in these mutants the extreme amino terminus, including Glu-3, is predicted to be physically closer to the aqueous-phase/membrane interface.Malonyl-CoA SensitivityThe most striking property of the L-CPT I-Δ(19–30) and -Δ(19–46) mutants was that they had IC50 values for malonyl-CoA inhibition that were manyfoldlower that that for the parental protein (Table II). This was especially evident for the Δ(19–30) protein, which had an IC50 value that was almost 50-fold lower than that of L-CPT I (0.8 μm versus 38 μmmalonyl-CoA; see Fig. 3).Figure 3Effects of increasing the concentration of malonyl-CoA on the activities of wild-type L-CPT I- and the L-CPT I-Δ(19–30) mutant. Cell-free extracts ofP. pastoris were prepared, and CPT activity was measured for (●) wild-type and (○) Δ(19–30) constructs. Aliquots (25 μl) of extract were assayed in a final volume of 1 ml for 4 min at 30 °C, using 35 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 0.5 mmcarnitine. Values are means of three separate determinations (±S.D.). Where error bars are not visible, they lie within the symbol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Affinities for Carnitine and Palmitoyl-CoAThere were modest, but statistically significant, increases in theK0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA and Kmfor carnitine with respect to the wild-type protein (up to 2-fold; see Table II). Therefore, mutations Δ(19–30) and Δ(19–46) had effects similar to E3A and Δ(3–18) on the increases in the values for both the reaction substrates, but markedly opposite effects on the Ki for malonyl-CoA (above).Mechanism of Malonyl-CoA InhibitionTo ascertain that the observed 50-fold decrease in IC50 for malonyl-CoA for the Δ(19–30) mutant did not result from the change in theK0.5 for palmitoyl-CoA, we performed kinetic analyses of the dependence of the activities of the mutants and of the parental protein, with respect to palmitoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA concentrations. The Ki value for the Δ(19–30) mutant was almost two orders of magnitude lower than that for native L-CPT I (Table II). The data in Fig. 2(a and b) show that this decrease inKi was not accompanied by any change in the kinetic mechanism of malonyl-CoA inhibition of the enzyme activity of Δ(19–30) compared with the parental protein (both competitive). A similar result was obtained for the Δ(19–46) mutant (not shown). Thus, the decrease in Ki for malonyl-CoA could account entirely for the decreased IC50 of these internal deletion mutants (Table II).Interaction between the Effects of the E3A Mutation and Deletions Internal to the Cytosolic Amino-segment of L-CPT IIn view of the opposing effects on malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the E3A and of the Δ(19–30) and, to a lesser extent, the Δ(19–46) mutations, we investigated whether the enhanced malonyl-CoA sensitivity demonstrated by the deletion mutants was conditional on the presence of Glu-3. Therefore, two mutants, E3A-Δ(19–30) and E3A-Δ(19–46) were constructed. The data in Table II show that the E3A-Δ(19–30) mutant was two orders of magnitude less sensitive to malonyl-CoA than the Δ(19–30) mutant, indicating that the lowered IC50induced by the internal deletion does not obviate the requirement for the presence of Glu-3. However, despite its increase, the IC50 value was still significantly lower (by 25%) than that of the E3A mutant (p = 0.008). By contrast, the effect of deletion of residues 19–46 on malonyl-CoA sensitivity was fully reversed by simultaneous mutation of Glu-3. Both the E3A derivatives of the internal deletion mutants showed very similar kinetic parameters for palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine to those displayed by the proteins expressed from mutants with the parental deletions and the E3A mutant itself (Table II) indicating that the effects of the combined mutations were not additive.Comparison of the Properties of Native M-CPT I to Those of the Δ(1–80) and Δ(3–18) Mutants Derived from ItPrevious work (20Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has shown that deletion of the amino-terminal first 18 residues of human M-CPT I causes only a relatively minor increase in IC50 for malonyl-CoA, whereas further amino-terminal truncation of the protein by 28, 39, 51, or 72 residues gives a 10-fold greater loss in sensitivity. (It is to be noted, however, that the IC50 is still lower than that of full-length L-CPT I.) Therefore, in human M-CPT I any effect of the sequence between residues 19–30 on malonyl-CoA sensitivity would be expected to be positive, rather than negative. Therefore, we decided to test this possibility to ascertain whether the 19–3"

Using a PCR1 amplification strategy with degenerate oligonucleotides we cloned an inwardly rectifying K+ channel KDC1 from carrot root RNA. A combination ofin situ hybridization experiments and comparative electrophysiological studies of the gene product expressed in CHO cells and K+ channels in root hair cells identified KDC1 as the major inwardly rectifying K+ channel of carrot root hair cell plasma membranes.DISCUSSIONMost of the work performed to date on the characterization of plant potassium channels has focused on the model plantArabidopsis thaliana. A molecular and electrophysiological analysis of K+ channels from other plant species, particularly crop species, is needed before general conclusions about the roles of K+ channels in plant growth and development can be drawn.Here we describe the molecular cloning and functional analysis of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel KDC1 from carrot. Northern blotting demonstrated that Kdc1 is mainly expressed in the root and whole mount hybridization showed it to be localized at the tip of root hair cells. KDC1 is remarkably similar to the putativeArabidopsis K+ channel ATKC1 (GenBankTM ATU81239). ATKC1 (which has not yet been characterized at the electrophysiological level) is also predominantly expressed in root tissue and has a similar expression pattern to KDC1. 2K. Palme, personal communication. The KDC1 and ATKC1 proteins share 60% amino acid identity. These channels are expressed in root tissue but do not contain the ankyrin-like repeats which are characteristic of proteins of the AKT1 family. Based on their similar expression patterns and peptide sequences we suggest that these two proteins represent a new subfamily of plant K+ channels. Plant K(in) channels have previously been divided into two subgroups based on the presence (AKT1-like) or absence (KAT1-like) of the ankyrin-like repeat region. A recent detailed electrophysiological analysis of the AKT2/3 channel showed it to be only very weakly rectifying and blocked by protons (14Marten I. Hoth S. Deeken R. Ache P. Ketchum K.A. Hoshi T. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7581-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) thus it is clearly different to KAT1- or AKT1-like channels which are strongly rectifying and activated by acid pH. We propose that plantKin channels can in fact be divided into four subfamilies. KAT1-type channels which are expressed in guard cells and flowers, do not contain ankyrin-like repeats and are activated at acidic pH values (7Müller-Rober B. Ellenberg J. Provart N. Willmitzer L.

Ache, submitted for publication. and KDC1-like channels which are mainly expressed in root epidermal tissues are activated at acidic pH values and do not contain ankyrin-like repeat regions. When an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of these channels is performed using either the transmembrane domains or the entire peptide sequences the channels divide into these groups. As new channels are discovered and detailed expression analyses performed these groupings may of course change, but they appear to reasonably represent the sequence and expression data presently available.KDC1, like ATKC1, 4K. Palme, personal communication. did not express in Xenopus oocytes and was unable to complement the CY162 yeast mutant (38Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells have been used to study plantKin channels which could not be expressed inXenopus oocytes, however, as only certain batches of these cells are able to withstand hyperpolarizations beyond −150 mV (39Gaymard F. Cerutti M. Horeau C. Lemaillet G. Urbach S. Ravallec M. Devauchellet G. Sentenac H. Thibald J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22863-22870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) they are clearly not ideal for analyzing plant K+ channels. CHO cells have been widely used to express mammalian proteins and this cell line represents a preferred system for exogenous K+channel expression (40Yu S.P. Kerchner G.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To follow the fate of KDC1 in CHO cells we fused the KDC1 protein with the GFP and performed localization experiments. A number of mammalian ion channels have been successfully tagged with GFP and the presence of the tag allowed localization studies to be performed (41Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W.W. Howe J.R. Hughes T.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 42Connor J.X. Boileau A.J. Czakowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28906-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under standard culture conditions both the KDC1::GFP fusion and a KAT::GFP protein (data not shown) were blocked at the ER. Reducing the incubation temperature to 30 °C helped to ensure functional insertion into the plasma membrane, similar results have been reported for a misfolded CFTR channel protein (43Lukacs G.L. Chang X. Bear C. Kartner N. Mohamed A. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21592-21598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As 37 °C is not a physiological temperature for plant cells, plant proteins may not fold correctly at such an elevated temperature, reducing the temperature could help the proteins to fold more correctly and thus reach the plasma membrane. We have also recently expressed the KAT1 protein in CHO cells, confirming the validity of the system. CHO cells represent a robust system for expressing plant K+ channels and we therefore think that they could become the system of choice for expressing plant K+ channels which do not express in Xenopusoocytes.The whole cell electrophysiological analysis of KDC1 in CHO cells showed it to be an inwardly rectifying potassium specific channel. KDC1 is blocked by cesium and tetraethylammonium which are specific inhibitors of K+ channels, and showed a low permeability to sodium. Potassium and sodium are the only physiologically relevant alkaline metals that root hairs are exposed to and KDC1 is clearly selective for potassium over sodium. Interestingly, the KDC1 channel is strongly activated at acidic pH values and there was a large increase in current when the pH of the bath solution was reduced from pH 7.0 to 6.0. The pH in root cell walls is acidic. Measurements in corn root tissues showed that the apoplastic pH ranges 5.1–5.6 in the cortex (44Felle H., H. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 987-995Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and 4.5–4.9 in the epidermis (45Taylor D.P. Slattery J. Leopold A.C. Physiol Plant. 1996; 97: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CHO cells are unable to tolerate such acidic pH. A whole cell analysis of carrot root hair protoplasts showed that the predominating conductance was a potassium-specific current, confirming the findings of Gassmann and Schroeder (23Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with wheat root hair cells. Our whole cell results showed that carrot root hair cells contain an inwardly rectifying K+ current which is blocked by cesium and is much less permeable to sodium. We were able to measure the current at pH values ranging from pH 7 to 4.5, the current was clearly increased as the pH of the external solution reduced, showing that the K+current is acid activated. Similar findings have been recently reported with barley root protoplasts (46Amtmann A. Jelitto T.C. Sanders D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of the KDC1 channel in CHO cells recorded in the whole cell configuration were in good agreement with those obtained from root hair protoplasts (were Kdc1 is highly expressed). Single channel analyses further suggest that KDC1 underlies the K+channel activity observed in root hair protoplasts.While our data suggest that KDC1 is the main conductance in the root hair plasma membrane this does not exclude the possibility that otherKin channels may also contribute to the whole cell activity. For example, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with an AKT1 promoter-GUS fusion, GUS activity was mainly detected in the root endoderm and cortex but was also shown to be present in root hair cells (16Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C. Plant J. 1996; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Very recently, a new tomato channel LKT1, a member of the AKT1 family, has also been shown to be expressed in root hair cells (47Hartje S. Zimmermann S. Klonus D. Müller-Rober B. Planta. 2000; 210: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that channels from both the AKT1 and KDC1 families are in fact present in root hair cells.Root hair cells are tip growing tubular outgrowths of epidermal cells which serve to increase surface area and penetrate between soil particles to provide access to nutrients in undepleted soil regions (48Bibikova T.N. Jacob T. Dahse I. Gilroy S. Development. 1998; 125: 2925-2934PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of KDC1 in root hair cells and its biophysical characterization suggest that this channel is very probably involved in potassium uptake from the soil. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that KDC1 is not directly involved in K+uptake, but plays a role in the growth and/or development of root hairs. However, the fact that we always saw Kdc1 expression in fully elongated root hairs, but did not always see expression in smaller tip growing root hairs (Fig. 2 B), would seem to suggest that KDC1 is probably involved in the uptake of K+from fully elongated root hairs.There is clearly a degree of redundancy in potassium uptake and it is highly probable that a number of K+ channels and carriers are involved in K+ uptake into roots, in this context it is interesting to note that a null allele of the Arabidopsis Akt1 gene showed reduced K+ uptake and growth only under certain growth conditions (17Hirsch R.E. Lewis B.D. Spalding E.P. Sussman M.R. Science. 1998; 280: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Future experiments, including antisense RNA inhibition of Kdc1, will enable a detailed analysis of the role that this channel plays in the tip growth of root hair cells and potassium nutrition. Potassium is one of the most abundant inorganic cations in higher plant cells. This macronutrient is involved in maintaining electro-neutrality and is an essential co-factor for a number of enzymes; especially those involved in respiration and photosynthesis (1Clarkson D.T. Hanson J.B. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1980; 31: 239-298Crossref Google Scholar). Potassium channels play an important role in K+ uptake as well as the control of membrane potential (2Brüggemann L. Dietrich P. Becker D. Dreyer I. Palme K. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3298-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), growth, and turgor driven movements (3Moran N.

Potassium channels can be divided into outward rectifiers (Kout) which excrete potassium from the cell, inward rectifiers (Kin) which transport potassium ions into the cell, and largely voltage-independent channels (Kin/out) which are able to catalyze both processes. The first genes encoding plant K+ channels were isolated by the complementation of yeast mutants deficient in potassium uptake (5Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc.

Using a PCR1 amplification strategy with degenerate oligonucleotides we cloned an inwardly rectifying K+ channel KDC1 from carrot root RNA. A combination ofin situ hybridization experiments and comparative electrophysiological studies of the gene product expressed in CHO cells and K+ channels in root hair cells identified KDC1 as the major inwardly rectifying K+ channel of carrot root hair cell plasma membranes. DISCUSSIONMost of the work performed to date on the characterization of plant potassium channels has focused on the model plantArabidopsis thaliana. A molecular and electrophysiological analysis of K+ channels from other plant species, particularly crop species, is needed before general conclusions about the roles of K+ channels in plant growth and development can be drawn.Here we describe the molecular cloning and functional analysis of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel KDC1 from carrot. Northern blotting demonstrated that Kdc1 is mainly expressed in the root and whole mount hybridization showed it to be localized at the tip of root hair cells. KDC1 is remarkably similar to the putativeArabidopsis K+ channel ATKC1 (GenBankTM ATU81239). ATKC1 (which has not yet been characterized at the electrophysiological level) is also predominantly expressed in root tissue and has a similar expression pattern to KDC1. 2K. Palme, personal communication. The KDC1 and ATKC1 proteins share 60% amino acid identity. These channels are expressed in root tissue but do not contain the ankyrin-like repeats which are characteristic of proteins of the AKT1 family. Based on their similar expression patterns and peptide sequences we suggest that these two proteins represent a new subfamily of plant K+ channels. Plant K(in) channels have previously been divided into two subgroups based on the presence (AKT1-like) or absence (KAT1-like) of the ankyrin-like repeat region. A recent detailed electrophysiological analysis of the AKT2/3 channel showed it to be only very weakly rectifying and blocked by protons (14Marten I. Hoth S. Deeken R. Ache P. Ketchum K.A. Hoshi T. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7581-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) thus it is clearly different to KAT1- or AKT1-like channels which are strongly rectifying and activated by acid pH. We propose that plantKin channels can in fact be divided into four subfamilies. KAT1-type channels which are expressed in guard cells and flowers, do not contain ankyrin-like repeats and are activated at acidic pH values (7Müller-Rober B. Ellenberg J. Provart N. Willmitzer L.

Ache, submitted for publication. and KDC1-like channels which are mainly expressed in root epidermal tissues are activated at acidic pH values and do not contain ankyrin-like repeat regions. When an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of these channels is performed using either the transmembrane domains or the entire peptide sequences the channels divide into these groups. As new channels are discovered and detailed expression analyses performed these groupings may of course change, but they appear to reasonably represent the sequence and expression data presently available.KDC1, like ATKC1, 4K. Palme, personal communication. did not express in Xenopus oocytes and was unable to complement the CY162 yeast mutant (38Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells have been used to study plantKin channels which could not be expressed inXenopus oocytes, however, as only certain batches of these cells are able to withstand hyperpolarizations beyond −150 mV (39Gaymard F. Cerutti M. Horeau C. Lemaillet G. Urbach S. Ravallec M. Devauchellet G. Sentenac H. Thibald J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22863-22870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) they are clearly not ideal for analyzing plant K+ channels. CHO cells have been widely used to express mammalian proteins and this cell line represents a preferred system for exogenous K+channel expression (40Yu S.P. Kerchner G.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 612-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To follow the fate of KDC1 in CHO cells we fused the KDC1 protein with the GFP and performed localization experiments. A number of mammalian ion channels have been successfully tagged with GFP and the presence of the tag allowed localization studies to be performed (41Marshall J. Molloy R. Moss G.W.W. Howe J.R. Hughes T.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 42Connor J.X. Boileau A.J. Czakowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28906-28911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under standard culture conditions both the KDC1::GFP fusion and a KAT::GFP protein (data not shown) were blocked at the ER. Reducing the incubation temperature to 30 °C helped to ensure functional insertion into the plasma membrane, similar results have been reported for a misfolded CFTR channel protein (43Lukacs G.L. Chang X. Bear C. Kartner N. Mohamed A. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21592-21598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As 37 °C is not a physiological temperature for plant cells, plant proteins may not fold correctly at such an elevated temperature, reducing the temperature could help the proteins to fold more correctly and thus reach the plasma membrane. We have also recently expressed the KAT1 protein in CHO cells, confirming the validity of the system. CHO cells represent a robust system for expressing plant K+ channels and we therefore think that they could become the system of choice for expressing plant K+ channels which do not express in Xenopusoocytes.The whole cell electrophysiological analysis of KDC1 in CHO cells showed it to be an inwardly rectifying potassium specific channel. KDC1 is blocked by cesium and tetraethylammonium which are specific inhibitors of K+ channels, and showed a low permeability to sodium. Potassium and sodium are the only physiologically relevant alkaline metals that root hairs are exposed to and KDC1 is clearly selective for potassium over sodium. Interestingly, the KDC1 channel is strongly activated at acidic pH values and there was a large increase in current when the pH of the bath solution was reduced from pH 7.0 to 6.0. The pH in root cell walls is acidic. Measurements in corn root tissues showed that the apoplastic pH ranges 5.1–5.6 in the cortex (44Felle H., H. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 987-995Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and 4.5–4.9 in the epidermis (45Taylor D.P. Slattery J. Leopold A.C. Physiol Plant. 1996; 97: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CHO cells are unable to tolerate such acidic pH. A whole cell analysis of carrot root hair protoplasts showed that the predominating conductance was a potassium-specific current, confirming the findings of Gassmann and Schroeder (23Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with wheat root hair cells. Our whole cell results showed that carrot root hair cells contain an inwardly rectifying K+ current which is blocked by cesium and is much less permeable to sodium. We were able to measure the current at pH values ranging from pH 7 to 4.5, the current was clearly increased as the pH of the external solution reduced, showing that the K+current is acid activated. Similar findings have been recently reported with barley root protoplasts (46Amtmann A. Jelitto T.C. Sanders D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of the KDC1 channel in CHO cells recorded in the whole cell configuration were in good agreement with those obtained from root hair protoplasts (were Kdc1 is highly expressed). Single channel analyses further suggest that KDC1 underlies the K+channel activity observed in root hair protoplasts.While our data suggest that KDC1 is the main conductance in the root hair plasma membrane this does not exclude the possibility that otherKin channels may also contribute to the whole cell activity. For example, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with an AKT1 promoter-GUS fusion, GUS activity was mainly detected in the root endoderm and cortex but was also shown to be present in root hair cells (16Lagarde D. Basset M. Lepetit M. Conejero G. Gaymard F. Astruc S. Grignon C. Plant J. 1996; 9: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Very recently, a new tomato channel LKT1, a member of the AKT1 family, has also been shown to be expressed in root hair cells (47Hartje S. Zimmermann S. Klonus D. Müller-Rober B. Planta. 2000; 210: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that channels from both the AKT1 and KDC1 families are in fact present in root hair cells.Root hair cells are tip growing tubular outgrowths of epidermal cells which serve to increase surface area and penetrate between soil particles to provide access to nutrients in undepleted soil regions (48Bibikova T.N. Jacob T. Dahse I. Gilroy S. Development. 1998; 125: 2925-2934PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of KDC1 in root hair cells and its biophysical characterization suggest that this channel is very probably involved in potassium uptake from the soil. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that KDC1 is not directly involved in K+uptake, but plays a role in the growth and/or development of root hairs. However, the fact that we always saw Kdc1 expression in fully elongated root hairs, but did not always see expression in smaller tip growing root hairs (Fig. 2 B), would seem to suggest that KDC1 is probably involved in the uptake of K+from fully elongated root hairs.There is clearly a degree of redundancy in potassium uptake and it is highly probable that a number of K+ channels and carriers are involved in K+ uptake into roots, in this context it is interesting to note that a null allele of the Arabidopsis Akt1 gene showed reduced K+ uptake and growth only under certain growth conditions (17Hirsch R.E. Lewis B.D. Spalding E.P. Sussman M.R. Science. 1998; 280: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Future experiments, including antisense RNA inhibition of Kdc1, will enable a detailed analysis of the role that this channel plays in the tip growth of root hair cells and potassium nutrition.

The molecular weight was estimated to be about 160,000 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. During electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate the protein divided into three or four subunits. The phosphatase was unstable above pH 7.5 but very stable from pH 4.5 to 6.5 at 4° or -18°. Optimal activity of the purified enzyme was at pH 5.9; the isoelectric point was at pH 6.5 to 6.8. The enzyme specificity was not absolute; however, 3-phosphoglycerate was the preferred substrate. The Michaelis constant for 3-phosphoglycerate was 2.8 x 10-4 m, and it was hydrolyzed stoichiometrically to glycerate and inorganic phosphate. No cofactors were required for activity, and the enzyme was stable in 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate and other metal-complexing agents. The phosphatase was inhibited by 1 mm Zn++ and Cu++. Fluoride, l-(+)-tartrate, and molybdate gave typical phosphatase inhibition at 1 mm. Glycidol phosphate was not hydrolyzed by the phosphatase, but inhibited the enzyme irreversibly and competitively.

For constructing it, we designed the super anti-apoptotic factor by disturbing three intramolecular polar interactions among α-helix structures of Bcl-xL. The resultant mutant Bcl-xL, named Bcl-xFNK, was expected to make the pore-forming domain more mobile and flexible than the wild-type. When overexpressed in Jurkat cells, Bcl-xFNK was markedly more potent in prolonging survival following apoptosis-inducing treatment with a kind of cell death cytokines (anti-Fas), a protein kinase inhibitor (staurosporine), cell cycle inhibitors (TN-16, camptothecin, hydroxyurea, and trichostatin A), or oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide and paraquat) than wild-type Bcl-xL. Furthermore, the transfectants ofbcl-xFNK became more resistant against a calcium ionophore and even a heat treatment than wild-type Bcl-xL. In addition, Bcl-xFNK showed marked anti-apoptotic activity in Chinese hamster ovary and Jurkat cells deprived of serum. Thus, Bcl-xFNK may be the first mutant generated by site-directed mutagenesis of Bcl-xL with a gain-of-function phenotype. Interestingly, Bcl-xFNK was found to allow interleukin-3-dependent FDC-P1 to grow without interleukin-3, but not BaF/3. In Bcl-xFNK transfectants of FDC-P1 and Jurkat, the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase was activated by 2 to 5 times, but not in those of BaF/3 and Chinese hamster ovary. Bcl-xFNK might gain a new function to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase in a cell-type specific manner. The findings of this study suggest that the central α5-α6 pore-forming region of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL has a pivotal role in suppressing apoptosis.

Inhibition of excess apoptosis would be an important strategy of the future therapies for many diseases. As regulators of apoptosis, thebcl-2 family consists of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors. Bcl-xL, a member of the bcl-2 family, strongly protects cells from apoptosis (1Boise L.H.

However, there is no direct evidence that the Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis based on the ion channel activity in vivo, and the mechanism by which the ion channel activity is associated with their opposing functions in apoptosis regulation is unknown. It is important to clarify how the α5-α6 region of the Bcl-2 family proteins participates in apoptosis regulation.We have independently crystallized native rat Bcl-xL to determine the structure with a 2.5-Å resolution and found that Bcl-xL has nine intramolecular polar interactions to stabilize the central pore-forming domain (8Aritomi M.

We focused on the role of the α5-α6 helixes of Bcl-xL and made them more mobile to be inserted into a membrane to generate an ion channel. Actually, we have constructed the super anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xFNK by introducing three amino acid substitutions Y22F, Q26N , and R165K in rat Bcl-xL.

A putative pore-forming domain is hypothetically assigned to the α5-α6 region of these proteins. Bcl-2 lacking the putative α5-α6 region failed to form ion channels in synthetic membranesin vitro (4Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and the putative α5-α6 region was essential for Bcl-2 in promoting cell survival (5Matsuyama S. Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30995-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The central α5-α6 region in the Bcl-2 family proteins apparently plays an important and distinct role in apotosis regulation. It is stressed that the ease with which the α5-α6 region can insert into membranes appears to enhance the function of Bax and Bcl-xL (6Nouraini S. Six E. Matsuyama S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This could be a common step for some of the Bcl-2 family proteins to express their activity. It is important and necessary in further studies to investigate whether the ion channel activity of Bcl-xFNK is enhanced in vitro.To elucidate the role of the putative pore-forming domain of Bcl-xL, Bcl-xFNK would provide a possibility of importance for generating the channel to express the anti-apoptotic activity. In this study, we showed that the other combinations of amino acid mutation did not enhance the apoptosis suppressing activity, but that only the combination of the three amino acid substitutions (Y22F, Q26N, and R165K did. This finding indicates that the substitutions of the amino acids themselves are not important, but that the mobility or flexibility of the α5-α6 region of Bcl-xL is critical to enhancing the anti-apoptotic activity.In addition to the enhanced function, a novel feature of Bcl-xFNK appeared in FDC-P1 cells, that is, IL-3-independent growth. Overproduction of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL results in a prolonging of cell survival against death stimuli but never leads to proliferation. Cooperation of Bcl-2 and c-Myc conferred IL-3 independence upon the growth factor-dependent pre-B cells (28Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that Bcl-xFNK gains the ability to regulate gene transcription like transcription factor c-Myc. In all FDC-P1 cells overexpressing Bcl-xFNK as well as Jurkatbcl-xFNK, the p42/p44 MAP kinase activity was shown to be enhanced. IL-3 has been reported to activate the MAP kinase (12Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is speculated that Bcl-xFNK would directly or indirectly activate the MAP kinase. It is stressed that Bcl-xFNK allowed IL-3 independent growth in a cell type-specific manner. Bcl-xFNK may indirectly activate the MAP kinase through interaction(s) with factor(s) which are present in FDC-P1 but absent in BaF/3.Bag-1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 1) interacts with many proteins including Bcl-2 and suppresses apoptosis (29Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bag-1 confers IL-3 independence upon BaF/3 cells (30Clevenger C.V. Thickman K. Ngo W. Chang W.P. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 608-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect any Bcl-xL or Bcl-xFNK co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-Bag-1 antibody (C-16; Santa Cruz Biotech), from FDC-P1 overexpressing Bcl-xL or Bcl-xFNK, respectively, regardless of the presence of IL-3 (data not shown). Expression levels of Bag-1 were the same in these cells (data not shown). It is not likely that Bag-1 is involved in the mechanism by which FDC-P1 cells gain IL-3 independence through Bcl-xFNK.Nutrient limitation, oxygenation (oxygen stress), and mechanical agitation (hydrodynamic stress) are very important factors in cell death in the bioreactor environment. Bcl-2 has been reported to increase maximum viable cell density and viability of CHO cells in batch culture and to maintain viability of thymidine-treated CHO cells (31Tey B.T. Singh R.P. Piredda L. Piacentini M. Al-Rubeai M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 68: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Bcl-xL consistently affords CHO cells a high degree of protection from various culture insults, compared with Bcl-2 (32Mastrangelo A.J. Hardwick J.M. Zou S. Betenbaugh M.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 67: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the anti-apoptotic activities are not strong enough to protect the cultured cells against apoptosis in industrial uses. Thus, Bcl-xFNK would be extremely useful for making commercially important animal cell lines robust to culture insults.In terms of clinical applications of the future, Bcl-xFNK may more effectively protect neuronal cells from degeneration or cell death caused by brain injury and ischemia than Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In fact, we have shown that ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL delays neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus of adult rat brain (33Asoh S. Mori T. Ohta S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 272: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-xFNK may play an important role to cure sick cells due to collapse of Ca2+ homeostasis, because exposure of cells to calcium ionophore revealed the relative robustness of the cells overexpressing Bcl-xFNK.Finally, we emphasize that this construction is not a simple remodeling of the Bcl-xL protein by random selection, but was designed based on the idea that the insertion of the putative pore-forming domain into membranes is essential for expressing the anti-apoptotic activity. Further analysis of Bcl-xFNK with a gain-of-function phenotype could provide new insight into the function of Bcl-xL in apoptosis regulation.

It is important and necessary in further studies to investigate whether the ion channel activity of Bcl-xFNK is enhanced in vitro.To elucidate the role of the putative pore-forming domain of Bcl-xL, Bcl-xFNK would provide a possibility of importance for generating the channel to express the anti-apoptotic activity. In this study, we showed that the other combinations of amino acid mutation did not enhance the apoptosis suppressing activity, but that only the combination of the three amino acid substitutions (Y22F, Q26N, and R165K did. This finding indicates that the substitutions of the amino acids themselves are not important, but that the mobility or flexibility of the α5-α6 region of Bcl-xL is critical to enhancing the anti-apoptotic activity.In addition to the enhanced function, a novel feature of Bcl-xFNK appeared in FDC-P1 cells, that is, IL-3-independent growth. Overproduction of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL results in a prolonging of cell survival against death stimuli but never leads to proliferation. Cooperation of Bcl-2 and c-Myc conferred IL-3 independence upon the growth factor-dependent pre-B cells (28Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that Bcl-xFNK gains the ability to regulate gene transcription like transcription factor c-Myc. In all FDC-P1 cells overexpressing Bcl-xFNK as well as Jurkatbcl-xFNK, the p42/p44 MAP kinase activity was shown to be enhanced. IL-3 has been reported to activate the MAP kinase (12Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is speculated that Bcl-xFNK would directly or indirectly activate the MAP kinase. It is stressed that Bcl-xFNK allowed IL-3 independent growth in a cell type-specific manner. Bcl-xFNK may indirectly activate the MAP kinase through interaction(s) with factor(s) which are present in FDC-P1 but absent in BaF/3.Bag-1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 1) interacts with many proteins including Bcl-2 and suppresses apoptosis (29Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bag-1 confers IL-3 independence upon BaF/3 cells (30Clevenger C.V. Thickman K. Ngo W. Chang W.P. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 608-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect any Bcl-xL or Bcl-xFNK co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-Bag-1 antibody (C-16; Santa Cruz Biotech), from FDC-P1 overexpressing Bcl-xL or Bcl-xFNK, respectively, regardless of the presence of IL-3 (data not shown). Expression levels of Bag-1 were the same in these cells (data not shown). It is not likely that Bag-1 is involved in the mechanism by which FDC-P1 cells gain IL-3 independence through Bcl-xFNK.Nutrient limitation, oxygenation (oxygen stress), and mechanical agitation (hydrodynamic stress) are very important factors in cell death in the bioreactor environment. Bcl-2 has been reported to increase maximum viable cell density and viability of CHO cells in batch culture and to maintain viability of thymidine-treated CHO cells (31Tey B.T. Singh R.P. Piredda L. Piacentini M. Al-Rubeai M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 68: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Bcl-xL consistently affords CHO cells a high degree of protection from various culture insults, compared with Bcl-2 (32Mastrangelo A.J. Hardwick J.M. Zou S. Betenbaugh M.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 67: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the anti-apoptotic activities are not strong enough to protect the cultured cells against apoptosis in industrial uses. Thus, Bcl-xFNK would be extremely useful for making commercially important animal cell lines robust to culture insults.In terms of clinical applications of the future, Bcl-xFNK may more effectively protect neuronal cells from degeneration or cell death caused by brain injury and ischemia than Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In fact, we have shown that ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL delays neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus of adult rat brain (33Asoh S. Mori T. Ohta S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 272: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, Bcl-xFNK may play an important role to cure sick cells due to collapse of Ca2+ homeostasis, because exposure of cells to calcium ionophore revealed the relative robustness of the cells overexpressing Bcl-xFNK.Finally, we emphasize that this construction is not a simple remodeling of the Bcl-xL protein by random selection, but was designed based on the idea that the insertion of the putative pore-forming domain into membranes is essential for expressing the anti-apoptotic activity. Further analysis of Bcl-xFNK with a gain-of-function phenotype could provide new insight into the function of Bcl-xL in apoptosis regulation. Bcl-xL is more suitable to design an anti-apoptic factor by remodeling its structure because of its own stronger anti-apoptotic activity and of its refined structure determined by the x-ray crystallography. We focused on the role of the α5-α6 helixes of Bcl-xL and made them more mobile to be inserted into a membrane to generate an ion channel. Actually, we have constructed the super anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xFNK by introducing three amino acid substitutions Y22F, Q26N , and R165K in rat Bcl-xL. Bcl-xFNK suppressed cell death of Jurkat against a wide variety of stimuli more strongly than Bcl-xL. Disruption of three intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions generated a novel mutant, Bcl-xFNK with a gain-of-function phenotype. Staurosporine (13Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M.

A putative pore-forming domain is hypothetically assigned to the α5-α6 region of these proteins. Bcl-2 lacking the putative α5-α6 region failed to form ion channels in synthetic membranesin vitro (4Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and the putative α5-α6 region was essential for Bcl-2 in promoting cell survival (5Matsuyama S. Schendel S.L. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30995-31001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The central α5-α6 region in the Bcl-2 family proteins apparently plays an important and distinct role in apotosis regulation. It is stressed that the ease with which the α5-α6 region can insert into membranes appears to enhance the function of Bax and Bcl-xL (6Nouraini S. Six E. Matsuyama S. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Mol.

As this molecule is potentially important for future vaccine studies, the L. pifanoi gene encoding the P-4 membrane protein was cloned and sequenced. Southern blot analyses indicate the presence of six tandemly arrayed copies of the P-4 gene in L. pifanoi; homologues of the P-4 gene are found in all other species of the genus Leishmania examined. DNA-derived protein sequence data indicated an identity to the P1 zinc-dependent nuclease of Penicillium citrinum(20.8%) and the C-terminal domain of the 3′ nucleotidase ofLeishmania donovani (33.7%). Consistent with these sequence analyses, purified L. pifanoi P-4 protein possesses single strand nuclease (DNA and RNA) and phosphomonoesterase activity, with a preference for UMP > TMP > AMP >> CMP. Double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopic analyses employing anti-binding protein antibodies revealed that the P-4 protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum of the amastigote. Northern blot analyses indicated that the gene is selectively expressed in the intracellular amastigote stage (mammalian host) but not in the promastigote stage (insect) of the parasite.

The parasite exists as a flagellated promastigote within the alimentary tract of its insect vector, the phlebotomine sand fly; within the mammalian host, the parasite transforms into the amastigote stage and resides in the phagolysosomal vacuole of the macrophage.Leishmania pifanoi, a member of the Leishmania mexicana complex, is associated with both simple and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World (1Grimaldi G. Tesh R.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The latter form of the disease is characterized by large histocytoma-like cutaneous nodules containing heavily parasitized macrophages and by a parasite-specific impairment of the cell-mediated immune response (2Peterson E. Neva A.F. Barral A. Correa-Coronas R. Bogaertz-Diaz H. Martinez D. Ward F.E. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2603-2606PubMed Google Scholar); patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis are generally resistant to current forms of chemotherapy (1Grimaldi G. Tesh R.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 230-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Over the past decade, leishmanial vaccine research has gained significant attention as clinical treatment failure is becoming increasingly common in many areas; furthermore, drugs used for therapy can be associated with significant adverse effects. However, problems exist with standard live vaccines employing virulent organisms (3Modabber F. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 76 (suppl.): 72-78Google Scholar, 4Handman E. Parasitol.

Antigens specific for the amastigote (intracellular-mammalian host) stage of the parasite have been of interest in the construction of a leishmanial vaccine, as such developmentally regulated molecules may be biologically important for the intracellular survival of the parasite. Furthermore, the amastigote is the parasite stage responsible for the pathology associated with disease. Relatively little is known about the mechanisms of amastigote adaptation and survival within the degradative milieu of the macrophage phagolysosome (10Mosser D.M. Rosenthal L.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Metabolic differences are known to exist between the promastigote and amastigote stages (11Zilberstein D. Gepstein A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Glaser T.A. Baatz J.E. Kreishman G.P. Mukkada A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol. Biochem.

These include specific glycosphingolipids, parasite lysosomal enzymes (cysteine proteinase(s); arylsulfatase), the Leishmania donovani A2 gene, superoxide dismutase, and the proteophosphoglycan molecule(s) (15Peters C.

The biological functions of these stage-specific molecules are of interest in terms of their potential role(s) in parasite virulence, pathogenicity, and intracellular survival. The leishmanial superoxide dismutase is considered to be involved in the detoxification of host cell radical oxygen intermediates known to be deleterious to the intracellular amastigote. The proteophosphoglycan molecule appears to have a role in parasite vacuole formation within the infected macrophage. Although not essential for survival, experimental studies of Leishmania genetically deficient in either the A2 or cysteine proteinase genes indicate that these molecules are important in parasite virulence. We have previously reported that three purified antigens (P-2, P-4, and P-8), up-regulated or selectively expressed in the amastigote stage, provide partial to complete protection in BALB/c mice against infection with L. pifanoi and Leishmania amazonensis (20Soong L. Duboise S.M. Kima P. McMahon-Pratt D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3559-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced resistance to infection in mice immunized with the P-4 antigen correlates with an increased interferon-γ (Th1/Tc1) response. More recently, we have found that the P-4 antigen also can elicit a preferential Th1-like response in patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (21Coutinho S.G. Oliveira M.P. DaCruz A.M. De Luca P.M. Mendonca S.C.F. Bertho A.L. Soong L. McMahon-Pratt D. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 84: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For future vaccine studies of leishmaniasis and to understand better the potential biological function of the P-4 amastigote protein, we have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the P-4 antigen from L. pifanoi. DNA-derived protein sequence data indicate that P-4 is a single strand-specific nuclease. Biochemical analyses have demonstrated that P-4 has both endo- and exonuclease activities and cleaves both RNA and single strand DNA substrates. The specific nuclease/ribonuclease activities, as well as developmental regulation of this molecule, suggest a potential role for P-4 in intracellular survival of these protozoan parasites. L. pifanoi (MHOM/VE/60/Ltrod) amastigotes were maintained at 31 °C in F-29 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,1 Life Technologies, Inc.), as previously reported (22Landford C.K. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 360-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). L. amazonensis(MHOM/BR/77/LTB0016), Leishmania major (MHOM/IS/79/LRCL251) strain WR309, Leishmania braziliensis(MHOM/BR/75/M2903), and L. donovani (MHOM/ET/67/L82) strain LV9 promastigotes were grown at 23 °C in Schneider'sDrosophila medium supplemented with 20% FBS. The P-4 antigen was purified from detergent-solubilized L. pifanoi amastigote membrane preparations by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography as described previously (20Soong L. Duboise S.M. Kima P. McMahon-Pratt D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3559-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated P-4 protein was then concentrated and further separated by SDS-PAGE. After staining of the proteins with Coomassie Blue, gel slices containing either the 33- or 35-kDa protein were excised and subjected to in-gel enzymatic digestion with either trypsin or chymotrypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Peptides were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C-18 column and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis at the Yale University School of Medicine Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility. For N-terminal sequence analysis of the 33-kDa protein, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), stained with Coomassie Blue, and subjected to gas phase sequence analysis. L. pifanoi amastigote cDNA was generated from isolated total mRNA and oligo(dT) primers using a cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cDNA was immediately amplified via PCR using a GeneAmp kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of pairs of primers specific for P-4, oligo(dT), or spliced leader. Based upon the protein/peptide amino acid sequences obtained (Table I), and the codon usage (G/C bias in the third codon position) reported for other Leishmania genes (22Landford C.K. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 360-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), degenerate sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were synthesized. Mixed nucleotides are indicated in parentheses; inosines (I) were used to minimize degeneracy. The sequences of primers used in reverse transcriptase-PCR to amplify the P-4 cDNA were as follows: A1 (sense), 5′-CAGCTIGA(T/C)CTIG A(A/G)AACGA(A/G)GA-3′; A4 (antisense), 5′-TAIGT(T/C)TCIACIAGCTT(A/G)TCIGC-3′; A5 (sense), 5′-GA(A/G)AACA AGGA(A/G)GTIAT(T/C/A)CAGAAGATGG-3′. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Amplification products were examined by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-agarose gels. Isolated DNAs were ligated into a pCRTM II vector provided in a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then transformed into Escherichia coli. Positive colonies were selected for plasmid isolation, restriction endonuclease analysis, and DNA sequencing.Table IAmino acid sequences of the N-terminal and internal peptides of the P4 33-kDa proteinPeptidesSequenceDesigned primers 1-aDegenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on underlined amino acids.N-terminalX 1-bX designates an undetermined residue.

Open table in a new tab To obtain a complete P-4 gene copy, a genomic library constructed with partially Sau3A-digested L. pifanoi genomic DNA ligated into the BamHI site of EMBL3cos was screened employing a 32P-labeledEcoRI fragment from clone TA6.2. This 540-bp DNA fragment was isolated and random prime-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP in 1% low melt agarose using a random primer DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and was used as a probe for colony hybridization and Northern and Southern blots. After four rounds of isolation and hybridization, four phage were chosen for further analysis. The DNAs from two of these phage clones, when digested with various restriction endonucleases (BamHI, PstI, EcoRV,SphI, HindIII, HincII; alone and in double digest combinations), revealed after Southern blot hybridization a similar fragment pattern to that observed for total genomic L. pifanoi DNA. The resulting 2.4-kb PstI fragments of each of these phage DNAs were cloned into pUC 19 and further restriction-mapped with EcoRV, HindIII, andSphI; the PstI subclones, based upon restriction mapping, appeared to be similar. Plasmid DNAs derived from genomic clones or cDNA from TA clones were isolated using a Qiagen Qiaquick plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Both strands of each DNA clone were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method employing [35S]dATP and a Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or the Fidelity Sequencing Kit from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD); alternatively, clones were sequenced using automated sequencing (Keck Sequencing Facility, Yale University) using an Applied Biosystems 377 Gel Sequencers and Capillary ABI 3700 DNA Analyzers. Multiple colonies for each clone were sequenced; each colony was sequenced in both directions at least three times. Analyses of the derived nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ExPASy Proteomics Server. Northern blot analysis was performed using total mRNA isolated from cultured parasites using a micro RNA isolation kit (Stratagene). The mRNA was fractionated electrophoretically on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde (23Campos-Neto A. Soong L. Cordova J.L. Sant'Angelo D. Skeiky Y.A.W. Ruddle N.H. Reed S.G. Janeway C. McMahon-Pratt D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and transferred to Nytran filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were hybridized with the TA6.2 probe at 42 °C in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide and washed at 42 °C with 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS. The filters were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C with a Cronex Lighting Plus intensifier screen. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA of L. pifanoiamastigotes was digested with endonuclease as indicated, subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred onto Nytran filters. Filters were hybridized with the TA6.2 probe at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, washed at 65 °C, and processed for radioautography. For molecular karyotype analysis,Leishmania chromosomes were prepared in 1% agarose plugs as described (24Beverley S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 925-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and stored at 4 °C in lysis buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl, 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 9.5). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (25Chu G., D. Vollrath D. Davis R.W. Science. 1986; 234: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar) was performed in a Bio-Rad CHEF-DR II apparatus, using 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 175 V employing a 60–150-s ramp for 30 h. The gels were transferred onto Nytran, hybridized with the TA6.2 probe at 60 °C in 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, washed at 60 °C, and processed for autoradiography. The P-4 protein was isolated as indicated above and assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE analysis using Coomassie Blue staining as described previously (20Soong L. Duboise S.M. Kima P. McMahon-Pratt D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3559-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphomonoesterase activity of purified P-4 protein was assayed by measuring the inorganic phosphate liberated following the hydrolysis of the indicated substrates. As described previously (26Gottlieb M. Dwyer D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the enzymatic activity was assessed using reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) that were composed of 50 mm Tris maleate, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CoCl2, 2.5 mm substrate (e.g. 3′-AMP), and varying amounts of the protein fraction being tested. Nuclease P1 from Penicillin citrinum (Sigma) was used as a positive control. After incubation at 42 °C for 30 min, liberated Pi was measured using a detection buffer containing 0.045% malachite green hydrochloride and 4.2% ammonium molybdate (27Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar), as described by Zlotnick and Gottlieb (28Zlotnick G.W. Gottlieb M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 34% sodium citrate; the absorbances at 660 nm were immediately determined spectrophotometrically. Appropriate dilutions of KH2PO4 were used as standards. Results are expressed as μm of inorganic phosphate(Pi) released per 30 min. Single strand nuclease activity of purified P-4 protein was assayed by measuring the release of acid-soluble nucleotides at 260 nm, following the hydrolysis of either heat-denatured DNA or RNA. As described previously (29Vogt V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 30Shishido K. Habuka N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the standard reaction consisted of 30 μg of single strand salmon sperm DNA (sonicated and then boiled for 15 min before use; Sigma) or yeast tRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm ZnCl2, and varying amounts of the protein fraction being tested. Penicillium citrinum P1 or mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used as a positive control. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by chilling and addition of 0.4 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The sample was clarified by centrifugation, and the absorbance at 260 nm was determined. Result are expressed as nanomoles of nucleotide released per 30 min. The endonuclease activity of the P-4 protein was assessed using covalently closed single-stranded M13mp DNA, a “bubble” DNA substrate, and single strand oligonucleotides. Briefly, covalently closed single-stranded M13mp DNA (0.5 μg) was incubated with different concentrations of P-4 protein at 25 °C in 30 μl of buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 30 mmNaCl, and 1 mm ZnSO4 for 2 h. The reaction was stopped, followed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel; DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and then photographed using Polaroid type 55 film. The P-4 protein was tested for its ability to cleave bubble-structured DNA consisting of a central unpaired region of 29 nucleotide in one strand and 30 nucleotides in the other strand flanked by 30 base pairs on both sides. Substrate was formed by annealing one 90-mer oligonucleotide and one 89-mer oligonucleotide (as indicated below); one of the strands (89- or 90-mer) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′-end. The bubble substrate was gel-purified after annealing the oligonucleotide 5′-CCAGTGATCACATACGCTTTGCTAGGACATCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCAGTGCCACGTTGTATGCCCACGTTGACCG-3′ to the oligonucleotide 5′-CGGTCAACGTGGGCATACAACGTGGCACTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATGTCCTAGCAAAGCGTATGTGATCACTGG-3′ (31O'Donovan A. Davis A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The bubble-structured DNA (2 ng) was incubated with different concentrations of P-4 at 25 °C for different times. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of denaturing solution (95% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol), and samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min. Products were separated on a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography and photographed using a DC 220 ZOOM camera. Size markers were made by labeling of the 10-bp DNA ladder with [γ-32P]ATP. To determine the nucleotide preference of the P-4 nuclease, 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-CGGTCAACGTGGGCATACAACGTGGCACTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATGTCCTAGCAAAGCGTATGTGATCACTGG-3′ or 5′-CCAGTGATCACATACGCTTTGCTAGGACATCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCAGTGCCACGTTGTATGCCCACGTTGACCG-3′ was used as substrate. P-4 digestion was conducted as indicated above, and the products were visualized by autoradiography after resolution in denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. All incubations were carried out on ice. After washing three times in PBS, L. pifanoi amastigotes were incubated in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then washed once in PBS. Fixed cells were then permeabilized by incubation for 5 min, in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100, washed once in PBS, and then incubated in PBS containing 5% FBS and 5% normal goat serum. After washing twice with PBS, amastigotes were then either incubated for 45 min with either normal rabbit serum or anti-P-4 monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-Trypanosoma brucei binding protein (BiP; generously provided by Dr. J. Bangs, University of Wisconsin) diluted in PBS, 5% FBS. The parasites were then washed three times with PBS containing 5% FBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Washed amastigotes were then incubated for 45 min with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Molecular Probes), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Jackson Laboratories, Inc.), and DAPI (1:1000; Sigma). Organisms were then washed, air-dried onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and mounted in aqueous mounting medium (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). Fluorescence was visualized using either a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope; images were digitalized with a film scanner equipped with the microscope. Alternately, the localization of P-4 and/or BiP proteins were examined using confocal microscopy employing a Zeiss axiovert 100 and LSM 510 software. We have previously shown that on SDS-PAGE, affinity purified P-4 appears as a doublet of proteins with estimated molecular masses of 33 and 35 kDa (20Soong L. Duboise S.M. Kima P. McMahon-Pratt D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3559-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation studies, examining the in vivobiochemical processing of these proteins, indicated that the 35-kDa protein is the precursor of the 33-kDa protein (65Duboise S.M. Developmentally Regulated Antigens of Leishmania pifanoi Amastigotes: Characterization, Patterns of Expression, and Immunoprophylactic Potential. Ph.D. Thesis. Yale University, New Haven, CT1994Google Scholar). In agreement with this, the alignment of high pressure liquid chromatography elution profiles of trypsin-digested 33- and 35-kDa proteins indicated that these two proteins were closely related, if not identical (data not shown). The amino acid sequences of the N terminus and eight internal tryptic and/or chymotryptic peptides (Table I) from the 33-kDa P-4 protein were obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on amino acid sequences of peptides II, III, and VII, degenerate oligonucleotides A1, A4, and A5, respectively, were synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures”) using a mixed primer strategy (32Sirakova T.D. Markaryan A. Kolattukudy P.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4208-4218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Frohman M.A. Snincky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 28-38Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of L. pifanoi amastigote RNA employing either A1/A4 or A5/A4 primer sets each yielded a single fragment of approximately 540 or 520 bp, respectively. These PCR products were cloned into pCRTM II vectors; the DNA sequences obtained encoded a polypeptide that included five peptides of trypsin/chymotrypsin-digested P-4 (peptides I–IV, VI, and VII), clearly indicating that these PCR products represented a segment of a cDNA encoding the P-4 protein. To obtain a complete copy of the P-4 gene, a L. pifanoi EMBL3cosgenomic library was screened using a radiolabeled TA6.2 cDNA clone as probe. Two separate phage clones containing genomic P-4gene copies were isolated; subfragments containing the P-4genes were subcloned and sequenced from each phage clone. The two cloned copies of the P-4 gene were found to have identical sequences. The sequence of the cDNA clone TA6.2 was contained within the genomic clones; some differences in the derived protein sequence appeared to exist between the TA6.2 cDNA clone and genomic sequences. These difference did not involve residues involved in either zinc-binding sites nor hypothetically involved in the active site of the enzyme. Furthermore, the completely derived P-4 protein sequence included the chymotryptic peptides V and VIII (Table I), not found within derived protein sequence of the TA6.2 cDNA clone. The final DNA sequence encoding the P-4 protein is shown in Fig.1 A. The gene encoding P-4 is 948 nucleotides in length (Fig. 1 A); the open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 316 amino acids with a predicted mass of 35.1 kDa and predicted pI of 8.9. Based upon the structural features signal peptide, a putative signal peptidase recognition site (34Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) is predicted between Gly-30 (amino acid residue 30) and Trp-31 (Fig.1 A, marked with ▾). This is consistent with the known N-terminal sequence of the 33-kDa protein (Table I). The deduced protein sequence contains two putative N-linked glycosylation sites ( NIT and NTS , Fig. 1 B) at amino acid residues 108–110 and 251–253, as well as potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. The existence of such post-translational modifications, however, needs to be confirmed experimentally. The P-4 proteins have been demonstrated to be membrane-associated (20Soong L. Duboise S.M. Kima P. McMahon-Pratt D. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3559-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the prediction of Gerberet al. (35Gerber L.D. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12168-12173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not likely that P-4 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein. Sequence analyses, however, predicted three putative transmembrane domains from residues 1–38, 134–151, and 286–299. However, based upon the enzymatic activity (see below) of the protein, which is dependent upon zinc-binding site included in residues 138–151, it is unlikely that these residues represent a membrane-spanning region of the protein. To define the biological function of the P-4 protein(s), the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of P-4 were compared with those in the data banks. These analyses indicated similarities in amino acid sequences among the mature P-4 protein (amino acid residues 31–316), and the C-terminal region of L. donovani 3′-nucleotidase/nuclease (3′-NT/Nu; GenBankTM accession number L35078, with an open reading frame of a 477 amino acids), and the zinc-dependentP. citrinum nuclease P1 (GenBankTM accession number P24289, with an open reading frame of a 270 amino acids). Within these regions, P-4 shared"

The oligonucleotides are most frequently targeted to mRNA where they block translation or lead to degradation of the message by RNaseH (1Crooke S.T. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 133-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Alternatively, to inhibit transcription, oligonucleotides are designed to form triplex structures with the sequences in promoter regions of DNA. Both strategies result in down-regulation of the targeted genes and may be useful in the treatment of cancer (2Rubenstein M. Mirochnik Y. Chou P. Guinan P. Methods Find Exp. Clin.

They were especially effective when the antisense function of the targeting RNA was combined with ribozyme activity (12Cantor G.H. Stone D.M. McElwain T.F. Palmer G.H.

Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In another approach, antisense RNAs were designed as an external guide sequence that activated endogenous RNaseP, resulting in degradation of the targeted message (15Werner M. Rosa E. Al Emran O.

To promote stability, the antisense constructs were usually embedded within larger stable RNA molecules such as mRNAs, tRNAs, and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)1 (18Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C.

This combination not only stabilized the RNAs but also directed them either to the cytoplasm (mRNA and tRNA) or to the nuclei (snRNAs). Work in this laboratory showed that in addition to down-regulation of target genes, antisense oligonucleotides could restore the activity of genes inactivated by mutations that affect splicing of pre-mRNA and result in genetic disorders. Restoration of gene activity was accomplished by targeting the splice sites created or activated by several mutations in thalassemia (23Sierakowska H. Sambade M.J. Agrawal S. Kole R. Proc. Natl.

Thus, modification of splicing by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides provides a potential alternative to gene therapy protocols involving the replacement of defective genes. Treatment of patients with genetic diseases with antisense oligonucleotides, which do not remove the mutation but rather repair the defective pre-mRNA, would require lifelong periodic administrations. This drawback would be alleviated if the patients were subjected to treatment with vectors stably expressing the appropriate antisense RNAs. Under these conditions the effects of RNAs should result in long term, if not permanent, restoration of gene expression. A group of snRNAs, U snRNAs, which in cells form ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPS) and are involved in numerous RNA processing reactions (29Baserga S.J. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1993: 359-381Google Scholar, 30Guthrie C. Patterson B. Annu. Rev.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar), appear particularly attractive as carriers for antisense sequences effecting correction of splicing. They are localized in the nucleus (the site of splicing), are stable, are expressed at relatively high levels, and most importantly, interact with their natural RNA targets by base pairing via complementary,i.e. antisense nucleotides. Indeed, we have shown previously that stable expression of U7 snRNAs, which are normally involved in the processing of the 3′-ends of histone pre-mRNAs (32Spycher C. Streit A. Stefanovic B. Albrecht D. Koning T.H. Schumperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4023-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Bond U.M. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A.

Nature. 1986; 323: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but which were modified to target splice sites in the human β-globin gene, led to permanent restoration of correct splicing of thalassemic β-globin pre-mRNA (19Gorman L. Suter D. Emerick V. Schumperli D. Kole R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4929-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated whether U1 snRNA may be used as an effective modifier of splicing. The design of U1 snRNA as an antisense agent for modification of splicing was based on several considerations. There are approximately 1 × 106 copies of U1 per cell as compared with 5 × 103 copies of U7 snRNA molecules (29Baserga S.J. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1993: 359-381Google Scholar). Because there are 30 functional U1 genes (36Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Birnstiel M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Particles. Springer, Berlin1988: 38-70Crossref Google Scholar) and only one U7 gene (37Gruber A. Soldati D. Burri M. Schumperli D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Grimm C. Stefanovic B. Schumperli D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the expression of U1 snRNA per gene copy is still approximately 6-fold higher than that of U7, making U1 potentially a more attractive antisense carrier than the modified U7 snRNA. Experiments reported here show that U1 snRNA targeted to the 3′- but not the 5′-splice site could be used for antisense repair of aberrantly spliced thalassemic human β-globin pre-mRNA. The HeLa cell line carrying the thalassemic IVS2-705 human β-globin gene (39Sierakowska H. Montague M. Agrawal S. Kole R. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 1173-1182Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the cell lines stably expressing the modified U7 snRNAs (19Gorman L. Suter D. Emerick V. Schumperli D. Kole R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4929-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were grown in minimum essential medium modified for suspension cells (S-MEM), 5% fetal calf sera, 5% horse sera, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 200 μg/ml kanamycin. Cotransfection of the HeLa IVS2-705 cells with a plasmid carrying a hygromycin-resistance gene and a U1.U7.324 snRNA expressing plasmid (see below and Fig. 5 A) in the presence of LipofectAMINE (8 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc., as recommended by the manufacturer), was used to generate the stable cell line. Stable transfectants were isolated after selection in media containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin. The wild type U1 plasmid (U1.wt) was a kind gift from Dr. W. Marzluff (University of North Carolina). It contains the mouse U1 snRNA gene, U1 promoter, and 3′ sequences. In the U1.309, U1.318, and U1.324 constructs, the natural 9 nucleotide sequence (nt. 3–11) complementary to pre-mRNA 5′ splice sites was replaced with a 9-, 18-, or 24-nucleotide sequence complementary to the cryptic 3′ splice site activated by the IVS2-705 mutation. In the U1.Beta and U1.524 construct, the same 9-nucleotide sequence (nt. 3–11) was replaced with 168 nucleotides from the second intron (IVS2-549-717) or 24 nucleotides complementary to the 5′ splice site, respectively. In the U1.U7.324 construct, nearly the entire U1 gene (nt. 3–161) was replaced with the U7.324 gene, whereas theU1 promoter and 3′ sequences were retained. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis methods were used in all the above constructions (40Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar, 41Jones D.H. Winistorfer S.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (, 532, 534–535): 528-530PubMed Google Scholar). Refer to (19Gorman L. Suter D. Emerick V. Schumperli D. Kole R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For all experiments, HeLa IVS2-705 cells were plated 24 h before treatment in 24-well plates at 105 cells per 2-cm2 well. All HeLa cell lines were grown in S-MEM, 5% fetal calf sera, 5% horse sera, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 200 μg/ml kanamycin. The cells were treated for 10 h with the modified snRNA plasmids (indicated in the figure legends) complexed with 8 μg/ml LipofectAMINE or 8 μg/ml DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.). Unless otherwise indicated, the RNA was isolated 24-h post-transfection. Note that the variability of efficiency of transfection between experiments may be responsible for the differences in the effects of U7.324 seen in Figs. 2 B,3, 4 A, and 6 A. This variability is much less pronounced within a single experiment, and therefore the comparisons of the efficiency of correction within an experiment are more accurate.Figure 5A, structure of U1.U7.324 snRNA construct.

RNA (200 ng) was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using rTth DNA polymerase as recommended by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To maintain the linear concentration-dependent response, PCR was carried out for 18 cycles (42Chen I.T. Chasin L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with the addition of 0.2 μCi of [α-32P]dATP to the PCR reaction mixture. Correction of human β-globin pre-mRNA was detected with forward and reverse primers spanning positions 21–43 of exon 2 and positions 6–28 of exon 3, respectively, in β-globin mRNA. RT-PCR products were separated on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and autoradiographed with Kodak BioMax film. The assay was performed using the RPA II Ribonuclease Protection Assay Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) with probes antisense to the regions containing the U1.324, U1.524, or U1.U7.324 snRNA genes. The probes included 258 nucleotides complementary to the U1.324 or U1.524 plasmids and 145 nucleotides from the U1.U7.324 plasmid. Probes generated from U1.524 and U1.324 (mouse U1a) hybridize with endogenous human U1 snRNA (U1a) with 1-base pair mismatch resulting in a 152-base pair band after RNase digestion. U1.524 and U1.324 snRNAs are detected as 176-base pair bands. The digestion of the U1.U7.324 (mouse U7) probe generates a 62-nucleotideU7-protected band; this probe does not hybridize with endogenous human U7 snRNA. Following transient transfection, 1 μg of total cellular RNA or 1 μg of tRNA was hybridized at 44 °C overnight with 0.5 μl of radiolabeled probe in the hybridization buffer. Following RNase treatment, samples were separated on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and autoradiographed with Kodak BioMax film. Transfected cells were treated with hemin (10 μm, Fluka, Switzerland) in serum free medium for 4 h immediately preceding the isolation of protein. Blots of proteins separated on a 10% Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel (43Schagger H. von Jagov G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) were incubated with polyclonal affinity purified chicken anti-human hemoglobin IgG as primary antibody and rabbit anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibody (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY). The blots were developed with an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All autoradiograms were captured by a Dage-MTI CCD72 video camera (Michigan City, IN), and the images were processed using NIH IMAGE 1.61. NIH IMAGE was also used for quantification of the autoradiograms. Correctly spliced β-globin mRNA was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiograms, and the results were expressed as the percentage of correct product relative to the sum of the correct and aberrant products. The results were corrected to account for the 2-fold higher [32P]dAMP content of the PCR product derived from aberrantly spliced mRNA than that from correctly spliced mRNA. A T→G mutation at nucleotide 705 of intron 2 in human β-globin pre-mRNA (IVS2-705) generates an aberrant donor (5′) splice site and activates a cryptic acceptor (3′) splice site 126 nucleotides upstream from the mutation. As a result, IVS2-705 pre-mRNA is spliced incorrectly, and the β-globin mRNA retains a fragment of the intron (Fig.1 A). This fragment prevents proper translation of β-globin leading to reduced levels of hemoglobin and to β-thalassemia (44Schwartz E. Benz E.J. Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S.J. Furie B. Cohen H.J. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practices. Churchill Livingstone, New York1991: 586-610Google Scholar). Success in utilizing modified U7 constructs that had the 18 nucleotide anti-histone pre-mRNA sequence replaced with the anti-IVS2-705 sequence, as well as contained a modified Sm sequence (SmOPT), prompted the modification of U1 snRNA as an antisense carrier. To block aberrant splicing and induce correct splicing of the IVS2-705 β-globin pre-mRNA, a series of modified U1 snRNAs, containing sequences antisense to the aberrant 3′ splice site were generated (Fig.1 B). The length of the antisense sequences in the constructs ranged from 9 to 168 nucleotides. Transfection of HeLa cells stably expressing IVS-705 β-globin pre-mRNA with U1.309 resulted in barely detectable correction of β-globin splicing (Fig. 2 A,lane 2). In the U1.309 construct, the 9 nucleotides, which in native U1 snRNA are antisense to the 5′ splice site, were replaced with nucleotides complementary to the cryptic 3′ splice site in the β-globin intron. This modification does not change the overall length of U1 snRNA and therefore should not destabilize it. Thus, the negative result suggests that the antisense sequence was not able to compete with the splicing factors that assembled at the 3′ splice site during aberrant splicing of IVS2-705 pre-mRNA. This assumption was further supported by the findings that the levels of splicing correction by U1.318 and U1.324, containing, respectively, 18 and 24 nucleotide antisense sequences (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and4) were increased in a manner commensurate with the length of the inserted sequence. Further elongation of the antisense sequence to 168 nucleotides (U1.Beta, Fig. 2 A, lane 5), abolished rather than enhanced correction of splicing. The β antisense sequence, which extends through the putative branch points and the aberrant 3′and 5′ splice sites in the IVS2-705 β-globin intron, was expected to interfere with aberrant splicing on the basis of its effect when placed in the modified U7 gene (U7.Beta, Fig.2 B, lane 3). Unlike in U1 snRNA, the U7.Beta and U7.324 corrected splicing to a similar degree (Fig. 2 B,lanes 2 and 3). This suggests that the long antisense sequence affects the structure, stability, and/or interaction of the U1 and U7 particles with the target sequences in a very different manner. We have compared in more detail the ability of the two similar U7 and U1 snRNAs, i.e. those with 24 nucleotide antisense sequences, U7.324 and U1.324, to correct IVS2-705 pre-mRNA splicing. For both snRNAs, transient transfection of IVS2-705 HeLa cells resulted in dose-dependent correction of splicing (Fig. 3, lanes 6–11). Quantitation of the results by densitometry (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that at 1 μg of DNA plasmids per 105 cells, the level of correction was as high as 56 and 70% for the U1.324 and U7.324 constructs, respectively. The effect of U1.324 was dependent on the antisense sequence because the transfection of the cells with a plasmid expressing wild-type U1 snRNA did not restore correct splicing of β−globin IVS2-705 pre-mRNA (Fig. 3,lanes 3–5). The fact that transfection with U1.324 and U7.324 plasmids led to efficient correction of splicing of IVS2-705 pre-mRNA indicated that the 24-nucleotide antisense sequence did not destabilize the snRNPs, and that it bound to the 3′ splice site strongly enough to inhibit aberrant splicing. Because modified U7.524 snRNA targeted to the aberrant IVS2-705 5′ splice site was effective in correction of splicing (Fig.4 A, lane 3), it seemed possible that U1.524 might be similarly effective. However, as shown in Fig. 4 A, lane 5, U1.524 did not correct β-globin splicing; other constructs, U1.324, U7.524, and U7.324, were active as expected (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–4). To confirm that the inability of the U1.524 construct to correct splicing was not because of lack of its expression, an RNase protection assay was performed (Fig. 4 B). Densitometry analysis of the autoradiogram indicated that both U1.324 and U1.524 were expressed in transient transfections at comparable levels (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 6). Comparison of the intensity of the bands representing anti-thalassemic and endogenous U1 snRNAs (176 and 152 nucleotides, respectively) indicated that these RNAs were expressed at, approximately, a 1:5 ratio. Thus, assuming that the wild-type U1 snRNA is present at 106 copies per cell (29Baserga S.J. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1993: 359-381Google Scholar), the amount of modified U1.324 and U1.524 was estimated to equal 2–3 × 105 copies per cell. In an attempt to further improve the effectiveness of snRNA-based vectors, we combined the strong U1 promoter and terminator sequences with the coding sequence of the modified U7.324 gene. In transient transfections with 1 μg of plasmid, this construct (U1.U7.324, Fig.5 A) was effective, resulting in approximately 70% correction of β-globin splicing (Fig.5 B, lane 2), whereas the U7.324 gene controlled by the U7 promoter (Fig. 5 B, lane 3) corrected splicing to approximately 60%. This small increase in correction efficiency was consistent with the higher level of U1.U7.324 expression over that of the U7.324 construct (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3 and 4). The effectiveness of the U7.324 and U1.U7.324 constructs was compared in a time-course experiment in transiently transfected cells. For both constructs, correctly spliced β−globin mRNA became detectable 12-h post-transfection (Fig.6 A, lanes 4 and5), and its level increased in a time-dependent fashion at the 24- and 48-h time points (Fig. 6 A,lanes 6–9). There was no further increase 72-h post-transfection (Fig. 6 A, lanes 10–11). At every time point, the level of correction effected by U1.U7.324 snRNA was higher than that by U7.324 snRNA. The average of the results from this figure and Fig. 5 indicates that the U1.U7.324 construct is approximately 30% more effective in splicing correction than its U7-only counterpart. The RNase protection assay shows that the time course of splicing correction is consistent with the levels of expression of the two constructs (Fig. 6 B). The U7.324 snRNA is not yet generated 6-h post-transfection but is clearly detectable at 12–72-h time points, and its levels are higher upon transcription from the U1 promoter (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5, 7, 9 and11 versus lanes 6, 8, 10, and 12, respectively). Interestingly, translation of β−globin protein was delayed relative to transcription and splicing because it was not detectable for 24-h post-transfection (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2–5); β−globin was translated 24 h later (Fig.6 C, lanes 6–9). However, although an increasing time-dependent correction of splicing is confirmed by the Western blot, a quantitative difference between the U7 and U1.U7 constructs is not evident. This may be because of low sensitivity of the Western blot or loading error. Note that this error is eliminated in RT-PCR assays by comparing the ratio of the spliced products. Because the main advantage of vector-transcribed antisense RNA over synthetic antisense oligonucleotides is the possibility of stable intracellular expression, a U1.U7.324-expressing IVS2-705 HeLa cell line was generated. As expected, correct splicing of IVS2-705 pre-mRNA was restored very efficiently (77%) and persisted at this level throughout the time of culture (Fig.7). The growth rate of the cell line was comparable with that of the wild-type HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that the modified U7 snRNA is not toxic to the cells.

Mature human adipocytes and 3T3 L1-preadipocytes contain a plasma membrane-bound H2O2 generating system that is under antagonistic control by various hormones, growth factors, and cytokines, including ligands of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, such as insulin and various isoforms of PDGF and FGF (6Krieger-Brauer H.I.

Recent work revealed that the stimulatory effect of insulin on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation is transduced by a G protein (Gαi2), whereas the inhibitory action of the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, which signals through a prototypical Gs-coupled receptor, is mediated by Gβγ derived from Gs (13Krieger-Brauer H.I.

In this work we examined whether the inhibitory effect of bFGF, another ligand of tyrosine kinase receptors, on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation is also transmitted by a G protein. Antibodies directed against the C terminus of Gαs(RM/1), common anti-Gβ (SW/1), and anti-Gβ1/2 were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Bad Homburg, Germany (RM/1 and SW/1), and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY, respectively.

Human albumin and luminol were obtained from Behring Werke, Marburg, Germany. The GST fusion protein containing a carboxyl-terminal fragment (residues 546–670) of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK 1CT-GST) and the corresponding GST protein were a gift of Dr. R.

Briefly, adipose tissue was from nondiabetic subjects undergoing elective abdominal or cosmetic breast surgery. The specimens were cut into small pieces, and fat cells were isolated by the method of Rodbell (17Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a HEPES-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 20 g/liter albumin, and 1 mg/ml collagenase (CLS, Worthington). After 30 min, fat cells were washed and re-suspended in 10 volumes of an ice-cold lysing medium containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmKCl, and 100 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor. Mechanical shaking completed cell lysis, and fat cell ghosts were collected by low speed centrifugation (1,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). Similar to other effector systems, such as adenylyl cyclases, it is difficult to assess the effects of inhibitory ligands on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation under basal conditions, where enzyme activity is low. Since direct activators of NADPH oxidase are presently unknown, enzyme activity was increased by insulin, which stimulates NADPH oxidase via Gαi2 (12Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol.

Plasma membranes from untreated or insulin-treated cells were first exposed to hormones and growth factors and were then assayed for NADPH oxidase activity. The activation step was carried out in 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, containing 120 mm KCl, 1.4 CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1% human albumin. Membranes were first incubated with various concentrations of hormones and growth factors for 5 min to allow receptor occupation. Thereafter, guanine nucleotides were added, as indicated. After 20 min, ghosts were collected by centrifugation, washed, and then re-suspended in 30 mm MES, pH 5.8, containing 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm NaN3, 250 μm NADPH, and 10 μm FAD for determination of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. Reactions were started by addition of 250 μm NADPH and terminated after 30 min at 37 °C by adding HCl to yield a final concentration of 100 μm (10Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of G protein antibodies on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, membranes were first exposed to antibodies at 0 °C for 45 min and were then subjected to the two-step procedure described above. In contrast to other G proteins, Gαs does not dissociate in the presence of GTPγS alone under the conditions used in the present experiments (18Toyoshige M. Okuya S. Rebois R.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Toyoshige M. Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. J. Biol.

Plasma membranes (80 μg) were suspended in 200 μl of MOPS (30 mm, pH 7.5) containing 120 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% human serum albumin in the absence or presence of 0.3 nm bFGF for 5 min at ambient temperature. Thereafter, 50 μm GTPγS was added and incubations were continued for another 25 min. The membranes were recovered by centrifugation and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 0 °C. Gswas immunoprecipitated by an antibody directed against the COOH terminus of Gαs (RM/1), which does not discriminate between heterotrimeric and monomeric Gαs (18Toyoshige M. Okuya S. Rebois R.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Toyoshige M. Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8791-8795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, proteinase inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μmleupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 1 unit/ml aprotinin), antibody RM/1 (at a dilution of 1:80), and 50 μm GTPγS. The samples (30 μg of membrane protein/100 μl of precipitation buffer) were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were captured with protein A-agarose beads and washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and proteinase inhibitors). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was performed using anti-Gαs (RM/1) and anti-Gβ (SW/1) antibodies (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and quantified by densitometric analysis. The amount of Gβ was normalized to the amount of Gαs immunoprecipitated for each condition. Adenylyl cyclase activity of human fat cell plasma membranes was determined in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μm GTP, 10 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.1 mg creatine kinase, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 100 μl (20Katada T. Amano T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3739-3746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by addition of 3–5 μg of membrane protein and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of isoproterenol or bFGF, as indicated. Reactions were terminated by 100 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid (5%). cAMP was determined by radioimmunoassay after neutralization. For determination of cellular cAMP, isolated adipocytes (50,000 cells) were incubated in HEPES-buffered Krebs-Henseleit solution, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 2% human serum albumin, and isoproterenol or bFGF, as indicated, for 15 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Incubations were terminated by an equal volume of 5% ice-cold perchloric acid, and cAMP was determined as described above. Fig. 1 A shows the effects of 0.1 nm bFGF on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation in the presence of increasing concentrations of GTPγS in membranes from cells that had been pretreated with 10 nm insulin. Similar to early observations with the turkey erythrocyte adenylyl cyclase, where activation by GMP(PNP) appeared to be totally dependent on hormone because the hormone-independent rate of activation was slow, GTPγS alone had no measurable effect under the conditions used (21Orly J. Schramm M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3433-3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The inhibitory action of bFGF became apparent at concentrations of GTPγS exceeding 5 μm and was half-maximal at approximately 10 μm GTPγS. At a maximal concentration of GTPγS (50 μm), NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was reduced by approximately two-thirds in the presence of 0.1 nm bFGF. Fig. 1 B shows a concentration-response curve for bFGF in the presence of a maximal concentration of GTPγS (50 μm). The bFGF-induced inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was half-maximal at about 1 pm and was maximal at approximately 30 pm. Recent work showed that the effects of another inhibitor of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, are transduced by βγ subunits derived from Gs (13Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Sattel B. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2486-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility was explored that the effects of bFGF were also mediated by Gβγ. Indeed, the inhibitory action of bFGF was dose-dependently reversed by an antibody directed against an internal sequence of β1/β2 subunits which had no influence on basal or insulin-stimulated rates of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation (Fig. 2 A). Maximal effects were observed at an antibody dilution of 1:100 in the presence of 0.3 nm bFGF (Fig. 2 A). The inhibitory effect of bFGF could also be reversed by 10 μm βARK-1CT, a fragment of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase that specifically binds free Gβγ (16Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reversal of the bFGF-induced suppression of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was half-maximal at 0.5 μm βARK-1CT, maximal effects were observed at 10 μm (Fig. 2 B). The GST protein alone failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of isoproterenol and bFGF (not shown). Fig. 3 shows the effects of aFGF, bFGF, and insulin on Gs subunit composition. In contrast to other heterotrimeric G proteins, Gs does not dissociate in the presence of GTPγS alone under the conditions used (18Toyoshige M. Okuya S. Rebois R.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Toyoshige M. Basi N.S. Rebois R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8791-8795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were therefore treated with 50 μm GTPγS in the absence or presence of 0.3 nm bFGF, 3 nmaFGF, or 5 nm insulin. Dissociation of Gs into its component subunits was monitored by an immunoblot technique utilizing antibody RM/1, which does not discriminate between heterotrimeric and monomeric Gαs. Fig. 3 demonstrates that the amount of Gβ recovered in RM/1 immunoprecipitates was selectively reduced in membranes that had been pretreated with bFGF, while aFGF and insulin failed to influence the subunit composition of immunoprecipitated Gs. In the absence of GTPγS, bFGF had no influence on the subunit composition of Gs. Thus, the growth factor caused a guanine nucleotide triphosphate-dependent dissociation of Gs which is characteristic for a receptor-mediated activation. The latter finding suggested that bFGF may also stimulate adenylyl cyclase, which was in fact the case. Fig.4 shows the effects of bFGF and isoproterenol on cAMP production and NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation in human fat cell plasma membranes. bFGF caused a concentration-dependent increase of cAMP accumulation that became apparent at picomolar concentrations, suggesting that it was transmitted by discrete ligand-specific receptors (Fig. 4 A). Compared with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, which elicited a 6-fold increase in cAMP production, bFGF was able to induce only a modest (3-fold) activation of adenylyl cyclase in fat cell plasma membranes (Fig. 4 A), whereas both compounds were of comparable efficacy in suppressing NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation (Fig. 4 B). The differential ability of isoproterenol and bFGF to increase cAMP became even more apparent in intact cells, where a bFGF-induced increase in cAMP was only detectable in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutylmethylxanthine). On the average, cellular cAMP levels were doubled by 10 nm bFGF under these conditions, a figure that contrasts to a more than 100-fold elevation seen in the presence of 1 μm isoproterenol, consistent with recent observations in NIH 3T3 cells (22Pursiheimo J.P. Jalkanen M. Taskén K. Jaakola P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the effects of a COOH-terminal decapeptide (peptide 385–395), a sequence comprising residues 100–119 within the α-helical domain of Gαs(peptide 100–119), and a homologous sequence of Gαt on the bFGF-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and the inhibitory action of the growth factor on insulin-stimulated rates of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. At the concentrations used, both the COOH-terminal and the α-helical Gαs peptide inhibited the stimulatory effect of bFGF on cAMP formation. By contrast, the inhibitory effect of bFGF on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was only reversed by peptide 100–119 whereas the COOH-terminal decapeptide had no effect. The effects of the peptide 100–119 were specific in as much as a homologous peptide derived from Gαt had no influence on the antagonistic effects of bFGF on cAMP production and H2O2 generation. In addition, the peptide did not influence the stimulatory effect of insulin, which is mediated via Gαi2. In this report it is shown that bFGF, a ligand of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, stimulates adenylyl cyclase and inhibits NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation in human fat cell plasma membranes. The mechanisms by which bFGF elicited its antagonistic stimulatory and inhibitory effects on adenylyl cyclase and NADPH oxidase were confined to the plasma membrane, independent of second messengers, and operated in the absence of ATP, indicating that established pathways of signal transduction, including the tyrosine kinase activity of bFGF receptor(s) were not involved. Along with the observation that bFGF promoted dissociation of Gs these findings suggested that FGF receptor(s) are directly coupled to Gs, via a non-tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism. Indeed, human adipocytes express at least two members of the FGF receptor family, e.g. FGFR1 and FGFR2. Both isoforms co-eluted with Gαs and Gβ upon affinity chromatography on Sepharose coupled to antibodies directed against their carboxyl-terminal sequences and hence may both contribute to bFGF-signaling via Gs. 2H. I. Krieger-Brauer, unpublished results. Antibodies directed against the COOH termini of Gα subunits and peptides corresponding to their target sequences are thought to block receptor recognition and activation, and are therefore widely used in functional studies aimed at assessing receptor/G protein coupling (23Stehno-Bittel L.

The stimulatory effect of bFGF on adenylyl cyclase could be blocked by COOH-terminal anti-Gαs and a peptide corresponding to its antigenic site, indicating that it was in fact transmitted by Gαs. The bFGF-induced inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation also required the participation of a G protein. In contrast to its stimulatory effects on adenylyl cyclase, the inhibitory action of bFGF appeared to be mediated via Gβγ subunits, however, based on observations that this latter effect was specifically reversed by anti-Gβ or a COOH-terminal β-adrenergic receptor kinase fragment (βARK-CT) that sequesters free Gβγ, and was mimicked by exogenously supplied Gβγ subunits (14Krieger-Brauer H.I.

Physiol. 1997; 502: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to the stimulatory effect of bFGF on adenylyl cyclase, its inhibitory action on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation was not influenced by COOH-terminal anti-Gαs. A possible explanation for this unexpected finding would be that activation of Gs by bFGF receptors may not yield enough, or inappropriately composed, βγ subunits to account for inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, as has been proposed for the regulation of type II adenylyl cyclase (27Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bayewitch M.L. Avidor-Reiss T. Levy R. Pfeuffer T. Nevo I. Simonds W.F. Vogel Z.

However, the effects of COOH-terminal Gα antibodies on Gβγ-mediated responses are variable and may depend on receptors, G proteins, and cell types studied (13Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U.

Therefore, the lacking effects of COOH-terminal anti-Gαs do not permit conclusions to be made about the origin of the Gβγ complexes transmitting the inhibitory action of bFGF. Indeed, we have recently shown that Gs is capable of providing enough appropriately composed Gβγ subunits to account for the inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation seen in the presence of isoproterenol (14Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Sattel B. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2486-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, bFGF was considerably less efficacious than isoproterenol in activating adenylyl cyclase, although both compounds were of comparable efficacy in inhibiting of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation. It is possible that the differential effect of bFGF on both systems is merely an apparent one, because the adenylyl cyclase assays contained GTP, whereas NADPH oxidase activity was determined in the presence of GTPγS. However, the differential ability of bFGF and isoproterenol to act as stimulators of adenylyl cyclase occurred under identical conditions and was even more pronounced in intact cells, indicating that it was physiologically relevant. A possible explanation, among others, for this difference would be that activated β-adrenergic receptors recruit more Gs for signaling than the receptor(s) for bFGF. It therefore appeared possible that βγ complexes derived from G proteins other than Gs participated in bFGF receptor signaling. Indeed, it has been reported that bFGF receptor(s) may also couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in certain cell types (29Sa G. Fox P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3219-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fedorov Y.V. Jones N.C. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5780-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To obtain definitive information about the origin of the Gβγ complexes transmitting the inhibitory effects of bFGF, we utilized a peptide comprising residues 100–119 of Gαs (K-20). Recent work showed that this peptide antagonized the antagonistic effects of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol on adenylyl cyclase and NADPH oxidase that are transmitted by Gαs and Gβγs, respectively (13Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Hebling U. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28308-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Sattel B. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2486-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The present studies revealed that peptide 100–119 reversed the effects of bFGF on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation and cAMP production as well. The peptide did not influence the stimulatory effect of insulin, which is mediated by Gαi2. In addition, a homologous peptide derived from Gαt had no influence on the antagonistic effects of bFGF on cAMP production and H2O2 generation, indicating that peptide 100–119 is specific for Gαs, and does not block the interactions of receptors with other G proteins. Thus, the latter finding strongly supported the view that the βγ subunits mediating the bFGF-induced inhibition of NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation were exclusively derived from Gs. G proteins are typically coupled to heptahelical receptors. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that G proteins may be responsible for transmitting signals of other types of receptors as well, including receptor kinases. Aside from the stimulatory effect of insulin on NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation, which is mediated by Gαi2 (12Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), these include activation of cardiac adenylyl cyclase by epidermal growth factor through Gαs and induction of fibroblast transformation by TGFβ1 via Gαi1, respectively (31Nair B.G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19851-19857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The receptors of some growth factors, such as insulin and epidermal growth factor, may couple to multiple G proteins (12Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol.

Intriguingly, at least one ligand of a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, insulin-like growth factor-1, appears to be capable of utilizing Gα as well as Gβγ subunits for signaling, albeit in different cells (35Luttrell M. van Biesen T.

However, bFGF is the first example of a ligand of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases that has been shown to be capable of signaling through both types of G protein subunits of a single class of heterotrimeric G proteins in a single cell type. As pointed out recently (14Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Sattel B. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2486-2490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which Gαi2 (which mediates the stimulatory effects of insulin) and Gβγs modulate the activity of the human fat cell oxidase remain to be defined. Current knowledge suggests that activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by ligand-receptor complexes is achieved by exchange of GTP for GDP on the α-subunit, and this is thought to faciltate dissociation into α and βγ subunits (38Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar,39Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). G protein-sensitive effectors are then directly regulated by GTP-liganded α-subunits, βγ subunits, or both (38Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 39Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Consistently, the mechanisms by which insulin and bFGF modulated NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation were confined to the plasma membrane and were independent of soluble second messengers, making it likely that activated Gαi2and Gβγs acted upon NADPH oxidase directly. However, indirect mechanisms of action involving intermediate membrane-associated effectors or association of Gαi2 and Gβγs to yield the inactive Gi2 heterotrimer cannot definitively be ruled out (40Knaus U.G.

The generation of H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species seems to be a common signaling event for hormones and cytokines that regulate cell growth and differentiation (40Knaus U.G. Morris S.

Consistently, previous work from this laboratory revealed that growth factors that stimulated NADPH-dependent H2O2 generation promoted adipogenesis in 3T3 L1-preadipocytes, whereas inhibitory ligands, such as bFGF, were antiadipogenic (6Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it has been reported that inhibition of adipogenesis may be mediated via a Gs pathway that does not involve cAMP (45Wang H.Y. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The finding that the signal of bFGF, an inhibitor of adipogenesis, is transduced by βγ subunits that are derived from Gs is consistent with these latter observations and provides further evidence in support of the concept that the H2O2 produced in response to hormones, growth factors, and cytokines may be important in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and maintenance of the differentiated state. The physiological role of the bFGF-induced stimulation of cAMP production, if any, is currently unknown. In intact cells, a measurable elevation of cAMP levels by bFGF was only observed in the simultaneous presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that bFGF has no lipolytic activity in human adipocytes.2 An interesting possibility that will be addressed in future studies is raised by observations in hamster fibroblasts showing that bFGF alone has no effects on cAMP levels but may be capable of potentiating the effects of other stimulators of adenylyl cyclase via activation of Gs (46Magnaldo I. Pouyssegur J. Paris S. Cell. Signal. 1989; 1: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present findings show that bFGF, a ligand of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, is capable of utilizing Gαs as well as Gβγs for dual signaling in a single cell type via a non-kinase-dependent mechanism, and suggest a physical interaction of one or more members of the FGF receptor family with Gs. These results confirm and extend recent observations demonstrating that the human fat cell oxidase is under antagonistic control by Gα and Gβγ subunits derived from different G proteins and provide further evidence in support of the concept that this membrane-bound redox system represents an universal effector system for hormones, growth factors, and cytokines linking ligand binding to cell surface receptors to changes in the intracellular redox equilibrium.

https://openalex.org/W1525116553,"Abstract A histidine-binding protein has been isolated from the shock fluid of osmotically shocked Salmonella typhimurium and has been purified by conventional techniques. It has a molecular weight of 25,000 and binds 1 histidine molecule per molecule of protein. The binding protein is stable to wide variations of temperature, ionic strength, and pH. It binds histidine with a Kd of 1.5 µm. The protein also binds arginine but with a much weaker affinity. The transport of histidine by Salmonella typhimurium was found to be an energy-dependent process. The Km for histidine was 0.07 µm when measured by the growing cells method but it was 1 µm when determined in the presence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Histidine transport is inhibited by large excesses of arginine. Osmotically shocked exhibit a reduction in the initial rate and the steady state level of histidine accumulation. The simultaneous release of the histidine-binding protein and the reduction of transport caused by osmotic shock, as well as the similarity of kinetic constants and specificity of the binding protein and the histidine permease system suggest that the histidine-binding protein is a functional component of the histidine permease system."

Plasmin then degrades fibrin, yielding soluble fibrin degradation products. Through a positive feedback mechanism, fibrin enhances its own degradation by stimulating t-PA-mediated Pg activation. To potentiate this reaction, fibrin acts as a template onto which both t-PA and Pg bind (3Horrevoets A.J. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

The activator and its substrate bind to independent sites on intact fibrin because the t-PA interaction is primarily mediated by its fibronectin finger-like domain, whereas Pg binding is kringle-dependent (3Horrevoets A.J.

As a functional consequence of t-PA and Pg interaction with fibrin, the catalytic efficiency of t-PA-mediated Pg activation is 2–3 orders of magnitude greater in the presence of fibrin than in its absence (1Hoylaerts M.

In contrast to the potent stimulatory effect of fibrin, fibrinogen (Fg) produces only a 25-fold enhancement in the catalytic efficiency of Pg activation by t-PA (1Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R.

Because t-PA preferentially activates Pg in the presence of fibrin rather than Fg, it is designated a fibrin-specific Pg activator.

Recently, we demonstrated that (DD)E compromises the fibrin specificity of t-PA, because this soluble fragment is as potent as fibrin at stimulating Pg activation by t-PA (10Stewart R.J.

In contrast to its predominantly finger-dependent interaction with fibrin, t-PA binds to (DD)E via its second kringle domain (4Nesheim M.E. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol.

Although Pg also binds to (DD)E in a kringle-dependent fashion, the activator and substrate do not compete for (DD)E binding, indicating that they have distinct binding sites (5Stewart R.J.

A latent carboxypeptidase B (CPB)-like enzyme, termed thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), has recently been identified in plasma (13Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpé S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). When activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, activated TAFI (TAFIa) attenuates fibrinolysis, presumably by removing carboxyl-terminal lysine residues on fibrin, thereby removing the newly exposed binding sites for Pg that are generated as fibrin is degraded by plasmin (16Sakharov D.V. Plow E.F. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14477-14482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,17Nesheim M.E. Fibrinolysis and Proteolysis. 1999; 13: 72-77Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TAFIa prevents the 2.5-fold rate enhancement of Pg activation that occurs during the early stages of fibrinolysis and blocks the conversion of Glu-Pg to the more readily activated Lys-Pg, a process also dependent on exposure of new carboxyl-terminal lysine residues (18Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, TAFIa eliminates the enhancement of Pg activation associated with partial degradation of fibrin by plasmin. Given its mechanism of action, we speculated that TAFIa or CPB would compromise the cofactor activity of (DD)E by abrogating Pg and/or t-PA binding. To explore this possibility, the ability of (DD)E to potentiate Pg activation by t-PA was examined before and after exposure of (DD)E to TAFIa or CPB. Herein we demonstrate that the stimulatory activity of (DD)E is nearly abolished upon exposure to TAFIa or CPB. Because plasmin generation in the presence of TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E is less than that with native (DD)E, TAFIa or CPB attenuates degradation of (DD)E into its constitutive fragments, E and DD, the latter of which can impair fibrin polymerization. To explore the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon, light scattering spectroscopy was used to compare the affinities of TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E for Glu-Pg, Lys-Pg, or t-PA with those of native (DD)E. TAFIa or CPB exposure reduces the affinity of (DD)E for Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg 2- and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, the affinity of (DD)E for t-PA is reduced 160-fold. These data raise the possibility that by attenuating the systemic plasmin generation induced by (DD)E, TAFIa renders t-PA more fibrin-specific. Wild-type recombinant t-PA, kindly provided by Dr. B. Keyt (Genentech Inc., S.

After a 20-min incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μmd-valyl-phenyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone (VFKCK; Calbiochem) and 1 μm PPACK to inhibit plasmin and t-PA, respectively. Remaining aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and fibrin degradation products were separated using a Biosep-Sec-S3000 size exclusion column (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) fitted to a liquid chromatography system (System Gold; Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA).

Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CPB, potato tuber-derived CPB inhibitor (CPI), and the CPB-directed synthetic substrate hippuryl-l-arginine were purchased from Sigma. CPB activity was assessed by incubating 20 nm CPB with 0.4 mm hippuryl-l-arginine dissolved in 0.02m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBS) in a quartz cuvette. Increases in absorbance at 254 nm were monitored for 20 min at 22 °C using a DU 7400 Spectrophotometer from Beckman (Mississauga, Canada). Under these conditions, CPB has a specific activity of 41 units/mg, where one unit hydrolyzes 1 μmol of hippuryl-l-arginine/min. When the experiment was repeated in the presence of 1 μm CPI, the lowest concentration used to inhibit CPB prior to Pg activation assays, no increase inA 254 was observed, indicating complete CPB inhibition. TAFI was isolated from fresh frozen human plasma by Pg-Sepharose affinity chromatography and activated with thrombin and soluble thrombomodulin as described elsewhere (15Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 26Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the resultant TAFIa against hippuryl-l-arginine was similar to that of CPB. Because TAFIa activity is unstable at room temperature (27Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Marx P.F. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol.

Like CPB, the activity of 20 nm TAFIa was completely inhibited by 1 μm CPI. CPB was used for the majority of experiments because its activity is more stable than that of TAFIa and it does not require preactivation. To demonstrate that TAFIa has effects similar to CPB, however, confirmatory experiments were done using TAFIa. To examine the effect of TAFIa or CPB on the ability of (DD)E to stimulate Pg activation by t-PA, 1.0 ml of a 8 μm (DD)E solution was incubated with 20 nmTAFIa or CPB for 40 min at 22 °C. At intervals, 20-μl aliquots were removed, and 2 μl of 40 μm CPI was added to inhibit the TAFIa or CPB. Complete TAFIa or CPB inhibition was achieved because no residual activity was detected using the CPB-directed synthetic substrate hippuryl-l-arginine. The ability of TAFIa- or CPB-treated (DD)E to stimulate Pg activation was then compared with that of the starting material by adding 20 μl of 2 mm S-2251 and 0.5 nm t-PA to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 0.5 μm Glu-Pg or 0.12 μm Lys-Pg and 0.5 μm (DD)E, dissolved in 80 μl of TBS. Plasmin generation was assessed by measuring absorbance at 405 nm at 30-s intervals for 60 min using a Spectramax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) thermostated at 37 °C. Initial rates of plasmin formation were calculated by dividing the slope determined from the linear portion of the plot ofA 405 versus time squared by the specific activity of plasmin (0.017 optical density units s−1μm−1), which was determined in a separate experiment (5Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Plasmin degrades (DD)E to DD and fragment E (8Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Gaffney P.J. Joe F. Thromb. Res. 1979; 15: 673-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because exposure of (DD)E to CPB or TAFIa reduces its ability to potentiate Pg activation, we examined whether CPB or TAFIa indirectly attenuates (DD)E degradation during t-PA-mediated Pg activation. 4 μm (DD)E that had been exposed to 20 nm CPB for various intervals or to 20 nm TAFIa for 40 min was compared with 4 μm native (DD)E in terms of its ability to stimulate 0.4 μm Glu-Pg activation by 1 nmt-PA. Under these conditions, (DD)E concentrations were sufficient to monitor its degradation by PAGE analysis. After 1 h of incubation, the reaction was made to 1 μm VFKCK and 10 nmPPACK to inhibit plasmin and t-PA, respectively, and a 4-μl aliquot of the reaction solution was then subjected to PAGE analysis under nondenaturing conditions on 4–15% gradient gels, on 10% gels in the presence of SDS, and on 15% gels in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Gels were stained with Fast Stain (Zoion Research, Shrewsbury, MA), and bands were quantified using an ImageMaster Video Documentation System. For amino acid sequencing, protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Ponceau S. Appropriate bands were cut from the membrane and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis, which was performed by Biotechnology Service Center (University of Toronto). To determine whether CPB or TAFIa releases lysine and/or arginine residues from (DD)E, (DD)E was incubated with 20 nm CPB or TAFIa for intervals up to 60 min, and free lysine and arginine were measured using methods similar to those described by Wang et al. (19Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). After dialysis of (DD)E into 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, an 8 μm (DD)E solution was incubated with 20 nmCPB for 60 min at 22 °C. At various times, 100-μl aliquots were removed, and 10-μl of 40 μm CPI was added to inactivate the CPB or TAFIa. The samples were deprotonated by bringing the solution to 0.2 m with perchloric acid followed by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 5 min. After the supernatants were neutralized with potassium hydroxide, the samples were placed on ice, and insoluble potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The concentration of lysine and arginine in the supernatants was determined enzymatically by methods established by Nakatani et al. (29Nakatani Y. Fujioka M. Higashino K. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Gaede et al. (30Gaede G. Grieshaber M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 66: 393-399Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), respectively. For lysine determination, 50 μl of supernatant was added to 40 μl of 0.5 mm NADH (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Canada) and 2.5 mm α-ketoglutaric acid (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 (HBS). Dehydration of NADH was initiated by the addition of 0.33 units of saccharopine dehydrogenase (Sigma) suspended in 10 μl of HBS. Decreases in fluorescence intensity were monitored over 25 min in a Spectra Max, Gemini XS fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 340 and 450 nm, respectively, and fitted with a 435-nm emission cut-off filter. The concentration of lysine was calculated based on a standard curve generated by plotting changes in fluorescence intensity produced by known concentrations of l-lysine (Sigma). Determination of free arginine was accomplished in the same manner using pyruvate (Roche Diagnostics) in place of α-ketoglutaric acid and 0.5 units of octopine dehydrogenase (Sigma) in place of saccharopine dehydrogenase. Standard curves for free arginine determination were generated by plotting changes in fluorescence intensity produced by known concentrations of l-arginine (Sigma). To determine the effects of exposure of (DD)E to TAFIa or CPB on the kinetics of (DD)E-stimulated Pg activation, kinetic parameters for Glu- and Lys-Pg activation by t-PA, measured in the presence of TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E, were compared with those obtained with native (DD)E or in the absence of a cofactor. After exposure of 8 μm (DD)E to 20 nm TAFIa or CPB for 40 min at 22 °C, the reaction was terminated with CPI. Different concentrations of CPI were used to maintain a concentration of CPI in the Pg activation assay between 0.2 and 0.8 μm. This range of CPI concentrations was maintained to ensure CPI levels were well above theK i for inhibiting CPB (31Ryan C.A. Hass G.M. Kuhn R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but low enough so as not to inhibit plasmin (5 μm CPI causes a 7% reduction in the activity of 0.01 μm plasmin). 0.8 μmCPI has no measurable effect on the rate of plasmin formation (data not shown). Glu- or Lys-Pg, in concentrations ranging from 0 to 16 μm, was incubated with 0.1 nm t-PA in the absence or presence of native (DD)E or TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E at concentrations up to 6 μm. Plasmin formation was then monitored using the plasmin-directed substrate S-2251 and rates of Pg activation (υ), determined as described above, were divided by the concentration of activator (υ′) and subjected to nonlinear regression analysis (Table Curve; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, υ′ = ([S] ×k cat)/(K m + [S]), where [S] is the equilibrium concentration of free substrate, calculated for each input concentration of Pg and cofactor as described (3Horrevoets A.J. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Free Glu- and Lys-Pg concentrations were calculated based on their affinities for native (DD)E (K d values of 5.5 and 0.09, respectively) or CPB-exposed (DD)E (K d values of 11 and 0.35 μm, respectively), which were determined as described below. Michaelis-Menten analysis yielded the rate constant (k cat) and Michaelis constant (K m). -Fold stimulation of Pg activation was calculated by dividing the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of native or TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E with that calculated in its absence. Cofactor concentrations were considered saturating when the catalytic efficiency reached a maximum. For comparison purposes, the effect of fibrin and Fg on Glu- and Lys-Pg activation by t-PA was determined as described previously (11Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Leslie B.A. Keyt B.A. Rischke J.A. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10112-10120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The affinities of native or TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E for t-PA, Glu-Pg, or Lys-Pg were quantified using right angle light-scattering spectroscopy in a LS50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (5Stewart R.J.

The solution was excited at 400 or 440 nm, and emission intensities were measured at the same wavelength. Excitation and emission slit widths were set to either 8 or 12 nm, and a 1% attenuation emission filter was used. Changes in scattering intensity were continuously monitored in time drive with the interval time set at 2 s and the response time set at 3 s. Scattering intensities after each addition of ligand were obtained from the time drive profile by averaging scattering intensities observed over a period of at least 100 s. Control titrations were performed to determine the light scattering intensity of t-PA, Glu-Pg, or Lys-Pg alone. The emission intensity (I) of the incident beam after each addition of ligand was corrected for changes due to ligand scattering and dilution. Corrected values were compared with the emission intensity of the target alone (I o). When TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E was used, scattering intensities were corrected for scattering due to the presence of CPI and TAFIa or CPB. These data, together with the total ligand concentration (L o), were fit by nonlinear regression analysis (Table Curve, Jandel Scientific) to Equation 1 (5Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J.

To confirm the binding parameters obtained in this fashion, reverse titrations also were performed wherein 0.1 μm active site-blocked t-PA, Glu-Pg, or Lys-Pg was titrated with native or TAFIa- or CPB-exposed (DD)E. To determine whether CPB or TAFIa treatment of (DD)E modulates its ability to stimulate Pg activation by t-PA, (DD)E was incubated with CPB or TAFIa for intervals up to 40 min. After inhibiting CPB or TAFIa with CPI, the stimulatory activity of CPB- or TAFIa-treated (DD)E was then compared with that of the starting material. When t-PA-mediated activation of Glu-Pg is monitored, plasmin formation is decreased with increasing exposure of (DD)E to CPB (Fig.1, inset) or TAFIa (data not shown). From these data, rates of plasmin formation were calcula"

To investigate the structure and function of IN, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against HIV-1 IN was raised and characterized previously in this laboratory. Among them, mAbs17, -4, and -33 were found to inhibit IN activity in vitro. In this study, we investigated the interaction of N-terminal-specific mAb17 and its isolated Fab fragment with full-length HIV-1 IN(1–288) and its isolated N-terminal, Zn2+-binding domain IN(1–49). Our results show that binding of Zn2+ to IN(1–49) stabilizes the mAb17-IN complex and that dimer dissociation is not required for binding of the Fab. To identify the epitope recognized by mAb17, we developed a protein footprinting technique based on controlled proteolysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Binding was mapped to a region within amino acids Asp25–Glu35. This peptide corresponds to the end of a helix-turn-helix motif in the IN(1–55) NMR structure and contributes to the dimerization of the N-terminal domain. Antibody binding also appears to destabilize the N-terminal helix in this domain. A molecular model of the [IN(1–49)]2·(Fab)1 complex shows Fab binding across the dimer protein and suggests a potential target for drug design. These data also suggest that mAb17 inhibits integrase activity by blocking critical protein-protein interactions and/or by distorting the orientation of the N-terminal α-helix. The relevance of our results to an understanding of IN function is discussed.

The reaction was initiated by addition of 1 μm32P-labeled 21-base pair model viral DNA substrate and incubation was for 30 min.

A high binding microtiter plate was coated with full-length IN(IN-3CS), blocked with bovine serum albumin, and washed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Either mAb17 (■) or Fab17 (▪) were subsequently added as primary antibody, followed by a standard ELISA protocol using a secondary antibody against κ chain (8Asante-Appiah E.

Although the isolated core domain can catalyze an apparent reversal of the joining reaction, called disintegration or splicing (21Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two-domain derivatives containing core and C-terminal domains (residues 49–286) of ASV integrase are capable of carrying out the processing and joining reactions (14Yang Z.-N.

However, deletion of either the N-terminal or C-terminal domain of HIV-1 IN abolishes both the processing and joining reactions in vitro and viral replication in vivo (25Stevenson M. Haggerty S.

With the increase in our understanding of the structure and function of retroviral IN, this enzyme has become an attractive target for new drug development to treat patients with AIDS (28Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Antiviral Res. 1997; 36: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several types of compounds identified byin vitro screening assays were recently found to be potential inhibitors of IN. Some of the compounds bind to the catalytic core domain (28Asante-Appiah E.

However, because they are essential for activity, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of the HIV-1 IN may be considered as possible targets for anti-AIDS drug design (32Pommier Y.

Biochemistry. 1996; 43: 13762-13771Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A library of monoclonal antibodies was raised against purified HIV-1 IN and characterized in our laboratory (34Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several of these mAbs inhibit the enzymatic activities of IN in vitro (8Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among these, mAbs17, -4, and -33 bind to N-terminal, catalytic core, and C-terminal domain of HIV-1 IN, respectively (Fig. 1 A). An understanding of the basis for such inhibition may suggest new approaches for the development of antiviral drugs. We report here the results from analysis of mAb17 binding to the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 IN. Its epitope was mapped to determinants that include the turn of the helix-turn-helix structure that is stabilized by coordination of Zn2+ by the HHCC motif in this domain. Our results support the interpretation that these determinants play a critical role in the formation of the catalytically active protein. They also suggest a possible target for drug design. The construction of plasmid pET29b encoding wild type HIV-1 IN(8) and mutants IN-F185KC2805 (8Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol.

The HIV-1 IN-F185KC2805 or IN-3CS proteins, which have much higher solubility than wild type IN, but wild type activity in vitro (48Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The construction of plasmid pET28b that included a gene encoding the N-terminal domain fragment (amino acids 1–49) with a six-histidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site on the N-terminal end of the protein was also described in a previous report (8Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This plasmid was also expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The N-terminal domain fragment was bound to a HiTrap Ni2+-chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–1.0 m imidazole in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mNaCl. The pool of protein-containing fractions was dialyzed in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol and 0.5 mm CaCl2. The His6tag was removed by cleavage with thrombin, added at a ratio of 1000:1 (mg IN/mg thrombin), and incubated with shaking for 4–6 h at room temperature. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of 5 mm EDTA. The mixture was passed through ap-aminobenzamidine-agarose (Sigma) column to remove the thrombin. The protein was then loaded on a Ni2+-chelating column to remove the His6 tag and any remaining His6-tagged proteins. The fraction not bound to the column was collected and concentrated. As this purified protein includes four amino acid residues, GHSM, fused to its N terminus it is here denoted Gt-IN(1–49). The preparation of ascites from mice and the purification of the anti-HIV-1 IN monoclonal antibodies from the ascites were described previously (34Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To isolate Fab fragments, purified monoclonal antibodies mAb17, -4, or -33 (1–2 mg/ml) were incubated at room temperature with papain (Sigma) at a ratio of mAb/papain = 200:1 (mg/mg) in phosphate-buffered saline (25 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 10 mm cysteine. To monitor the proteolytic process, a 2-μl aliquot was withdrawn every 30 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After digestion, iodoacetamide (Sigma) was added to final concentration 20 mm, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h in the dark to inhibit the papain. To remove the undigested monoclonal antibody and Fc fragments, the preparation was dialyzed in 1 m glycine buffer (pH 8.9) containing 0.5 m NaCl and then loaded on a HiTrap Protein A column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with the above buffer. The fractions containing Fab fragments passed through the column and were pooled. The Fab preparations were purified further by loading the protein on a Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) adapted to a high pressure liquid chromatographic system and eluting with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.5 mNaCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.9). The two most abundant isomeric forms of the mAb 17 Fab fragments were also separated in this step. Both isoforms were equally active in our assays. The collected Fab-containing fractions were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline, concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Centricon 10 (Amicon), and stored in a −20 °C freezer until use. The concentration of Fabs was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay with IgG as a standard or by UV measurement with an extinction coefficiency constant 1.5 g of IgG/liter. Enzymatic activity of HIV-1 IN was determined as reported previously (8Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN proteins (either wild type or IN-3CS or Gt-IN(1–49)) was applied to 96-well, high-binding microtiter plates by overnight incubation of 1 μg/ml IN protein and 0.2 mm ZnCl2 in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) with a total 50 μl volume in each well. Subsequently, 50 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the above buffer was added to each well and incubated for 2 h to block the remaining binding sites. In order to investigate the effect of Zn2+ binding on the recognition of IN protein by mAb17, the plates were washed once with 200 μl of TBS containing various concentrations of EDTA to remove the metal bound to the protein (Fig. 2 A). The plates were further washed with 200 μl of TBS buffer four times, followed by addition of primary antibodies, and second antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase. The standard protocol was then followed, and the relative binding efficiencies of monoclonal antibody to the immobilized IN protein were determined by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm (8Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A 70-μl sample of 2 μm Gt-IN(1–49) protein was incubated for 1 h with 50 μm Zn2+ in 10 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. The sample was then divided into two equal aliquots. Fab17 or Fab33 was added to these aliquots to a final concentration of 2.2 μm, 10% excess of Fab over the N-terminal fragment of IN. The mixtures were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Next, a sequencing grade protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), either trypsin in a ratio of 200:1 (mg IN/mg protease), chymotrypsin at 100:1, orStaphylococcus aureus V8 endoprotease Glu-C at 100:1, or endoprotease Asp-N at 200:1 was added. At specified times, 2-μl aliquots were withdrawn from each sample and added into 2 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid to quench proteolysis. To map the resulting peptides, samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. These experiments were performed on a Perspective Biosystems Voyager DE mass spectrometer (Fannie E. Ripple Biotechnology Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA). First, 0.4 μl of the quenched sample was placed on a gold target plate where it was mixed with 0.4 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as the matrix (sinapinic acid (SA) was used as matrix as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3 in order to catch the signals of species with high molecular weight). The drops were allowed to dry at 25 °C prior to mass analysis. The mass spectra were recorded in a linear mode at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Each spectrum was acquired by averaging 256 scans. The calibration was first carried out using two internal standards, CHCA dimer (MH+, 390.37) and undigested Gt-IN(1–49) (MH+, 5933.17). Several assigned IN-derived peptides in each spectrum were used subsequently as internal standards for the final reported results. The calibrated masses were analyzed with the Paws computer software (ProteoMetrics) and mapped to Gt-IN(1–49)-derived peptides. A match with an error no greater than 1.0 mass unit was considered to be acceptable. PSI-BLAST (35Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59753) Google Scholar) was used to compare the sequence of the heavy and light chain variable domains of mAb17 with sequences of known structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (36Berman H.L.

For the light chain, the closest sequence in the PDB was chain L of PDB entry 1A0Q, a 2.30-Å crystal structure of catalytic antibody 29G11 in complex with [1-(1-N-succinylamino)pentyl]-2-phosphonate (37Buchbinder J.L. Stephenson R.C. Scanlan T.S. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The alignment had no gaps and gave a sequence identity of 88%. For the heavy chain, we used a composite of two antibody crystal structures. The majority of the chain, except for the H2 CDR loop, was taken from the 2.50-Å crystal structure of antitumor antibody R24, PDB entry1BZ7, chain B (38Kaminski M.J. MacKenzie C.R. Mooibroek M.J.

The H3 loop of the R24 antibody is the same length as that in mAb17, and they share three aromatic amino acids that are not present in the H3 loops of other antibodies of known structure. These residues are likely to determine the conformation of the loop. However, this antibody has an H2 loop one amino acid longer than the mAb17 H2 loop. For this loop we used the 2.7-Å crystal structure of the anti-digoxin antibody 40–50 in PDB entry 1IBG, chain H (39Jeffrey P.D. Schildbach J.F. Chang C.Y. Kussie P.H. Margolies M.N. Sheriff S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 344-360PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of the heavy chain variable domain from PDB entries 1BZ7 and1IBG were aligned with the MIDAS program (40Ferrin T.E. Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar), such that 3-residue anchors on either side of the H2 loop superimposed with 0.1-Å root mean square deviation. The composite coordinates were compiled to form a single heavy chain variable domain consisting of the H2 loop from 1IBG-H and the rest of the domain from 1BZ7-B. The heavy chain model was docked onto the light chain model by superimposing the backbone coordinates of the frame onto those in PDB entry 1A0Q chain H using MIDAS (40Ferrin T.E. Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar) and by compiling a single file with the models of the light and heavy chain variable domains of mAb17. We used the side chain conformation prediction program SCWRL (41Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 42Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Proteins Struct. Funct.

SCWRL uses a backbone-dependent rotamer library (43Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 543-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 44Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Cohen F.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1661-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) to place side chains onto a fixed backbone, followed by combinatorial optimization to remove steric clashes, and is more accurate than alternative methods (42Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 3 (suppl.): 81-87Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). No further energy minimization was performed, as such minimization usually does not improve a model (45Koehl P. Levitt M. Nat. Struct.

In the absence of FAD, the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase monomer forms a stable folding intermediate, which is incapable of dimerization. This intermediate displays a similar tryptic resistance to the native enzyme but is less heat-stable, because its ability to form native E3 is lost after incubation at 65 °C for 15 min. The presence of FAD promotes slow, additional conformational rearrangements of the E3 subunit as observed by cofactor-dependent decreases in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. However, after 2 h, the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum and far UV CD spectrum of E3, refolded in the absence of FAD, are similar to that of the native enzyme, and full activity can still be recovered on addition of FAD. Cross-linking studies show that FAD insertion is necessary for the monomeric folding intermediate to attain an assembly competent state leading to dimerization.

Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 271-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In both cases these multienzyme complexes are composed of non-covalent aggregates of three distinct enzymes, E1, E2, and E3, which act in a concerted fashion to convert their 2-oxoacid substrates to the corresponding acyl-CoAs. The initial oxidative decarboxylation reaction is promoted by a complex-specific thiamine diphosphate -requiring dehydrogenase, which also reductively acylates the lipoamide prosthetic groups covalently-linked to the oligomeric E2 enzyme. Lipoic acid is bound in amide linkage to specific lysine residues located at the tip of exposed type 1 β-turns within the flexible N-terminal lipoyl domains of the E2 components, whereas the acyltransferase active sites responsible for transfer of the acyl group to CoA are found near the C termini. In E. coli, as in all organisms studied to date, E3 is a FAD-linked homodimer required for reoxidation of the reduced lipoamide cofactor with NADH as the final reaction product. The genes of the individual enzymes of E. coli PDC were cloned in the early 1980s (3Stephens P.E. Darlison M.G. Lewis H.M. Guest J.R. Eur. J.

The identical subunits of E3 have a distinct four-domain organization arranged from the N terminus in the following manner: the FAD binding domain, the NAD binding domain, the central domain, and the interface domain. The catalytic mechanism of E3 has also been extensively investigated; the results show that the ultimate production of NADH involves initial transfer of reducing equivalents from E2-linked dihydrolipoamide prosthetic groups via the tightly bound FAD cofactor and a redox-active cysteine disulfide pair (18Williams Jr., C.H.

It is also apparent that amino acids on both E3 subunits contribute to formation of the two identical active sites on the E3 homodimer. Moreover, there are extensive contacts between the two subunits, because it has been estimated that approximately 16% of the surface area of the E3 monomer becomes inaccessible to the bulk solvent during E3 dimerization. High resolution structural analysis of E2-E3 interactions has also been performed for the B. subtilisenzyme, where it has been shown that association with E2 is mediated by a region within the central domain located near the 2-fold axis of symmetry (9Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G. Structure. 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only one of these two sites can be occupied at any one time owing to steric hindrance effects. In recent years, a number of novel E3s of unknown function has been described from a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources (20Li de la Sierra I. Pernot L. Prange T. Saludjian P. Schiltz M.

In several cases, the enzyme is expressed at the plasma membrane and is not an integral component of the family of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. Interestingly also, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from Neisseria meningitidis contains a catalytically active lipoyl domain (20Li de la Sierra I. Pernot L. Prange T. Saludjian P. Schiltz M. Fourme R. Padron G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been postulated in the case of the E3 enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei (21Danson M.J. Conroy K. McQuattie A. Stevenson K.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Else A.J. Clarke J.F. Willis A. Jackman S.A. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that it may have a role in sugar transport, although there is no definitive evidence on its precise physiological role at present. To date there have been relatively few reports addressing the molecular events in the assembly of these vast multienzyme assemblies withM r values ranging from 4–10 million. However, it is known that native eukaryotic PDC can be assembled spontaneouslyin vitro from stoichiometric amounts of its individual constituent enzymes. Moreover, the E2 core assembly of mammalian PDC can be fully constituted in vitro after complete denaturation in GdmCl (24McCartney R.G. Sanderson S.J. Lindsay J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6819-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Early studies on the E3 enzyme have shown that the tightly bound E3 cofactor can be removed by acid ((NH4)2SO4) treatment yielding an inactive apoenzyme that can be reactivated in the presence of FAD or derivatives in a temperature-dependent manner. However, this early work did not address the possible involvement of protein folding in the reconstitution process or analyze the folded state of the inactivated form of the enzyme (25Kalse J.F. Veeger C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 244-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Visser J. McCormick D.B. Veeger C. Biochim. Biohys. Acta. 1968; 159: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The current study is concerned with investigation of the folding/assembly pathway of the homodimeric E3 enzyme from E. coli and provides definitive evidence for a direct role of cofactor insertion in promoting the assembly competence of individual, folded E3 monomers. All chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially. Dihydrolipoamide was synthesized from lipoamide (Sigma, UK, Ltd.), essentially as described by Kochi and Kikuchi (27Kochi H. Kikuchi G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) was purified to at or near homogeneity from an overproducing strain of E. coli JRG 2872, kindly provided by Prof. J. R Guest, University of Sheffield. In this strain, all the genes for PDC subunits are housed in plasmid pG5501 under the control of thetac promoter. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction leads to vast overproduction of E. coli E3 relative to the other PDC subunits. High speed supernatant extracts containing free E3 were prepared as described by Russell et al. (28Russell G.C. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 1076: 225-232Google Scholar). Thereafter, aliquots of the supernatant fraction were subjected to heat treatment at 65 °C for 10 min, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation on a refrigerated bench top centrifuge at 5000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Heat-treated extracts were dialyzed into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 (Buffer A), and the purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Generally, E3 was enriched to greater than 90% purity by this stage; however, when required, it was further purified by elution from a Resource Q ion exchange column using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was pre-equilibrated in Buffer A with elution of E3 being achieved using a 0–700 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. For long term storage, E3 was kept at −80 °C in Buffer A containing 50%(v/v) glycerol. E3 activity was monitored by NADH formation at 340 nm using free dihydrolipoamide as substrate essentially as described previously (29Jackman S.A. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Stevenson K.J. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Two types of refolding protocols were adopted. In Method A, purified E3 (2 mg/ml) was fully denatured (30West S.M. Rice J.E. Beaumont E.S. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Lindsay J.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, by treatment on ice for 15 min with ultrapure 6 m GdmCl (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). To initiate the refolding process, the denatured enzyme was rapidly diluted 100-fold into the same buffer either without further additions or supplemented with additional amounts of FAD plus BSA and/or DTT as indicated in the legends. Reconstitution of E3 activity was routinely conducted at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated. In Method B, purified E3 (2–3 mg/ml) was treated with GdmCl as described above prior to complete removal of released cofactor by passing the denatured E3 down a Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column (10 × 1 cm) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Denatured E3 polypeptide eluted at the void volume and was analyzed to check that FAD was absent (see below); its concentration was then adjusted to 1 mg/ml for subsequent folding/reconstitution studies. Far UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence measurements, to monitor the loss or recovery of secondary and tertiary structure, respectively, were made on a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 fluorimeter. For CD analysis, the ellipticity changes at 225 nm were recorded, whereas fluorescence emission was monitored at 340 nm following excitation at 290 nm. Fluorescence spectra were corrected for Raman scattering by the solvent. Protein concentrations for these studies were in the ranges of 0.15–0.2 mg/ml and 50–80 μg/ml, respectively. Release of flavin was determined after spinning E3 samples (1 mg/ml) treated with the indicated levels of GdmCl at 10,000 ×g for 30 min through Centricon tubes with aM r 10,000 exclusion limit. Free flavin in the elute was measured fluorimetrically by exciting at 450 nm and measuring at 535 nm, with the excitation time being limited to 1 s to reduce the occurrence of photobleaching. Rapid covalent linking (2 min) of E3 subunits during refolding was performed in the presence of glutaraldehyde as the cross-linking agent as reported by White and coworkers (31White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with detection of dimerization by SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Blue. Fig. 1 shows the profile of reactivation of purified E. coli dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdmCl and following its removal by rapid dilution. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) revealed that E3 was inhibited by the presence of low concentrations of GdmCl in the assay with 50% inhibition occurring in 0.25 m GdmCl, whereas no activity was observed when assaying in 1 m GdmCl. These findings are consistent with those observed by Thorpe and Williams (32Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3263-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) who proposed that the inactivation of E3 by low concentrations of GdmCl was due to localized structural perturbations accompanying binding of the denaturant. In contrast (Fig. 1), initial exposure to 2.8–3 m GdmCl was required to cause total inactivation when assayed immediately following exposure to the denaturant, whereas 100% recovery was still achieved after pretreatment with 1 m GdmCl. Incubation with 2m GdmCl led to a loss of approximately 50% of the E3 activity on subsequent dilution. At these higher levels of GdmCl, unfolding of the E3 polypeptide chain was also observed as monitored by alterations in the far UV CD spectrum and tryptophan fluorescence, which reported on the loss of secondary and tertiary structure, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 1, there was a close correlation between the extent of protein unfolding and the lack of restoration of E3 activity following dilution of GdmCl. No residual secondary or tertiary structure could be detected above 3.0m GdmCl, indicating that the protein is present largely as “random coil” at this stage. In agreement with this finding, no immediate reappearance of E3 activity could be measured on rapid dilution after pretreatment with 3–6 m GdmCl. Removal of the FAD cofactor is also shown in Fig. 1, where it is clear that release of the cofactor was induced by GdmCl concentrations in the 1–3.0 m range equivalent to the levels that lead to unfolding of the polypeptide. In Fig. 2, preliminary attempts to demonstrate significant reconstitution of E3 activity in the presence of increasing amounts of FAD are described. As expected, the presence of cofactor was essential for the restoration of E3 function; however, during the period of the refolding assay, only minor recovery of E3 activity (5–10%) was observed in the presence of endogenous (equimolar) FAD, whereas, on addition of a 5- to 10-fold molar excess, both the rate and extent of E3 recovery were markedly increased with overall reconstitution in the 30–40% range routinely achieved within 90–120 min.Figure 1Unfolding and reactivation profile of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase treated with GdmCl as measured by changes in activity, CD, and fluorescence properties. Purified E3 (2 mg/ml) was treated with the stated concentration of GdmCl as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Method A), and the loss of recovered E3 activity was monitored by enzyme assays after dilution into buffer with no further additions. See “Experimental Procedures” for details of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, flavin release, and assessment of secondary structural changes by CD. All changes are expressed relative to the total change observed between 0 and 6 m GdmCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Effect of FAD on the rate and extent of recovery of E3 activity after unfolding in GdmCl. 6 mGdmCl-treated E3 (2 mg/ml) was refolded after complete removal of cofactor (see Method B, under “Experimental Procedures”) in the absence of FAD or in the presence of equimolar levels or a 5-fold molar excess of the cofactor. Samples (10 μl) were removed from the refolding mix, and E3 activity was measured at the indicated times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as a percentage of the activity of a similarly treated E3 sample, which had not been exposed to GdmCl. All determinations are the average of duplicate assays differing by less than 5%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At this stage, improvement of the refolding assay conditions was explored and it was discovered that inclusion of dithiothreitol (DTT) and/or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the presence or absence of excess FAD also promoted the restoration of E3 activity. By varying the levels of FAD, DTT, and BSA independently in the reconstitution assay (data not shown), it was determined that maximal levels of enzymatic recovery were achieved with a 5-fold molar excess of FAD, 10 mm DTT, and 100 μg/ml BSA, respectively. As depicted in Fig.3, complete recovery of E3 activity (90–100%) was routinely obtained in the presence of optimal concentrations of FAD, DTT, and BSA, whereas these reagents, either individually or in combination, promoted the partial restoration of E3 function to varying extents. The additive nature of the effects of FAD, DTT, and BSA on E3 recovery suggests that they each act by a separate mechanism to facilitate the correct functional maturation of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Essentially identical results were obtained if dissociated FAD was initially removed from denatured E3 (data not shown) except that basal recovery of E3 activity observed in controls (5–12%) was eliminated. Further studies were designed to investigate the temperature and protein concentration dependence of E3 reconstitution. In common with many enzymes examined previously, complete refolding to the native state in vitro was observed at low protein concentrations (20–50 μg/ml) under conditions that minimize nonspecific aggregation (data not shown). Restoration of E3 function also displayed a marked temperature dependence with little or no E3 activity appearing during a 3-h incubation at 4 °C, whereas maximal recovery occurred within 1.5–2 h at 25 °C. As expected, the rate of E3 reconstitution declined at intermediate temperatures (10 °C and 20 °C). The FAD binding domain is located in the N-terminal region of the E3 polypeptide where it forms important contacts with the NAD binding, central, and interface domains. Thus, it might be expected that the presence of FAD is necessary to promote the correct initial folding of this domain, thereby providing a framework for the subsequent ordered assembly of the remaining domains. In this scenario, the presence of FAD would be obligatory during the initial stages of the refolding process; however, as depicted in Fig. 4, the addition of FAD to the refolding mix could be delayed for at least 2 h after dilution of GdmCl-treated E3 into the refolding mix with little subsequent effect on the kinetics or extent of reconstitution. This observation indicates that the normal folding pathway is operative in the absence of FAD. Under these conditions a stable, folding intermediate is present that retains the ability to assemble into the functional, dimeric enzyme following cofactor insertion. Mature dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase possesses a compact, tightly folded domain organization, which renders it heat-stable and resistant to proteolytic attack. In Fig.5 A, the proteolytic sensitivity of the stable, E3 folding intermediate is compared with that of the native enzyme. The presence of trypsin (0.5%, w/w) in the refolding mix during the entire period of E3 reactivation had no apparent effect on its reactivation profile, indicating that E3 acquires its characteristic protease resistance at an early stage in the folding/assembly pathway. As a positive control for the trypsin treatment, it was demonstrated that heat-denatured E3 is highly susceptible to proteolysis by 0.5% (w/w) trypsin with the M r 55,000 subunit being degraded completely within 15 min as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown); however, the activity of the native E3 enzyme was totally unaffected during a 2-h incubation with trypsin under these conditions (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, incubation of the refolding mix at 65 °C for 15 min, after permitting initial reconstitution for 5 min under standard assay conditions, led to the complete abolition of the appearance of E3 activity during a subsequent 2-h incubation at 30 °C (Fig.5 B). Control experiments confirmed also that there was no loss of native E3 activity following a 15-min incubation at 65 °C. In summary, therefore, the stable E3 folding intermediate was more heat-sensitive than the native E3 enzyme, although it displayed a similar resistance to trypsin, indicative of the presence of a compact, folded domain organization at an early stage in the folding/assembly process. In Fig. 6, the state of assembly of the E3 enzyme was monitored in the presence or absence of FAD at various times during the reconstitution period by employing rapid cross-linking in the presence of glutaraldehyde in combination with SDS-PAGE analysis. It was apparent that the stable, assembly intermediate was incapable of dimerization in the absence of FAD (lanes 1–5,panel B), whereas the presence of the cofactor promoted dimerization of the refolded E3 subunits on a similar timescale and to a similar extent as that observed for the appearance of E3 activity under these assay conditions (lanes 1–5, panel A). Densitometric analysis of the time course of the FAD-induced dimerization (data not shown) of E3 indicates that 60–70% conversion to the native oligomeric state occurred within 90 min, in agreement with the levels of E3 activity recovered in the presence of FAD and DTT. As expected, it was also noted that the cross-linked, monomeric subunits exhibited an increased mobility on SDS-PAGE as compared with E3 subunits (lane B) in the absence of a cross-linker, which can be totally unfolded on addition of SDS. Lane A in Fig. 6(panel A) shows the mobility of cross-linked, native dimeric E3. Because the presence of FAD is a prerequisite for establishing the assembly competence of individual monomers, slow alterations in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence during refolding were monitored in the absence and in the presence of FAD to determine if additional tertiary structural rearrangements could be detected that were induced exclusively by the cofactor. As shown in Fig.7 (curve 1), there was little or no change in tryptophan fluorescence over a 2-h incubation period (after the initial rapid refolding events, which occurred within the manual mixing time) if FAD was absent from the refolding mixture. In the presence of equimolar FAD in the refolding assay, there were considerably larger changes in the protein fluorescence (curve 2), which were further enhanced in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of the cofactor. The FAD-induced intrinsic fluorescence changes presumably reflect the formation of assembly competent monomers and/or dimerization of such monomers to form active enzyme. It should be noted that detailed comparisons of the amplitudes of the curves in Fig. 7 are difficult, because bound FAD itself quenches the protein fluorescence due to energy transfer from one or more neighboring tryptophan side chains. Fig. 8 compares the fluorescence spectra of the native E3 enzyme (curve 1) and its GdmCl-denatured form (curve 2) with the spectra of E3, reconstituted in the absence of FAD (curve 3) and in the presence of equimolar amounts or a 5-fold excess of cofactor (curves 4 and5, respectively). It is evident that the spectrum of native dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is virtually identical to those of E3 reassembled in the presence of two separate concentrations of cofactor. Moreover, in terms of the emission maximum, it is also very similar to that of the stable, monomeric intermediate formed in the absence of FAD. In the case of GdmCl-denatured E3, there was a significant enhancement in fluorescence accompanied by a shift in emission maximum from 340 nm to 356 nm, consistent with exposure of internally located tryptophans to the external environment. In fact, rapid refolding to the “near-native” state associated with the so-called “hydrophobic collapse” and formation of the major secondary structural elements has occurred within the timescale of the manual mixing experiment (10 s). Thus, analysis of the far UV CD spectrum (190–250 nm) of the refolded E3 immediately on dilution is virtually identical to that of the native enzyme (data not shown). In addition, after 1 min both the secondary and tertiary structural characteristics of the assembly intermediate are indistinguishable to those observed following a 2-h incubation in the absence of cofactor, indicating that individual subunits rapidly return to a “near-native” state in an FAD-independent manner. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from E. coli is a prominent member of a family of pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductases that includes glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, and mercuric reductase. All of these enzymes are dimeric, display a similar multidomain organization, and contain a redox-active cysteine disulfide pair at their active sites. Complete reconstitution of E3 activity could be achieved under optimal refolding conditions, which required the inclusion of excess FAD, DTT, and BSA in the refolding mix. Although all of these reagents individually were able to promote partial recovery of E3 function, in combination they elicited a synergistic effect such that essentially 100% recovery could be achieved in their presence. Both DTT and BSA have both been shown previously to protect proteins and mediate their ordered folding (see Ref. 33Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar for review). In the case of the sulfhydryl reagent, DTT, a positive effect can be attributed to its ability to either aiding in disulfide bond formation or preventing oxidation of reactive sulfhydryl groups, which in this enzyme play key roles in the catalytic mechanism. Similarly, BSA has often been included to improve yields of reconstituted enzyme in a variety of cases. Its stimulatory effects appear to be related to its ability to bind hydrophobic patches on the surfaces of unfolded proteins and thus mediate their slow release into solution during the refolding process. In essence, BSA lowers the concentration of folding intermediates, thereby limiting the formation of nonspecific aggregates that are readily formed, particularly at high protein concentrations. In dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, the FAD-binding domain is situated at the N terminus and is likely to be the first segment of the polypeptide to assume its three-dimensional conformation as it emerges from the ribosome. This FAD binding domain (8Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1183-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) makes important contacts with all three C-terminally located domains, and thus it might be expected that the initial FAD-induced folding of this segment of the protein would be necessary to provide the appropriate framework for the correct functional maturation of the remainder of the polypeptide. However, it is apparent from this study, that the presence of FAD during the refolding process is not necessary to induce the appropriate, ordered folding pathway of the E3 polypeptide to a near native state. In fact, FAD addition can be delayed for at least 2 h following removal of GdmCl without any decline in the assembly competence of the stable folding intermediate that forms rapidly on dilution of the chemical denaturant. Although this folding intermediate has a near native structure in terms of its far UV CD, intrinsic fluorescence properties and resistance to trypsin, it is more heat-labile than the native enzyme, which can withstand 65 °C treatment for 30 min or more. Interestingly, FAD addition leads to further minor conformational rearrangements as judged by additional alterations in tryptophan fluorescence. These additional alterations in subunit structure are essential for the subsequent dimerization process leading to the appearance of a mature, fully functional enzyme. Thus, cofactor insertion represents an obligatory step in the mechanism of assembly of this important dimeric enzyme. Because E3 is a prominent member of the pyridine dinucleotide oxidoreductase family, it may be that FAD insertion is a key event in a common assembly pathway for all these related enzymes. The stabilizing effects of substrates or coenzymes on their respective apoenzymes is well-documented for a great number of proteins. However, the involvement of cofactor addition in promoting the correct folding of individual enzymes has not received the same degree of attention, except in a few specific examples. In some cases, such as the dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), core enzymes of the family of α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes, insertion of the lipoic acid cofactor is a passive event that occurs post-translationally in the mitochondrial compartment. Moreover, the exposure of the specific lysine residue at the tip of a type-1 β-turn in a fully folded lipoyl domain is necessary for recognition by the lipoate ligase (34Wallis D.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast, for cytochrome c, covalent attachment of the heme prosthetic group, by its heme lyase, appears to be essential not only to induce its folding from an unstructured peptide into the native holoenzyme but to complete import of the polypeptide chain across the mitochondrial outer membrane (35Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12390-12397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, a role for several cofactors has been reported where they appear to act as “nucleation sites,” mediating the appropriate sequential folding of the nascent chain as is the case for pyridoxal phosphate in aspartate aminotransferase (36West S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 171: 609-614Google Scholar) and the isoalloxazine ring in medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (37Saijo T. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 1995; 261: 189-196Google Scholar). However, for dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, folding to the near native state, at least in vitro, is independent of the presence of cofactor. Its presence, however, is a prerequisite for a later stage in the maturation of individual monomers, which display many of the characteristics of the native E3 enzyme but exhibit an absolute dependence on cofactor integration for the final dimerization event. To our knowledge, this is the first clear-cut demonstration of a key role for cofactor addition in inducing the attainment of assembly competence of prefolded monomers.

Association ofb′2 orbc′2 with TF1 did not have significant effect on ATPase activity. A disulfide bond between the introduced cysteine ofbc′ and cysteine 109 of γ subunit was readily formed, and this cross-link caused inactivation of ATPase. This implies that Fo b subunit bound to stator subunits of F1 with enough strength to resist rotation of γ subunit and to prevent catalysis. Contrary to this apparent tight binding, some detergents such as lauryldodecylamine oxide tend to cause release of b′2 from TF1.

F1-ATPase from Bacillus PS3 lauryldimethylamine oxide dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ATP synthases catalyze ATP synthesis/hydrolysis coupled with a transmembrane proton transport in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of two portions, a water-soluble F1, which has catalytic sites for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis, and a membrane-integrated Fo, which mediates proton movement. The bacterial enzyme has the simplest subunit structure, α3β3γ1δ1ε1for F1 anda 1 b 2 c 9–12for Fo. F1 is easily and reversibly detached from Fo by removal of Mg2+ in a low ionic strength solution. F1 is by itself a rotary motor fueled by ATP hydrolysis (3Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar), in which γ and ε subunits rotate relative to α3β3 hexamer (4Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

In the current view of ATP synthase, Fo is also thought to be a rotary motor that utilizes the energy of proton movement down the electrochemical potential (6Cross R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, proton movement through Fo drives rotation of the central stalk of γε, which then enforces each catalytic site in F1 to synthesize ATP (7Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a reverse reaction, ATP hydrolysis in F1 drives reverse rotation of the γε stalk, which causes proton transport in Fo. The concept that ATP synthase consists of two motors connected by a common rotor shaft necessitates the second stalk, which connects and fixes stator subunits of both F1 and Fo together to hold the α3β3 hexamer stationary when the γε rotor stalk rotates (8Duncan T.M.

Fo b, composed of 156 (Escherichia coli) or 167 (thermophilic Bacillus PS3) residues, has a single membrane-spanning helix at its N-terminal region (16Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H.

The hydrophilic domain of Fo b is predicted to be mostly α-helical and forms a dimer with highly extended structure (18Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol.

In addition, Fo b is tolerant for deletion of the length up to 11 amino acid residues (23Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and this extra length could contribute to produce elasticity necessary for the intact function (23Sorgen P.L.

To fulfill its putative role as a key component of the stator, the Fo b 2, a dimer Fo b, must resist the torque generated by rotation of γε. However, the observed interaction between δ and Fo b 2 was not strong (K d = 5–10 μm; Ref. 18Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), apparently insufficient to justify the stator model. To understand this interaction thoroughly, we have established an expression system for the TF1-b′2 complex1(α3β3γδεb′2) 2In this study, the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1, which has amino acid substitutions of α(W463Y/C193S)3β(10H)3γ(S109C) (3Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) was used as a starting material. Enzymatic characteristics of this subcomplex are almost identical to the wild type α3β3γ subcomplex, and therefore, we have been considering it as a second wild type subcomplex and termed as a wild type enzyme in this article. of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 in E. coli cells, in which b′ is a truncated Fo b subunit with 135 amino acid residues corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain and replaced the N terminus of b′ with cysteine (bc′). A disulfide cross-link betweenbc′ and γ was readily formed, and the resultant TF1-bc′2complex containing bc′-γ cross-link lost the ATPase activity. This indicates a strong connection between Fo b 2 and F1 stator subunit(s). Interestingly, some detergents have a deteriorating effect on the stability of the connection. DNA manipulations were carried out by following methods in the literature (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 4.4-kilobase pair EcoRI-PstI fragment containingBacillus PS3 uncAGD genes (coding for αγβ) was prepared from the plasmid pKKHC5 (3Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) and introduced into the plasmid pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously digested withEcoRI and PstI. A KpnI site was introduced into uncA gene (encoding α subunit) of the resultant plasmid by the method of Kunkel and Roberts (29Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using a synthetic oligonucleotide primer, 5′-CGATCGACGCGCTGGTACCGATCGGCCGC-3′ to obtain a plasmid pTR-HC5k. Then, uncC gene encoding ε subunit with improved translation signal sequence was amplified from a plasmid pUC119/TFoF1 (30Ohta S. Yohda M. Ishizuka M. Hirata H. Hamamoto T. Otawara-Hamamoto Y. Matsuda K. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) by PCR with following primers, 5′-CCGCGGCCCGGGATTATGAAGGAGATTAATCAATGAAAACGATCCACGTGAGCG-3′ and 5′-TGAGCGTTGCGGAAATGAAGTAAGCGGCCGCCTGCAGGCCCG-3′ (underlined bases indicate SmaI and PstI sites, respectively). The amplified fragment was digested withSmaI and PstI and ligated with the pTR-HC5k (the resulting plasmid is pTR-kε). A DNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic region of Fo b subunit, δ, and N-terminal moiety of α was amplified from pUC119/TFoF1by PCR with a pair of primers, 5′-CCGCGGGAATTCTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGCGAGGATCCTGAAACAACGTGAAGAACATATCGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGATCGGTACCAGCGCGTCGATCGCTTTAATCC-3′ (underlined regions corresponds to EcoRI andKpnI sites). The amplified fragment was digested withEcoRI and KpnI and introduced into the pTR-kε previously digested with the both restriction enzymes to obtain the plasmid pTR-bε2. A mutated TF1 subcomplex, TF1-bc′2, which has a amino acid substitution at alanine 2 of b′ subunit with cysteine, was constructed by digesting pTR-bε2 withEcoRI and BamHI, and the resultant fragment was ligated with a complementary pair of synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-AATTCTAAGAAGGAGATATACTTATGTGCAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTGCACATAAGTATATCTCCTTCTTAG-3′. Nucleotide sequence of regions either amplified by PCR or substituted by the synthetic oligonucleotides was verified by sequencing. To obtain the TF1-b′2 complex, E. coli DK8 [bglR, thi-1, rel-1, HfrPO1, Δ(uncB-uncC, ilv::Tn10] harboring pTR-bε2 was cultured in 2× YT medium (23Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. When the A 600 of the culture reached 1.0, an expression inducer, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, was added into the medium at a final concentration of 2 mm, and the culture was continued for another 2 h. Cells harvested from the culture were resuspended into buffer J (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mmK2SO4 and 5 mm MgSO4) and disrupted twice by French-Press (41 Mpa). Unbroken cells, and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 7700 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was incubated at 70 °C for 20 min, and denatured E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (QIAGEN) previously equilibrated with buffer J containing 20 mm imidazole. TF1-b′2complex was eluted from the column with buffer J containing 200 mm imidazole after washing with buffer J containing 20 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was supplemented with 10 mm DTT and 1 m ammonium sulfate and applied to a Phenyl-TOYOPEARL 650M column (TOSOH) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA) plus 1 m ammonium sulfate. Active TF1-b′2 complex was eluted from the column with a linear reverse gradient of ammonium sulfate (1–0m). The purity of the preparation was examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS-PAGE). 3SDS-PAGE usually refers to PAGE in the presence of SDS with prior reducing procedures (termed “reducing” SDS-PAGE when necessary for clarification. “Nonreducing” SDS-PAGE refers to SDS-PAGE without prior reducing treatment. Subunit stoichiometry of TF1-b′2 complex was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (26Cherepanov D.A. Mulkidjanian A.Y. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); the enzyme denatured with 6m guanidine hydrochloride was applied to a Cosmosil 5C4-AR-300 column (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (33–57%) in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, with monitoring absorbance at 280 nm. Subunit stoichiometry of γ, ε, and b′ was calculated by comparing the peak areas, taking into account that γ, ε, andb′ contain 6, 2, and 1 tyrosine residues, respectively, and none of them contains tryptophane. Purified TF1-bc′2complex passed twice through a gel filtration column PD-10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and was incubated in the presence of 20 μm CuCl2 at 25 °C for the indicated period. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mm EDTA and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and the reacted complex was subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (see legend to Fig. 4). The γ-bc′ cross-link yield was determined by quantifying the staining intensity of the γ band in the second reducing SDS-PAGE. Thebc′-bc′ cross-link yield was estimated from the intensity of thebc′-bc′ band in the first nonreducing SDS-PAGE. ATPase activity was measured by the method described previously (31Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Activity was measured in triplicate by monitoring reaction rates in a time period from 3 to 6 min using an ATP regenerating system at 25 °C (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.1 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit from Pierce, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out as follows; first dimension, cross-linked products of TF1-bc 2′ without exposure to a reducing reagent was analyzed on a 16% polyacrylamide gel; second dimension, a portion of the lanes was cut out and exposed to the denaturation buffer for SDS-PAGE containing 50 mm DTT for 20 min at room temperature (reducing SDS-PAGE). The gel piece was rotated 90° and positioned with agarose on a stacking gel of a 16% polyacrylamide gel. Fo b of Bacillus PS3 contains 167 amino acid residues, 4The N-terminal sequence of the matureb subunit of authentic ATP synthase purified fromBacillus PS3 revealed the processing of N-terminal 11 residues. The nucleotide sequence of uncF gene codingb subunit was also revised. Detailed information is available on request to authors. of which sequence similarity to the E. coli counterpart is distributed in the whole primary sequence (Fig.1 A). Fo b has been proposed by Dunn and co-workers (22Revington M. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to be functionally divided into four domains: transmembrane, tether, dimerization, and δ-binding domains. To construct Fo b′ subunit, which corresponds to the cytoplasmic region of Fo b subunit, the N-terminal 32-residue sequence including the transmembrane region, and part of the tether region was genetically eliminated (Fig.1 B). The N-terminal methionine residue of Fo b′ subunit corresponds to Leu29 ofE. coli Fo b subunit, which is assumed to be located near fatty acyl carbonyls of the lipid bilayer (16Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The resulting Fo b′ subunit was expected to be stable, because the eliminated region is not essential either for dimer formation or δ-binding (22Revington M. McLachlin D.T. Shaw G.S. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31094-31101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). TF1 complexed with b′ was expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli host cells and purified to homogeneity. About 100 mg of the complex was routinely purified from a 1-liter culture. As shown in Fig.2 A, five protein bands were found in SDS gels of the purified complex, corresponding to α, β, γ, δ, and ε subunits. Relative staining intensity of each band was the same as that of authentic TF1, except the band corresponding to ε subunit was unusually strong. N-terminal sequence analysis of the band revealed that it contained ε and b′. The sequence of b′ started with Ala2, and therefore, the first methionine was cleaved in E. coli. Exact subunit stoichiometry in the complex was determined by reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 2 B) (32Yoshida M. Papa S. Altendolf K. Ernster L. Packer L. H+-ATPase (ATP Synthase): Structure, Function, Biogenesis the FoF1 Complex of Coupling Membranes. International Council of Scientific Union Press, Bari, Italy1984: 147-152Google Scholar). Each of five eluted peaks was isolated and identified by both N-terminal sequencing and SDS-PAGE. Of the six subunits, good separation was obtained for the ε, b′, and γ subunits. Their relative molar ratio was calculated from the peak areas. The value of γ:ε:b′ was obtained as 1 : 0.99±0.04 : 2.00±0.01 for three preparations purified independently, and we concluded that the subunit stoichiometry of the complex is α3β3γ1δ1ε1 b′2, in short, TF1-b′2. Isolatedb′ is active in reconstitution; it can bind to TF1 to form TF1-b′2again but not to TF1 lacking δ subunit (data not shown). Steady state ATPase activity of the complex was 5.4 units/mg, nearly identical to the activity, 5.7 units/mg, of TF1(α3β3γδε), and thus the association of b′2 has little effect on ATPase activity of TF1. Ala2 ofb′ was replaced by cysteine and designated as bc′ (Fig. 1 B). As described above, the N-terminal methionine was lost during expression, and thus the introduced cysteine was located at N terminus of bc′. Steady state ATPase activity of TF1-bc′2complex, 5.5 units/mg, was nearly the same as that of the complex without mutation. Mobility in SDS-PAGE ofbc′ was slightly faster thanb′ and was identified as a separate band below ε (Fig.3 A, lane 1). In TF1-bc′2, there is another cysteine residue in the stalk region of γ subunit (Cys109). The cross-link between γ andbc′ was found when TF1-bc′2 was exposed to 20 μm CuCl2 for 2 h. When the cross-linked product was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, band intensities of γ and bc′ subunits decreased, and new bands at the expected positions ofbc′-bc′ and γ-bc′ appeared (lanes 2 and 3, shown by arrows). The γ-bc′ band usually overlapped with αβ bands but was identified as an isolated band just above the α subunit band when less amount of samples were electrophoresed for a long period (lane 3). The sample was further analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, first in nonreducing and second in reducing condition (Fig. 3 B). A presumedbc′-bc′ band in the first dimension indeed produced a monomerbc′ band in the second dimension. Likewise, a presumed γ-bc′ band overlapping with the β subunit band in the first dimension (mobility of the γ-bc′ band became faster when a large amount was applied) split into γ and b′ bands in the second dimension. The bands newly appeared in the second dimension were all confirmed by N-terminal sequencing to be really γ andbc′ subunits. Thus, the CuCl2-mediated oxidation generated two products,bc′-bc′ and γ-bc′. It has been reported that cross-linking two Fo b subunits by a disulfide bond in ATP synthase does not impair ATPase activity and proton translocation activity (17Rodgers A.J.W. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,25Rodgers A.J.W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29406-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To know the effect of γ-bc′ cross-link on catalytic function, TF1-bc′2 was incubated in 20 μm CuCl2, and the time course of γ-bc′ cross-link formation was compared with that of decrease of ATPase activity (Fig.4). It was confirmed that ATPase activity of the TF1-b′2 complex did not change after a 2-h incubation with 20 μmCuCl2. To assess the amount of the γ-bc′, the αβ band, in which the γ-bc′ band degenerated, in the first nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A) was cut out, and the excised gel piece was subjected to second reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 B). The amount of γ andbc′ bands in Fig. 4 Bcorresponded to the amount of the γ-bc′ cross-linked product. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the formation of γ-bc′ proceeded fast and was almost saturated (43%) in the first 5 min, reflecting high reactivity of both cysteines. 5The amount ofbc′-bc′ also increased rapidly in 5 min but, different from γ-bc′, then started to decrease slowly. Probably the disulfide bond ofbc′-bc′ is slowly rearranged to form γ-bc′. Maximal cross-link (60%) was obtained after 2 h. Consistently, the amount of γ and bc′ in nonreducing SDS-PAGE decreased as the incubation time increased. It is noteworthy that the yield of γ-bc′ was much higher than that ofbc′-bc′ (∼15%) despite the fact that two bc′ are associated (noncovalently) each other as a dimer in the complex. Probably, the N terminus of bc′ subunit is either in close location to Cys109 of the γ subunit or highly flexible in the TF1-bc′2complex. ATPase activity of TF1-bc′2decreased with time like a mirror image of γ-bc′ formation (Fig. 4 C). Linear correlation was confirmed by a plot of the yield of γ-bc′ formation versusATPase activity (Fig. 4 C, inset). Reduction of disulfides by DTT resulted in full recovery of the original ATPase activity: 5.5 units/mg before CuCl2-mediated oxidation, 2.2 units/mg after oxidation, and 5.4 units/mg after reduction by 50 mm DTT of the oxidized preparation. Taken together, we conclude that the TF1-bc′2complex containing a γ-bc′ cross-link is unable to catalyze ATP hydrolysis. As is known from the fact that our purification procedures included heat treatment at 70 °C to remove proteins derived from host cells, TF1-b′2 and TF1-bc′2 are stable complexes. It can be stored for several months at 4 °C in an ammonium sulfate suspension. However, we found that some detergents destabilize the complex and tend to induce dissociation ofb′ subunit from TF1. When TF1-b′2 was applied to a gel filtration column equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.1% lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) (33Lotscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and eluted with the same buffer, TF1 and b′2 were eluted as separate peaks (Fig. 5 A). If the same thing happens to TF1-bc′2complex containing γ-bc′ cross-link,bc′2 might lose the connection with δ (and α) subunits of TF1 and be tethered only to γ through a disulfide (Fig.6 C). Under this situation, the enzyme can hydrolyze ATP because γ can rotate, even if it has to dragbc′2together. 6Calculation shows that the force required for the dragging bc′ is too small to slow down the rotation of γ. Indeed, in the presence of LDAO, ATPase activity of TF1-bc′2complex containing γ-bc′ cross-link was reactivated to almost the same level as that of the DTT-pretreated complex, and 91% of the activity lost by cross-link was recovered (Fig. 5 B). It was confirmed that disulfide cross-link was cleaved 100% by DTT but not at all by LDAO. Taking the activity of DTT-pretreated enzyme as that of the TF1-bc′2without cross-link, similar test was carried out for other detergents. Some reactivations, 36 and 33%, were observed for α-lysolecithin and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, respectively, but very little reactivation was observed for Triton X-100 and n-octyl-β-d- glucopyranoside.Figure 6Illustration of γ-bc′ cross-linking and cleavage in TF1-bc′2. A, reduced TF1-bc′2without γ-bc′ cross-link.B, oxidized TF1-bc′2 with γ-bc′ cross-link. C, LDAO-treated TF1-bc′2 with γ-bc′ cross-link but without connection between bc′2 to stator subunits of TF1. Species B cannot hydrolyze ATP because γ rotation is prevented by the physical connection of γ and stator subunits throughbc′2. LDAO releases the connection between bc′2 and stator subunits of TF1 to produce species C in which γ can rotate again accompanying ATP hydrolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The expected role of the second stalk in ATP synthase is prevention of stator subunits from rotating together with rotor (8Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 27Dunn S.D. McLachlin D.T. Revington M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, structural details are not known, and it remains unclear how the stalk can act as a common stator of Fo and F1. In particular, previous results showed that the binding between F1 and Fo b appears to be not sufficiently strong to resist the rotary torque imposed by F1 motor or Fo motor (21Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have established the procedures to obtain large amount of TF1-b′2 complex, which enabled us to probe the interaction between TF1 andb′2 subunit. The complex is as stable as TF1, and association of b′2 appears to be tight enough to sustain the torque force. This was more directly shown by the γ-bc′ cross-linking experiment (Fig. 6). Cross-linking resulted in loss of ATPase activity. Because ATP hydrolysis and rotation of γ is tightly coupled and blocking one of them inevitably stops the other (34Garcia J.J. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15940-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), inactivation of ATPase should be caused from prevented rotation of γ (Fig.6 B). This implies that binding of b′2to the stator subunits of TF1 including δ is strong enough to hold γ from rotation. An earlier proposal that the weak interactions between b 2 and δ are designed to be broken to release torsional stress and allow continued rotation of the rotor subunits (23Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is inconsistent with the results presented here. In ATP synthase at work, the two junctions of the second stalk, one with F1 and the other with Fo, should resist the rotary torque. Our result provides an experimental support for the strength of the junction with F1."
