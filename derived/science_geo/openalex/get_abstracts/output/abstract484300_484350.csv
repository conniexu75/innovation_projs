https://openalex.org/W2068523052,"Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is a common malignancy that causes approximately 150,000 deaths per year worldwide. So far, no molecularly targeted agents have been approved for treatment of the disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we report here an integrated analysis of 131 urothelial carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations. There were statistically significant recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including multiple genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, chromatin regulation, and kinase signalling pathways, as well as 9 genes not previously reported as significantly mutated in any cancer. RNA sequencing revealed four expression subtypes, two of which (papillary-like and basal/squamous-like) were also evident in microRNA sequencing and protein data. Whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified recurrent in-frame activating FGFR3–TACC3 fusions and expression or integration of several viruses (including HPV16) that are associated with gene inactivation. Our analyses identified potential therapeutic targets in 69% of the tumours, including 42% with targets in the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and 45% with targets (including ERBB2) in the RTK/MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulatory genes were more frequently mutated in urothelial carcinoma than in any other common cancer studied so far, indicating the future possibility of targeted therapy for chromatin abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1970196890,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated enzyme Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease that uses RNA-DNA base-pairing to target foreign DNA in bacteria. Cas9-guide RNA complexes are also effective genome engineering agents in animals and plants. Here we use single-molecule and bulk biochemical experiments to determine how Cas9-RNA interrogates DNA to find specific cleavage sites. We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2009494639,"In the modern human genome, elevated Neanderthal ancestry is found at genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that gene flow with Neanderthals helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments; deficiencies of Neanderthal ancestry are also found, particularly on the X chromosome and in genes expressed highly in testes, suggesting that some Neanderthal mutations were not tolerated on a modern human genetic background as they reduced male fertility. The modern human genome contains traces of Neanderthal ancestry. But is Neanderthal DNA distributed uniformly across the human genome, or is it concentrated more in some parts than in others? Sriram Sankararaman et al. show that parts of the human genome enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments (in hair, for example) also contain a relatively high concentration of Neanderthal DNA, suggesting that this DNA helped modern humans adapt to the chillier non-African environment. On the downside, many Neanderthal-derived alleles are associated with disease risk. Other parts of the human genome contain a deficiency of Neanderthal alleles, implying their active removal in evolution. Among the 'lost' genes are a number expressed in the testis and on the X chromosome, implying that Neanderthal DNA reduced human fertility when moved to a modern human genetic background. Genomic studies have shown that Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, and that non-Africans today are the products of this mixture1,2. The antiquity of Neanderthal gene flow into modern humans means that genomic regions that derive from Neanderthals in any one human today are usually less than a hundred kilobases in size. However, Neanderthal haplotypes are also distinctive enough that several studies have been able to detect Neanderthal ancestry at specific loci1,3,4,5,6,7,8. We systematically infer Neanderthal haplotypes in the genomes of 1,004 present-day humans9. Regions that harbour a high frequency of Neanderthal alleles are enriched for genes affecting keratin filaments, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles may have helped modern humans to adapt to non-African environments. We identify multiple Neanderthal-derived alleles that confer risk for disease, suggesting that Neanderthal alleles continue to shape human biology. An unexpected finding is that regions with reduced Neanderthal ancestry are enriched in genes, implying selection to remove genetic material derived from Neanderthals. Genes that are more highly expressed in testes than in any other tissue are especially reduced in Neanderthal ancestry, and there is an approximately fivefold reduction of Neanderthal ancestry on the X chromosome, which is known from studies of diverse species to be especially dense in male hybrid sterility genes10,11,12. These results suggest that part of the explanation for genomic regions of reduced Neanderthal ancestry is Neanderthal alleles that caused decreased fertility in males when moved to a modern human genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W2116486533,"Poly(A) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(A)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(A)-tail function. Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA-mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2007404630,"Cultivated bacteria such as actinomycetes are a highly useful source of biomedically important natural products. However, such ‘talented’ producers represent only a minute fraction of the entire, mostly uncultivated, prokaryotic diversity. The uncultured majority is generally perceived as a large, untapped resource of new drug candidates, but so far it is unknown whether taxa containing talented bacteria indeed exist. Here we report the single-cell- and metagenomics-based discovery of such producers. Two phylotypes of the candidate genus ‘Entotheonella’ with genomes of greater than 9 megabases and multiple, distinct biosynthetic gene clusters co-inhabit the chemically and microbially rich marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. Almost all bioactive polyketides and peptides known from this animal were attributed to a single phylotype. ‘Entotheonella’ spp. are widely distributed in sponges and belong to an environmental taxon proposed here as candidate phylum ‘Tectomicrobia’. The pronounced bioactivities and chemical uniqueness of ‘Entotheonella’ compounds provide significant opportunities for ecological studies and drug discovery. Single-cell- and metagenomics-based study reveals two members of the candidate genus ‘Entotheonella’, symbionts of the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei; distinct biosynthetic gene clusters that account for most of the bioactive polyketides and peptides known from T. swinhoei are shown to be attributable to a single member of the T. swinhoei Y microbiome. Almost all drugs and drug candidates from bacteria are produced by a few groups of metabolically rich organisms. That leaves the unculturable — or uncultivated — microbial majority as a largely untapped resource. Here Jörn Piel and colleagues report the use of single-cell and metagenomic analysis to identify two potential 'environmental factories', both members of the candidate genus Entotheonella and symbionts of the chemically rich marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. Importantly they find that the genomes of both microbes encode multiple distinct biosynthetic gene clusters that together account for most of the bioactive polyketides and peptides previously thought to be produced by the sponge host. This discovery identifies Entotheonella and members of the newly proposed phylum Tectomicrobia as a 'biochemically talented' phylum on a par with the actinomycetes."
https://openalex.org/W1967279698,"Neandertal Shadows in Us Non-African modern humans carry a remnant of Neandertal DNA from interbreeding events that have been postulated to have occurred as humans migrated out of Africa. While the total amount of Neandertal sequence is estimated to be less than 3% of the modern genome, the specific retained sequences vary among individuals. Analyzing the genomes of more than 600 Europeans and East Asians, Vernot and Akey (p. 1017 , published online 29 January) identified Neandertal sequences within modern humans that taken together span approximately 20% of the Neandertal genome. Some Neandertal-derived sequences appear to be under positive selection in humans, including several genes associated with skin phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2071717527,"In parallel to the genetic code for protein synthesis, a second layer of information is embedded in all RNA transcripts in the form of RNA structure. RNA structure influences practically every step in the gene expression program. However, the nature of most RNA structures or effects of sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary structures (RSSs) in a human family trio (mother, father and their child). This provides a comprehensive RSS map of human coding and non-coding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures that demarcate open reading frames and splicing junctions, and define authentic microRNA-binding sites. Comparison of native deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified RNA suggests that the majority of the RSS information is encoded within RNA sequence. Over 1,900 transcribed single nucleotide variants (approximately 15% of all transcribed single nucleotide variants) alter local RNA structure. We discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the ability of point mutations to impact RSSs. Selective depletion of 'riboSNitches' versus structurally synonymous variants at precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes at thousands of sites, including 3' untranslated regions, binding sites of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins genome-wide. These results highlight the potentially broad contribution of RNA structure and its variation to gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2053915666,"Hybrid quantum systems seek to combine the strength of its constituents to master the fundamental conflicting requirements of quantum technology: fast and accurate systems control together with perfect shielding from the environment, including the measurements apparatus, to achieve long quantum coherence. Excellent examples for hybrid quantum systems are heterogeneous spin systems where electron spins are used for readout and control while nuclear spins are used as long-lived quantum bits. Here we show that joint initialization, projective readout and fast local and non-local gate operations are no longer conflicting requirements in those systems, even under ambient conditions. We demonstrate high-fidelity initialization of a whole spin register (99 %) and single-shot readout of multiple individual nuclear spins by using the ancillary electron spin of a nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Implementation of a novel non-local gate generic to our hybrid electron-nuclear quantum register allows to prepare entangled states of three nuclear spins, with fidelities exceeding 85 %. An important tool for scalable quantum computation is quantum error correction. Combining, for the first time, optimal-control based error avoidance with error correction, we realize a three-qubit phase-flip error correction algorithm. Utilizing optimal control, all of the above algorithms achieve fidelities approaching fault tolerant quantum operation, thus paving the way to large scale integrations. Our techniques can be used to improve scaling of quantum networks relying on diamond spins, phosphorous in silicon or other spin systems like quantum dots, silicon carbide or rare earth ions in solids."
https://openalex.org/W1988468514,Advances in the discovery and characterization of asteroids over the past decade have revealed an unanticipated underlying structure that points to a dramatic early history of the inner Solar System. The asteroids in the main asteroid belt have been discovered to be more compositionally diverse with size and distance from the Sun than had previously been known. This implies substantial mixing through processes such as planetary migration and the subsequent dynamical processes.
https://openalex.org/W2081910334,"Magnetic monopoles --- particles that behave as isolated north or south magnetic poles --- have been the subject of speculation since the first detailed observations of magnetism several hundred years ago. Numerous theoretical investigations and hitherto unsuccessful experimental searches have followed Dirac's 1931 development of a theory of monopoles consistent with both quantum mechanics and the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field. The existence of even a single Dirac magnetic monopole would have far-reaching physical consequences, most famously explaining the quantization of electric charge. Although analogues of magnetic monopoles have been found in exotic spin-ices and other systems, there has been no direct experimental observation of Dirac monopoles within a medium described by a quantum field, such as superfluid helium-3. Here we demonstrate the controlled creation of Dirac monopoles in the synthetic magnetic field produced by a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Monopoles are identified, in both experiments and matching numerical simulations, at the termini of vortex lines within the condensate. By directly imaging such a vortex line, the presence of a monopole may be discerned from the experimental data alone. These real-space images provide conclusive and long-awaited experimental evidence of the existence of Dirac monopoles. Our result provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe and manipulate these quantum-mechanical entities in a controlled environment."
https://openalex.org/W2065897880,"Recent clinical trials showed that targeting of inhibitory receptors on T cells induces durable responses in a subset of cancer patients, despite advanced disease. However, the regulatory switches controlling T-cell function in immunosuppressive tumours are not well understood. Here we show that such inhibitory mechanisms can be systematically discovered in the tumour microenvironment. We devised an in vivo pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in which shRNAs targeting negative regulators became highly enriched in murine tumours by releasing a block on T-cell proliferation upon tumour antigen recognition. Such shRNAs were identified by deep sequencing of the shRNA cassette from T cells infiltrating tumour or control tissues. One of the target genes was Ppp2r2d, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A phosphatase family. In tumours, Ppp2r2d knockdown inhibited T-cell apoptosis and enhanced T-cell proliferation as well as cytokine production. Key regulators of immune function can therefore be discovered in relevant tissue microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2033853492,"A map of the surface of a brown dwarf reveals features that suggest patchy clouds, providing the mechanism for the dispersal of atmospheric dust as brown dwarfs cool with age. The recently discovered system known as Luhman 16AB is a binary consisting of two brown dwarfs — objects much bigger than planets but not big enough to become stars — and is a mere six light years from us. Only Alpha Centauri and Barnard's star are closer. Ian Crossfield et al. have now mapped the surface of brown dwarf Luhman 16B in the infrared and find large-scale surface patterns indicative of patchy clouds. Monitoring suggests that the characteristic timescale for the evolution of global weather patterns is about one day. Further observations of the evolution of weather patterns on brown dwarfs could provide a new benchmark for understanding how global circulation conditions affect dusty atmospheres on brown dwarfs and giant extrasolar planets. Brown dwarfs—substellar bodies more massive than planets but not massive enough to initiate the sustained hydrogen fusion that powers self-luminous stars1,2—are born hot and slowly cool as they age. As they cool below about 2,300 kelvin, liquid or crystalline particles composed of calcium aluminates, silicates and iron condense into atmospheric ‘dust’3,4, which disappears at still cooler temperatures (around 1,300 kelvin)5,6. Models to explain this dust dispersal include both an abrupt sinking of the entire cloud deck into the deep, unobservable atmosphere5,7 and breakup of the cloud into scattered patches6,8 (as seen on Jupiter and Saturn9). However, hitherto observations of brown dwarfs have been limited to globally integrated measurements10, which can reveal surface inhomogeneities but cannot unambiguously resolve surface features11. Here we report a two-dimensional map of a brown dwarf’s surface that allows identification of large-scale bright and dark features, indicative of patchy clouds. Monitoring suggests that the characteristic timescale for the evolution of global weather patterns is approximately one day."
https://openalex.org/W2077701817,"The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of cadmium-zinc (Cd-Zn) interactions on their uptake, oxidative damage of cell macromolecules (lipids, proteins, DNA) and activities of antioxidative enzymes in tobacco seedlings as well as roots and leaves of adult plants. Seedlings and plants were exposed to Cd (10 µM and 15 µM) and Zn (25 µM and 50 µM) as well as their combinations (10 µM or 15 µM Cd with either 25 µM or 50 µM Zn). Measurement of metal accumulation exhibited that Zn had mostly positive effect on Cd uptake in roots and seedlings, while Cd had antagonistic effect on Zn uptake in leaves and roots. According to examined oxidative stress parameters, in seedlings and roots individual Cd treatments induced oxidative damage, which was less prominent in combined treatments, indicating that the presence of Zn alleviates oxidative stress. However, DNA damage found in seedlings, and lower glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity recorded in both seedlings and roots, after individual Zn treatments, indicate that Zn accumulation could impose toxic effects. In leaves, oxidative stress was found after exposure to Cd either alone or in combination with Zn, thus implying that in this tissue Zn did not have alleviating effects. In conclusion, results obtained in different tobacco tissues suggest tissue-dependent Cd-Zn interactions, which resulted in activation of different mechanisms involved in the protection against metal stress."
https://openalex.org/W2024238641,"Evidence indicates that central adiposity has increased to a higher degree than general adiposity in children and adolescents in recent decades. However, waist circumference is not a routine measurement in clinical practice.This study aimed to determine the prevalence of abdominal obesity based on waist circumferences (WC) and waist to height ratio (WHtR) in Spanish children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Further, the prevalence of abdominal obesity (AO) among normal and overweight individuals was analyzed.Data were obtained from a study conducted from 1998 to 2000 in a representative national sample of 1521 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years (50.0% female) in Spain. WC and WHtR measurements were obtained in addition to BMI. AO was defined as WHtR ≥0.50 (WHtR-AO), sex and age specific WC≥90(th) percentile (WC-AO1), and sex and age specific WC cut-off values associated with high trunk fat measured by by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (WC-AO2).IOTF- based overweight and obsity prevalence was 21.5% and 6.6% in children and 17.4% and 5.2% in adolescents, respectively. Abdominal obesity (AO) was defined as WHtR≥0.50 (WHtR-AO), sex- and age-specific WC≥90th percentile (WC-AO1), and sex- and age-specific WC cut-off values associated with high trunk fat measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (WC-AO2). The respective prevalence of WHtR-AO, WC-AO1, and WC-AO2 was 21.3% (24.6% boys; 17.9% girls), 9.4% (9.1% boys; 9.7% girls), and 26.8% (30.6% boys;22.9% girls) in children and 14.3% (20.0% boys; 8.7% girls), 9.6% (9.8% boys; 9.5% girls), and 21.1% (28.8% boys; 13.7% girls) in adolescents.The prevalence of AO in Spanish children and adolescents is of concern. The high proportion of AO observed in young patients who are normal weight or overweight indicates a need to include waist circumference measurements in routine clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2084777655,"Although Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in macrophages has been shown to be critical for the development of atherosclerosis upon atherogenic stimuli, it remains unknown whether activated Nlrp3 inflammasomes by other non-atherogenic stimuli induce alterations in macrophages that may contribute in the concert with other factors to atherogenesis. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes by ATP, which is a classical non-lipid danger stimulus, enhances the migration of macrophage and increases lipids deposition in macrophages accelerating foam cell formation. We first demonstrated that extracellular ATP (2.5 mM) markedly increased the formation and activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from wild type (Asc+/+) mice resulting in activation of caspase-1 and IL-1β production. In these Asc+/+ macrophages, such stimulation of inflammasomes by non-lipid ATP was similar to those induced by atherogenic stimuli such as cholesterol crystals or 7-ketocholesterol. Both non-lipid and lipid forms of stimuli induced formation and activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes, which were prevented by Asc gene deletion. Interestingly, Asc+/+ BMMs had dramatic lipids accumulation after stimulation with ATP. Further, we demonstrated that large amount of cholesterol was accumulated in lysosomes of Asc+/+ BMMs when inflammasomes were activated by ATP. Such intracellular and lysosomal lipids deposition was not observed in Asc−/− BMMs and also prevented by caspase-1 inhibitor WEHD. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that migration of Asc+/+ BMMs increased due to stimulation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes, which was markedly attenuated in Asc−/− BMMs. Together, these results suggest that activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes remarkably increases the susceptibility of macrophages to lipid deposition and their migration ability. Such novel action of inflammasomes may facilitate entry or retention of macrophages into the arterial wall, where they form foam cells and ultimately induce atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1986684176,"An increasing number of population studies are assessing epigenetic variation in relation to early-life outcomes in tissues accessible to epidemiologic researchers. Epigenetic mechanisms are highly tissue specific, however, and it is unclear whether the variation observed in one of the tissue types is representative of other sources or whether the variation in DNA methylation is distinct, reflecting potential functional differences across tissues. To assess relations between DNA methylation in various samples from newborns and children in early infancy, we measured promoter or gene-body DNA methylation in matched term placenta, cord blood, and 3-6 mo saliva samples from 27 unrelated infants enrolled in the Rhode Island Child Health Study. We investigated 7 gene loci (KLF15, NR3C1, LEP, DEPTOR, DDIT4, HSD11B2, and CEBPB) and global methylation, using repetitive region LINE-1 and ALUYb8 sequences. We observed a great degree of interlocus, intertissue, and interindividual epigenetic variation in most of the analyzed loci. In correlation analyses, only cord blood NR3C1 promoter methylation correlated negatively with methylation in saliva. We conclude that placenta, cord blood, and saliva cannot be used as a substitute for one another to evaluate DNA methylation at these loci during infancy. Each tissue has a unique epigenetic signature that likely reflects their differential functions. Future studies should consider the uniqueness of these features, to improve epigenetic biomarker discovery and translation."
https://openalex.org/W2066231137,"RGS10 is an important regulator of cell survival and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. We recently showed that RGS10 transcript expression is suppressed during acquired chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The suppression of RGS10 is due to DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation, two important mechanisms that contribute to silencing of tumor suppressor genes during cancer progression. Here, we fully investigate the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic silencing of RGS10 expression in chemoresistant A2780-AD ovarian cancer cells. We identify two important epigenetic regulators, HDAC1 and DNMT1, that exhibit aberrant association with RGS10 promoters in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of HDAC1 or DNMT1 expression, and pharmacological inhibition of DNMT or HDAC enzymatic activity, significantly increases RGS10 expression and cisplatin-mediated cell death. Finally, DNMT1 knock down also decreases HDAC1 binding to the RGS10 promoter in chemoresistant cells, suggesting HDAC1 recruitment to RGS10 promoters requires DNMT1 activity. Our results suggest that HDAC1 and DNMT1 contribute to the suppression of RGS10 during acquired chemoresistance and support inhibition of HDAC1 and DNMT1 as an adjuvant therapeutic approach to overcome ovarian cancer chemoresistance."

However, the biochemical and biophysical analysis of the assembly of TJ strands is limited by their sensitivity to detergents. This, so far, prevented solubilization or in vitro reconstitution of intact TJ strands. To circumvent this limitation, we analyzed claudin assembly in a native cellular environment. TJ strands were reconstituted in HEK293 cells by transfection with claudin constructs C-terminally tagged with YFP. In this system, strand formation can be analyzed independently of endogenous claudins and TJ-regulating proteins containing a PDZ domain (2Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N.

To identify claudin segments and residues involved in this difference, a panel of Cldn3/Cldn5 chimeras (ChA-ChG) was created by mixing the different predicted segments (transmembrane segments (TM1–4), intracellular loops (ICLs), and ECLs.

Transient transfections were performed using PEI (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the recommendations of the supplier. For live-cell imaging, 2 days after transfection, cells were transferred to 1 ml Hanks' balanced salt solution with Ca2+, Mg2+, glucose, and sodium bicarbonate and without phenol red (Invitrogen). The plasma membrane was visualized by addition of 20 μl of trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany), 0.05% in PBS. Cells were examined with a LSM 510 META system containing an Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with a PlanNeofluar ×100/1.3 objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), (2Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Formation of tight junction. Determinants of homophilic interaction between classic claudins.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To quantify claudin enrichment at contacts between two claudin-expressing cells, confocal images of living cells were analyzed using the LSM 510 software (Carl Zeiss). Two different methods were used. The enrichment factor (EF) was measured using intensity profiles of confocal images. Contacts between two cells were identified by the trypan blue fluorescence peaks indicating the plasma membrane. For each cell pair, three fluorescence intensity profiles were quantified. For cultures of Cldn/chimera-YFP-expressing cells, the EF was calculated as (intensity at contact between two Cldn/chimera-expressing cells)/(sum of intensities at contact between the two expressing cells and non-expressing cells) (2Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Formation of tight junction. Determinants of homophilic interaction between classic claudins.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The EF could not be usefully determined for constructs that showed a saturation of the signal at contacts between two Cldn/chimera-expressing cells but no clear signal between Cldn/chimera-expressing and non-expressing cells. For these constructs, the percentage of enrichment-positive contacts was quantified as contacts between two Cldn/chimera-YFP-expressing cells with a strong YFP signal. To quantify the ratio of claudin signals in the plasma membrane versus the nuclear membrane, images of single Cldn/chimera-expressing cells were taken. Either the plasma membrane identified by trypan blue or the nuclear membrane identified morphologically were detected close to the saturation of the signals (depending on which signal was stronger). Five fluorescence intensity profiles per cell were quantified and averaged. FRET experiments at cell-cell contacts were performed using Cldn-CFP/Cldn-YFP-cotransfected HEK293 cells, as described previously (2Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C.

Pellets of 10 cm2 of transiently transfected HEK293 cells were resuspended in sample buffer (1× NativePAGETM sample buffer, 1% DDM (Invitrogen), and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C. To 5 μl of supernatant, 5 μl of sample buffer including 0.5% NativePAGETM G-250 sample additive (Invitrogen) was added. As a marker, we used NativeMarkTM unstained protein standard (Invitrogen) and applied a correction factor of 0.6 similar to that used for claudins, as described previously (23Van Itallie C.M. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Claudin-2 forms homodimers and is a component of a high molecular weight protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3442-3450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen) on the basis of Ref. 24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Blue native electrophoresis for isolation of membrane protein complexes in enzymatically active form.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar. Gels were transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were fixed in 8% acetic acid for 15 min, destained with 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, 2% SDS for 15 min, washed with H2O, and blocked with 3% milk powder for 1 h. Western blotting was performed with mouse anti-GFP (catalog no. JL-8, Clontech) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen). A close proximity between claudin molecules was detected by FRET between CFP and YFP tags. Cldn-CFP/Cldn-YFP-cotransfected HEK293 cells were lysed in PBS containing 1% DDM (Sigma-Aldrich) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation (30 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was analyzed in a FP-6500 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). CFP fluorescence was detected with λexcitation of 425 ± 5 nm and λemission of 475 ± 5 nm; YFP with λexcitation of 490 ± 5 nm and λemission of 525 ± 5 nm; and the FRET signal with λexcitation of 425 ± 5 nm and λemission of 525 ± 5 nm. Cross-talk of YFP fluorescence to the CFP and FRET signal was determined with samples containing either YFP or CFP only; for λ-excitation of 425 ± 5 nm and λ-emission of 475 ± 5 nm, the signal was 2% of the YFP signal (ϵ1 = 0.02), and for λ-emission of 525 ± 5 nm, the signal was 5% of the YFP signal (ϵ2 = 0.05). As a measure of the FRET efficiency, the FRET ratio was calculated as (FRET signal − ϵ2 × YFP fluorescence)/(CFP fluorescence − ϵ1 × YFP fluorescence). For negative controls, a FRET ratio of about 0.4 was obtained (9Piontek J. Fritzsche S. Cording J. Richter S. Hartwig J. Walter M. Yu D. Turner J.R. Gehring C. Rahn H.P. Wolburg H. Blasig I.E. Elucidating the principles of the molecular organization of heteropolymeric tight junction strands.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 3903-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with Cldn/chimera-YFP constructs. Three days later, they were washed with PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (electron microscopy-grade, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS Ca2+/Mg2+ for 2 h, washed, and processed for freeze-fracture electron microscopy as reported previously (25Wolburg H. Liebner S. Lippoldt A. Cerebral endothelial tight junctional structure as revealed by freeze-fracture.Meth. Mol. Biol. 2003; 89: 51-66Google Scholar). For quantification of the continuity and the P-/E-face association of the TJ strands, the particle coverage along strand axis was determined as follows. FFEM images were analyzed with ImageJ by measuring the length of the strands and counting the intramembranous particles at a given position along the strand axis in 10-nm steps. The particle coverage was defined as the number of particles × 10 nm/total length of analyzed strands. This was done for the P- and E-faces. For each construct, more than seven strand network areas were analyzed. Sequence alignments for murine Cldn3 and Cldn5 were created with the GCG program package (GCG Wisconsin package, Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and visualized with Geneiouse Pro 5.4.4 (Geneious Pro 5.4.4 created by Biomatters). Transmembrane helix predictions were performed with the GCG program package and TMHMM (26Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden Markov model. Application to complete genomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, results are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). First, normality tests were performed (D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus and Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Data sets exhibiting normal distribution were analyzed using unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Data sets not showing normal distribution were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. Seven chimeras (ChA-ChG, Fig. 1, A and B) with a C-terminal YFP tag were expressed by transfection in the TJ-free cell line HEK293. Similarly to Cldn3 and Cldn5, the chimeras ChA, ChF, and ChG colocalized with the plasma membrane. However, in contrast with Cldn3 and Cldn5, the chimeras ChA, ChF, and ChG were not enriched at contacts between claudin-expressing cells (Fig. 2, A, B, D, E, G, and H). This indicates inhibition of the trans-interaction. FFEM was performed to analyze whether this inhibition affects strand formation. Although extended networks of TJ strands were easily detected for Cldn3 and Cldn5 (Refs. 2Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E.

https://openalex.org/W2146794439,"Background and aims MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known for their function as translational regulators of tumor suppressor or oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNAs related genes have been shown to affect the regulatory capacity of miRNAs and were linked with gastric cancer (GC) and premalignant gastric conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential associations between miRNA-related gene polymorphisms (miR-27a, miR-146a, miR-196a-2, miR-492 and miR-608) and the presence of GC or high risk atrophic gastritis (HRAG) in European population. Methods Gene polymorphisms were analyzed in 995 subjects (controls: n = 351; GC: n = 363; HRAG: n = 281) of European descent. MiR-27a T>C (rs895819), miR-146a G>C (rs2910164), miR-196a-2 C>T (rs11614913), miR-492 G>C (rs2289030) and miR-608 C>G (rs4919510) SNPs were genotyped by RT-PCR. Results Overall, SNPs of miRNAs were not associated with the presence of GC or HRAG. We observed a tendency for miR-196a-2 CT genotype to be associated with higher risk of GC when compared to CC genotype, however, the difference did not reach the adjusted P-value (odds ratio (OR) - 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.07, P = 0.032). MiR-608 GG genotype was more frequent in GC when compared to controls (OR −2.34, 95% CI 1.08–5.04), but significance remained marginal (P = 0.029). A similar tendency was observed in a recessive model for miR-608, where CC + CG vs GG genotype comparison showed a tendency for increased risk of GC with OR of 2.44 (95% CI 1.14–5.22, P = 0.021). The genotypes and alleles of miR-27a, miR-146a, miR-196a-2, miR-492 and miR-608 SNPs had similar distribution between histological subtypes of GC and were not linked with the presence of diffuse or intestinal-type GC. Conclusions Gene polymorphisms of miR-27a, miR-146a, miR-196a-2, miR-492, miR-492a and miR-608 were not associated with the presence of HRAG, GC or different histological subtypes of GC in European subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2067394087,"In vitro studies have suggested that isolated gut bacteria are able to metabolize PUFA into CLA (conjugated linoleic acids) and CLnA (conjugated linolenic acids). However, the bioavailability of fatty acid metabolites produced in vivo by the gut microbes remains to be studied. Therefore, we measured intestinal concentration and plasma accumulation of bacterial metabolites produced from dietary PUFA in mice, first injected with a lipoprotein lipase inhibitor, then force-fed with either sunflower oil (200 µl) rich in n-6 PUFA or linseed oil (200 µl) rich in n-3 PUFA. The greatest production of bacterial metabolites was observed in the caecum and colon, and at a much lesser extent in the jejunum and ileum. In the caecal content, CLA proportions were higher in sunflower oil force-fed mice whereas CLnA proportions were higher in linseed oil force-fed mice. The accumulation of the main metabolites (CLA cis-9,trans-11-18:2 and CLnA cis-9,trans-11,cis-15-18:3) in the caecal tissue was not associated with their increase in the plasma, therefore suggesting that, if endogenously produced CLA and CLnA have any biological role in host metabolism regulation, their effect would be confined at the intestinal level, where the microbiota is abundant."
https://openalex.org/W2010082093,"Paraquat poisoning associates very high mortality rate. Early treatment with hemoperfusion is strongly suggested by animal and human studies. Although the survival benefit of additional immunosuppressive treatment (IST) in combination with hemoperfusion is also reported since 1971, the large-scale randomized control trials to confirm the effects of IST is difficult to be executed. Therefore, we designed this nationwide large-scale population-based retrospective cohort study to investigate the outcome of paraquat poisoning with hemoperfusion and the additional effects of IST combined with hemoperfusion. This nationwide retrospective cohort study utilized data retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. A total of 1811 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of paraquat poisoning who received hemoperfusion between 1997 and 2009 were enrolled. The mean age of all 1811 study subjects was 47.3 years. 70% was male. The overall survival rate was only 26.4%. Respiratory failure and renal failure were diagnosed in 56.2% and 36% patients. The average frequency of hemoperfusion was twice. IST was added in 42.2% patients. IST significantly increases survival rate (from 24.3% to 29.3%, P<0.001). The combined IST with methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone associates with the highest survival rate (48%, P<0.001). Moreover, patients younger than 45 years of age in the IST group had the best survival (41.0% vs. 33.7%, p<0.001). Our results support the use of IST with hemoperfusion for paraquat-poisoned patients. The best survival effect of IST is the combination of methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide and daily dexamethasone, especially in patients with younger age."
https://openalex.org/W2035161955,"Background Although child undernutrition and stunting has been decreasing worldwide while obesity rates increase, these extreme conditions might coexist in families from low- and middle-income countries. We examined the association between maternal and child anthropometric indicators using a population representative sample. Methods 4,258 non-pregnant women and their children <60 months who participated in the 2006 Brazilian Demographic Health Survey. We compared the distributions of two nutritional indexes of children, height-for-age (HAZ) and body mass index-for age (BAZ) z-scores, by categories of maternal height, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC). Adjusted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated from linear regression, taking into account the complex survey design. We also examined the associations of maternal anthropometry with the prevalence of child stunting (HAZ<−2) and overweight/obesity (BAZ>2). Results HAZ was positively associated with maternal height and WC in a linear fashion. After adjustment, for sociodemographic characteristics, children whose mothers' height was<145 cm had 1.2 lower HAZ than children whose mothers were ≥160 cm tall (p-trend<0.0001). After further adjustment for maternal height and maternal BMI, children of mothers with a waist circumference ≥88 cm had 0.3 higher HAZ than those of mothers with WC<80 cm (p-trend<0.01). Adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CI for stunting by the categories of maternal height (<145, 145–149, 150–154, 155–159 and ≥160 cm) were, respectively, 2.95 (1.51;5.77), 2.29 (1.33;3.93), 1.09 (0.63;1.87), and 0.89 (0.45;1.77), (p-trend = 0.001). BAZ was positively associated with maternal BMI and WC. Conclusion We observed a strong, positive association of maternal and child nutritional status. Mothers of low stature had children with lower stature, mothers with central obesity had taller children, and mothers with overall or abdominal obesity had children with higher BAZ."

This awaits confirmation in independent cohorts including investigation of the role of T2-lesion load (T2-LL), which is another important determinant of cognition in MS. We here thus aimed to test this cognitive reserve hypothesis by investigating whether educational attainment (EA) moderates the negative effects of both brain atrophy and T2-LL on cognitive function in a large sample of MS patients.137 patients participated in the study. Cognition was assessed by the ""Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests."" T2-LL, normalized brain volume (global volume loss) and third ventricle width (regional volume loss) served as MRI markers.Both T2-LL and atrophy predicted worse cognition, with a stronger effect of T2-LL. Higher EA (as assessed by years of education) also predicted better cognition. Interactions showed that the negative effects of T2-LL and regional brain atrophy were moderated by EA.In a cohort with different stages of MS, higher EA attenuated the negative effects of white matter lesion burden and third ventricle width (suggestive of thalamic atrophy) on cognitive performance. Actively enhancing cognitive reserve might thus be a means to reduce or prevent cognitive problems in MS in parallel to disease modifying drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2006587707,"Evidence indicates that disruption of normal prenatal development influences an individual's risk of developing obesity and cardiovascular disease as an adult. Thus, understanding how in utero exposure to chemical agents leads to increased susceptibility to adult diseases is a critical health related issue. Our aim was to determine whether adenosine A1 receptors (A1ARs) mediate the long-term effects of in utero caffeine exposure on cardiac function and whether these long-term effects are the result of changes in DNA methylation patterns in adult hearts. Pregnant A1AR knockout mice were treated with caffeine (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.09% NaCl) i.p. at embryonic day 8.5. This caffeine treatment results in serum levels equivalent to the consumption of 2–4 cups of coffee in humans. After dams gave birth, offspring were examined at 8–10 weeks of age. A1AR+/+ offspring treated in utero with caffeine were 10% heavier than vehicle controls. Using echocardiography, we observed altered cardiac function and morphology in adult mice exposed to caffeine in utero. Caffeine treatment decreased cardiac output by 11% and increased left ventricular wall thickness by 29% during diastole. Using DNA methylation arrays, we identified altered DNA methylation patterns in A1AR+/+ caffeine treated hearts, including 7719 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) within the genome and an overall decrease in DNA methylation of 26%. Analysis of genes associated with DMRs revealed that many are associated with cardiac hypertrophy. These data demonstrate that A1ARs mediate in utero caffeine effects on cardiac function and growth and that caffeine exposure leads to changes in DNA methylation."

B. subtilis spores have also been shown to behave as particulate vaccine adjuvants, promoting the increase of antibody responses after co-administration with antigens either admixed or adsorbed on the spore surface. In this study, we further evaluated the immune modulatory properties of B. subtilis spores using a recombinant HIV gag p24 protein as a model antigen. The adjuvant effects of B. subtilis spores were not affected by the genetic background of the mouse lineage and did not induce significant inflammatory or deleterious effects after parenteral administration. Our results demonstrated that co-administration, but not adsorption to the spore surface, enhanced the immunogenicity of that target antigen after subcutaneous administration to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Spores promoted activation of antigen presenting cells as demonstrated by the upregulation of MHC and CD40 molecules and enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by murine dendritic cells. In addition, in vivo studies indicated a direct role of the innate immunity on the immunomodulatory properties of B. subtilis spores, as demonstrated by the lack of adjuvant effects on MyD88 and TLR2 knockout mouse strains."
https://openalex.org/W2083829020,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract in huntingtin (htt) protein. The expansion leads to increased htt aggregation and toxicity. Factors that aid in the clearance of mutant huntingtin proteins should relieve the toxicity. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of ubiqulin-1, which facilitates protein clearance through the proteasome and autophagy pathways, reduces huntingtin aggregates and toxicity in mammalian cell and invertebrate models of HD. Here we tested whether overexpression of ubiquilin-1 delays or prevents neurodegeneration in R6/2 mice, a well-established model of HD. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing human ubiquilin-1 driven by the neuron-specific Thy1.2 promoter. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed robust and widespread overexpression of ubiquilin-1 in the brains of the transgenic mice. Similar analysis of R6/2 animals revealed that ubiquilin is localized in huntingtin aggregates and that ubiquilin levels decrease progressively to 30% during the end-stage of disease. We crossed our ubiquilin-1 transgenic line with R6/2 mice to assess whether restoration of ubiquilin levels would delay HD symptoms and pathology. In the double transgenic progeny, ubiquilin levels were fully restored, and this correlated with a 20% increase in lifespan and a reduction in htt inclusions in the hippocampus and cortex. Furthermore, immunoblots indicated that endoplasmic reticulum stress response that is elevated in the hippocampus of R6/2 animals was attenuated by ubiquilin-1 overexpression. However, ubiquilin-1 overexpression neither altered the load of htt aggregates in the striatum nor improved motor impairments in the mice."
https://openalex.org/W2104395198,"Background Major life changes may play a causative role in health through lifestyle factors, such as alcohol. The objective was to examine the impact of stressful life events on heavy alcohol consumption among French adults. Methods Trajectories of excessive alcohol consumption in 20,625 employees of the French national gas and electricity company for up to 5 years before and 5 years after an event, with annual measurements from 1992. We used repeated measures analysis of time series data indexed to events, employing generalized estimating equations. Results For women, excessive alcohol use increased before important purchase (p = 0.021), children leaving home (p<0.001), and death of loved ones (p = 0.03), and decreased before widowhood (p = 0.015); in the year straddling the event, increased consumption was observed for important purchase (p = 0.018) and retirement (p = 0.002); at the time of the event, consumption decreased for marriage (p = 0.002), divorce, widowhood, and death of loved one (all p<0.001), and increased for retirement (p = 0.035). For men, heavy alcohol consumption increased in the years up to and surrounding the death of loved ones, retirement, and important purchase (all p<0.001), and decreased after (all p<0.001, except death of loved one: p = 0.006); at the time of the event, consumption decreased for all events except for children leaving home and retirement, where we observed an increase (all p<0.001). For women and men, heavy alcohol consumption decreased prior to marriage and divorce and increased after (all p<0.001, except for women and marriage: p = 0.01). Conclusion Stressful life events promote healthy and unhealthy alcohol consumption. Certain events impact alcohol intake temporarily while others have longer-term implications. Research should disentangle women's and men's distinct perceptions of events over time."
https://openalex.org/W2067066994,"Background It has been previously shown that loss of consciousness is associated with a breakdown of dominating fronto-parietal feedback connectivity as assessed by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Structure and strength of network connectivity may change over time. Aim of the current study is to investigate cortico-cortical connectivity at different time intervals during consciousness and unconsciousness. For this purpose, EEG symbolic transfer entropy (STEn) was calculated to indicate cortico-cortical information transfer at different transfer times. Methods The study was performed in 15 male volunteers. 29-channel EEG was recorded during consciousness and propofol-induced unconsciousness. EEG data were analyzed by STEn, which quantifies intensity and directionality of the mutual information flow between two EEG channels. STEn was computed over fronto-parietal channel pair combinations (10 s length, 0.5–45 Hz total bandwidth) to analyze changes of intercortical directional connectivity. Feedback (fronto → parietal) and feedforward (parieto → frontal) connectivity was calculated for transfer times from 25 ms to 250 ms in 5 ms steps. Transfer times leading to maximum directed interaction were identified to detect changes of cortical information transfer (directional connectivity) induced by unconsciousness (p<0.05). Results The current analyses show that fronto-parietal connectivity is a non-static phenomenon. Maximum detected interaction occurs at decreased transfer times during propofol-induced unconsciousness (feedback interaction: 60 ms to 40 ms, p = 0.002; feedforward interaction: 65 ms to 45 ms, p = 0.001). Strength of maximum feedback interaction decreases during unconsciousness (p = 0.026), while no effect of propofol was observed on feedforward interaction. During both consciousness and unconsciousness, intensity of fronto-parietal interaction fluctuates with increasing transfer times. Conclusion Non-stationarity of directional connectivity may play a functional role for cortical network communication as it shows characteristic changes during propofol-induced unconsciousness."
https://openalex.org/W2011117276,"Copy number variations (CNVs) are important forms of genomic variation, and have attracted extensive attentions in humans as well as domestic animals. In the study, using a custom-designed 2.1 M array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), genome-wide CNVs were identified among 12 individuals from diverse pig breeds, including one Asian wild population, six Chinese indigenous breeds and two modern commercial breeds (Yorkshire and Landrace), with one individual of the other modern commercial breed, Duroc, as the reference. A total of 1,344 CNV regions (CNVRs) were identified, covering 47.79 Mb (∼1.70%) of the pig genome. The length of these CNVRs ranged from 3.37 Kb to 1,319.0 Kb with a mean of 35.56 Kb and a median of 11.11 Kb. Compared with similar studies reported, most of the CNVRs (74.18%) were firstly identified in present study. In order to confirm these CNVRs, 21 CNVRs were randomly chosen to be validated by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and a high rate (85.71%) of confirmation was obtained. Functional annotation of CNVRs suggested that the identified CNVRs have important function, and may play an important role in phenotypic and production traits difference among various breeds. Our results are essential complementary to the CNV map in the pig genome, which will provide abundant genetic markers to investigate association studies between various phenotypes and CNVs in pigs."

The plasma membrane protein MCA1 and its paralog MCA2 from Arabidopsis thaliana are involved in mechanical stress-induced Ca2+ influx and are thus considered as candidates for such channels or their regulators. Both MCA1 and MCA2 were functionally expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system in order to elucidate their molecular natures. Because of the abundance of protein in these cells, MCA2 was chosen for purification. Purified MCA2 in a detergent-solubilized state formed a tetramer, which was confirmed by chemical cross-linking. Single-particle analysis of cryo-electron microscope images was performed to depict the overall shape of the purified protein. The three-dimensional structure of MCA2 was reconstructed at a resolution of 26 Å from 5,500 particles and appears to comprise a small transmembrane region and large cytoplasmic region."
https://openalex.org/W1972652789,"Although testicular germ cell tumors are generally quite responsive to treatment with cisplatin, a small fraction of them acquire resistance during therapy. Even when cisplatin treatment is successful the patient is often left with a residual teratoma at the site of the primary tumor suggesting that cisplatin may trigger differentiation in some tumors. Using the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTera2/D1, we confirmed that exposure to the differentiating agent retinoic acid produced a reduction in pluripotency markers NANOG and POU5F1 (Oct3/4) and an acute concentration-dependent increase in resistance to both cisplatin and paclitaxel that reached as high as 18-fold for cisplatin and 61-fold for paclitaxel within four days. A two day exposure to cisplatin also produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the expression of the NANOG and POU5F1 and increased expression of three markers whose levels increase with differentiation including Nestin, SCG10 and Fibronectin. In parallel, exposure to cisplatin induced up to 6.2-fold resistance to itself and 104-fold resistance to paclitaxel. Paclitaxel did not induce differentiation or resistance to either itself or cisplatin. Neither retinoic acid nor cisplatin induced resistance in cervical or prostate cancer cell lines or other germ cell tumor lines in which they failed to alter the expression of NANOG and POU5F1. Forced expression of NANOG prevented the induction of resistance to cisplatin by retinoic acid. We conclude that cisplatin can acutely induce resistance to itself and paclitaxel by triggering a differentiation response in pluripotent germ cell tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2146042929,"CD80 plays a critical role in stimulation of T cells and subsequent control of infection. To investigate the effect of CD80 on HSV-1 infection, we constructed a recombinant HSV-1 virus that expresses two copies of the CD80 gene in place of the latency associated transcript (LAT). This mutant virus (HSV-CD80) expressed high levels of CD80 and had similar virus replication kinetics as control viruses in rabbit skin cells. In contrast to parental virus, this CD80 expressing recombinant virus replicated efficiently in immature dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, the susceptibility of immature DCs to HSV-CD80 infection was mediated by CD80 binding to PD-L1 on DCs. This interaction also contributed to a significant increase in T cell activation. Taken together, these results suggest that inclusion of CD80 as a vaccine adjuvant may promote increased vaccine efficacy by enhancing the immune response directly and also indirectly by targeting to DC."
https://openalex.org/W1969515173,"Externally shelled cephalopods were important elements in open marine habitats throughout Earth history. Paleotemperatures calculated on the basis of the oxygen isotope composition of their shells can provide insights into ancient marine systems as well as the ecology of this important group of organisms. In some sedimentary deposits, however, the aragonitic shell of the ammonite or nautilid is poorly or not preserved at all, while the calcitic structures belonging to the jaws are present. This study tests for the first time if the calcitic jaw structures in fossil cephalopods can be used as a proxy for paleotemperature. We first analyzed the calcitic structures on the jaws of Recent Nautilus and compared the calculated temperatures of precipitation with those from the aragonitic shell in the same individuals. Our results indicate that the jaws of Recent Nautilus are secreted in isotopic equilibrium, and the calculated temperatures approximately match those of the shell. We then extended our study to ammonites from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Pierre Shale of the U.S. Western Interior and the age-equivalent Mooreville Chalk of the Gulf Coastal Plain. In the Pierre Shale, jaws occur in situ inside the body chambers of well-preserved Baculites while in the Mooreville Chalk, the jaw elements appear as isolated occurrences in the sediment and the aragonitic shell material is not preserved. For the Pierre Shale specimens, the calculated temperatures of well-preserved jaw material match those of well-preserved shell material in the same individual. Analyses of the jaw elements in the Mooreville Chalk permit a comparison of the paleotemperatures between the two sites, and show that the Western Interior is warmer than the Gulf Coast at that time. In summary, our data indicate that the calcitic jaw elements of cephalopods can provide a reliable geochemical archive of the habitat of fossil forms."

Recombinant GST-Bic-C N-terminal fusion protein (residues 1–506) was expressed and purified as described (15Hou Z. Danzer J.R. Mendoza L. Bose M.E. Müller U. Williams B. Fox C.A.

The various RNA substrates were derived from the xCR1 3′-UTR and uniformly radiolabeled by in vitro transcription reactions that included P32UTP (8Zhang Y. Forinash K.D. McGivern J. Fritz B. Dorey K.

The negative control RNA (negative control, 261 nucleotides) was generated from the polylinker of the pSTBlue-1 plasmid (Novagen/EMD Biosciences). Binding reactions (20 μl) contained GST-Bic-C-NT protein (either 0, 50, 200 nm), 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.02% Tween 20, 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 nm RNA. Reaction products were analyzed on 4% (1× TBE) native polyacrylamide gels (7Zhang Y. Cooke A. Park S. Dewey C.N. Wickens M.

Uniformly radiolabeled RNAs were combined with recombinant Bic-C N-terminal fusion protein (200 nm) using conditions identical to those used for electrophoretic mobility assays with the addition of RNase T1 (1000 units) or RNaseOne (10 units, Promega) to some of the reactions. The reaction products were analyzed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 287–464 xCR1 RNA substrate was radiolabeled at its 5′ end using polynucleotide kinase and γ-32P-labeled ATP. Footprinting reactions (20 μl) contained 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.02% Tween 20, 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 nm RNA. Reactions also contained various amounts of GST-Bic-C N-terminal protein or Bic-C N-terminal protein. The Bic-C N-terminal protein was generated from a recombinant SUMO-Bic-C-N-terminal protein using SUMO protease to cleave off the SUMO tag (17Malakhov M.P. Mattern M.R. Malakhova O.A. Drinker M. Weeks S.D. Butt T.R. SUMO fusions and SUMO-specific protease for efficient expression and purification of proteins.J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated 10 min at 20 °C. RNaseA (10 pg) was added, and incubation was continued for 2 min. The reaction products were analyzed by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and compared with RNA molecular weight markers generated by 5′-radiolabeling RNAs of the low range ssRNA ladder (New England Biolabs). RNA markers to delineate the boundaries of the 32-nucleotide Bic-C binding site were generated by treating the 5′ end-labeled 287–464 RNA with oligonucleotides and RNase H. Mk1 was created with oligonucleotide ctttgtcaattaataaaaaaatttaaaaaaaaataaaagtttgtgaa and Mk2 was created with oligonucleotide gctgttaatgtacaacgtgtctaataag. To biochemically analyze the interaction between Bic-C and the xCR1 3′-UTR, three independent RNA-protein interaction assays were used. First, we used EMSAs to analyze RNA binding by Bic-C (Fig. 1). We previously demonstrated that a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal half of Bic-C, including the KH and KH-like domains (Bic-C N-terminal; amino acids 1–506 of Bic-C) binds the xCR1 TCE but not other similarly sized RNAs (7Zhang Y. Cooke A. Park S. Dewey C.N. Wickens M. Sheets M.D. Bicaudal-C spatially controls translation of vertebrate maternal mRNAs.RNA. 2013; 11: 1575-1582Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Forinash K.D. McGivern J. Fritz B. Dorey K. Sheets M.D. Spatially restricted translation of the xCR1 mRNA in Xenopus embryos.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3791-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To define a region of the TCE sufficient for Bic-C binding, radiolabeled RNAs corresponding to different regions of the TCE were mixed with purified Bic-C N-terminal protein, and the reactions were analyzed by EMSA. Bic-C N-terminal efficiently bound the intact TCE RNA (nts 286–637) and the RNA containing the 5′-half of the TCE (nts 286–464) (Fig. 1, A and C, lanes 1–8). In contrast, Bic-C bound the RNA containing the 3′-half of the TCE (nts 465–637) less efficiently (Fig. 1C, lanes 9–12). Further analysis of smaller RNAs derived from the 5′-half of the TCE (nts 286–464) (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–18) identified a 32-nucleotide RNA (nts 358–389 of the TCE) that was sufficient for Bic-C binding (Fig. 1D, lanes 13–15). As a second approach, Bic-C binding to the xCR1 TCE RNA was analyzed with an RNase protection assay (Fig. 2). In these assays, uniformly 32P-labeled xCR1 TCE RNA (nts 286–637 of the xCR1 3′-UTR), was incubated with Bic-C N-terminal protein and the binding reactions were treated with RNase T1 that cleaves RNA only after guanine residues. The reaction products were analyzed by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bound Bic-C N-terminal protein should protect G residues within the Bic-C binding sites from cleavage by the RNase. RNase T1 treatment of the TCE RNA in the absence of Bic-C protein produced the predicted RNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 2, A–C, lane 2). When Bic-C N-terminal protein was present in the reaction, a new protected RNA product 86 nucleotides in length was observed (Fig. 2C, lanes 3–5). This protected RNA fragment was gel-purified and treated with RNase T1, and the products analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The RNA fragment protected from RNase T1 cleavage by Bic-C was composed of a characteristic set of RNase T1 RNA oligonucleotides (Figs. 2D, lane 2). The oligonucleotides from the Bic-C-protected fragment were a subset of oligonucleotides generated from RNase T1 treatment of the TCE RNA (Figs. 2, A, B, and D, lane 2). These results indicate that the Bic-C protected RNA fragment includes the same 32-nucleotide region of the TCE sufficient for Bic-C binding as measured in EMSAs (Fig. 1). The specificity of RNase T1 (i.e. RNase T1 cleaves RNA only after G residues) (18Takahashi K. Uchida T. Egami F. Ribonuclease T1, structure and function.Adv. Biophys. 1970; 1: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar) limits the resolution of the protection assays performed with this enzyme. To address this bias, protection experiments were also performed with RNaseOne, an enzyme with no nucleotide specificity for cleavage (19Meador 3rd, J. Cannon B. Cannistraro V.J. Kennell D. Purification and characterization of Escherichia coli RNase I. Comparisons with RNase M.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Meador 3rd, J. Kennell D. Cloning and sequencing the gene encoding Escherichia coli ribonuclease I: exact physical mapping using the genome library.Gene. 1990; 95: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Uniformly radiolabeled TCE RNA (nts 286–637 of the xCR1 3′-UTR) treated with RNaseOne was cleaved into short RNA oligonucleotides <11 nucleotides in length (Fig. 2E, lane 3). The addition of Bic-C N-terminal protein to the reaction produced Bic-C protected RNA products 31 to 34 nucleotides in length (Fig. 2, E, lane 5, and F, lane 2). The RNase One protected fragments were purified, cleaved with RNase T1, and the products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resulting RNA oligonucleotides indicated that the RNase One protected RNAs were composed of a distinctive set of T1 RNA oligonucleotides characteristic of the 32-nucleotide region sufficient for Bic-C binding (Fig. 2, F, lane 3, and see Fig. 2, A and B, fragments indicated by blue line). RNase footprinting was used as third approach to analyze Bic-C-TCE interactions. RNA consisting of the 5′-half of the TCE (nts 286–464 of the xCR1 3′-UTR, Fig. 3A) was radiolabeled at its 5′ end. The labeled RNA was treated with limiting amounts of RNase A in the presence or absence of the Bic N-terminal protein (Fig. 3C), and the products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3B). The Bic-C N-terminal protein protected a region of the TCE RNA from RNase A cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–12). Comparison of the reaction products to specific RNA markers (Fig. 3, A and B, Mk1 and Mk2) demonstrates that the Bic-C N-terminal protected region coincided with the same 32-nucleotide minimal Bic-C binding site defined independently by EMSAs and RNase protection (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Thus, three independent and complementary biochemical approaches for examining RNA-protein interactions support the conclusion that a single 32-nucleotide RNA region within the xCR1 mRNA 3′-UTR constitutes a minimal Bic-C binding site. Inspection of the Bic-C binding site (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) using mFOLD (21Zuker M. Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10284) Google Scholar) indicated that this 32-nucleotide RNA could potentially form a secondary structure that consisted of a five nucleotide stem with a six-nucleotide loop (Fig. 4A). To test the importance of this predicted structure for Bic-C binding, RNA variants containing specific nucleotide base changes were analyzed for Bic-C binding by EMSAs (see Fig. 1). RNAs containing three nucleotide changes of one or the other strand of the predicted stem impaired Bic-C binding (Fig. 4B, Stem1 and Stem2 RNAs, and Fig. 4C, lanes 5–8). However, efficient binding could be restored using another RNA variant that contained three additional nucleotide changes predicted to restore complementary base pairing between strands of the putative stem (Fig. 4B, Stem1/Stem2 RNA, and Fig. 4C, lanes 9 and 10). In addition, Bic-C efficiently bound RNAs that contained either two additional GC base pairs added to the base of the stem (Fig. 4B, Stem+2GC RNA, and Fig. 4D, lanes 3 and 4) or 10 nucleotide changes of the putative stem predicted to maintain base pairing between strands (Fig. 4B, Stem10 RNA, and Fig. 4D, lanes 5 and 6). These results support a model in which a stem structure rather than sequence of the stem is an important characteristic of the Bic-C binding site present in the xCR1 3′-UTR. Although the stem was important for binding, it was not sufficient. Bic-C did not bind efficiently to an RNA substrate that contains the stem but lacks the region preceding the stem (RNA 368–389, Fig. 4C, lanes 11 and 12). Also, the importance of putative loop for Bic-C binding was analyzed with an additional RNA variant in which the nucleotide sequence of the loop was changed (Fig. 4B, Loop). Bic-C failed to bind this RNA variant (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these results provide evidence that the RNA binding site for Bic-C within the xCR1 mRNA TCE formed a stem-loop structure in which both the stem and the sequence of the loop are important determinants for recognition by Bic-C. The central region of the xCR1 mRNA 3′-UTR, termed the TCE (translational control region; nts 286–637) is sufficient for Bic-C-mediated translational repression (7Zhang Y. Cooke A. Park S. Dewey C.N. Wickens M. Sheets M.D. Bicaudal-C spatially controls translation of vertebrate maternal mRNAs.RNA. 2013; 11: 1575-1582Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Forinash K.D. McGivern J. Fritz B. Dorey K. Sheets M.D. Spatially restricted translation of the xCR1 mRNA in Xenopus embryos.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3791-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mRNA that encodes the Bic-C protein is localized to vegetal cells of Xenopus embryos. Consequently, animal cells of the embryo are normally deficient for Bic-C (22Wessely O. De Robertis E.M. The Xenopus homologue of Bicaudal-C is a localized maternal mRNA that can induce endoderm formation.Development. 2000; 127: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and as a result of this deficiency, the xCR1 mRNA is translated in animal cells. Thus animal cells of Xenopus embryos provide a context to assay for Bic-C-mediated repression (7Zhang Y. Cooke A. Park S. Dewey C.N. Wickens M. Sheets M.D. Bicaudal-C spatially controls translation of vertebrate maternal mRNAs.RNA. 2013; 11: 1575-1582Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Specifically, injection of animal cells with a luciferase reporter mRNA containing the xCR1 3′-UTR with an mRNA that expresses full length Bic-C protein leads to specific repression of the reporter mRNA in Xenopus embryos (Fig. 5A) (7Zhang Y. Cooke A. Park S. Dewey C.N. Wickens M. Sheets M.D. Bicaudal-C spatially controls translation of vertebrate maternal mRNAs.RNA. 2013; 11: 1575-1582Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This assay was used to determine the region of the xCR1 3′-UTR sufficient for Bic-C-mediated repression by examining reporter mRNAs bearing sub-segments of the TCE (Fig. 5B). Whereas removal of 100 or 174 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the TCE had small affects on Bic-C repression (Fig. 5, B and C, reporters 286–554 and 286–464), the removal of an additional 106 nucleotides that included the 32-nucleotide Bic-C binding site eliminated repression (Fig. 5, B and C, reporter 286–358). Thus, sequences critical for Bic-C mediated repression reside in the region of the xCR1 3′-UTR between nucleotides 358 and 464 and included the Bic-C binding site. To determine whether the minimal Bic-C binding site identified biochemically was sufficient for translational repression, luciferase reporter mRNAs containing one or three copies of the binding site were analyzed in the animal cell assay. A single binding site was sufficient to elicit a low level of repression (Fig. 5D, xCR1 3′-UTR nts 358–389 × 1). However, three copies of the minimal Bic-C binding site elicited repression almost as efficiently as the TCE of xCR1 mRNA 3′-UTR (Fig. 5D, xCR1 3′-UTR nts 358–389 × 3). Thus, the Bic-C binding site defined biochemically provides sufficient information to direct robust translational repression. Competition experiments were used as a second approach to analyze the relationship between the Bic-C binding site and translational repression. We reasoned that if Bic-C was essential for translational repression of xCR1 mRNA, then the presence of excess Bic-C binding sites would disrupt binding to the TCE of the xCR1 3′-UTR and disrupt repression of TCE-containing reporter mRNAs. Reporter assays were performed as described above with the inclusion of a 1000-fold excess of different potential RNA competitors (Fig. 5E). Translational repression of the TCE-containing luciferase reporter mRNA (nts 286–637 of the xCR1 3′-UTR) was attenuated by the presence of RNAs containing Bic-C binding sites (Fig. 5E, either the TCE (nts 286–637) or the 358–389 × 3 RNA). In contrast, repression was unaffected by the presence of an RNA that lacked Bic-C binding sites; (Fig. 5E, xCR1 3′-UTR nucleotides 1–308). To investigate the structural requirements of the Bic-C binding site for translational repression, different luciferase reporter mRNAs containing three copies of different variants of the Bic-C binding site were analyzed in the animal cell assay (Fig. 5A). Reporter mRNA where the Bic-C binding site contained five nucleotide changes on one strand of the predicted stem impaired Bic-C repression (Fig. 6A, Stem5 reporter mRNA). However, efficient repression of thereporter mRNA could be restored by using a variant that contained the five additional nucleotide changes predicted to restore complementary base pairing between strands of the putative stem (Fig. 6A, Stem10 reporter mRNA). In addition, the reporter mRNA in which the nucleotides of the putative loop in the Bic-C binding site were changed was inefficiently repressed by Bic-C (Fig. 6A, loop reporter mRNA). The normal mechanism of xCR1 translational repression is vegetal cell-specific, consistent with the localization of Bic-C protein to these cells. Thus, another prediction was that reporter mRNAs containing the minimal Bic-C binding site would be translationally repressed in vegetal cells. We tested this prediction by injecting reporter mRNAs into vegetal cells and comparing their translation to reporter mRNAs injected into animal cells, cells in which the xCR1 mRNA is normally translated (Fig. 6B). The reporter mRNA containing three copies of the Bic-C binding sites was repressed in vegetal cells and repression was comparable with a reporter containing the TCE of the xCR1 3′-UTR (Fig. 6C). Reporter mRNAs were inefficiently repressed by vegetal cells when they contained either the Bic-C binding sites with nucleotide changes to one strand of the potential stem (Fig. 6C, stem 5) or nucleotide changes to the potential loop (Fig. 6C, loop). In contrast, the reporter containing Bic-C binding sites with nucleotide changes predicted to restore base pairing and restore formation of the potential stem was repressed as efficiently as the reporter containing the wild type binding site (Fig. 6C, stem 10). Thus, repression in vegetal cells exhibited the same requirements for the Bic-C binding site as observed in biochemical experiments of Bic-C binding (Fig. 4) and repression in animal cells expressing Bic-C (Fig. 6A). Bic-C proteins are expressed in embryos and specific adult tissues of invertebrate and vertebrate organisms where they regulate diverse biological processes (1Gamberi C. Lasko P. The bic-C family of developmental translational regulators.Comp. Funct. Genomics. 2012; 10.1155/2012/141386Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All evidence to date indicates that Bic-C in all metazoans functions primarily by repressing the translation of a select subset of mRNAs; yet, there is a paucity of information about the molecular determinants that specify RNAs for Bic-C binding. In Xenopus, Bic-C is suggested to be important for establishing the fundamental differences between animal and vegetal cells of the embryo (22Wessely O. De Robertis E.M. The Xenopus homologue of Bicaudal-C is a localized maternal mRNA that can induce endoderm formation.Development. 2000; 127: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, during early embryonic cell divisions, Bic-C protein accumulates only within the vegetal cells of the embryo because the mRNA encoding Bic-C is specifically localized to the vegetal cortex of developing oocytes. We recently identified the xCR1 mRNA as a bona fide target of Bic-C-mediated translation repression in vegetal cells (7Zhang Y. Cooke A. Park S. Dewey C.N. Wickens M. Sheets M.D. Bicaudal-C spatially controls translation of vertebrate maternal mRNAs.RNA. 2013; 11: 1575-1582Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Bic-C repression of this mRNA in vegetal cells allows for the accumulation of xCR1 protein specifically within the animal cells of the embryo, where it can regulate multiple developmentally important signaling pathways (8Zhang Y. Forinash K.D. McGivern J. Fritz B. Dorey K. Sheets M.D. Spatially restricted translation of the xCR1 mRNA in Xenopus embryos.Mol. Cell.

A novel Cripto-related protein reveals an essential role for EGF-CFCs in Nodal signalling in Xenopus embryos.Dev. Biol. 2006; 292: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we substantially extended these findings by using several independent and complementary biochemical approaches to define a minimal Bic-C target site within the xCR1 mRNA 3′-UTR. Our data provide evidence that the Bic-C target site consists of both structural and sequence elements, suggesting a level of complexity that must be considered for developing computational tools to predict additional Bic-C target RNAs. Although recent studies have identified mRNAs potentially regulated by Bic-C (2Chicoine J. Benoit P. Gamberi C. Paliouras M. Simonelig M. Lasko P.

The evolutionarily conserved KH domains are found in a variety of different proteins that regulate splicing, translation, and other events of RNA metabolism (10Valverde R. Edwards L. Regan L.

A compendium of RNA-binding motifs for decoding gene regulation.Nature. 2013; 499: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins employ multiple KH domains to direct specific RNA binding and provide substrate specificity. Often in such proteins the multiple KH domains function together to recognize either short sequence elements or structural features of their RNA substrates. For example, the KH domains of the Nova-1 protein prefer to bind RNA substrates that contain short sequence motifs within stem-loop structures. The sequence of the stem is less important than its structure, but the sequence of the loop is critical (25Lewis H.A. Musunuru K. Jensen K.B. Edo C. Chen H. Darnell R.B. Burley S.K.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5740-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, the KH domains of the FMRP (Fragile-X mental retardation protein), mediate the recognition of RNAs that contain a specific tertiary structure (27Darnell J.C. Warren S.T. Darnell R.B.

Fragile X mental retardation protein targets G quartet mRNAs important for neuronal function.Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the KH domains of Bic-C mediate its binding to the 3′-UTR of the xCR1 mRNA and that secondary structure is an important feature of this binding. Additional experiments are required to define the exact RNA structure optimal for Bic-C binding and to determine what other sequence features are important for binding as well. The Bic-C binding site from the xCR1 3′-UTR was sufficient for translational repression. Although a single Bic-C binding site was able to direct a low, but detectable amount of repression, three sites used in combination repressed translation nearly as efficiently as the intact TCE region of the xCR1 3′-UTR. These results suggest that Bic-C binding to a single target site within the xCR1 3′-UTR may be facilitated by additional factors that interact with both the RNA substrate and Bic-C. For example, we previously demonstrated that the TCE region of the xCR1 3′-UTR contains binding sites for the pumilio and CELF1 (also called CUGBP1) proteins (8Zhang Y. Forinash K.D. McGivern J. Fritz B. Dorey K. Sheets M.D. Spatially restricted translation of the xCR1 mRNA in Xenopus embryos.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3791-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the context of the intact xCR1 3′-UTR with a single efficient Bic-C binding site these proteins may function together to facilitate efficient Bic-C binding. Indeed, stabilizing Bic-C binding to the xCR1 3′-UTR could be their primary function in xCR1 mRNA translational regulation. The role of these factors may be circumvented by the presence of multiple binding sites that increase the probability that Bic-C will bind the 3′-UTR. Although our results provide evidence that a Bic-C-RNA element interaction is sufficient for efficient translational repression in Xenopus embryos, recent studies in kidney cells suggest that Bic-C represses target mRNAs in collaboration with specific miRNAs (4Tran U.

https://openalex.org/W2034379370,"Predators can reduce bee pollination and plant fitness through successful predation and non-consumptive effects. In honey bees, evidence of predation or a direct attack can decrease recruitment dancing and thereby magnify the effects of individual predation attempts at a colony level. However, actual predation attempts and successes are relatively rare. It was not known if a far more common event, just detection of a predator, could inhibit recruitment. We began by testing honey bees' avoidance of the praying mantis (Tenodera sinensis). Larger predators (later mantis instars, ≥4.5 cm in body length) elicited significantly more avoidance (1.3 fold) than smaller mantis instars. Larger instars also attempted to capture honey bees significantly more often than did smaller instars. Foragers could detect and avoid mantises based upon mantis odor (74% of bees avoided an odor extract) or visual appearance (67% avoided a mantis model). Finally, foragers decreased recruitment dancing by 1.8 fold for a food source with a live adult mantis, even when they were not attacked. This reduction in recruitment dancing, elicited by predator presence alone, expands our understanding of predator non-consumptive effects and of cascading ecosystem effects for plants served by an important generalist pollinator."
https://openalex.org/W2052360725,"Mechanical ventilation (MV) induces diaphragmatic muscle fiber atrophy and contractile dysfunction (ventilator induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, VIDD). It is unknown how rapidly diaphragm muscle recovers from VIDD once spontaneous breathing is restored. We hypothesized that following extubation, the return to voluntary breathing would restore diaphragm muscle fiber size and contractile function using an established rodent model.Following 12 hours of MV, animals were either euthanized or, after full wake up, extubated and returned to voluntary breathing for 12 hours or 24 hours. Acutely euthanized animals served as controls (each n = 8/group). Diaphragmatic contractility, fiber size, protease activation, and biomarkers of oxidative damage in the diaphragm were assessed.12 hours of MV induced VIDD. Compared to controls diaphragm contractility remained significantly depressed at 12 h after extubation but rebounded at 24 h to near control levels. Diaphragmatic levels of oxidized proteins were significantly elevated after MV (p = 0.002) and normalized at 24 hours after extubation.These findings indicate that diaphragm recovery from VIDD, as indexed by fiber size and contractile properties, returns to near control levels within 24 hours after returning to spontaneous breathing. Besides the down-regulation of proteolytic pathways and oxidative stress at 24 hours after extubation further repairing mechanisms have to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1992481032,"In mammals, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can mediate sequence-specific RNA interference, activate sequence-independent interferon response, or undergo RNA editing by adenosine deaminases. We showed that long hairpin dsRNA expression had negligible effects on mammalian somatic cells—expressed dsRNA was slightly edited, poorly processed into siRNAs, and it did not activate the interferon response. At the same time, we noticed reduced reporter expression in transient co-transfections, which was presumably induced by expressed dsRNA. Since transient co-transfections are frequently used for studying gene function, we systematically explored the role of expressed dsRNA in this silencing phenomenon. We demonstrate that dsRNA expressed from transiently transfected plasmids strongly inhibits the expression of co-transfected reporter plasmids but not the expression of endogenous genes or reporters stably integrated in the genome. The inhibition is concentration-dependent, it is found in different cell types, and it is independent of transfection method and dsRNA sequence. The inhibition occurs at the level of translation and involves protein kinase R, which binds the expressed dsRNA. Thus, dsRNA expression represents a hidden danger in transient transfection experiments and must be taken into account during interpretation of experimental results."
https://openalex.org/W2069601112,"We report here the utility of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II dextramers for in situ detection of self-reactive CD4 T cells in two target organs, the brain and heart. We optimized the conditions for in situ detection of antigen-specific CD4 T cells using brain sections obtained from SJL mice immunized with myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) 139-151; the sections were costained with IA(s)/PLP 139-151 (specific) or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) 70-86 (control) dextramers and anti-CD4. Analysis of sections by laser scanning confocal microscope revealed detection of cells positive for PLP 139-151 but not for TMEV 70-86 dextramers to be colocalized with CD4-expressing T cells, indicating that the staining was specific to PLP 139-151 dextramers. Further, we devised a method to reliably enumerate the frequencies of antigen-specific T cells by counting the number of dextramer⁺ CD4⁺ T cells in the 'Z' serial images acquired sequentially. We next extended these observations to detect cardiac myosin-specific T cells in autoimmune myocarditis induced in A/J mice by immunizing with cardiac myosin heavy chain-α (Myhc) 334-352. Heart sections prepared from immunized mice were costained with Myhc 334-352 (specific) or bovine ribonuclease 43-56 (control) dextramers together with anti-CD4; the sections showed the infiltrations of Myhc-specific CD4 T cells. The data suggest that MHC class II dextramers are useful tools for enumerating the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4 T cells in situ by direct staining without having to amplify the fluorescent signals, an approach commonly employed with conventional MHC tetramers."
https://openalex.org/W2117884405,"Objective To examine factors associated with chronic energy deficiency (CED) and anaemia in disadvantaged Indian adults who are mostly involved in subsistence farming. Design A cross-sectional study in which we collected information on socio-demographic factors, physical activity, anthropometry, blood haemoglobin concentration, and daily household food intake. These data were used to calculate body mass index (BMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), daily energy expenditure, and energy and nutrient intake. Multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression was used to assess socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with CED (defined as BMI<18 kg/m2) and anaemia. Setting The study was conducted in 12 villages, in the Rishi Valley, Andhra Pradesh, India. Subjects Individuals aged 18 years and above, residing in the 12 villages, were eligible to participate. Results Data were available for 1178 individuals (45% male, median age 36 years (inter quartile range (IQR 27–50)). The prevalence of CED (38%) and anaemia (25%) was high. Farming was associated with CED in women (2.20, 95% CI: 1.39–3.49) and men (1.71, 95% CI: (1.06–2.74). Low income was also significantly associated with CED, while not completing high school was positively associated with anaemia. Median iron intake was high: 35.7 mg/day (IQR 26–46) in women and 43.4 mg/day (IQR 34–55) in men. Conclusions Farming is an important risk factor associated with CED in this rural Indian population and low dietary iron is not the main cause of anaemia. Better farming practice may help to reduce CED in this population."

https://openalex.org/W1964725925,"Illusory line motion (ILM) refers to a motion illusion in which a flash at one end of a bar prior to the bar's instantaneous presentation or removal results in the percept of motion. While some theories attribute the origin of ILM to attention or early perceptual mechanisms, others have proposed that ILM results from impletion mechanisms that reinterpret the static bar as one in motion. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined participants while they made decisions about the direction of motion in which a bar appeared to be removed. Preceding the instantaneous removal of the bar with a flash at one end resulted in a motion percept away from the flash. If this flash and the bar's removal overlapped in time, it appeared that the bar was removed towards the flash (reverse ILM). Independent of the motion type, brain responses indicated activations in areas associated with motion (MT+), endogenous and exogenous attention (intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye fields, and ventral frontal cortex), and response selection (ACC). ILM was associated with lower percept scores and higher activations in ACC relative to real motion, but no differences in shape-selective areas emerged. This pattern of brain activation is consistent with the attentional gradient model or bottom-up accounts of ILM in preference to impletion."
https://openalex.org/W2047688079,"Human ether-a-go-go related-gene K⁺ channels (hERG) participate in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. HERG channel activity is up-regulated by growth factors. Kinases sensitive to growth factor signaling include the serine/threonine protein kinase B-RAF. The present study thus explored whether B-RAF influences hERG channel expression and activity. To this end, hERG channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes with or without wild-type B-RAF, hERG channel activity was determined utilizing dual-electrode voltage clamp and hERG protein abundance in the cell membrane was analyzed utilizing confocal microscopy as well as chemiluminescence. Moreover, in rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells the effect of B-RAF inhibitor PLX-4720 on hERG-mediated current was quantified by whole-cell patch clamp and hERG cell surface protein abundance by utilizing biotinylation of cell surface proteins as well as flow cytometry. As a result, co-expression of wild-type B-RAF in hERG-expressing Xenopus oocytes significantly increased hERG channel activity and hERG channel protein abundance in the cell membrane. Treatment for 24 hours of B-RAF and hERG-expressing Xenopus oocytes with B-RAF inhibitor PLX-4720 (10 µM) significantly decreased hERG-mediated current and hERG cell surface expression. Similarly, in rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells, treatment for 24 hours with B-RAF inhibitor PLX-4720 significantly decreased hERG cell membrane protein abundance and hERG-mediated current. In conclusion, B-RAF is a powerful regulator of hERG channel activity and cell surface hERG protein abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2026561311,"Background The approach of RNAi mediated gene knockdown, employing exogenous dsRNA, is being beneficially exploited in various fields of functional genomics. The immense utility of the approach came to fore from studies with model system C. elegans, but quickly became applicable with varied research models ranging from in vitro to various in vivo systems. Previously, there have been reports on the refractoriness of the neuronal cells to RNAi mediated gene silencing following which several modulators like eri-1 and lin-15 were described in C. elegans which, when present, would negatively impact the gene knockdown. Methodology/Principal Findings Taking a clue from these findings, we went on to screen hypothesis-driven- methodologies towards exploring the efficiency in the process of RNAi under various experimental conditions, wherein these genes would be knocked down preceding to, or concurrently with, the knocking down of a gene of interest. For determining the efficiency of gene knockdown, we chose to study visually stark phenotypes of uncoordinated movement, dumpy body morphology and blistered cuticle obtained by knocking down of genes unc-73, dpy-9 and bli-3 respectively, employing the RNAi-by-feeding protocol in model system C. elegans. Conclusions/Significance Our studies led to a very interesting outcome as the results reveal that amongst various methods tested, pre-incubation with eri-1 dsRNA synthesizing bacteria followed by co-incubation with eri-1 and gene-of-interest dsRNA synthesizing bacteria leads to the most efficient gene silencing as observed by the analysis of marker phenotypes. This provides an approach for effectively employing RNAi induced gene silencing while working with different genetic backgrounds including transgenic and mutant strains."
https://openalex.org/W2059995086,"Cell cycle transitions are governed by the timely expression of cyclins, the activating subunits of Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which are responsible for the inactivation of the pocket proteins. Overexpression of cyclins promotes cell proliferation and cancer. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which cyclins regulate the expression of cell cycle promoting genes including subsequent cyclins. LIN-9 and the pocket proteins p107 and p130 are members of the DREAM complex that in G0 represses cell cycle genes. Interestingly, little is know about the regulation and function of LIN-9 after phosphorylation of p107,p130 by Cyclin D/Cdk4 disassembles the DREAM complex in early G1. In this report, we demonstrate that cyclin E1/Cdk3 phosphorylates LIN-9 on Thr-96. Mutating Thr-96 to alanine inhibits activation of cyclins A2 and B1 promoters, whereas a phosphomimetic Asp mutant strongly activates their promoters and triggers accelerated entry into G2/M phase in 293T cells. Taken together, our data suggest a novel role for cyclin E1 beyond G1/S and into S/G2 phase, most likely by inducing the expression of subsequent cyclins A2 and B1 through LIN-9."
https://openalex.org/W2051489306,"In bacteria, threonine dehydratases could convert L-threonine to 2-ketobutyrate. Some threonine dehydratases contain only a catalytic domain, while others contain an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain composed of one or two ACT-like subdomains. However, the role of the ACT-like subdomain in threonine dehydratases is not clear. Here, nine different bacterial threonine dehydratases were studied. Three of the nine contain no ACT-like subdomain, four of them contain a single ACT-like subdomain, and two of them contain two ACT-like subdomains. The nine genes encoding these threonine dehydratases were individually overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and the enzymes were purified to homogeneity. Activities of the purified enzymes were analyzed after incubation at different temperatures and different pHs. The results showed that threonine dehydratases with a single ACT-like subdomain are more stable at higher temperatures and a broad range of pH than those without ACT-like subdomain or with two ACT-like subdomains. Furthermore, the specific activity of threonine dehydratases increases with the increase of the number of ACT-like subdomains they contain. The results suggest that the ACT-like subdomain plays an important role in bacterial threonine dehydratases."
https://openalex.org/W2055467066,"p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein and its inhibition is believed to be a prerequisite for cancer development. In approximately 50% of all malignancies this is achieved by inactivating mutations in the p53 gene. However, in several cancer entities, including melanoma, p53 mutations are rare. It has been recently proposed that tyrosinase related protein 2 (TRP2), a protein involved in melanin synthesis, may act as suppressor of the p53 pathway in melanoma. To scrutinize this notion we analyzed p53 and TRP2 expression by immunohistochemistry in 172 melanoma tissues and did not find any correlation. Furthermore, we applied three different TRP2 shRNAs to five melanoma cell lines and could not observe a target specific effect of the TRP2 knockdown on either p53 expression nor p53 reporter gene activity. Likewise, ectopic expression of TRP2 in a TRP2 negative melanoma cell line had no impact on p53 expression. In conclusion our data suggest that p53 repression critically controlled by TRP2 is not a general event in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2003282671,"In a field as fast-growing and high-profile as stem cell research, friends are vital. To this end, for more than a decade researchers around the world have steadily been building national networks to create stronger professional bonds. Their hope is that the strength of these scientific connections might foster excellence in the field, help younger researchers move forward in their careers, and improve the public image of stem cell science. In 2005 these disparate national networks were collected under a global umbrella group known as the International Consortium of Stem Cell Networks. Today, it has 17 members, stretching from as far south as New South Wales to as far north as Norway. “Stem cell networks are thriving,” says Michael Rudnicki, who chairs the consortium and is also the scientific director of Canada’s Stem Cell Network. His own network, based in Ottawa, is the oldest, founded in 2001. It was given 14 years of government funding, which now stands at more than 6,000,000 Canadian dollars a year. This allows the network to fund research as well as promote outreach and work on policy. Unfortunately, at the end of its funding cycle in 2015, the Canadian Stem Cell Network will no longer exist, at least in its present form. Networking activities may continue, however, if alternative sources of income can be secured. Rudnicki says that the network’s aim was to have one clinical trial by the end of the funding cycle. Already, the number of trials has entered double digits. Their secret, he explains, is to “give out grants, but be strategic about it. We, in a very nimble way, can change the way we do business.” Unlike other funders, the network can be far quicker to pick out promising research areas among its membership. Their success stories include a cancer stem cell project, which screened drugs that targeted tumor cells and has since spun off numerous clinical trials. The Canadian Stem Cell Network has also helped to bring together researchers from different disciplines. One incentive for them to become involved, says Rudnicki, is the prospect of seeing their work translated in unanticipated ways. Angela McDonald, a Ph.D. student at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, joined the network in 2009. “I can't imagine what my graduate school experience would have looked like without it,” she says. “It has been involved in every aspect of my training, from funding one of my Ph.D. projects to allowing me to present my research at Stem Cell Network annual meetings.” The network has also helped her to become involved in extracurricular activities, including public education programs and writing for the network’s blog. And it has taken her as far and wide as a workshop in the Canadian Rocky Mountains to a summer school on a Greek island. “Networks can be very useful,” agrees Clare Blackburn, Professor of Tissue Stem Cell Biology at the Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and Coordinator of EuroStemCell, which is not a network as such but a partnership founded in 2008 that links around 90 European laboratories with ethicists, social scientists, and science communicators, with the aim of relaying their research to the public. She suggests that networks “should be driven by scientists, rather than by administrators,” adding that Canada’s Stem Cell Network is “a really fantastic model,” demonstrating just how much a well-funded and well-supported network can achieve. It may seem a shame, then, that the Canadian Stem Cell Network will be gone in a couple of years. But Rudnicki is nevertheless proud of what the network has achieved. “The sunsetting of the Stem Cell Network in 2015 will without question leave a gap, but our legacy will live on,” he says. As stem cell research advances, new national networks are emerging. “I always felt it was important we had something like this in Germany,” says Daniel Besser, coordinator of the German Stem Cell Network, which was founded in May, 2013 (Figure 1). Among its primary goals, he says, are to develop new technologies and do more to translate basic science into applied research. Their first event, an annual conference, was held in Berlin in November, attracting 400 participants. The network’s membership has already blossomed to 270, including 100 junior scientists. “The German Stem Cell Network puts particular focus on the promotion of junior scientists and working groups covering strategic topics such as career development, future funding policies, and patient information on available therapies,” says Oliver Brüstle, Professor of Reconstructive Neurobiology at the University of Bonn, and acting president of the network. It has received a year’s funding from the government, after which—if it is successful— it needs to create a cofinancing structure to ensure its survival. The hope is to reap a third of its income from membership fees. A particular challenge for the network is the public reputation of stem cell research in Germany. Controversy was stoked in 2010 following the death of a baby who was treated using dubious and unproven stem cell therapies at a clinic in Düsseldorf (in 2011, the clinic was closed down). In this atmosphere of public concern, Daniel Besser says that the network would like to better advise patients about these kinds of therapies. “We also need more public education. We want to inform everyone from schools to politicians,” he adds. Another fairly recent addition to the list of national networks is Stem Cells Australia, which launched in November, 2011. It has 7 years of funding from the Australian Research Council, amounting to 3,000,000 Australian dollars a year. “In Australia in particular a network is really critical to our competitiveness in this very active and fast moving field,” says Martin Pera, Professor of Stem Cell Stem Sciences at the University of Melbourne, and Stem Cells Australia Program Leader. “Our scientific community is of very high quality, but it is relatively small, and our resources are quite limited. Thus there is actually no alternative to working effectively together if we wish to remain on the cutting edge of this field… Perhaps our biggest continuing limitation is the relatively small pool of funding for stem cell research and regenerative medicine here in Australia.” Stem Cells Australia’s membership includes 37 scientists, ranging from senior level researchers to early career stage investigators. “Many have backgrounds in stem cell biology and development, but we also have experts in bioinformatics, nanotechnology and materials science, chemical biology, and bioengineering,” says Pera. “There are always challenges in establishing genuine collaborative links between diverse scientific groups in different institutions spread across a large country, but I think we are meeting these.” Again, like in Germany, public engagement is important to Australian researchers. “Our biggest challenge in public policy now is the proliferation of clinics offering unproven stem cell treatments outside of the context of a clinical trial. This is particularly an issue with autologous cell therapy, which unfortunately falls outside of our national cell therapy regulatory framework, which is otherwise excellent,” explains Pera. “We have a program devoted to outreach, ethics, education, and law, and much of our focus there, beyond scientific education, is on promotion of a realistic awareness of the current state of stem cell medicine amongst patients, their families and friends, and health care professionals.” Although Germany and Australia continue to struggle to engage the public positively with the idea of stem cell research, Canadian scientists have enjoyed strong approval ratings, says Michael Rudnicki. Part of this is due to a general cultural acceptance, he explains, but he also credits the Stem Cell Network for part of it. “We’re seen as an honest broker,” when it comes to bringing people together around policy issues, he says. The network also funds art and museum exhibits, some of which are on international tour. Some networks may be blooming, but others have already started to wither. At the end of 2011, the sponsors of the UK National Stem Cell Network called time on the organization by ending its funding. Peter Andrews, Professor of Biomedical Science at the University of Sheffield, blames this partly on the fact that its organization was too “top-down.” The other problem, he adds, is that there were “too many diverse, competing interests. It tried to do too many things for too many people.” While Andrews accepts that national stem cell networks can “serve a function,” he adds, “Only so long as they’re set up in ways that allow people to talk to each other.” Daniel Besser from the German Stem Cell Network agrees that good networks shouldn’t just rely on senior scientists, but that they need input from both gurus in the field and those lower down the chain. This has been a particular issue for Japanese stem cell researchers, explains Hironobu Fujiwara, a researcher at the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, who founded its Stem Cell Club in 2013. According to Fujiwara, strong hierarchical structures in some Japanese research institutions can dampen young researchers’ enthusiasm to develop networks. However, he adds, the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology is committed to providing a collegial work environment and flat organization for research staff. “We feel it is important to maximize interactions between people in different labs as the institute is quite large and spread out over several buildings. So, we aim to provide a platform for meeting and interacting with scientists from various fields relating to stem cells” he says. The RIKEN Center’s Stem Cell Club has no funding as yet, and is less of a formal network than a regular meet-up for like-minded scientists. Yet it has managed to attract 30 scientists among the institute’s staff. They get together once a month and host seminars with invited speakers. “This is a very local activity, bottom-up style,” says Fujiwara. Without a sizeable income, maintaining a network can be tough. When asked what the cornerstone to a network’s success is, Michael Rudnicki is unequivocal: “It helps to be able to fund research.” Networks that are able to only hold events and workshops can only go so far in attracting members and encouraging them to get involved. “Our model gives us the ability to walk the walk,” he says, referring to the Canadian Stem Cell Network. His ambitious vision for the future of the International Consortium of Stem Cell Networks is that it will be able to fund joint research projects around the world, in the same way that the Canadian network funds domestic research. The problem, he laments, is that there has been a falling off of “international funding for research across the board around the world.” The New York Stem Cell Foundation, an independent research institute that has 45 people working in its own laboratory and also supports external scientists, is an example of one kind of network that has focused its resources almost exclusively on funding research. Susan Solomon, the foundation’s Chief Executive Officer, explains that this activity is especially important in stem cell research because it’s an area that has been “neglected and underfunded by the traditional funding mechanisms,” such as large government grants. It means they are able to continue research even if national policies on stem cell research change. Collaboration is the keystone to making this New York model successful. “We work closely with a number of different stem cell and research networks,” including “the International Society for Stem Cell Research, the Canadian Stem Cell Network, the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, the Center for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine, and the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine,” says Solomon. Her advice for others hoping to start a similar network is, “to build a robust advisory board consisting of the leading experts in your field and to discuss with them what is needed to be successful in your chosen goals and where opportunities and possible advancements lie.” Of course, networks and clubs can still thrive without money. Despite the importance of funding to the survival of so many national stem cell networks, the RIKEN Center’s Stem Cell Club in Japan proves that, where there is a strong desire for researchers to meet, anything is possible. Hironobu Fujiwara says that the secret is to, “find cooperators who are motivated, prepared to make great sacrifices, and can share values.”"
https://openalex.org/W2061810692,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) regulates normal blood pressure and fluid homeostasis through its action in the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS). Ace-/- mice are smaller in size, have low blood pressure and defective kidney structure and functions. All of these defects are cured by transgenic expression of somatic ACE (sACE) in vascular endothelial cells of Ace-/- mice. sACE is expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells and undergoes a natural cleavage secretion process to generate a soluble form in the body fluids. Both the tissue-bound and the soluble forms of ACE are enzymatically active, and generate the vasoactive octapeptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) with equal efficiency. To assess the relative physiological roles of the secreted and the cell-bound forms of ACE, we expressed, in the vascular endothelial cells of Ace-/- mice, the ectodomain of sACE, which corresponded to only the secreted form of ACE. Our results demonstrated that the secreted form of ACE could normalize kidney functions and RAS integrity, growth and development of Ace-/- mice, but not their blood pressure. This study clearly demonstrates that the secreted form of ACE cannot replace the tissue-bound ACE for maintaining normal blood pressure; a suitable balance between the tissue-bound and the soluble forms of ACE is essential for maintaining all physiological functions of ACE."
