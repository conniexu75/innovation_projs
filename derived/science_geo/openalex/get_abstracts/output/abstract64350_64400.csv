https://openalex.org/W2134241075,"Plastic particles, in concentrations averaging 3500 pieces and 290 grams per square kilometer, are widespread in the western Sargasso Sea. Pieces are brittle, apparently due to the weathering of the plasticizers, and many are in a pellet shape about 0.25 to 0.5 centimeters in diameter. The particles are surfaces for the attachment of diatoms and hydroids. Increasing production of plastics, combined with present waste-disposal practices, will undoubtedly lead to increases in the concentration of these particles. Plastics could be a source of some of the polychlorinated biphenyls recently observed in oceanic organisms."

Tuna has a relatively high content of selenium and tends to accumulate additional selenium when mercury is present. A content of selenium in the diet comparable to that supplied by tuna decreased methylmercury toxicity in rats. Selenium in tuna, far from being a hazard in itself, may lessen the danger to man of mercury in tuna."

The pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis and the granule neurons of the gyrus dentatus contained more radioactivity than did other regions of the brain; however, the intensity of labeling varied among adjacent neurons. The nuclei of many neurons were clearly labeled but radioactivity was relatively sparse in the cytoplasm, in the axons where they branch from cell bodies, and in adjacent neuropil."
https://openalex.org/W2037235771,"Lesions in the medial preoptic area of ovariectomized female rats reduced the quantity of estrogen needed to induce sexual receptivity in these animals. In addition, the number of days over which receptive behavior could be elicited after a single initial estrogen injection and with subsequent daily progesterone treatment was significantly increased by lesions in the medial preoptic area. These findings support the view that estrogen acts to reduce an inhibitory action that is tonically exerted by the medial preoptic area on pathways mediating estrous behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2022668782,"The behavioral effects of early malnutrition and early environmental isolation were observed in male rats. Dietary and environmental manipulations occurred during the first 7 weeks of life, after which followed a 10-week recovery period. On the basis of several different responses, it was found that the behavioral effects of early malnutrition were exaggerated by the environmental isolation. In most cases, the behavioral effects of early malnutrition were completely eliminated by supplying ""additional stimulation"" early in life. Two theoretical mechanisms are proposed to explain these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2082684474,"The Wiener theory of nonlinear system identification was applied to a three-stage neuron chain in the catfish retina in order to determine the functional relationship between the artificial polarization of the horizontal cell membrane potential and the resulting discharge of the ganglion cell. A mathematical model was obtained that can predict quantitatively, with reasonable accuracy, the nonlinear, dynamic behavior of the neuron chain. The applicability of the method is discussed. We conclude that this is a very powerful method in the analysis of information transfer in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1565322106,"Lipoxygenase catalyzes its own destruction during oxygenation of fatty acid substrates. The destruction is first order with respect to enzyme. The rate constant for this inactivation (κ2) has a characteristic value for each fatty acid substrate. The values are greater for acids having correspondingly higher degrees of unsaturation. In the presence of product, the enzyme loses activity 10 times faster with both substrates, fatty acid and oxygen, present than with either alone. We have confirmed that oxygenation of fatty acids by lipoxygenase occurs with a kinetic lag period which can be abolished by adding product hydroperoxides. Product hydroperoxides play an essential role in the over-all autocatalytic reaction. We have further shown that the lag period may be extended as a result of inhibition of the enzyme by polyenoic acid substrates. The previously reported inhibition of lipoxygenase by GSH peroxidase in the presence of glutathione appears to be due to the removal of the hydroperoxide product. These findings as well as those of others may be accommodated by a kinetic model in which distinct roles exist for both the product and the fatty acid substrate in a manner allowing product binding only at the product site whereas fatty acid substrates may bind at either site."

The effect seemed to be proportional to the administered dose of nerve growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2027102816,"Erythropoiesis in the fetal mouse provides a model to study several important aspects of the regulation of cell differentiation and differentiated protein synthesis. Changes in the patterns of hemoglobins formed during fetal and postfetal development are shown to be associated with the substitution of the liver erythroid cell line. In the course of differentiation of yolk sac erythroid cells there are at least two classes of proteins distinguishable with respect to dependence on continued RNA formatoin. The bulk of nuclear proteins, ""nondifferentiated"" proteins, appear to be dependent on relatively short-lived messenger RNA while synthesis of differentiated proteins, the hemoglobins, proceeds on relatively stable molecules of messenger RNA. Hemoglobin formation occurs in those cells which are actively synthesizing DNA and dividing. On the average, two to three cell divisions may occur after the formation and stabilization of the messenger RNA for globin. Yolk sac erythropoiesis, at least from day 10 of gestation, is unresponsive to erythropoietin. By comparison, in fetal liver erythropoiesis, the hormone, erythropoietin, acts selectively on the most immature erythroid cell precursor to induce differentiation, cell replication, and hemoglobin formation. The erythropoietin responsive cell in the liver is apparently differentiated from the progenitor, pluripotential stem cell and committed to erythroblast formation and hemoglobin synthesis on exposure to the hormone. The initial effects of erythropoietin on macromolecular synthesis are to stimulate RNA synthesis, which temporally is followed by cell replication and the increase in hemoglobin formation. During liver erythropoiesis, there appears to be a transition from hemoglobin synthesis dependent on RNA formation to hemoglobin synthesis directed by relatively stable messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1545549317,"Abstract The self-diffusion coefficients of myoglobin and hemoglobin have been determined with a modification of the Northrup-Anson procedure in which diffusion is made to occur through a Millipore filter paper. In solutions less concentrated than 6 mm (heme) or about 10% (w/v), the self-diffusion coefficient is found independent of protein concentration. At greater protein concentration the logarithm of the self-diffusion coefficient falls linearly with increasing protein concentration. The decrease in self-diffusion coefficient is most simply related to the volume fraction of the solution occupied by protein. The relation between self-diffusion coefficient and hemoglobin concentration remains continuous and linear to the highest attainable concentration, which is the concentration within the erythrocyte. At this concentration the hemoglobin molecules are close-packed and nearly contiguous. The self-diffusion coefficient of hemoglobin in this environment is only 10-fold less than that at infinite dilution. This and other findings indicate that frictional interactions between myoglobin or hemoglobin molecules are minimal. The numerical values of the self-diffusion coefficient serve to test the molecular mechanism proposed for myoglobin (or hemoglobin)-facilitated oxygen diffusion. The facilitated oxygen flux per unit protein concentration is found to be directly proportional to the protein self-diffusion coefficient, as predicted."

Although only subjects with pronounced ocular astigmatism exhibit this effect, the differences are of neural, rather than optical, origin. It is argued that the resolution anisotropies result from early abnormal visual input caused by astigmatism. This abnormal input permanently modifies the brain."

These color-contingent motion aftereffects complement reports of motion-contingent color aftereffects and suggest that both may reflect adaptation of detectors specific to color and motion."
https://openalex.org/W1603836262,"The isolated perfused rat liver preparation was employed to study the effects of glucagon, fasting, and diabetes on the flow of exogenous lactate or endogenous substrates into the pathways of gluconeogenesis, glycogenesis, ketogenesis, lipogenesis, and the Krebs cycle in the liver. Measurements were made of the utilization of substrates and oxygen, the formation of glucose, glycogen, ketone bodies, and urea, and the incorporation of isotope from [14C]lactate into glucose, glycogen, protein, CO2, ketone bodies, cholesterol, and other lipids. Glucose synthesis from lactate was enhanced in livers treated with glucagon or from fasted or diabetic rats. The increased gluconeogenesis was associated with increased lactate utilization and was not the result of inhibition of alternative pathways of lactate metabolism. The disposition of isotope between glucose and glycogen indicated impaired glycogen synthesis in these livers. The changes in glucose and glycogen synthesis in livers from diabetic rats were reversed by insulin treatment in vivo. CO2 was the major product of lactate metabolism in livers from fed rats, whereas glucose was the major product in livers treated with glucagon or from fasted or diabetic rats. Ketone bodies, fatty acids, and cholesterol were minor products of lactate metabolism in all situations examined. Glucagon, fasting, and diabetes had negligible effects on the oxidation of lactate to CO2, but inhibited the synthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol from this substrate. Fasting and diabetes also reduced lactate ketogenesis. Urea production was increased about 2-fold by glucagon and diabetes and by about 30% by fasting. It was minimally changed by lactate. The alterations in ureogenesis indicated enhancement of gluconeogenesis from endogenous protein by glucagon, fasting, and diabetes. Ketone body production was increased about 10-fold in livers from fasted or diabetic rats perfused without lactate. The increase was apparently due to increased lipid utilization and decreased Krebs cycle activity. Glucagon produced a 2-fold increase in ketone bodies and it is suggested that these were mainly derived from protein. Lactate markedly suppressed ketogenesis and increased respiration in livers from fasted or diabetic rats. Both effects were attributable to an increase in the Krebs cycle. Lactate also replaced lipid as the major fuel oxidized by livers from fed rats and it is suggested that it acted by diverting endogenous fatty acid from oxidation to esterification. The metabolic changes observed in the present study are discussed from the viewpoints of underlying mechanisms and physiological implications. It is concluded that changes in the disposition of substrate (pyruvate or fatty acid) within the liver may be as important as changes in substrate supply in the alterations in gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis during fasting and diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2027056925,"The amount of phenacetin in plasma was determined in nine control subjects (nonsmokers) and nine subjects who smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day. The mean plasma concentration of phenacetin at 1, 2, 3(1/2), and 5 hours after its administration was markedly lower in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers. At 2 hours after the oral administration of 900 milligrams of phenacetin, the plasma concentration (+/- standard error) of unchanged drug was 2.24 +/- 0.73 micrograms per milliliter in the controls and 0.48 +/- 0.28 micrograms per milliliter in the smokers. The rate of excretion in urine of the major metabolite of phenacetin, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol, was the same in both groups. These results indicate for the first time decreased concentrations of a drug in plasma of persons who smoke cigarettes, and the results suggest that the decrease in the amount of Phenacetin in plasma may result from increased metabolism of phenacetin in cigarette smokers."

The l isomer of benzylsuccinic acid, 2(R)-benzyl-3-carboxypropionic acid, appears to be bound by the enzyme several orders of magnitude more tightly than known substrates and inhibitors. This inhibitor may resemble the collected substrates for the reverse reaction, combining their individual binding characteristics in a single molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1680345515,"Abstract The equilibrium between carbon monoxide and leghemoglobin from soybean root nodules shows that the protein is half-saturated with carbon monoxide at only about 0.00074 mm Hg pco at 20°. This value varies only slightly with changes in salt or protein concentration. The value is essentially independent of pH (no Bohr effect). The temperature dependence measurements show a rather large van't Hoff apparent enthalpy, -18.9 kcal per mole, which reflects the very high free energy of ligand binding indicated by the equilibrium. Leghemoglobin is half-saturated with oxygen at about 0.047 mm Hg. The kinetic dissociation constant for oxygen, koo2 off, is 11 sec-1 at 25°. This constant is believed to play a controlling role in the facilitation of the diffusion of oxygen by mammalian myoglobins which have koo2 ≅ 10 sec-1. This close similarity suggests that a primary role of leghemoglobin may also be that of the facilitation of the diffusion of oxygen within the nodule. The kinetic on constant in leghemoglobin appears to be primarily responsible for the very high affinity of ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1553808092,Abstract The results of a kinetic investigation of the reactions of bovine serum mercaptalbumin with p-nitrophenyl acetate are described. At pH 6.3 to 7.8 these reactions are biphasic and consist of (a) an initial phase during which the release of p-nitrophenol results from a monoacetylation of the albumin and from an albumin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the p-nitrophenylacetate and (b) a second phase during which the release of p-nitrophenol results only from the albumin-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester. Second order rate constants for both the acetylation reaction and albumin-catalyzed hydrolytic reaction are reported. Results are also presented which indicate that the acetylation site and the catalytic site on the albumin are separate sites and that the conformational integrity of the protein is necessary for its catalytic activity. Analysis of albumin which has reacted with p-nitrophenyl acetate indicate that two tyrosyl hydroxyl groups on the protein are rapidly acetylated by the ester. One of these tyrosyl groups is at the acetylation site of the protein and the other is postulated to be adjacent to the catalytic site. A model compatible with the kinetic and analytical data is proposed in which the acetyl group of an acetyl protein intermediate in the catalytic reaction is transferred to a tyrosyl residue adjacent to the catalytic site.
https://openalex.org/W2036923626,"6,7-Dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is a pharmacologically active alkaloid that can be formed by condensation of dopamine with formaldehyde. We used fluorescence microscopy to study in vitro the uptake and storage of this compound by sympathetic nerves of the rat iris. Rats were treated with reserpine or with the methyl ester of α-methyl-p-tyrosine in order to deplete the endogenous catecholamine stores. Accumulation of the alkaloid was about one-tenth that of norepinephrine. Uptake was completely blocked by 10-5M desmethylimipramine. These results offer some explanation for the sympathomimetric properties of the alkaloid. Similar results can be expected for similar tetrahydroisoquinolines that may be formed in vivo from endogenous catecholamines during ingestion of alcoholic beverages."
https://openalex.org/W2017015366,"Close linkage of mutually exclusive genes occurs in the non-alpha chain hemoglobin genes and in the immunoglobulin genes of man and other mammals. The expression of one gene in the cluster precludes the expression of any other linked gene. A simple, testable theory of gene selection called ""looping-out excision""which was designed only to explain this mutual exclusivity in the hemoglobin system is described. The theory is closely concordant with a wide range of previously unexplained findings concerning hematopoiesis- including the developmental changes of hemoglobins, the increases in immature or fetal forms of hemoglobin that accompany anemia, and with the distribution of adult and fetal hemoglobins among erythrocytes during normal embryogenesis and in various pathological conditions. One corollary of this theory is that erythroid tissue in the normal adult bone marrow is constantly recapitulating the developmental stages of its embryogenesis. Another corollary is that the selection from among the linked globin genes occurs independently on the two chromosomes of the diploid organism. Both of these corollaries are supported by the available data. The same theory of gene selection is also remarkably consistent with known data for immunoglobulin synthesis; it could explain not only the mutually exclusive activation of linked variable genes but also the splicing which occurs between genetically linked variable and constant region genes for the immunoglobulin polypeptide chains. The agreement between these two different tissues is considered to be strong evidence that the proposed mechanism is correct at least in broad outline. Evidence from the genetics of maize and of drosophila also supports this theory of somatic tissue variegation. On the basis of these comparisons, I suggest that looping-out excision probably occurs also in other tissues and may be one means of gene selection and activation in differentiating cells."

Twins were also concordant for the spurts and lags in development in this period (monozygotic twins more so than dizygotic). From these results it was inferred that infant mental development was primarily determined by the twins' genetic blueprint and that, except in unusual cases, other factors served mainly a supportive function."

https://openalex.org/W1904839522,"Abstract By kinetic studies and the identification of the labeled peptide of the [14C]KNCO-modified protein, the inactivation of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase by potassium cyanate can be attributed to the carbamylation of the e-amino group of lysine-97. Although the e-amino group of lysine-97 is the major site of carbamylation by cyanate, the α-amino group of alanine-1 and e-amino group of lysine-85 are also sites of carbamylation. Kinetic experiments indicate that the apparent pKa of the reactive amino group is 7.7, a value which is in good agreement with the apparent pKa of 8.0 ± 0.3 obtained by studies of the inactivation of the enzyme by reaction with pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate. Experimental evidence suggests that the previously reported inactivation of glutamate dehydrogenase by carbamyl phosphate can be attributed to the cyanic acid which is formed by the decomposition of carbamyl phosphate."

Mild to severe symptoms of physical dependence, including grand mal seizures, are observed when ethanol is abruptly withdrawn after 6 to 10 weeks of chronic oral intake. In addition, the rate of disappearance of ethanol in blood increased during periods of chronic ingestion, an indication of developing metabolic tolerance. These results suggest that the young chimpanzee may be a suitable model for experimental studies of alcoholism."

https://openalex.org/W1557757782,"Abstract Polarization of fluorescence measurements on hen's egg white lysozyme labeled with 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride have been used to detect the formation of a soluble complex of this protein with thyroglobulins from bovine, normal human, and goitrous human thyroids. The binding of the labeled lysozyme to thyroglobulin is accompanied by a 40% increase in the quantum yield, a blue shift of 14 nm in the emission maximum, and a lengthening of the fluorescence lifetime of the 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl moiety from 6.7 to 8.2 nsec. A statistical dissociation constant of 1.5 x 10-6 m at pH 8.0 and evident cooperativity of binding indicated by a Hill exponent of 3 to 4 were observed. Assuming that interlysozyme bonds occur when 2 or more lysozyme molecules are bound contiguously on thyroglobulin, a free energy of lysozyme-lysozyme interaction of about 1 kg cal per pair accounts well for the observed cooperativity."

https://openalex.org/W1570254896,"Abstract The extents of AMP, CMP, and UMP incorporation catalyzed by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase were examined under a variety of experimental conditions. At low levels of enzyme nucleotide incorporation into tRNApCpC, tRNApC, and tRNApX in the presence of both ATP and CTP led to the formation of the normal product, tRNApCpCpA. However, when ATP or UTP were present without CTP, tRNApCpA, tRNApCpU, or tRNApU were also synthesized. At high concentrations of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, a wide variety of unusual tRNA molecules were made. These included molecules with AMP, CMP, or UMP in each, and sometimes all, of the terminal positions, as well as tRNA chains containing as many as 8 CMP residues. These altered tRNA molecules should prove valuable for elucidating the biological function of the -pCpCpA terminus of tRNA. Evidence is also presented that apparently homogeneous preparations of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase contain a poly(C) polymerase activity which utilized as substrates intact tRNA, rRNA, and tRNAs without complete termini. With rRNA as substrate, molecules containing as many as 40 CMP residues could be made. AMP and UMP were generally not added to rRNA, but in the presence of CTP, AMP residues could be incorporated. The properties of this poly(C) polymerase activity were similar to those of the CMP-incorporating activity of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and differed from those of mammalian poly(C) polymerase suggesting that contamination of the enzyme preparation was probably not involved. A rapid procedure for the location of nucleotide residues added to RNA chains is also described."

https://openalex.org/W1542634683,"Abstract The protoheme group of myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c peroxidase was chemically replaced by the mesoheme group. The magnetic susceptibilities and optical absorption spectra of these mesohemoproteins and their derivatives in ferric states were measured as a function of temperature between 77° K and 296° K in order to examine the effect of chemical modification of the heme group on the heme group on the heme-apoprotein interaction. Ferric mesohemoproteins and their derivatives showed thermal excitation characteristics of spin states similar to those of the corresponding protohemoproteins. The compensation temperature (Tc), which is the ratio of the enthalpy difference (ΔH0) and the entropy difference (ΔS0) between high and low spin states and at which the concentration of the high and low spin states are equal, was found to be 50–100° higher in mesohemoproteins than the corresponding protohemoproteins. On the basis of the present results it was concluded that the Van der Waals contacts between porphyrin and apoprotein moieties are essential for the thermal equilibria of spin states in ferric hemoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2092060899,"Ciliated epithelial cells in the oviduct of Necturus maculosus were stimulated mechanically by brief dimpling with a microstylus. This treatment produlced a transient depolarization of the membrane, and a transient increase in the frequency of ciliary beating. The increase in frequency of ciliary beating was related to the concentration of extracellular calcium ion, decreasing with reductiotn in calcium. Addition of lanthanum was followed by a decrease in spontaneous ciliary aictivity and a hyperpolarization of the membrane. In the presence of lanthanum, the transietnt depolarization in response to mechanical stimulation had a shorter timte course, and the concomitant increase in ciliary frequency was greatly reduced. It is concluded that calciuml ions enter the cell as a result of mechanical stimulationi of the membrane, and that calcium influx leads to an increase in the frequency of ciliary activity."
