https://openalex.org/W1976602029,An abrupt change in sediment thickness between the crests and flanks of the mid-ocean ridges can be interpreted as a major discontinuity in the rates either of spreading of the sea floor or of accumulation of sediment. The preferable interpretation of the data is that the process of spreadig of the sea floor is intermittent and that the present cycle of spreading commenced around 10 million years ago. following a long period Of quiescence during which most of the observed sediments were deposited.

These pulses should find extensive application in basic and applied research. Additional shortening of optical pulse durations can be obtained by means of the stimulated Raman effect, second-harmonic generation, or amplification with nonlinear laser amplifiers."
https://openalex.org/W1976420979,The technique of using magnetic-tape recorders and atomic frequency standards to operate two widely separated radio telescopes as a phase-coherent interferometer when the stations have no radio-frequency connecting link has been successfully tested at the National Research Council of Canada's Algonquin Radio Observatory.

Paramagnetic and light-absorption effects associated with irradiated glasses were diminished by a factor as large as 20 in some glasses. Irradiation increases the concentration of hydroxyl ions, as evidenced by increased absorption in the 2.7-micron (3700 cm(-1)) infrared region for hydrogen-silica glasses."

https://openalex.org/W2029252860,"The first appearance of mitotic figures in reactivatinig buds of 1-year-old ash seedlings is in leaf primordia. The occurrence of mitotic figures then progresses sequentially to the procambial cells and finally to the cambium at the base of the bud. Milotic reactivation of the cambium in progressively more proximal regions of the stem is slow, proceeding at a maximal rate of 6 centimeters per day."

https://openalex.org/W2031118354,"Nabam in water solution retards hatching of Meloidogyne eggs. In soil nabam increases egg hatching of Meloidogyne and Heterodera tabacum, indicating that a decomposition product in soil is a hatching factor. Because of this attribute, combining nabam with a nematocide increases control of Meloidogyne by exposing more larvae to the nematocide while it is at maximum efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2014309347,"At 9:48 P.M. Mountain time, June 30, I918,' a meteorite was seen to fall in the country between Richardton and Mott, North Dakota. Pieces fell on both sides of the line between Stark and Hettinger counties within a strip about 9 miles wide from north to south and 5 miles wide from east to west. The center of this area lies in altitude 46037'30 N. and longitude I02016'17 W., about 20 miles south of Richardton. The following data in regard to finders and specimens have been collected. The finds are arranged in geographical order from north to south."
