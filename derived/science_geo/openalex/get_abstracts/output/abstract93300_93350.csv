https://openalex.org/W1992800404,"A selection procedure is described that should allow the genetic identification of cellular components involved in the process of protein localization in Escherichia coli. This procedure makes use of mutations that alter the signal sequence of the lambda receptor protein (product of the lamB gene), and prevent export of this protein to its normal outer membrane location. Several suppressor mutations have been identified that restore export of the mutant lambda receptor protein. Mapping experiments show that the suppressor phenotype is the result of mutations in any of at least three different chromosomal loci. One class of suppressor mutations, the class containing the largest number of independent isolates, maps in the major ribosomal gene cluster, suggesting that the suppressor phenotype is the consequence of an altered ribosomal protein. This class of suppressors phenotypically suppresses all known export-defective mutations, internal to the signal sequence region of the lamB gene. These results suggest that ribosomes play an important role in the export of lambda receptor to the outer membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1527595827,"The process of in vitro RNA chain elongation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase transcribing the early genetic region of T7 DNA has been studied using a quantitative RNA polymerase assay procedure together with analysis of nascent transcripts by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When transcription is initiated synchronously at the T7 A1 promoter, there is extensive pausing of elongating complexes at specific sites on the DNA as revealed by transient formation of discrete RNA bands detected by gel electrophoresis. This pausing is also signalled by the rapid loss of transcriptional synchrony among the population of elongating polymerase molecules. Although transcriptional pausing is more readily detected at low substrate concentrations, it is still prevalent, even at optimal substrate concentrations, and even at optimal substrate concentrations, RNA polymerase molecules are paused up to 70% of the time during in vitro elongation. Hence, pausing must be reduced substantially to obtain in vivo elongation rates. Transcriptional pause sites are numerous and are distributed throughout the T7 early region. They were not confined to intercistronic regions, nor do we detect strong pause sites located in these regions under a variety of conditions. Pause sites are heterogeneous as judged by differences in the efficiency with which they cause elongating polymerase molecules to pause and in the length of the resulting pause. RNA polymerase responds differently to certain of these sites in the presence of the transcriptional regulatory factors rho-protein and L-protein, raising the possibility that these sites play a role in transcriptional regulation in vivo. The sites at which rho-protein causes RNA chain release in the T7 early region appear to be pause sites. However, not all pause sites are rho release sites and this class includes some of the strongest pause sites. rho release sites are not coincident with the T7 intercistronic regions."

https://openalex.org/W2031741078,Female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) exposed to a single drop of male urine on the upper lip showed changes in concentrations of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and norepinephrine in olfactory bulb tissue; no such changes occurred in dopamine concentration. The changes were measured in the posterior but not the anterior olfactory bulb tissue of females within 1 hour after they were exposed to urine. These females also showed rapid increases in serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone. Females exposed to water on the upper lip showed none of these changes. These results suggest that in this species LHRH and norepinephrine in the olfactory bulb may mediate luteinizing hormone release in response to external (pheromonal) chemical cues.

https://openalex.org/W1985621084,"Four monoclonal antibodies have been produced that recognize surface molecules of the guinea pig sperm. Each antibody binds to a unique, localized region of the sperm surface. The four antibody-binding patterns are restricted to the anterior head, of the sperm, the posterior head, the whole head and the posterior tail. Based on absorption experiments, the surface molecules detected by the antibodies are differentiation antigens. Three of the antibodies immunoprecipitate 125I-labeled protein antigens. The molecular weights of the polypeptides observed after SDS-PAGE are 52,000 (anterior head), 42,000 (whole head), and 60,000 (posterior head). The observed monoclonal antibody-binding patterns suggest that the guinea pig sperm surface is divided into a minimum of four domains."
https://openalex.org/W184098300,"The effect of the regulatory nucleotide ppGpp on transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro has been studied using bacteriophage T7 and T3 DNAs as templates. We have previously described the development of transcriptional test systems using these templates that can sensitively detect changes in promotor or terminator recognition of an RNA polymerase (Wiggs, J.L., Bush, J.W., and Chamberlin, M.J. (1979) Cell 16, 97-109) or changes in the rate of any of the major steps of the transcription cycle (Chamberlin, M.J., Nierman, W.C., Wiggs, J.L., and Neff, N. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10061-10069). Using these procedures we fail to detect any substantial alteration by ppGpp of the normal interaction of E. coli RNA polymerase with the several T7 major and minor promoter sites or of the rate of productive RNA chain initiation at either T7 promoter A1 (ATP start) or A2 (GTP start). However, at physiologically relevant concentrations (KI approximately 50 microM), ppGpp significantly lowers the overall elongation rate of T7 RNA chains, leading to a substantial reduction in the overall rate of RNA synthesis. Inhibition of transcriptional elongation does not appear to be competitive with the ribonucleoside triphosphate substrates. Furthermore, ppGpp does not inhibit chain elongation during transcription of the synthetic polynucleotide templates poly[d(A-T)] or poly[d(A-G):d(C-T)]. We conclude that ppGpp interacts directly with some site on RNA polymerase other than one of the sites used for substrate binding. Furthermore, the inhibition must depend on specific DNA sequences present in T7 DNA, but not in poly[d(A-T)] or poly[d(A-G):d(C-T)]. Analysis of T7 transcripts formed in the presence and absence of ppGpp by gel electrophoresis reveals that in the latter instance there is enhanced pausing of the transcriptional elongation complex at specific sites on the template. It is likely that the enzyme also pauses at such sequences in the absence of ppGpp, but for a far briefer time (Kassavetis, G.A., and Chamberlin, M.J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2777-2786). Thus, ppGpp appears to slow transcriptional elongation by binding to RNA polymerase and altering its structure in a manner that impedes passage of the enzyme through certain DNA sequences. The presence of similar transcriptional barriers in rRNA operons activated by the presence of ppGpp could lead selectively to large reductions in the rate of rRNA synthesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1569565331,"Abstract By labeling cells heavily with [3H]glycerol or [3H]-palmitic acid several new species of lipoproteins, in addition to Braun's lipoprotein and a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein called PAL, were found in the envelope of Escherichia coli. The new lipoproteins were immunochemically different from both Braun's lipoprotein and PAL. A strain lacking the structural gene for Braun's lipoprotein contained new lipoproteins and PAL. In addition to Braun's lipoprotein and PAL, four new lipoproteins were found to be localized in the outer membrane, while other two species were found in the cytoplasmic membrane. The localization of one species is unknown. We previously reported that, on treatment of cells with globomycin, a precursor of Braun's lipoprotein accumulated in the cell envelope (Hussain, M., Ichihara, S., and Mizushima, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3707-3712). Similarly, the putative precursors of new lipoproteins and that of PAL accumulated in globomycin-treated cells. These precursors contained glycerol and fatty acid(s) as that of Braun's lipoprotein did. It is suggested that the structures of the signal region and the mechanisms of processing of all the lipoproteins of E. coli are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1629280082,"Using two complementary methods developed and applied earlier in rats absorbing triacylglycerols, we have now determined the intestinal contribution of individual plasma apolipoproteins when the rate of intestinal lipid absorption is very low. After all dietary fat was withheld for 16-20 h, the intestine produced approximately 50% of the plasma apolipoprotein A-I (apo-A-I) and apo-A-IV, similar to its contribution during fat absorption. When rats were fed a fat-free diet for 12 days and, in addition, biliary fat was diverted from the intestine for 16 h, the intestine still produced approximately 50% of the apo-A-I and only slightly less of the apo-A-IV. Under both conditions of reduced fat absorption, a larger proportion of the intestinally-derived apo-A-I and apo-A-IV bypassed the mesenteric lymph and was released directly into intestinal venous blood. The intestinal apo-B contribution, 16% of the total in fat-fed rats, was reduced to approximately 5% when dietary fat was withheld. Intestinal apo-B was released entirely into the lymph. Intestine produced only small amounts of apo-C and little or no apo-E under all conditions. The results indicate that production of apo-A-I and apo-A-IV by the small intestine is not regulated by the rate of intestinal triacylglycerol transport."

https://openalex.org/W1541029191,"Acyl carrier protein (ACPSH) functions as the acyl carrier in fatty acid biosynthesis. The acyl moieties are bound to the sole sulfhydryl of the protein located on the 4'-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. Disulfide-linked dimers of ACPSH were formed by the reaction of ACPSH with acyl-ACP or the mixed disulfide of ACPSH and thionitrobenzoate. The formation of ACP dimers was established by electrophoresis, gel filtration, and sedimentation equilibrium. ACP purified from stationary phase Escherichia coli B cells was found to exist primarily as a mixed disulfide with glutathione. This species was identified by gel electrophoresis amino acid analysis and 31P NMR spectroscopy. A non-denaturing gel electrophoresis system was developed that allows the comparison of the effects of various protein and sulfhydryl modifications on the stability of the ACP protein moiety to pH-induced denaturation. In general, attachment of hydrophilic ligands to the sulfhydryl of ACPSH resulted in less stable protein structures whereas the presence of a hydrophobic thioester resulted in stabilization of the protein conformation. The less stable ACP structures were found to have 31P NMR chemical shifts displaced downfield from ACPSH and the more stable acyl-ACP derivatives were found to have chemical shifts displaced upfield from ACPSH."
https://openalex.org/W2089012091,"Abstract The organization of tRNA genes on the circular 32 kb mitochondrial genome of the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans has been studied by gel transfer hybridization and by DNA sequencing. Most of the tRNA genes are tightly clustered within two regions (1 kb each) flanking the split gene for the large ribosomal subunit RNA. The upstream cluster contains nine genes, the downstream cluster eleven genes. The twenty tRNA genes are on the same strand as the two rRNA genes and are separated from each other by AT-rich spacer sequences, usually consisting of only a few nucleotides. Two tRNA genes ( leul and ala ) are joined end to end. The occurrence of two tRNA Gty genes is the first exception to the observation that in mitochondria all four-codon families are read by a single tRNA. Both genes are adjacent and show extensive sequence homology, suggesting relatively recent origin by gene duplication. The product of glyl has a U in the wobble position as do all other tRNA gene products specific for four-codon families, whereas the gly2 product, which has a rare A in the same position, should read only the codon GGU. The products of metl and thr have an A and G in positions 18 and 55, respectively, like the mitochondrial tRNA fMet and tRNA Thr of Neurospora crassa. Other unusual features are the replacement of the invariant G-C pair at positions 53 and 61 by A-T in met2, glyl and gly2 , the replacement of the invariant T at position 8 by A in phe and G in pro and the deletion of a nucleotide at position 9 in ser2 ."

A precursor to maltose-binding protein (Mr - 41,000), which is identical to the precursor polypeptide synthesized in vitro in a cell-free system, can be detected in vivo indicating that it is not processed to mature size until the polypeptide chain is terminated. The population of incomplete, nascent polypeptide chains of maltose-binding protein was found to contain NH2 termini characteristic of both precursor and mature protein demonstrating that processing occurs co-translationally as well as post-translationally. However, the polypeptide containing the signal sequence must reach a critical size of Mr - 33,000 before any processing takes place."

https://openalex.org/W1498082444,"Human erythrocytes were separated according to age to determine whether there is heterogeneity in the specific binding of 125I-insulin to red cells. The mean cell age of erythrocyte isolates was determined from the cumulative distribution frequency of the cells in an isotonic (290 milliosmolar) density gradient and confirmed by assay for pyruvate kinase, an age-dependent red cell enzyme. An IBM 2997 centrifugal cell separator was used to obtain larger quantities of younger erythrocytes from normal subjects. 125I-insulin binding to red cells including reticulocytes was found to decrease exponentially as a function of their mean cell age in 8 normal subjects. A change in receptor number rather than affinity appeared to account for the observed change in 125I-insulin binding. An exponential, age-dependent change in binding of a hormone to its cell membrane bound receptor has not previously been observed. Consistent with these results is the possibility that regulation of the red cell insulin receptor concentration takes place only in the younger red cells."

The extract contained clathrin (greater than 90%) and polypeptides of 35,000 (less than 5%) and 38,000 (less than 5%) molecular weight. Antibodies to clathrin were affinity purified on a homogeneous clathrin-Sepharose column and demonstrated to be monospecific by sensitive immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments. These antibodies give a fluorescence pattern consistent with coated pit localization in cultured cells from diverse species indicating extensive cross-reaction, and, thus, conservation of the clathrin antigen. Antibodies to the lower molecular weight proteins (LMWP) present in the clathrin preparation were also affinity purified on a column containing these polypeptides but devoid of clathrin. These antibodies cross-reacted completely and immunoprecipitated only clathrin from 3T3 cell extracts. Although the molecular weights and isoelectric points of the LMWP presented are quite similar to tropomyosins, these immunological results and limited protease digestion data indicate that tropomyosin and the LMWP are not related. Rather, the latter may be breakdown products of clathrin."

https://openalex.org/W1555792171,"The cls mutation conferring a defect in cardiolipin synthesis (Pluschke, G., Hirota, Y., and Overath, P. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5048-5055) has been introduced into an Escherichia coli strain defective in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in order to study the effect of changes in polar head group composition on the ordered in equilibrium fluid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids. The defect in cardiolipin formation is compensated by an increase in phosphatidylglycerol content, resulting in a decrease of the midpoint of the phase transition by 6 degrees C. Starvation of the cls mutant strain for the unsaturated fatty acid supplement leads to the incorporation of saturated acyl chains of reduced average length into the phospholipids, and growth is inhibited although the membrane remains in a fluid state. A revertant of this strain is described which retains the parental fabB-, fadE-, and cls markers and grows in the absence of an unsaturated fatty acid supplement. A cls+ derivative of the revertant can multiply in a restricted temperature range (35-43 degrees C). It contains only saturated phospholipid acyl chains of an anomalously short average length of 14 carbon atoms but has the same polar head group composition as wild type E. coli. The results demonstrate that, under defined conditions, saturated acyl chains of reduced length are functionally equivalent to unsaturated chains."
https://openalex.org/W1520511594,"The amino acid sequence of purified gene 0.3 protein of T7, the protein responsible for overcoming host restriction, has been determined. The nucleotide sequence of the 0.3 RNA, the messenger RNA that codes for both the 0.3 protein and the gene 0.4 protein, a T7 protein of unknown function, has also been determined. The 0.3 RNA is 578 nucleotides long, 509 of which are used to code for the 2 proteins. The coding sequences do not overlap, but the termination codon for the 0.3 protein and the presumed initiation codon for the 0.4 protein do overlap in the sequence UAAUG. The 0.3 protein is very acidic: 34 of its 116 amino acids are aspartic or glutamic acid and only 6 are arginine or lysine. The 0.3 protein contains no cysteine. The nucleotide sequence predicts that the 0.4 protein consists of 50 amino acids and contains no histidine or proline. The effects of different mutations indicate that a protein which contains only the first 87 amino acids of the 0.3 protein is unable to prevent host restriction in vivo; one that contains the first 93 amino acids has weak function; and one that has the first 94 amino acids is fullymore » able to prevent host restriction. The apparently critical 94th amino acid is tryptophan.

Sodium deoxycholate extracts of canine pancreatic rough microsomes containing both signal peptidase and phospholipid were delipidated by gel filtration chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B equilibrated with 0.2% deoxycholate. Column fractions were assayed for signal peptidase activity both with and without the addition of ethanol-extracted soybean phospholipid at a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. A peak of signal peptidase activity was detected only when the fractions were assayed with added phospholipid. Phospholipid assays demonstrated that the peak of signal peptidase activity was cleanly separated from phospholipid. The ratio of protein to phospholipid in the deoxycholate extract of rough microsomes was 1.76 while that of the most active signal peptidase fractions ranged from 46.1 to 138. The peak of signal peptidase activity exhibited an apparent Stokes radius of 55 A.

In contrast, minimal coreplication of a Col E1- and a pMB1-derivative plasmid occurred, with the latter type rapidly excluding the former. We suggest here that the pMB1 derivatives, pMB9 and pBR322, are less sensitive than Col E1 derivatives to the putative inhibitor that regulates plasmid replication, due to base sequence differences in their target for the inhibitor, and consider one mechanism whereby the duplication of Col E1-like plasmids might be regulated."

The effect of leucine on branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase activity was observed both in the presence and absence of insulin, which also increased the activity of the enzyme in tissue extracts. Intact adipose tissue segments oxidized [I-14C]leucine at a maximum rate approximately 4 times that of [1-(14)C]valine. The rate of valine oxidation by intact tissue segments was doubled by addition of 0.2 to 0.5 mM unlabeled leucine, but not isoleucine, to medium containing 2 mM [1-(14)C]valine. Leucine, but not valine, also stimulated the rate of oxidation of 2 mM [U-14C]isoleucine by intact tissue segments.

https://openalex.org/W1481450333,"This study deals with the effects that mutations in the COB region of yeast mtDNA have on the expression of mitochondrially made polypeptides. Based on the detection of two series of polypeptide chain-terminating mutations, we conclude that two proteins are specified by this region, apocytochrome b (Mr = 30,000) and a polypeptide of Mr = 42,000. One series of mutations generates new polypeptides ranging in size from 8,000 to 29,000 daltons; all of them are precipitated by serum direct against apocytochrome b. These mutations are located in five distinct segments of the COB region, the sequences alpha to epsilon coding for apocytochrome b. The second series of mutations, generating new polypeptides ranging in size from 17,000 to 41,000 daltons, is located within the first intervening sequence (alpha/beta) of the split gene for apocytochrome b. These mutations cause premature chain termination in the COOH-terminal part of a 42,000-dalton polypeptide. Its NH2-terminal part is likely to be specified by sequence alpha and thus to be homologous to that of apocytochrome b. We conclude that the 42,000-dalton polypeptide is translated on a processing intermediate of th COB transcript by reading through sequence alpha into sequence alpha/beta. We discuss the hypothesis that this polypeptide has a function in the expression of the COB region, possibly at the level of transcript processing."

A protein of the appropriate molecular weight for pilin was isolated by this procedure and demonstrated to be pilin by specific labeling of the intact pilus with ferritin-coupled antibodies. CB15 pilin has an apparent molecular weight of 8,000, is rich in hydrophobic amino acids (greater than 70%), and has a broad isoelectric focusing range centered about a pI of 6.6. Periodic acid-Schiff reagent staining did not demonstrate carbohydrate modification of the monomer. The pilins of both CB15 and a related strain CB13 cross-react with anti-CB15 pilin antibody.

With purified, CoA-inactivated enzyme, ATP had only a weak reactivating effect which increased drastically, however, when a chelator was added at a concentration (0.1 mM) which by itself had little effect. Higher concentrations of chelator (1 mM) caused rapid reactivation even in the absence of ATP. Reactivation was also possible by removing CoA from equilibrium with oxidized glutathione, with acetyl phosphate in the presence of phosphotransacetylase, or by dialysis; however, these processes were very slow. Protection against CoA inactivation of alpha-isopropylmalate synthase was provided by high concentrations of ATP and, to a much lesser extent, ADP, by a high adenylate energy charge, by chelators, and by 3'-dephospho-CoA. Enzyme which had been inactivated with [3H]CoA did not retain any radioactivity (above control) when extracted with phenol. This result, together with other observations, is interpreted to mean that inactivation does not involve covalent modification, but is more likely the result of the formation of an enzyme.CoA.zinc complex held together by noncovalent forces. The physiological significance of the CoA effect is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1557099836,"The presence of zymogen E in bovine pancreatic secretion was demonstrated by activation with trypsin and isolation of protease E. The enzyme, pI = 4.85, has k3 and Km values of 48 s-1 and 4.4 mM, respectively, for acetyl-tri-L-alanine methyl ester and an amino acid composition similar to that of porcine protease E. Gel filtration of the proteins in the secretion provided evidence that bovine zymogen E forms complexes with procarboxypeptidase A, including a ternary complex of these two proteins with chymotrypsinogen C. Taken together with previous observations on porcine zymogen E (Kobayashi, R., Kobayashi, Y., and Hirs, C. H. W. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5526-5530) the data suggest that complex formation between procarboxypeptidase A and zymogen E may be a more widespread property of these proteins. The fact that zymogen E occurs as a major constituent in bovine pancreatic secretion in a physiological context n which no requirement for elastolysis exists suggests further that the functional significance of protease E in the digestion of proteins is general and not specific for elastin."
https://openalex.org/W1481810132,"S-Adenosyl-5'-3-methylthio[1-3H]propylamine was prepared by decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine in tritiated water, catalyzed by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli. Degradation of this product to 3-methylthio[1-3H]propylamine followed by oxidation in a coupled assay system involving pea seedling amine oxidase, catalase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase indicated less than 4% of total counts in water and greater than 75% in NADH plus NAD+. These results allow the assignment of tritium in 3-methylthiopropylamine to the 1-R configuration, establishing that S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, a pyruvate-containing decarboxylase, operates via a retentive mode. Tabulation of the available stereochemical results for two pyruvate-containing and three pyridoxal phosphate-dependent amino acid decarboxylases indicates that stereochemistry has been conserved both within each class of amino acid decarboxylases and between structurally distinct classes of decarboxylases. Comparison of the specific activity of 3-methylthio[1-3H]propylamine to the tritiated water employed in the decarboxylation reaction leads to a primary tritium isotope effect of 4.5 under conditions of substrate concentration far in excess of Km. Although a portion of the tritium in 3-methylthiopropylamine could have arisen through an enzyme-catalyzed exchange into decarboxylated adenosylmethionine (leading to an underestimate of the kinetic tritium isotope effect), we are unable to detect enzymatic loss of tritium from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. The magnitude of the observed isotope effect is discussed in the context of a kinetically significant exchange of an active site residue with solvent in the present of enzyme-bound S-adenosylmethionine."
https://openalex.org/W1586550977,"A procedure for the preparation of porcine protease E is described. The availability of a convenient source of the enzyme has permitted specificity studies utilizing the macromolecular substrates oxidized insulin A and B chains and oxidized ribonuclease. The results show that protease E has a pronounced selectivity for the carbonyl bonds of serine threonine, alanine, and valine residues, with the latter most favored. The specificity is complementary to that of the chymotrypsins and we suggest that this property is physiologically significant. The k3 and Km values for the substrates acetyl-trialanine methyl ester, succinyltrialanine p-nitroanilide and benzoylalanine methyl ester are comparable to those observed by others for porcine elastase. The specificity observed in the present work, however, indicates that protease E may best be regarded as a member of the chymotrypsin group of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1599043290,"It has recently been reported (Horwitz, K. B., Zava, D. T., Thilagar, A. K., Jensen, E. M., and McGuire, W. L. (1978) Cancer Res. 38, 2434-2437) than the human breast cancer-derived cell line MCF-7 from EG&G Mason Research Institute contains no 8 S and very little 4 S cytoplasmic estrogen receptor. Even so, we have found significant levels of cytoplasmic estrogen receptor in MCF-7 cells from this source. The receptor was found at a maximum level of 132 fmol/mg of cytoplasmic protein, and had an apparent dissociation constant at 30 degrees C of 7.3 X 10(-10) M and at 4 degrees C of 1.2 X 10(-10) M. In sucrose gradients without KCl, the receptor migrated at 6-7 S, and with 0.4 M KCl, at 3-4 S. The receptor was specific for estrogen, in that a 100-fold excess of diethylstilbestrol eliminated binding of radiolabeled estrogen, whereas hydrocortisone, aldosterone, progesterone, and testosterone had no effect. It was further demonstrated that at least part of the reason for the discrepancy between our data and those of Horwitz et al. is that the high insulin level (10 microgram/ml) used by Horwitz et al. dramatically lowers the assayable level of receptor. These results may have important implications for steroid receptor assays in other cell lines in tissue culture and in human breast cancer patients as well."
https://openalex.org/W1504591959,"Addition of the polypeptide mating pheromone alpha-factor to haploid MATa cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in the modification of a 32P-labeled protein (P17) with an apparent Mr of 17,000 to a form having an apparent Mr of 17,500 (P17). 32P associated with both P17 and P17 exhibits an unusually rapid rate of turnover. The conversion of P17 to P17 precedes the appearance of morphologically abnormal cells and, in contrast to other responses elicited by this pheromone, this change in apparent molecular weight does not require protein synthesis. Upon removal of alpha-factor, the P17/P17 ratio returns to pretreatment levels."
