https://openalex.org/W2019219628,"A concept for molecular electronics exploiting carbon nanotubes as both molecular device elements and molecular wires for reading and writing information was developed. Each device element is based on a suspended, crossed nanotube geometry that leads to bistable, electrostatically switchable ON/OFF states. The device elements are naturally addressable in large arrays by the carbon nanotube molecular wires making up the devices. These reversible, bistable device elements could be used to construct nonvolatile random access memory and logic function tables at an integration level approaching 10(12) elements per square centimeter and an element operation frequency in excess of 100 gigahertz. The viability of this concept is demonstrated by detailed calculations and by the experimental realization of a reversible, bistable nanotube-based bit."
https://openalex.org/W2069426323,"Domestication of many plants has correlated with dramatic increases in fruit size. In tomato, one quantitative trait locus (QTL), fw2.2, was responsible for a large step in this process. When transformed into large-fruited cultivars, a cosmid derived from the fw2.2 region of a small-fruited wild species reduced fruit size by the predicted amount and had the gene action expected for fw2.2. The cause of the QTL effect is a single gene, ORFX, that is expressed early in floral development, controls carpel cell number, and has a sequence suggesting structural similarity to the human oncogene c-H-ras p21. Alterations in fruit size, imparted by fw2.2 alleles, are most likely due to changes in regulation rather than in the sequence and structure of the encoded protein."

We provide evidence from Drosophila that a group of membrane-associated proteins act in concert to regulate both epithelial structure and cell proliferation. Scribble (Scrib) is a cell junction-localized protein required for polarization of embryonic and, as demonstrated here, imaginal disc and follicular epithelia. We show that the tumor suppressors lethal giant larvae (lgl) and discs-large (dlg) have identical effects on all three epithelia, and that scrib also acts as a tumor suppressor. Scrib and Dlg colocalize and overlap with Lgl in epithelia; activity of all three genes is required for cortical localization of Lgl and junctional localization of Scrib and Dlg. scrib, dlg, and lgl show strong genetic interactions. Our data indicate that the three tumor suppressors act together in a common pathway to regulate cell polarity and growth control."

The principle is based on the finite time constant for double-layer charging, which varies linearly with the local separation between the electrodes. During nanosecond pulses, the electrochemical reactions are confined to electrode regions in close proximity. This technique was used for local etching of copper and silicon as well as for local copper deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1985078116,"In Neurospora crassa , white collar 1 (WC-1), a transcriptional activator and positive clock element, is rhythmically expressed from a nonrhythmic steady-state pool of wc-1 transcript, consistent with posttranscriptional regulation of rhythmicity. Mutations in frq influence both the level and periodicity of WC-1 expression, and driven FRQ expression not only depresses its own endogenous levels, but positively regulates WC-1 synthesis with a lag of about 8 hours, a delay similar to that seen in the wild-type clock. FRQ thus plays dual roles in the Neurospora clock and thereby, with WC-1, forms a second feedback loop that would promote robustness and stability in this circadian system. The existence also of interlocked loops in Drosophila melanogaster and mouse clocks suggests that such interlocked loops may be a conserved aspect of circadian timing systems."
https://openalex.org/W1979299941,"The cytokine-inducible SH2 protein-3 (CIS3/SOCS-3/SSI-3) has been shown to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway and act as a negative regulator of fetal liver erythropoiesis. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which CIS3 regulates the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) signaling in erythroid progenitors and Ba/F3 cells expressing the EPOR (BF-ER). CIS3 binds directly to the EPOR as well as JAK2 and inhibits EPO-dependent proliferation and STAT5 activation. We have identified the region containing Tyr<sup>401</sup> in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPOR as a direct binding site for CIS3. Deletion of the Tyr<sup>401</sup> region of the EPOR reduced the inhibitory effect of CIS3, suggesting that binding of CIS3 to the EPOR augmented the negative effect of CIS3. Both N- and C-terminal regions adjacent to the SH2 domain of CIS3 were necessary for binding to EPOR and JAK2. In the N-terminal region of CIS3, the amino acid Gly<sup>45</sup> was critical for binding to the EPOR but not to JAK2, while Leu<sup>22</sup> was critical for binding to JAK2. The mutation of G45A partially reduced ability of CIS3 to inhibit EPO-dependent proliferation and STAT5 activation, while L22D mutant CIS3 was completely unable to suppress EPOR signaling. Moreover, overexpression of STAT5, which also binds to Tyr<sup>401</sup>, reduced the binding of CIS3 to the EPOR, and the inhibitory effect of CIS3 against EPO signaling, while it did not affect JAB/SOCS-1/SSI-1. These data demonstrate that binding of CIS3 to the EPOR augments the inhibitory effect of CIS3. CIS3 binding to both EPOR and JAK2 may explain a specific regulatory role of CIS3 in erythropoiesis."

The human airway epithelium is an important environmental interface, but LPS recognition pathways have not been determined. We hypothesized that LPS would trigger β−defensin (hBD2) mRNA in human tracheobronchial epithelial (hTBE) cells through a CD14-dependent mechanism, ultimately activating NF-κB. An average 3-fold increase in hBD2 mRNA occurs 24 h after LPS challenge of hTBE cells. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of CD14 mRNA and cell surface protein in hTBE cells and show that CD14 neutralization abolishes LPS induction of hBD2 mRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate TLR mRNA in hTBE cells and NF-κB activation following LPS. Thus, LPS induction of hBD2 in hTBE cells requires CD14, which may complex with a TLR to ultimately activate NF-κB.

Many protective elements including nitric oxide, peptides/proteins, and whole cells such as phagocytes and natural killer cells have been conserved during evolution. Studies in Drosophila illustrate the primary importance of pathogen recognition and induction of antimicrobial molecules. Toll mutations preventing antifungal peptide induction render mutant flies susceptible to fungal infection (1Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A.

Legarda D. Ryan L.K. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). These receptors include the mannose receptor (8Fraser I.P. Kosiel H. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Semin.

The mouse TLR4 homologue is an important determinant of LPS responsiveness (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6384) Google Scholar). In general, activation of pattern recognition receptors induces host defense gene products.As a primary interface between pathogens and the environment, epithelial cells lining the mammalian airways are a crucial site for the innate immune response. It has been proposed that dysfunction of innate immunity may result in recurrent airway infections as seen in cystic fibrosis (13Smith J.J. Travis S.M. Greenberg E.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The bovine β-defensin tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) serves as a paradigm for induction of innate immunity in the airway (14Diamond G. Russell J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The TAP gene is expressed in the ciliated airway epithelium (15Diamond G. Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and is induced following experimental bacterial infection (14Diamond G. Russell J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In vitro incubation of bovine tracheal epithelial cells with LPS increases TAP mRNA levels via a CD14-mediated response (14Diamond G. Russell J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), culminating in NF-κB activation and transcriptional up-regulation of the TAP gene (16Diamond G. Kaiser V. Rhodes J. Russell J.P. Bevins C.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, in the bovine airway epithelium antimicrobial peptides are induced through a well defined recognition and activation pathway that helps prevent microbial colonization.Two β-defensins are present in human epithelia. Human β-defensin-1 (hBD1) (17Bensch K.W. Raida M. Magert H.-J. Schulz-Knappe P. Forssmann W.-G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) is highly expressed in urogenital tissues (18Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), and to a lesser extent in airway and other epithelia, entirely in a constitutive manner (19Zhao C. Wang I. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Human β-defensin-2 (hBD2) was initially found in psoriatic skin and is present in cultured keratinocytes in response to bacteria (20Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.-M. Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The hBD2 gene is similar to TAP and includes three NF-κB consensus sequences upstream from the transcriptional initiation site (21Liu L. Wang L. Jia H.P. Zhao C. Heng H.H.Q. Schutte B.C. McCray P.B. Ganz T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1998; 222: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The mRNA for hBD2 is present in human lung (22Bals R. Wang X. Wu Z. Freeman T. Bafna V. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and is up-regulated in chronic inflammation and by the proinflammatory mediator IL-1β (23Singh P.K. Jia H.P. Wiles K. Hesselberth J. Liu L. Conway B.A.D. Greenberg E.P. Valore E.V. Welsh M.J. Ganz T. Tack B.F. McCray Jr P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14961-14966Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus, hBD2 is a host defense molecule whose production is induced in response to infection and inflammation. Purified hBD2 peptide acts synergistically with other antibacterial components of the airway surface fluid, including lysozyme and lactoferrin (22Bals R. Wang X. Wu Z. Freeman T. Bafna V. Zasloff M. Wilson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in maintaining a pathogen-free environment.As an innate immune response tissue, the human airway must recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as LPS via cell surface receptors. Surprisingly, neither CD14 nor TLRs have been documented in human tracheobronchial epithelial (hTBE) cells. We hypothesized that LPS would trigger hBD2 expression possibly through a CD14-mediated recognition, ultimately resulting in hBD2 induction via activation of NF-κB. To establish this paradigm, we analyzed the hBD2 mRNA response to LPS in hTBE cells and determined the role of CD14. Furthermore, we document expression of TLRs in these cells and demonstrate activation of NF-κB in response to LPS.RESULTSInducibility of antimicrobial factors by bacterial products and/or inflammatory mediators is a key feature of innate immunity. LPS induction of hBD2 gene expression was examined in passage 1 or 2 hTBE grown in culture at an air-liquid interface. Cells were grown for 7, 14, or 21 days, which corresponds to distinct stages of mucociliary differentiation (24Bernacki S.H. Nelson A.L. Abdullah L. Sheehan J.K. Harris A. William Davis C. Randell S.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and were treated with E. coli LPS at 1 or 5 μg/ml in the presence of human serum as a source of LPS-binding protein. Fig. 1 shows that hBD2 mRNA levels are highest early in culture and that expression is induced after incubation with LPS. In subsequent experiments conducted at 7 days postseeding, steady-state levels of hBD2 mRNA increased an average of 3-fold following LPS (range 1.3–6.3-fold, 10 separate experiments, with seven different patient cell samples) and up to 16-fold following IL-1β (data not shown), which is consistent with published results (23Singh P.K. Jia H.P. Wiles K. Hesselberth J. Liu L. Conway B.A.D. Greenberg E.P. Valore E.V. Welsh M.J. Ganz T. Tack B.F. McCray Jr P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immun. 1999; 67: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The LPS dose-response relationship for hBD2 induction in hTBE cells is shown in Fig. 2 A, which is a graphical representation of the results from a Northern blot with triplicate samples. An LPS dose of 10 ng/ml, which typically induces strong responses in monocyte-derived cells, did not alter hBD2 expression in hTBE cells, but hBD2 mRNA increased following 100 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml of LPS. As shown in Fig. 2 B, we examined LPS stimulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in the same cultures. The basal expression of IL-8 is approximately 10-fold higher in the presence of serum than in cultures with media alone (data not shown). However, ≥1 μg/ml LPS induced a significant increase over this elevated base line.Figure 2Steady state hBD2 mRNA and production of IL-8 by hTBE cells in response to LPS. A, cells were cultured for 7 days and exposed to varying amounts of E. coli LPS. RNA was harvested 24 h later, and the resulting Northern blot was hybridized with probes for hBD2 and subsequently for γ-actin. The hBD2 signal was normalized to γ-actin and is presented in arbitrary units (A.U.). B, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurements of IL-8 protein in the basolateral medium after treatment of cells with LPS as described above. In bothA and B, the overall LPS effect is significant by analysis of variance (p < 0.001 for hBD2;p = 0.007 for IL-8). Both the 1- and 5-μg doses are significantly different from no LPS by the Tukey test for multiple comparisons (p = 0.002 and 0.003 for hBD2 andp = 0.007 and p = 0.015 for IL-8, respectively). Values are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time course of hBD2 mRNA induction is shown in Fig.3 A. LPS increased hBD2 mRNA at 12 and 24 h, but not 6 h, following challenge. Basal hBD2 expression declined over 24 h, possibly in response to the serum added to the medium as a source of LPS-binding protein. Subsequent analyses were performed 24 h following LPS addition. Fig. 3 B demonstrates a corresponding LPS-induced increase in hBD2 protein as detected by Western blot.Figure 3LPS induction of hBD2 mRNA and protein. A, hTBE cells cultured for 7 days were treated with LPS (5 μg/ml) for 6, 12, or 24 h. RNA was isolated, and the resulting Northern blot was hybridized to hBD2 and γ-actin probes.Open boxes are the mean of duplicate samples, and the hatched boxes are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate values. Although LPS induction of hBD2 was relatively low in this experiment, the 24-h time point was significantly greater than control when compared by Student's t test with Bonferroni's multiple comparison correction. p values for 6, 12, and 24 h were 0.44, 0.08, and 0.01, respectively.B, acid urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western blot analysis of hBD2 in acid-soluble proteins from hTBE cells.Lanes 1–3 represent 10, 3, and 1 ng of hBD2 standard.

Russell J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We examined hTBE cells for the expression and production of CD14, as well as its involvement in the up-regulation of hBD2. Immunoprecipitation of biotinylated surface proteins reveals that membrane-bound CD14 is found on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of hTBE cells (Fig.4 A). The Northern blot shown in Fig. 4 B indicates that mRNA for CD14 is present in hTBE cells, and the levels of CD14 are not altered in response to LPS. To test the role of CD14 in the stimulation of hBD2 gene expression, we challenged cultures with LPS in the presence of either My4, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to CD14, or an IgG2b isotype control. The Northern blot in Fig. 4 B and the corresponding graphical representation in Fig. 4 C are representative of three experiments and show that My4 blocks the up-regulation of hBD2 by LPS. Thus, CD14, either membrane-bound or the soluble form, is necessary for the LPS-induced increase in hBD2 mRNA.Figure 4The role of CD14 in the LPS-mediated induction of hBD2 gene expression. A, biotinylated surface proteins were immunoprecipitated with the My4 antibody specific to CD14 or an IgG2b isotype control. Electrophoresed immunoprecipitated proteins were blotted and then visualized by streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescent detection. As a positive control, HL60 cells, a myeloid cell line, were differentiated with 50 nm vitamin D. B, My4, a neutralizing antibody to CD14, was added to 7-day-old hTBE cultures at 5 μg/ml both apically and basolaterally for 20 min prior to 24-h basolateral LPS stimulation. IgG2b was used as an isotype control. RNA was isolated from the cultures, and the resulting Northern blot was hybridized sequentially with probes for hBD2, CD14, and γ-actin. The blot shown is representative of three experiments. C, a graphical representation of the blot in B. hBD2 signals were standardized to γ-actin and are presented in arbitrary units. When analyzed by analysis of variance, there was a very significant overall treatment effect (p < 0.001). My4 abolished LPS induction of hBD2 mRNA, (p < 0.001 for LPS aloneversus My4 plus LPS according to the Tukey test for multiple comparisons). The antibody control for My4 (IgG2b plus LPS) is significantly greater than its own control (IgG2b alone),p < 0.05.

As noted above, recent studies suggest that CD14-TLR complexes may function to initiate a signal transduction event. We examined hTBE cells for the expression of TLR genes by RT-PCR (Fig.5 A). Our results show that mRNA for all six published hTLRs is expressed in these cultures. Based on published results (10Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. J.

Northern blot analysis shown in Fig. 5 B indicates that hTLR2 is abundantly expressed in hTBE cells and that there is no induction by LPS. Human TLR4 expression is also detectable by Northern blot but is much less abundant than TLR2 and is also not regulated by LPS (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Expression of Toll-like receptors on hTBE cells. A, RT-PCR analysis of hTLR1–6 with total mRNA from hTBE cells. The absence of genomic DNA was verified by an intron-spanning primer pair from the γ-actin gene. All bands are of the predicted size.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we determined whether LPS-induced hBD2 expression was associated with activation of NF-κB. Upon induction with LPS for varying time periods, we isolated nuclear extracts from hTBE cells. THP-1 cells were used as a positive control (32Schottelius A.J. Mayo M.W. Sartor R.B. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Fig.6 A indicates that NF-κB is activated after a 1-h incubation with LPS in hTBE cells and persists through 8 h. A stronger and more persistent shift is seen in response to IL-1β. Preincubation of the extracts with unlabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide, but not with unlabeled mutant oligonucleotide, effectively competes for binding to the labeled oligonucleotide demonstrating specificity (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Activation of NF-κB in hTBE cells in response to LPS and inflammatory mediators. A, nuclear extracts were isolated from hTBE cultures after incubation with LPS or IL-1β for 1, 8, or 24 h. Thearrows indicate the shifted bands. B, the shifted bands were shown to be specific for NF-κB by competition with an oligonucleotide containing a consensus or mutant NF-κB site. The upper band indicated by the arrow contains the p65 subunit of NF-κB detectable by supershift (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with cells derived from two additional patient samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe airway epithelium comprises an important barrier against invasion by airborne pathogens. We show that epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract induce the host defense gene hBD2 at both the mRNA and protein level in response to LPS, a pathogen-associated pattern molecule. Human β-defensin-2 mRNA also is increased by IL-1β (23Singh P.K. Jia H.P. Wiles K. Hesselberth J. Liu L. Conway B.A.D. Greenberg E.P. Valore E.V. Welsh M.J. Ganz T. Tack B.F. McCray Jr P.B. Proc.

Together these data suggest that a peptide-based antimicrobial host response during infection and inflammation is intrinsic to mucosal surfaces.The molecular pathway for the induction of antimicrobial peptides in the airway is both similar to and different from circulating professional phagocytes, such as monocytes. While initially discovered and extensively studied in myeloid-derived cells, CD14 is also expressed by bovine and murine epithelial cells (14Diamond G. Russell J.P. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 38Fearns C. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate both CD14 mRNA and cell surface protein in human airway epithelial cells. We found that CD14 mRNA was not increased in response to LPS, whereas it is in monocytes (39Marchant A. Duchow J. Delville J.P. Goldman M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1663-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The CD14-specific antibody, My4, inhibited LPS-induced hBD2 expression in hTBE cells, which suggests a critical role for CD14 in the mechanism by which airway epithelial cells recognize and respond to bacterial products.Induction of hBD2 or IL-8 in hTBE requires relatively high concentrations (1–5 μg/ml) of LPS, whereas phagocytic cells or bovine epithelial cells are activated by 10–20 ng/ml concentrations. Thus, while CD14 is an important mediator of LPS responsiveness in hTBE cells, initiation and coupling to downstream signal transduction events appears to be much less efficient than in monocyte-derived cells. Primary cultures of bovine tracheal epithelial cells respond to lower levels of LPS than passaged hTBE cells. 2G. Diamond, unpublished observations. Surface CD14 in passage 1 hTBE cells was detected by immunoprecipitation, but expression was much less than in the vitamin D3-differentiated HL60 cells used as a positive control. Further studies are necessary to determine CD14 protein levels in normal and diseased human airways in vivo.The low sensitivity of the hTBE cells to LPS could be due to desensitization during culture. The medium for hTBE cells contains several biologicals including albumin, EGF, transferrin, and bovine pituitary extract. The practical limit of endotoxin reduction was 100 pg/ml. Thus, desensitization by basal endotoxin levels in the medium could have contributed to the apparent resistance of hTBE cells to LPS. However, polymyxin B addition did not reduce basal levels of IL-8 production (data not shown). As demonstrated by others, LPS desensitization of monocytic cell lines and murine macrophages appears to require 20–100 ng of LPS/ml (40Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Wedel A. Schraut W. Strobel M.

In LPS-tolerant cells, DNA binding activity in NF-κB gel shift assays consists mostly of p50 homodimers in LPS-tolerant cells (40Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Wedel A. Schraut W. Strobel M. Wendelgass P.

Immun. 1999; 67: 1553-1559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-κB gel shift assays in our studies are consistent with those seen in LPS-sensitive Mono Mac 6 cells, where the low mobility upper band representing the p50/p65 heterodimer is more prominent. We hypothesize that the low LPS responsiveness of hTBE cells reflects the low level of CD14 expression compared with monocytic cells. In support of this hypothesis are the findings that the response to LPS in THP-1 cells correlates inversely with the level of CD14 expression (43Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The lack of a cytoplasmic domain in GPI-anchored CD14 implies that it acts in concert with other proteins to transduce signals. Several lines of evidence suggest that TLRs contribute transmembrane signaling functions. Recent reports indicate that TLR2 mediates both LPS sensitivity (44Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A.

However, TLR2 null hamster macrophages still respond to LPS (46Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a complementary function for other TLRs including TLR4. It is now known that mouse TLR4 is equivalent to the mouse LPS gene conferring LPS sensitivity (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C.

Using RT-PCR, we demonstrate mRNA for the six published hTLR sequences in hTBE cells and have established that hTLR2 and -4 are present at levels detectable by Northern blot of whole RNA. Further studies are needed to clearly elucidate the specific roles of TLR2 and/or -4 in initiating signal transduction responses in the airway. This will require the development of tools including neutralizing antibodies analogous to My4, successful strategies to generate dominant negative phenotypes in difficult to transfect polarized hTBE cells, and genetically engineered animals.Studies of the Drosophila Toll pathway for antimicrobial factor induction and the discovery of inducible antimicrobial peptide expression in mammals suggest an evolutionarily conserved activation pathway.

To investigate potential mechanisms responsible for this age-dependent defect in VEGF expression, aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from young rabbits (ages 6–8 months) or old rabbits (ages 4–5 years) were exposed to normoxic (21% oxygen) or hypoxic (0.1% oxygen) conditions. Hypoxia-induced VEGF expression was significantly lower in old versus young cells. VEGF mRNA stability in hypoxic conditions was similar in both young and old cells. However, transient transfection with a luciferase reporter gene that was transcriptionally regulated by the VEGF promoter revealed a significant defect in VEGF up-regulation following hypoxia in oldversus young cells (a 43 versus 117% increase in luciferase activity, p < 0.05); this difference was not seen when a deletion construct lacking the hypoxia-inducible 1 (HIF-1) binding site was used. Moreover, although HIF-1α-mRNA expression was shown to be similar in young and old smooth muscle cells, HIF-1α protein and DNA binding activity were significantly reduced in old versus young smooth muscle cells that were exposed to hypoxia.

For instance, we have recently demonstrated that advanced age is associated with a defect in compensatory neovascularization in response to tissue ischemia (1Rivard A. Fabre J.E. Silver M. Chen D. Murohara T. Kearney M. Magner M. Asahara T. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Such impaired angiogenesis in ischemic tissues of old animals was found to be associated with reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),1 an endothelial-specific growth factor that is essential for embryonic (2Carmeliet P.

Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) neovascularization. The molecular alterations responsible for this age-dependent decline in VEGF expression, however, have not been elucidated. Among those factors that have been implicated in the regulation of VEGF expression, hypoxia appears to play a major role, both in vitro (5Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4176) Google Scholar) and in vivo (6Banai S. Shweiki D. Pinson A. Chandra M. Lazarovici G. Keshet E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in the hypoxic regulation of VEGF are similar to those factors responsible for erythropoietin (Epo) expression. Transcriptional regulation of VEGF expression at the 5′-promoter of VEGF is conferred by a sequence that is homologous to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) binding site within the Epo gene (7Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric (HIF-1α and HIF-1β) basic helix-loop-helix protein that activates the transcription of the Epo gene in hypoxic cells (8Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5103) Google Scholar). When reporter genes containing VEGF sequences are co-transfected with expression vectors that encode HIF-1α and HIF-1β, the reporter gene transcription is much higher in both hypoxic and normoxic cells than in cells transfected with the reporter gene alone (9Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). Moreover, the results of gene-targeting experiments have shown that HIF-1α deficiency is associated with a complete loss of VEGF gene induction under hypoxic conditions, marked reduction in vascularization of embryos, and early lethality by embryonic day 10.5 (10Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). In this study, we used an in vitro system to investigate potential transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in the age-dependent defect of VEGF induction by hypoxia. Our results indicate that the reduction in VEGF expression with aging is primarily attributed to a lower transcriptional activity under hypoxic conditions. Thus, this lower transcriptional activity is related to an age-dependent defect in HIF-1 activity. Cultures of primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were isolated from the aortas of young New Zealand White rabbits (ages 6–8 months) or old New Zealand White rabbits (ages 4–5 years) as described by Mader (11Mader S.L. J. Gerontol. Biol. Sci. 1992; 47: B32-B36Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The maximum age for New Zealand White rabbits was previously reported to be 7 years (12Weisbroth S. Weisbroth S. Flatt H. Kraus A. Neoplastic Diseases. Academic Press, New York1974: 331Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified of Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.25 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of normoxic conditions (5% CO2, 21% O2, and 74% N2), or placed in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, New York), flushed with hypoxic gas (95% N2 and 5% CO2), and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. All experiments were performed with early passage (P1-P3) rabbit VSMCs at 70% confluence. VSMCs from young and old rabbits were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for a 24-h period. The supernatant was collected and VEGF levels were determined by using an immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Quantikine, R&D Systems). Results were compared with a standard curve of human VEGF with a lower detection limit of 5 pg/ml. Samples were checked by serial dilution and were performed at least in duplicate. VEGF levels were normalized relative to the protein concentration of VSMC cellular extracts (Bio-Rad protein assay). VSMCs (P1) from young and old rabbits were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for a 24-h period, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer. Total protein extracts were quantified with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The protein extract (100 μg per sample) was separated on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and electroblotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in 0.2% Tween phosphate-buffered saline and then probed with VEGF rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), an HIF-1α mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400 dilution, Novus Biologicals), or an actin goat polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times in Tween phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with anti-rabbit (1:7000), anti-mouse (1:5000), or anti-goat (1:2000) horseradish peroxidase IgG for 1 h. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized after incubation for 1 min with enhanced luminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature, followed by exposure to hyperfilms (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each experiment was repeated at least twice with different cellular extracts. Representative results are shown below. Total cellular RNA was isolated from VSMCs by acid guanidinium phenol/chloroform extraction (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). The total denatured RNA (15 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose/formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 675-bpEcoRI/BglII fragment of pSVI.VEGF.21 (14Brogi E. Wu T. Namiki A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1994; 90: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), or a 345-bp fragment of human HIF-1α cDNA (pBluescript/HIF-1α 3.2–3T7) (8Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5103) Google Scholar) were used as specific probes. All probes were radio-labeled by random-primed labeling (Rediprime kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were hybridized overnight with 106 cpm/ml of the probe and then washed in 0.5 × SSC,0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, twice for 30 min at 65 °C, and subsequently exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films. For VEGF mRNA stability studies, VSMCs were exposed to hypoxic conditions for 24 h before the addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D to block gene transcription. RNA isolation was performed at different time-points (0, 1, 2, and 3 h). Subsequently, VEGF mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot and by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms that were exposed in the linear range of film density using a Hewlett-Packard scanner with National Institutes of Health Image Software. Least squares regression analysis of the resulting lines was performed, and half-life values were determined from the regression curves. Each experiment was repeated at least twice with different cell extracts. Representative results are shown below. For transfection experiments, we used a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the VEGF promoter (a 2.3 kilobase pair KpnI/NheI fragment of VEGF 5′-promoter region). From this initial full-length reporter gene, a deletion construct lacking the HIF-1 binding site was generated by restriction endonuclease digestion, PstI, as described previously (9,15). VSMCs were transiently transfected with 10 μg of reporter construct and with 30 μg of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, VSMCs were allowed to recover for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum before exposure to normoxic or hypoxic conditions. To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, luciferase activity was normalized relative to the level of alkaline phosphatase activity that was produced from co-transfected pSVAPAP plasmid (0.5 μg), which contained the reporter gene under the control of the simian virus 40 enhancer-promoter. The cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 3 h and then exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions. After 24 h, luciferase and alkaline phosphatase activities were measured in the VSMCs in old and young rabbits. Results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase to alkaline phosphatase activities. Cells were plated on four-well chamber slides before being exposed to either normoxic or hypoxic culture conditions for 6 h. Cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10 min before staining. They were then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase and 10% horse serum as a protein block before overnight incubation with the monoclonal HIF-1α antibody (1:5000 dilution). Signal amplification and detection were then carried out using the peroxidase-Catalyzed Signal Amplification System (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (16Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the reaction product was visualized by incubation with 0.05% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate, and a counterstain of 10% Gill hematoxylin was applied before cover-slipping. EMSA was performed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI·dC)/poly(dI·dC). After 10 min of preincubation in ice, 20 μg of whole cell extracts were incubated for 30 min with 1 pmol (4 × 104 cpm) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe spanning the VEGF HIF-1 binding site (5′-TGCATACGTGGGCTCCAACAG-3′; HIF-1 site isunderlined) (9Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar). Unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the preincubation mixture for competition assays (50-fold molar excess). Binding reactions were performed with a final volume of 15 μl (20 μg of cell extract), separated at 4 °C in non-denaturing 4% acrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE-running buffer. Each condition was performed in duplicate. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films. To study the effect of aging on VEGF expression in vitro, VSMCs that were isolated from young or old rabbits were exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h, and the VEGF expression was evaluated at mRNA and protein levels. As shown in Fig. 1 A, VEGF mRNA levels were low and similar among young and old VSMCs under normoxic conditions. VEGF levels were significantly increased by hypoxia in both groups. However, the magnitude of VEGF induction by hypoxia in old VSMCs (157% increase versus normoxia) was significantly lower than that of young VSMCs (273% increase versusnormoxia). Similar findings were observed at the protein level. VEGF levels in the supernatant ELISA were low and similar among young and old VSMCs in normoxic conditions (Fig. 1 B). Although VEGF values were significantly higher in both young and old VSMCs under hypoxic conditions, the magnitude of VEGF induction was significantly reduced in old versus young VSMCs (100 versus213% induction by hypoxia). This finding was confirmed by Western blot experiments on cellular extracts from VSMCs, which were exposed to hypoxic conditions. As seen in Fig. 1 C, VEGF levels were significantly reduced in old versus young hypoxic VSMCs. These results indicate that aging impairs VEGF induction under hypoxic conditions. Because VEGF expression is regulated not only at the transcriptional level but post-transcriptionally as well (15Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), we investigated whether VEGF mRNA half-life under hypoxic conditions was reduced by aging. VSMCs were exposed to hypoxic conditions for 24 h before the addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D to block gene transcription. RNA isolation was performed at different time-points, and the VEGF- mRNA half-life was determined after Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, no significant difference in mRNA half-life was found between young and old VSMCs (2.4 versus 2.8 h, p = not significant), indicating that the age-dependent impairment of VEGF induction under hypoxic conditions is not because of a decrease in mRNA stability. To investigate whether the transcriptional regulation of VEGF is affected by aging, we transfected VSMCs that were isolated from young or old rabbits with a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the VEGF promoter. The cells were then exposed to hypoxic conditions for a 24-h period, and promoter activities were measured in young and old VSMCs (Fig.3). VEGF promoter activity achieved under hypoxia in old VSMCs was almost half of that in young VSMCs (2.1 ± 0.3 versus 3.9 ± 0.1, p < 0.01). However, when a promoter construct lacking the HIF-1 binding site (Pst, Fig. 3), was transfected instead of the full-length reporter gene, VEGF promoter activity was not increased from hypoxia and no significant difference was found between the young and old VSMCs. This finding implicates HIF-1α in the age-dependent defect of VEGF induction by hypoxia. Next, we evaluated HIF-1α expression at the mRNA and protein levels in young and old VSMCs (Fig. 4). HIF-1α mRNA was not up-regulated by hypoxia, and similar levels were found in young and old VSMCs under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig.4 A). At the protein level, HIF-1α expression was barely detectable under normoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α protein expression was observed in young VSMCs, P1, but was reduced in old VSMCs (Fig. 4 B). HIF-1α immunostaining likewise disclosed reduced expression of HIF-1α protein in oldversus young VSMCs that were exposed to 6 h of hypoxia (Fig. 4 C). To study the effect of aging on HIF-1α DNA binding activity, we used a probe to span the VEGF HIF-1 binding site, and we performed electromobility shift assays on protein extracts from young or old VSMCs (Fig. 5). No specific HIF-1 DNA binding activity could be detected under normoxic conditions in either young or old VSMCs. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 DNA-binding activity was observed in young VSMCs but was still undetectable in old VSMCs. In this study, we have identified HIF-1 as a major factor involved in the age-dependent impairment of VEGF expression. We first confirmed in vitro the previously described reduction of VEGF expression in ischemic tissues of old animals (1Rivard A. Fabre J.E. Silver M. Chen D. Murohara T. Kearney M. Magner M. Asahara T. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Reduced VEGF expression in VSMCs that were isolated from old animals was seen only in hypoxic versus normoxic conditions at both the mRNA and protein levels. This indicates that aging is associated with a defect in VEGF up-regulation under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-stimulated VEGF expression has been attributed to increases in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (15Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol.

Previous investigators have demonstrated the central role of hypoxia in transcriptional up-regulation of VEGF expression (14Brogi E. Wu T. Namiki A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1994; 90: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 23Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). In this study, transfection experiments with a reporter gene under the control of the VEGF promoter clearly demonstrate that aging is associated with a reduction in hypoxia-induced VEGF transcriptional activity. Importantly, the age-dependent reduction in transcriptional activity was not seen when VSMCs were transfected with a reporter construct lacking the HIF-1 binding site. HIF-1 is a transcription factor that is known to be involved in several physiological responses to hypoxia. These responses are mediated by specific genes that are transcriptionally induced by HIF-1, such as the genes for glycolytic enzymes (24Semenza G.L. Jiang B.H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar), erythropoietin (25Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol.

HIF-1 has been shown to be essential for VEGF transcriptional activation, both in vitro (9Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar) and in vivo (10Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). Using 5′-flanking sequences mediating transcriptional activation of reporter gene expression, for example, Forsythe et al. (9Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3232) Google Scholar) showed that a 47-bp sequence located at 985 to 939 bp 5′ to the VEGF transcription initiation site was necessary for VEGF induction in hypoxic Hep3B cells. A HIF-1 binding site was demonstrated in the 47-bp response element, and a 3-bp substitution eliminated the ability of the element to bind HIF-1 and activate transcription in response to hypoxia. Moreover, the results of gene-targeting experiments have shown that HIF-1 null mice fail to up-regulate VEGF expression under hypoxic conditions, leading to a marked reduction in vascularization of the developing embryo and early lethality by embryonic day 10.5 (10Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M., Yu, A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data confirm the essential role of HIF-1 in VEGF induction under hypoxic conditions. In this study, we found that HIF-1α mRNA levels were not induced by hypoxia and were similar among young and old VSMCs. This finding is consistent with a previous study in which HIF-1α and HIF-1β mRNAs are shown to be constitutively expressed in HeLa and Hep3B cells with no significant induction by hypoxia. In fact, the activation of HIF-1 by hypoxia is shown to be primarily determined by the stabilization of HIF-1α protein (27Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Our analysis of HIF-1α protein expression under hypoxic conditions suggested that the stabilization of HIF-1α was impaired with aging. The exact mechanisms involved in this age-dependent reduction of HIF-1α protein expression are unknown. HIF-1α protein has been shown to be rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-protease system under normoxic conditions and stabilized by hypoxia through redox-induced changes (28Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 29Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Whether these mechanisms are affected by aging remains to be determined. Increase in mRNA stability constitutes a second important control point for the hypoxic induction of VEGF in different cell lines (15Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar,19Shima D.T. Deutsch U. D'Amore P.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Stabilization of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia is thought to be mediated by the binding of sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins (21Frenkel-Denkberg G. Gershon D. Levy A.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,22Shih S.C. Claffey K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1359-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) to the sequences in both the 3′- and 5′-untranslated region of VEGF mRNA (18Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Our findings indicated that VEGF mRNA half-life under hypoxic conditions was similar in VSMCs that were isolated from young and old animals. This finding suggests that the mechanisms involved in VEGF mRNA stabilization by hypoxia are not compromised with aging. The results of EMSA in the current experiments indicated that DNA binding activity of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions was significantly reduced in VSMCs that were isolated from old animals. Whether this was solely because of a reduction of HIF-1α protein expression is unclear. It is also possible that aging leads to a reduction in the ability of HIF-1 to bind to the hypoxia response element within the VEGF promoter, or that the ability of HIF-1α to form active heterodimers is reduced. Such post-translational loss of function has previously been described with aging for other proteins (31Reiss U. Gershon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 32Gershon H. Gershon D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The current findings implicate age-dependent defects in HIF-1 activity as being primarily responsible for reduced expression of VEGF and impaired angiogenesis associated with aging (1Rivard A. Fabre J.E. Silver M. Chen D. Murohara T. Kearney M. Magner M. Asahara T. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is also involved in the induction of other genes, including Epo and glycolytic enzymes. Reduced expression of metabolic and biosynthetic genes has been reported in association with advanced aging (35Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Similarly, lower secretion of Epo has been observed in old animals (36Wang R.Y. Tsai S.C. Lu C.C. Shih H.C. Chen Y.H. Tung Y.F. Wang W.F. Wang S.W. Wang P.S. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1996; 51: B434-B438Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in elderly patients (37Nafziger J. Pailla K. Luciani L.

Dammacco F. Blood. 1999; 93: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings of this study thus suggest that an age-dependent defect in HIF-1 action could result in a reduction in the expression of genes that are directly involved in the physiological responses to hypoxia."

Trp1 expression generated a 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG)-activated conductance that was detectable only in Ca2+-free extracellular solution. Trp3 expression gave rise to an OAG-activated conductance that was suppressed but clearly detectable at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. Coexpression of both species resulted in a constitutively active, OAG-sensitive conductance, which exhibited distinctive cation selectivity and high sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular Ca2+. Trp1-expressing cells displayed only modest carbachol-induced Ca2+ entry and lacked OAG-induced Sr2+ entry, whereas Trp3-expressing cells responded to both agents with a substantial divalent cation entry. Coexpression of Trp1 plus Trp3 suppressed carbachol-induced Ca2+ entry compared with Trp3 expression and abolished OAG-induced Sr2+ entry signals. We concluded that coassembly of Trp1 and Trp3 resulted in the formation of oligomeric Trp channels that are subject to regulation by phospholipase C and Ca2+.

Trp1 and Trp-related genes, originally cloned from Drosophila melanogaster (1Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 2Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron. 1992; 8: 631-642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), have been suggested to encode ion channel proteins that function in terms of a link between cellular phospholipase C activity and cation transport across the plasma membrane (3Zhu X.

Nature. 1999; 396 (b): 478-482Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The ability of mammalian Trp proteins to produce cation conductances has been demonstrated in a number of heterologous expression systems. Some Trp species were found capable of forming highly Ca2+-selective channels, which may provide the basis of Ca2+ entry and refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores after IP3-mediated store depletion (7Philipp S. Cavalie A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 8Warnat J. Philipp S. Zimmer S. Flockerzi V. Cavalie A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, other Trp isoforms appear to form rather nonselective cation channels that allow permeation of both mono- and divalent cations (9Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Lückhoff A. Schultz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 10Sinkins W.G. Estacion M. Schilling P. Biochem.

( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These nonselective, Trp-mediated conductances are likely to play a significant physiological role not only because of their substantial impact on membrane potential and homeostasis of monovalent ions such as Na+ but also because of a small but nonetheless detectable Ca2+ entry mediated by these ion channels (9Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Lückhoff A. Schultz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 10Sinkins W.G. Estacion M.

J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Albeit receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C is unequivocally a key event in cellular regulation of Trp channels, the different species appear to be linked to this event via divergent mechanisms. For Trp3, a direct conformational coupling to activated IP3 receptors has recently been demonstrated (4Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1999; 396 (b): 478-482Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar), whereas other species such Trp1, -4, and -5 appear to be sensitive to depletion of the cellular Ca2+ stores without activation of the IP3 receptor (7Philipp S. Cavalie A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 8Warnat J. Philipp S. Zimmer S.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Alternatively, activation by diacylglycerols has been suggested as a central mechanism of regulation for Trp3 and related species such as Trp6 (5Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of individual Trp isoforms results in the formation of cation channels that display divergent regulatory and biophysical properties. The cation channels produced by overexpression of a Trp isoform are considered to be multimeric, probably tetrameric, complexes based on the current models of Trp channel structure (13Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The existence of heteromultimeric Trp channels in tissues that express multiple isoforms appears likely because of a recent report demonstrating strong protein-protein interactions between Trp1 and Trp3 proteins in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 expression system (14Xu X.-Z.S. Li H.-S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, the latter study provided evidence for a substantial modification of the conductance provided by Drosophila Trp in conditions that favor coassembly of Drosophila Trp and Trp-like (Trp1) proteins.The present study was designed to investigate the functional consequences of hetero-oligomerization of two mammalian Trp species,i.e. hTrp1 and hTrp3. We present evidence for functional interaction of Trp1 and Trp3 proteins, resulting in the formation of a heteromultimeric cation channel of distinct biophysical and regulatory properties.DISCUSSIONThe present study suggests that hetero-oligomerization is a crucial determinant of Trp channel function and regulation. We observed that coexpression of the Trp1 and the Trp3 isoform resulted in the formation of cation channels that exhibited distinctive biophysical and regulatory properties. It is suggested that hetero-oligomerization determines the function and physiological role of Trp cation channels in tissues that express multiple Trp isoforms.Regulation of Trp1 and Trp3 Channels in HEK293 CellsTrp proteins currently appear as most attractive candidates for cation channels that mediate capacitative Ca2+ entry,i.e. Ca2+-permeable channels that are activated in response to a depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (20Putney J.W. McKay R.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). All mammalian Trp isoforms are apparently sensitive to activation via the phospholipase C/IP3/store depletion pathway. The molecular mechanism of channel activation in response to stimulation of phospholipase C may vary for different Trp species and is likely to involve interaction of the channels with activated IP3receptors (4Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X.

( Lond. ). 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Trp3 has been reported to provide some constitutive activity and to be activated both by IP3 (4Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L.

Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The available reports on regulatory properties of Trp1 are highly discrepant. Expression of Trp1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells was reported to provide a cation conductance that is sensitive to store depletion by thapsigargin as well as IP3 (9Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Lückhoff A. Schultz G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1189-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Trp1 channels expressed in Sf9 cells, in contrast, were found to be constitutively active but insensitive to store depletion (10Sinkins W.G. Estacion M. Schilling P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our present experiments with HEK293 cells overexpressing Trp1 showed that this Trp species failed to produce any constitutively active conductance and was barely sensitive to passive store depletion in this expression system. Similarly, active depletion of Ca2+ stores by intracellular administration of IP3 did not promote Trp1 currents. For Trp3, recent evidence suggests that IP3 receptors play a pivotal role in activation of these Trp channels (4Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the present study, intracellular administration of IP3 exerted only modest effects on the membrane currents in Trp3-expressing HEK293 cells. The reason for this low IP3 sensitivity of Trp3 in the present study is unclear. Our results suggest that the channel derived by overexpression of both Trp species in HEK293 cells is barely sensitive to passive as well as active store depletion.Nonetheless, Trp1 as well as Trp3 expression gave rise to a marked diacylglycerol-sensitive cation conductance in HEK293. Large OAG-induced currents were observed in all Trp3- and Trp1-expressing cells when measurements were performed in nominally Ca2+-free solution. Activation of the Trp3/6 subfamily by diacylglycerols has recently been demonstrated, whereas Trp1 was suggested to be insensitive to diacylglycerols (5Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that OAG-induced activation of Trp1 currents was unequivocally detectable in the HEK293 expression system. This discrepancy is well explained by the fact that so far activation by diacylglycerols of Trp currents was studied exclusively in the presence of divalent cations (5Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In the present study, OAG-induced activation of Trp1 currents was observed only when extracellular Ca2+was reduced to low micromolar levels (nominally Ca2+-free). Thus we present for the first time evidence for OAG sensitivity of the Trp1 protein, demonstrating that Trp1 and Trp3 share the principle property of activation by diacylglycerols. These results also suggest that the elucidation of the ion channel function of Trp proteins requires a careful analysis of the Ca2+ sensitivity of these channels and that Trp channel activity may easily be missed because of unfavorable experimental conditions.So far, Ca2+ ions have been reported to exert variable effects on Trp channel function (8Warnat J.

Physiol. 1994; 103: 409-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, inhibition of Trp currents by extracellular divalents is a commonly observed phenomenon. In the present study, Trp1- and Trp3-mediated conductances were substantially inhibited in the presence of physiological levels of Ca2+. Trp1 currents were completely occluded in Ca2+-containing solutions, whereas Trp3 currents showed a tendency to recover slowly after elevation of extracellular Ca2+ to physiological levels. This phenomenon was prominent when a low intracellular Ca2+ buffer capacity was used and may be explained by an as yet unidentified Ca2+-dependent cellular mechanism that promotes Trp3 activity. A similar phenomenon has recently been reported for the structurally related Trp7 protein (18Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and a permissive role of intracellular Ca2+ in Trp3 activation has been discussed (12Kamouchi M. Philipp S. Flockerzi V.

Thus, Trp1 and Trp3 channels differ in their regulation by Ca2+. It is suggested that an intracellular Ca2+-dependent mechanism up-regulates Trp3-mediated channels and allows for appreciable channel activity at physiological Ca2+ concentrations.Properties of Heteromultimeric Trp1/Trp3 Cation ChannelsProtein-protein interactions between different Trp proteins have recently been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation (14Xu X.-Z.S. Li H.-S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Similarly, an interaction between the Drosophila Trp and Trp1 proteins has been reported, and this Trp/Trp1 hetero-oligomerization was found to result in the generation of cation channels with unique properties (14Xu X.-Z.S. Li H.-S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A coexpression of multiple Trp species has been observed in various mammalian tissues (15Groschner K. Hingel S. Lintschinger B. Balzer M. Romanin C. Zhu X. Schreibmayer W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Chang A.S. Chang S.M. Garcia R.L. Schilling W.P.

Thus, it appears reasonable to speculate that specific membrane conductances in these tissues are based on heteromultimeric Trp complexes. In this study, we obtained evidence for a profound functional consequence of Trp1/Trp3 hetero-oligomerization. The membrane conductance of cells that overexpressed both Trp species exhibited properties distinctly different from the membrane conductance of cells that overexpressed only a single species. In striking contrast to Trp1 or Trp3 channels, Trp1/Trp3 channels displayed a high constitutive activity that was inhibited by extracellular Ca2+. Thus, coexpression of Trp1 plus Trp3 resulted in a significant Ca2+-dependent basal cation conductance that was not obtained by overexpression of either isoform alone. The Trp1/3 conductance was clearly sensitive to stimulation by the diacylglycerol OAG and inhibited by physiological levels of extracellular Ca2+. Experiments with different intracellular Ca2+ buffer systems showed that strong intracellular Ca2+ buffering slightly suppressed Trp3 currents but clearly promoted Trp1/3 currents. Trp1/3 currents were significantly facilitated when intracellular Ca2+ was strongly buffered with BAPTA as compared with experiments in which EGTA was used. It is of importance to note that the calculated free Ca2+ levels were in both cases below 10 nm. Because regulation of the channels at such low Ca2+concentration appears rather unlikely, it is tempting to speculate that the regulation takes place in proximity to the inner mouth of the Trp channel where local Ca2+ concentration may be considerably higher upon channel opening and Ca2+ entry. Subplasmalemmal Ca2+ levels may rise to levels significantly higher than those calculated for the buffer systems, and the dynamic changes in subplasmalemmal Ca2+ are expected to be buffered better with BAPTA than with EGTA. A summary on the observed Ca2+dependence of Trp3 and Trp1/3 channels together with average membrane currents recorded at different intra- and extracellular Ca2+ is shown in Fig. 10. We suggest that a tight regulatory cross-talk exists between intra- and extracellular Ca2+ at Trp channel proteins. The coassembly of Trp1 and Trp3 appears to eliminate the permissive effect of intracellular Ca2+ on Trp3 homomultimers and in turn generates additional sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular Ca2+. The regulation of Trp channels by both extracellular and subplasmalemmal Ca2+ may represent a crucial determinant of the physiological role of a specific type of Trp channel. Although it is tempting to speculate that inhibitory as well as permissive effects of Ca2+ may be based on a direct interaction of Ca2+ with the channel proteins, other mechanisms involving more indirect and complex Ca2+-dependent regulation of the channels cannot be excluded at present.In line with a number of previous reports on the permeability properties of Trp channels, Trp1/3 channels proved to be nonselective in that they allow for membrane currents carried by various mono- and divalent cations (9Zitt C.

Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, we calculated Na+/Cs+ permeability ratios for Trp1 and Trp3 channels that were approximately 1.5 (10Sinkins W.G. Estacion M. Schilling P. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Kamouchi M. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. Wissenbach U. Mamin A. Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 518: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, Trp1/3 currents displayed a significantly different (more positive) reversal potential than Trp3 currents, and a Na+/Cs+ permeability ratio of 2.6 was calculated. This result indicates that coassembly of the different isoforms results in a modest but significant change of the permeability properties, probably because of a significant modification of the pore structure in Trp heteromultimers.Physiological Significance of the Hetero-oligomerization of Trp ProteinsIt appears important to note that the observed Trp1/3 currents do not perfectly resemble any nonselective cation current that has so far been described in native tissues. Nonetheless, this type of current, which is sensitive to activation by diacylglycerol and to facilitation by low subplasmalemmal Ca2+ concentrations, may contribute to agonist-induced activation of excitable as well nonexcitable cells even at current densities much lower than those obtained in the HEK293 expression system. In cells that exhibit a high input resistance even small inward currents are sufficient to cause profound changes in membrane potential and to affect cellular functions because of activation of voltage-dependent ion channels and/or ion exchange mechanisms. Thus, Trp heteromultimers may in principle serve in regulation of cell functions even at low levels of expression that give rise to small agonist-regulated, nonselective ion conductances.The relation between such nonselective cation conductances and cellular Ca2+ signals is highly complex because of the simultaneous impact of nonselective cation conductances on a variety of factors that govern Ca2+ entry, such as Ca2+ permeability, intracellular Na+ concentration, and membrane potential. Our observation that overexpression of Trp1 in cells that also express Trp3 results in a gain of negative feedback regulation of Trp channels by intracellular Ca2+ suggests that the formation of Trp1/3 heteromultimers may lead to diminished overall Ca2+ signals during agonist stimulation. Indeed, we observed that carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ entry into HEKTrp1/3 cells was significantly smaller than that into HEKTrp3 cells. Similarly, OAG-induced Sr2+ entry was detectable only in HEKTrp3 cells but not in HEKTrp1/3 cells. This is in line with the observation that OAG-induced Trp1/3 currents were smaller than Trp3 currents when intracellular Ca2+ was buffered moderately and Ca2+ was present in the extracellular solution. By contrast, Trp1/3 inward currents were even larger than Trp3 currents when intracellular Ca2+ was kept low by effective Ca2+ buffering, indicating that the reduced Ca2+ entry into HEKTrp1/3 cells is not because of reduced density of functional channels but rather because of altered channel regulation. It is tempting to speculate that Trp1/3 channels allow Ca2+ entry only when subplasmalemmal Ca2+ is essentially low, thereby providing a pathway for the refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores at low cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that a reduction of the overall intracellular Ca2+ signal is not necessarily associated with blunted regulation of cellular functions (25Teubl M. Groschner K. Kohlwein S.D. Mayer B. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29529-29535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Even a modest entry of Na+ ions may well be sufficient to depolarize the cell and/or to elevate subplasmalemmal Ca2+ because of Na+/Ca2+ exchange despite detectable elevation of overall Ca2+ (25Teubl M.

Graier W.F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 524: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus the physiological role of specific Trp channels, which depend on the biophysical and regulatory properties, remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, the present results unequivocally demonstrate that the isoform expression pattern of Trp protein is a crucial determinant of both the biophysical and regulatory properties of Trp cation channels. We suggest that a considerable variability of Trp channel function and consequently of the physiological roles of these channels may arise from the formation of hetero-oligomers of variable properties.In summary, we observed that coexpression of Trp1 and Trp3 proteins in HEK293 cells generates a membrane conductance of unique regulatory as well as biophysical properties. Our results suggest that coassembly of different mammalian Trp species into multimeric channel complexes creates cation channel properties that are substantially different from those of the individual Trp species. So far, Trp channels have been characterized extensively by separate overexpression of specific isoforms, and the results were interpreted in terms of physiological relevance of these Trp species. However, these experiments may provide only a small amount of information on the physiological role of a specific Trp isoform because physiological Trp channels may be heteromultimers depending on the isoform expression pattern of a given tissue. Trp1/3 hetero-oligomerization creates a nonselective cation permeability that is tightly controlled by both phospholipase C activity and the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level and may play a physiological role by providing an important negative feedback control of Trp function. Receptor-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C is associated with various alterations in cellular cation conductances. Trp1 and Trp-related genes, originally cloned from Drosophila melanogaster (1Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 2Phillips A.M.

Nucleotide excision repair plays some role in the repair of DNA cross-links caused by psoralens and other agents. However, in mammalian cells there is evidence that the ERCC1-XPF nuclease has a specialized additional function during interstrand DNA cross-link repair, beyond its role in nucleotide excision repair. We placed a psoralen monoadduct or interstrand cross-link in a duplex, 4–6 bases from a junction with unpaired DNA. ERCC1-XPF endonucleolytically cleaved within the duplex on either side of the adduct, on the strand having an unpaired 3′ tail. Cross-links that were cleaved only on the 5′ side were purified and reincubated with ERCC1-XPF. A second cleavage was then observed on the 3′ side. Relevant partially unwound structures near a cross-link may be expected to arise frequently, for example at stalled DNA replication forks. The results show that the single enzyme ERCC1-XPF can release one arm of a cross-link and suggest a novel mechanism for interstrand cross-link repair.

These enzymes specifically cleave DNA near junctions between single-stranded and duplex DNA in cases where the single strand has a 5′→3′ polarity as it moves away from the junction (1Bardwell A.J.

The ability of these enzymes to cut such bubble, flap, and Y structures is necessary for many DNA transactions. In mammalian cells, the heterodimeric ERCC1-XPF nuclease is formed by tight association of ERCC1 and XPF subunits (2Sijbers A.M. de Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.-F. Moggs J.G.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 uses this nuclease to cleave a damaged DNA strand on the 5′ side of an opened “bubble” intermediate formed around a lesion. Some strategies for repair of DNA double-stranded breaks in S. cerevisiae involve the use of Rad1-Rad10, sometimes in a complex with Msh2 and Msh3 (5Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases the nuclease aids in resolution of recombination intermediates by clipping off nonhomologous 3′ single-stranded tails. InDrosophila, the XPF homolog mei9 is implicated in meiotic recombination (6Sekelsky J.J. McKim K.S. Chin G.M. Hawley R.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 619-627PubMed Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the XPF homolog rad16 (swi9) and ERCC1 homolog swi10 are involved in the recombination events that lead to mating-type switching (7Carr A. Schmidt H. Kirchhoff S. Muriel W. Sheldrick K. Griffiths D. Basmacioglu C. Subramani S. Clegg M. Nasim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2029-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NER-defective cells are sensitive to agents such as psoralen, which causes interstrand DNA cross-links (8Kaye J. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 696-702PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond its participation in NER, however, ERCC1-XPF appears to have an additional role in the repair of interstrand DNA cross-links. It is known, for example, that ERCC1-defective and many XP group F cells are much more sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents than are other NER mutants (9Hoy C. Thompson L. Mooney C. Salazar E. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1737-1743PubMed Google Scholar, 10Busch D.B. van Vuuren H. de Wit J. Collins A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mitchell D.L. Brookman K.W. Stefanini M. Riboni R. Thompson L.H. Albert R.B. van Gool A.J. Hoeijmakers J. Mutat. Res. 1997; 383: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the mechanism of repair of interstrand DNA cross-links. A number of pathways for cross-link repair can be envisaged. One possibility would mirror the model of Cole (11Cole R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) for cross-link repair in Escherichia coli, which involves sequential NER and homologous recombination steps. A comparable model in mammalian cells would not account for the additional role of ERCC1-XPF in cross-link repair beyond any function in NER. An alternative possibility is that ERCC1-XPF participates in a pathway in which it clips off strands with 3′ tails, arising for example from recombination intermediates following introduction of double-strand breaks on either side of a cross-link. However, the action of ERCC1-XPF on DNA structures containing a cross-link is an unexplored area. Here we studied the action of ERCC1-XPF on oligonucleotides containing a specifically located interstrand psoralen-DNA cross-link and found that the enzyme has an unexpected ability to cleave DNA on both sides of a psoralen cross-link, suggesting a novel mechanism for initiation of cross-link repair. The XPF and ERCC1genes were expressed as a dicistronic construct from pET30b. XPF had an N-terminal His tag and was expressed before ERCC1 with a C-terminal His tag. E. coli BL21 (DE3)recA host cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 oC for 22 h. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3). Clarified supernatant was loaded on a column of nickel-agarose in buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl and 5 mm imidazole, and ERCC1-XPF eluted in a gradient from 25–400 mm imidazole. CHAPS was added to 0.02%, and pooled fractions were concentrated on a Centriprep 50 and loaded onto an S-200 column in buffer B (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.01% CHAPS, and 0.02% NaN3). Pooled fractions were dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.5 mKCl and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and loaded on a Talon column. The column was eluted with a 10–500 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer. Pooled fractions were concentrated, dialyzed into buffer A plus 50 mm KCl and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and loaded on an fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column. The column was eluted with a gradient from 50 to 350 mm KCl. Peak fractions were diluted to 50 mmKCl in the above buffer, loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono S column, and eluted with a gradient from 50 to 350 mm KCl. Glycerol was added to 50%, and purified fractions were stored at −80 oC (37.5 μg/ml). A 26-mer with the sequence shown in Fig. 2 A was synthesized with a furan-side psoralen-thymine monoadduct at position 11 by using the psoralen-thymine phosphoramidite precursor described previously (12Kobertz W.R. Essigmann J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5960-5961Crossref Google Scholar). As the amount of available precursor was limited, the same adducted 26-mer was annealed to the different complementary strands shown. Cross-links were created by irradiation with 48 kJ m−2 from Sylvania black light bulbs (F15W/350BL-T8) at a dose rate of 80 J m−2 s−1. Cross-links were reversed with 254 nm (peak) irradiation with a dose of 5 kJ m−2. Standard reaction mixtures (15 μl) contained 1 fmol of DNA labeled either at the 5′ terminus with polynucleotide kinase and γ-[32P]ATP or at the 3′ terminus with terminal transferase and α-[32P]ddATP. The indicated amount of ERCC1-XPF was added, in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for 90 min at 30 oC, fragments were separated on a denaturing 14% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was analyzed using a PhosphorImager. ERCC1-XPF enzyme was purified in recombinant form as a complex of its two subunits (Fig. 1 A). The complex produced in E. coli is functional and can correct the nucleotide excision repair defect of XPF-defective human cell extracts (data not shown). Native ERCC1-XPF enzyme from HeLa cells was found to cleave a stem-loop structure near the 5′ junction between loop and stem (2Sijbers A.M. de Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.-F. Moggs J.G. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. de Jong M.C. Rademakers S. de Rooij J. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Wood R.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), and this same pattern of cleavage was observed for recombinant enzyme (Fig. 1 B). It is noteworthy that although ERCC1-XPF can cleave Y structures (3de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7835-7842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) it does not require a free 3′ single-stranded end for cleavage. To study the ability of ERCC1-XPF to cleave near a psoralen adduct, a 26-mer oligonucleotide was synthesized containing a furan-side psoralen monoadduct on thymine residue 11 (Fig.2 A). This strand was 5′-labeled with 32P and annealed to a complementary oligonucleotide to give the structure DS-MA (Fig. 2 A) or to a partially complementary oligonucleotide, forming the structure Y1-MA with a 12-base pair (bp) duplex region and a 3′ single-stranded tail (Fig. 2 C). ERCC1-XPF could cleave the Y structure containing a monoadduct, cutting within the duplex near the junction. The main cleavage site was 3 phosphodiester bonds away from the junction, releasing a labeled 9-mer (Fig. 2 D, left). This same major cleavage site was observed for a Y substrate without a psoralen adduct (not shown). Cleavage was dependent on the Y structure, as a fully duplex molecule containing a monoadduct was not cleaved (Fig. 2 B, left). The psoralen monoadduct was located in a 5′-TA-3′ sequence (Fig.2 A) and was convertible to a cross-link by irradiation with near-UV light (12Kobertz W.R. Essigmann J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5960-5961Crossref Google Scholar), which converted about 90% of the duplexes to a cross-linked form. The purified cross-linked DNA migrated more slowly on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 B,right). Several bands are often observed with cross-links, probably reflecting different possible conformations of denatured arms. DNA Y1-CL containing the single cross-link was also cleaved by ERCC1-XPF at the same 5′ position as the monoadduct, with some minor cleavage products slightly further from the junction (Fig.2 D, right). DNA containing a cross-link in the absence of a junction was not cleaved by the enzyme (Fig.2 B, right). Only the strand having the 3′-unpaired tail was cleaved, as shown by labeling the opposite strand with 32P at the 5′ terminus (Fig. 2 E). ERCC1-XPF cleavage of the cross-link (Fig.2 F, lanes 1–3) produced a slow migrating labeled product (Fig. 2 F, bracket) but no labeled short products. An identical set of reaction products was irradiated with UVC (peak 254 nm) light after ERCC1-XPF cleavage, a procedure that efficiently reverses the psoralen cross-link back to monoadduct form (12Kobertz W.R. Essigmann J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5960-5961Crossref Google Scholar). The labeled slower migrating products disappeared (Fig.2 F, lanes 4–6), confirming that they arose from cross-linking of the intact labeled strand with a cleaved unlabeled strand. Y1 DNA containing a cross-link was actually cleaved more efficiently than the same DNA with a monoadduct, suggesting that the stabilization of the duplex part of the structure by the cross-link favors recognition or cleavage. These results show that, surprisingly, a cross-link between the cutting site and the junction does not prevent ERCC1-XPF cleavage at the correct position. We next asked whether cleavage could occur on the 3′ side of a psoralen adduct. Structure Y3 was formed by annealing the 5′-labeled strand with the psoralen monoadduct to a partial complement, giving a 17-bp duplex with 6 bp between the adduct and the junction (Fig. 3 A). Two main cleavage sites were observed when this structure contained a monoadduct (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6). One was 3 phosphodiester bonds 5′ to the adduct, at the same sequence seen with structure Y1, releasing a labeled 9-mer. The second site was located 3 phosphodiester bonds on the 3′ side of the adduct (4 phosphodiester bonds from the junction), releasing a labeled 13-mer. This shows that ERCC1-XPF is capable of cutting on either side of a monoadduct in Y structures. With a psoralen cross-link, two types of ERCC1-XPF cleavage products were also observed. One type resulted from cleavage 3 or 4 bonds 5′ to the furan side of the cross-link, at the same position observed with the Y3-MA monoadduct substrate. The second type were slow migrating species (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–12,bracket), hypothesized to be products of cleavage on the 3′ side of the cross-link. To verify this notion, an identical set of reaction products was irradiated with UVC (peak 254 nm) light after ERCC1-XPF cleavage to reverse the psoralen cross-link back to monoadduct form. This reversal liberated a 13-nt product, demonstrating cleavage on the 3′ side of the cross-link, closer to the junction (Fig.3 B, lanes 13–18). To confirm the identity of these cleavage sites, the strand with the 3′-single-stranded tail was labeled with 32P at the 3′ terminus (Fig. 3 D). ERCC1-XPF cleavage of this cross-linked Y3-CL substrate gave a 13-nt product from cleavage at the expected position on the 3′ side of the cross-link and a slower-migrating product, presumably arising from cleavage on the 5′ side of the cross-link (Fig. 3 E, left). Reversal of the cross-link by UVC irradiation converted the slower migrating product to a 17-mer, the expected size for cleavage on the 5′ side of the cross-link (Fig. 3 E, right). We note that with these Y structures, ERCC1-XPF cleavage is endonucleolytic, with little or no exonuclease activity. Some cleavage on the 3′ side of monoadducts or cross-links was also observed with a structure designated Y2, formed by annealing the same labeled oligonucleotide with a complement to give a 14-bp duplex where the adduct was only 4 bp from the junction. The extent of 3′ cleavage was less than with structure Y3 (data not shown). It was significant that with higher ERCC1-XPF enzyme concentration there was a decrease in yield of labeled 3′ cleavage product and a continuing increase in labeled 5′ cleavage product arising from cross-linked Y3 molecules (Fig. 3 C). This suggested that some molecules were being cleaved twice, on both the 3′ and 5′ sides of the cross-link. This possibility was tested in the next set of experiments. The cross-linked products bracketed in Fig. 3 B were excised from a polyacrylamide gel and reincubated with ERCC1-XPF. Significantly, this second treatment with ERCC1-XPF generated 9-mers (Fig. 3 F, lane 2). This result demonstrates that ERCC1-XPF can cleave the same Y structure molecule on both the 3′ and 5′ sides of an interstrand cross-link. Without enzyme, two other bands appeared after purification (Fig. 3 F, lane 1). One was a small amount of 13-mer, resulting from a limited amount of spontaneous cross-link reversal during isolation of the intermediates. The second was a 26-mer, probably arising as a minor contaminant during the purification. Two possible models for repair of an interstrand cross-link are presented in Fig. 4. Part A shows a model involving a sequence of NER events and homologous recombination. The essential features of this model were originally proposed by Cole (11Cole R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) for repair of psoralen interstrand cross-links by E. coli. It is consistent with the genetic dependence of repair in that system and with reconstruction of this pathway with purifiedE. coli enzymes (13Van Houten B. Gamper H. Holbrook S.R. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8077-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Cheng S. Van Houten B. Gamper H.B. Sancar A. Hearst J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6755-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, attempts to visualize first NER incision at an interstrand cross-link as in Fig. 4(ii) have been unsuccessful (16Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6822-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although NER incisions can occur flanking a psoralen-thymine monoadduct (17Svoboda D.L. Taylor J.S. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1931-1936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In part B, a model incorporating the ability of ERCC1-XPF to cleave on either side of a cross-link is shown. A single-strand/duplex junction near the cross-link could be created by several mechanisms, for example at a stalled replication fork, elongating transcription complex, or by action of a DNA helicase. Digestion of the bottom strand in Fig. 4 B, (i) by a 5′→3′ exonuclease would also create a single-strand/duplex junction. Consequently such opened structures at a cross-link may be expected to occur frequently, and these would not be a substrate for repair by the NER pathway, which requires duplex DNA. However, the ERCC1-XPF enzyme could cleave the junction on the 3′ side of the cross-link (Fig. 4 B, (ii)). Next, as shown here, ERCC1-XPF could cleave on the 5′ side (Fig. 4 B, (iii)), perhaps facilitated by further unwinding. The net effect would be to release one arm of the cross-link. This intermediate is poised for a second step of recombination with a homologous sequence, after which the other arm of the former cross-link could be removed by NER. Attractions of this model are that there is no loss of genetic information and that it directly involves the unique properties of ERCC1-XPF in repair of a cross-link. A homologous recombination step is consistent with genetic evidence for the involvement of XRCC2 and XRCC3 in cross-link repair in mammalian cells (18Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 19Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two proteins of the RAD51 homologous pairing protein family. Other models are also possible, for example a scheme involving recombination repair by a single strand annealing pathway. A double-strand break on either side of a cross-link could remove it. Exonuclease digestion followed by annealing between partly homologous sequences could produce 3′ tails for processing by ERCC1-XPF, extrapolating from properties of the homologous Rad1-Rad10 enzyme ofS. cerevisiae. However, if two double strand breaks are required to remove cross-linked DNA, deletion of the intervening DNA would often cause loss of genetic information in mammalian cells. The pathway in Fig. 4 B is also consistent with the following observations. First, ERCC1 and some XPF cell lines are more sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking agents than any other NER-deficient cell lines. Second, cells from ERCC1-deficient mice show a reduced frequency of S phase-dependent illegitimate chromosome exchange (20Melton D. Ketchen A.M. Núñez F. Bonatti-Abbondandolo S. Abbondandolo A. Squires S. Johnson R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ERCC1-XPF is important to maintain correctly operating replication forks in S phase. The interaction of ERCC1-XPF with the single-stranded DNA binding replication protein A may be important in this regard (21de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Finally, studies of deletion formation in ERCC1 knockout cells (22Sargent R.G. Rolig R.L. Kilburn A.E. Adair G.M. Wilson J.H. Nairn R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13122-13127Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggest that the ERCC1 gene product is normally involved in a pathway leading to nonmutagenic processing of heteroduplex intermediates in recombination.

The 1946 Nankaido earthquake was unusual, with a rupture zone estimated from long-period geodetic data that was more than twice as large as that derived from shorter period seismic data. In the center of this earthquake rupture zone, we used densely deployed ocean bottom seismographs to detect a subducted seamount 13 kilometers thick by 50 kilometers wide at a depth of 10 kilometers.

Directional locomotion requires locally confined membrane protrusion driven by actin polymerization, resulting in the formation of a leading edge. Adhesion to the extracellular matrix is mediated by distinct multi-protein complexes. The formation of these focal adhesions is initiated by the activation of integrin heterodimers, which then recruit a variety of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules (1Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Most of the cytoskeletal components involved, e.g. talin, α-actinin, and vinculin, are multi-ligand proteins. They may function as structural scaffolds for other cytoskeletal and signaling proteins or interact directly with the actin cytoskeleton. Given the complexity of focal adhesions, actin dynamics at these sites is not completely understood, and the final integration of integrin-mediated signaling with de novo actin polymerization remains to be elucidated. Several lines of evidence have implicated the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)1 to be involved in the regulation of filament assembly and organization. VASP was originally purified from human platelets (2Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It belongs to a protein family including the Drosophila protein Enabled (Ena), its mammalian homologue Mena, and the Ena-VASP-like protein (Evl) (3Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). They all share a common domain structure comprising a central proline-rich core flanked by two highly conserved Ena-VASP homology domains (EVH1 and EVH2; Fig. 1and Ref. 3Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar).

The central region of Ena/VASP proteins harbors proline-rich stretches that are recognized by the G-actin-binding protein profilin (3Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). VASP oligomerization and F-actin binding are confined to the C-terminal EVH2 domain (3Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M.

VASP may thus control the actin cytoskeleton by three different mechanisms: (i) it may recruit G-actin via its binding to profilin, (ii) it may stabilize and possibly organize newly formed filaments by direct binding to F-actin, and (iii) oligomerization may potentiate both effects.Figure 1Murine VASP structure, ligand binding, and phosphorylation sites. VASP consists of a central proline-rich domain (PR) that is flanked by two Ena-VASP homology domains (EVH1 and EVH2). The EVH1 domain binds to zyxin, vinculin, and the bacterial surface protein ActA, whereas binding to profilin involves three GP5 motifs (shaded boxes) located in the proline-rich region. VASP oligomerization and F-actin binding is confined to the EVH2 domain. Phosphorylation sites for the cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases PKA and PKG are located in the proline-rich region (S153) and the EVH2 domain (S235 and T274). The preferences described for each kinase in vitro (11Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are indicated by the thickness of the arrows; Ser153 is preferentially phosphorylated by PKA, whereas Ser235 is the preferred phosphorylation site for PKG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) VASP is highly enriched in platelets (10Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and it is phosphorylated in response to vasodilators and platelet inhibitors, substances that raise intracellular cAMP and cGMP levels. VASP has been shown to be an immediate target for PKA and PKG in vitro and in vivo (11Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its phosphorylation correlates with the inhibition of platelet aggregation (12Horstrup K. Jablonka B. Honig-Liedl P. Just M. Kochsiek K. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These data are further supported by genetic analyses from VASP knockout mice that display enhanced agonist-induced platelet aggregation (13Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Ahmad M. Glauner M. Zhou X.H. Ny L. Andersson K.E. Kehrel B. Offermanns S. Fassler R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 14Hauser W. Knobeloch K.P. Eigenthaler M. Gambaryan S. Krenn V. Geiger J.

How platelet inhibition is mediated by VASP is currently unknown, but phosphorylation seems to be a key factor. VASP is phosphorylated in vitro and in intact human platelets at three residues by both PKA and PKG (11Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to residues Ser153, Ser235, and Thr274 in murine VASP (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All three phosphorylation sites are positioned close to ligand-binding modules (Fig. 1): Ser153 is located N-terminal to the (GP5)3 motif in the proline-rich region that has been shown to bind to profilin (15Lambrechts A. Verschelde J.L. Jonckheere V. Goethals M. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the EVH2 domain, Ser235 and Thr274 neighbor basic stretches that seem to mediate VASP-actin interactions (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hence the ligand binding properties of VASP may significantly be altered by phosphorylation. So far, VASP-ligand interactions and VASP phosphorylation have mainly been investigated separately, yielding little information about how these two are related. The aim of the present study was to directly analyze the influence of phosphorylation on VASP-ligand complex formation. Recombinant VASP was phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and tested in different assays for actin binding, oligomerization, and the interaction with its known ligands profilin, vinculin and zyxin. These experiments reveal that VASP phosphorylation by PKA diminishes binding to F-actin and even suppresses actin nucleation, whereas oligomerization and ligand binding remain unaffected. Our data lead to a model in which phosphorylation serves as a direct regulatory switch for VASP-mediated actin polymerization at adhesion sites. Cloning of murine VASP and its EVH1 and EVH2 domains has already been reported (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The constructs comprising either EVH domain and the proline-rich domain (EVH1-P; P-EVH2) were generated accordingly by polymerase chain reaction using full-length VASP as a template. Amplification primers introducedEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites for further cloning into the following vectors: pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for the generation of recombinant His-tagged proteins in bacteria, pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for expression of EGFP fusion proteins in eukaryotic cells, and a derivative of pcDNA3 (CLONTECH) bearing a sequence tag derived from birch profilin (BiPro-tag) (16Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to yield sequence-tagged proteins for immunoprecipitation experiments from HeLa cells. To mimic phosphorylation, VASP constructs were generated, in which Ser153, Ser235, and Thr274 were replaced by acidic residues. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to manufacturer's instructions using the Quick-change kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). First, single phospho-mutants (S153D, S235D, and T274E) were generated using the following primer pairs: 5′-GGAGCGCCGGGTCGACAATGCAGGAGGCCCACC-3′ (S153Dfwd); 5′-GGTGGGCCTCCTGCATTGTCGACCCGGCGCTCC-3′ (S153rev); 5′-CAAACTCAGGAAAGTGGACAAGCAGGAGGAGGCC-3′ (S235Dfwd); 5′-GGCCTCCTCCTGCTTGTCCACTTTCCTGAGTTTG-3′ (S235Drev); 5′-GGAGAAGAAAAGCCGAACAGGTTGGGGAGAAG-3′ (T274fwd); and 5′-CTTCTCCCCAACCTGTTCGGCTTTTCTTCTCCC-3′ (T274rev). After sequencing, these constructs were further altered via additional site-directed mutagenesis to yield double mutants and the triple mutant. Murine VASP and its derivatives were expressed in the Escherichia colistrain M15(pREP4). Bacteria were transformed with VASP expression vectors (pQE30) and were grown in 2× YT medium at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced in late log phase with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were harvested after 3 h post-induction. Recombinant proteins were purified essentially as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Protein elution was achieved by a stepwise histidine gradient (20, 30, 40, 50, and 150 mm) in VASP elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm benzamidine, 20 μmleupeptin, 50 μm Pefabloc SC, 1 μmpepstatin A, and 20 units/ml aprotinin). All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. VASP containing fractions with 70% purity as judged by densitometric analysis (E.A.S.Y. RH apparatus, E.A.S.Y. Image Plus Software; Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany) were transferred into 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.75 mmdithioerythritol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (see above). 2–3 mg of VASP were purified from 1 liter of bacterial culture by this method. VASP proteins were stored in sodium phosphate buffer with 20% glycerol added at −80 °C for up to 2 months. Recombinant mouse profilin I and II (17Witke W. Podtelejnikov A.V. Di Nardo A. Sutherland J.D. Gurniak C.B. Dotti C. Mann M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 967-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) were purified by poly-l-proline affinity chromatography as described previously (18Schluter K. Schleicher M. Jockusch B.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3261-3273PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications: profilin I and profilin II were eluted in 6 and 8 m urea, respectively. Proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.2 mmCaCl2, and 1.25 mm dithiothreitol. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an additional gel filtration step as described (20Giehl K. Valenta R. Rothkegel M. Ronsiek M. Mannherz H.G. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified VASP (3.75 μm) was incubated at 30 °C in buffer A (50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm pepstatin A). For radioactive assays, buffer A was supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP yielding a specific activity of 100 Ci/mol ATP. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 0.5 μm catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega, Madison, WI) and stopped at times indicated with 25 μm PKA inhibitor (Promega). Radiolabeled VASP was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and phosphate incorporation was visualized by autoradiography using BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For quantitative analysis, gel pieces containing VASP were excised from the gel and measured by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation analyzer (Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter, EG&G Berthold, Isernhagen, Germany). One-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis on thin layer cellulose plates (Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany) was performed in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid and 7.8% glacial acetic acid) essentially as described in Ref. 21Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar. Phospho-serine and phospho-threonine (Sigma) were used as internal standards and stained with ninhydrin. Radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. The influence of VASP or profilin I or II on actin polymerization was determined by fluorimetry with 10% pyrene-labeled actin (22Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) added to unlabeled actin. Actin polymerization assays were performed essentially as described (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 1 μm actin was preincubated in the absence or presence of 1 μm profilin I or II, respectively, at 25 °C in buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mm ATP) for 30 min. Polymerization was initiated by adjusting the solution to 25 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 15 mm KCl and adding 0.25 μm VASP protein (wild type, VASP phosphorylated by PKA, or VASP phospho-mutants). Fluorescence was monitored for 1 h at 366 nm excitation (slid width, 10 nm) and 384 nm emission (slid width, 10 nm) using a 150-μl cuvette in an LS50B fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer, Langen, Germany). Co-sedimentation assays were performed essentially as described in Ref. 8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar. 10 μm actin was prepolymerized in buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm ATP, 25 mm NaCl, and 2 mmMgCl2, KCl (15 mm or 50 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. 2 μm F-actin was incubated with 2 μm VASP in buffer C for 1 h at room temperature. After high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min in an Airfuge; Beckman, München, Germany) pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were analyzed densitometrically as described above. The percentage of VASP remaining in the supernatant compared with the total amount of VASP used in the experiment was calculated. In sedimentation assays to test for ternary VASP-profilin-actin complexes, prepolymerization was omitted, and actin filaments were polymerized in the presence of VASP and profilin. 2 μm unlabeled actin was polymerized in buffer C in the presence of 0.5 μm wild type VASP, the triple mutant, and VASP phosphorylated by PKA, respectively, at 37 °C for 1 h. Filaments were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) and directly analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot; Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and the MetaMorph Software package (Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany). Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with a GAL4-based MATCHMAKER System 3 (CLONTECH) with yeast strains HF7C and Y187 according to manufacturer's instructions. VASP constructs were cloned into the “bait” vector pGBKT7 as well as the “prey” vector pGADT7 by use of EcoRI and XhoI/SalI restriction sites in the multiple cloning sites of either vector. A mouse cDNA library (embryonic day 17.5;CLONTECH) was screened using either VASP or the VASP triple mutant as bait. DNA from positive clones was prepared from yeast and transformed into competent E. coli(XL1 blue; Stratagene) according to standard protocols. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM™ 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). C2C12 cells (mouse myogenic cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% calf serum at 10% CO2. 16 h prior to transfection, the cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips. Transfection with EGFP-VASP constructs was achieved by calcium phosphate precipitation according to standard protocols. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde followed by a 30-min permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Actin filaments were stained with coumarin-labeled phalloidin, and vinculin was detected with a monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma). Samples were analyzed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Zeiss) equipped for triple immunofluorescence. Images were taken with a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) using the MetaMorph Software package (Visitron Systems). Immunoprecipitations from HeLa cells using the membrane permeant cross-linker dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] (Pierce) were performed as described (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody against the BiPro sequence (16Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Endogenous proteins were detected after Western blotting with the following antibodies: anti-profilin (2H11) (23Mayboroda O. Schluter K. Jockusch B.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1997; 37: 166-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), anti-vinculin (hVIN-1; Sigma), and antibodies against human VASP and zyxin, which were a kind gift of J. Wehland, Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used for detection by enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The interaction between VASP and both profilin isoforms was monitored by an ELISA assay. Microcolon ELISA plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with 50 pmol of profilin I or II/well, washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After an additional wash with PBS, increasing amounts of recombinant Bipro-tagged VASP were added (0.1–100 pmol in 100 μl of PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated with either profilin I or profilin II for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound VASP was removed by three washing steps (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20). Bound VASP was detected with a monoclonal antibody (4A6) specific for the BiPro-tag derived from birch profilin (16Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Wiedemann P. Giehl K. Almo S.C. Fedorov A.A. Girvin M. Steinberger P. Rudiger M. Ortner M.

After incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated polyvalent anti-mouse secondary antibody, enzymatic activity was measured using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as a substrate at 410 nm using an ELISA reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Billingshurst, UK). To determine the stoichiometry and dissociation constants (K D) of VASP-profilin complexes, surface plasmon resonance studies were performed on a BIACORE 2000 analyzer (Biacore, Uppsla, Sweden). VASP (the ligand) was immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, on a CM5 sensor chip byN-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide chemistry, following the manufacturer's instructions. Profilin I and II (the analytes) were passed over the sensor chip with a flow rate of 10 μl/min at increasing concentrations as indicated. A different flow cell without VASP was used as a reference. Kinetics were analyzed by Biacore evalution software 3.0. The response from the reference cell was substracted from the response of the VASP cell to correct for refractive index changes and nonspecific binding. Thek on and k off values for association and dissociation and RU max, exp(the maximum increase of response units that can be obtained by complete binding of the analyte to the immobilized ligand) were calculated by the software from the association and dissociation phase of the kinetic curve. Best fitting of the data was obtained by assuming a 1:2 complex of VASP to profilin. A global fitting procedure (fitting of k on, k off, andRU max, exp to all measured curves) was used for profilin I, a local fitting was applied for profilin II (fitting of binding data to one curve only). The quality of the obtained binding data was judged by comparing the calculated, fitted curve with the measured curves. An indicator for the differences between the calculated and the measured curves is the chi2 value, which should be <10 for a global and <1 for a local fitting procedure. Furthermore RU max, exp was compared with a therotical RU max, theor value, which was calculated from the amount of VASP coupled to the sensor chip.RU max, theor can be obtained by the formulaRU max, theor=M P/M V·RU coupled·N, where M P = molecular mass profilin (15 kDa),M V = molecular mass VASP (40 kDa),RU coupled = response units of VASP coupled to the sensor chip surface (1045 and 1280 for studies with profilin I and profilin II, respectively), and n = the number of binding sites of VASP for profilin, which is 2 according to data from Ref. 15Lambrechts A.

To analyze VASP phosphorylation by PKA under the experimental conditions chosen (see “Experimental Procedures”), 1 μg of recombinant murine VASP was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were taken after 0.5, 1.5, 3, 10, and 60 min of incubation. The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by addition of excess amounts of the PKA inhibitory peptide. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained gel (Fig.2 A, upper panel) revealed that His-tagged VASP was completely shifted from 50 kDa to an apparent molecular mass of approximately 54 kDa (phospho-VASP), already after 0.5 min. As has been described previously (11Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this shift is caused by phosphorylation of Ser153 in murine or Ser157 in human VASP, respectively, located in the central proline-rich domain of VASP (Fig. 1). Prolonged phosphorylation did not cause additional changes in the electrophoretic mobility, even though an increase in phosphate incorporation was observed by autoradiography (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Protein bands were excised from the gel and phosphate incorporation was analyzed by Cerenkov counting. After 60 min 1.8 mol phosphate/mol VASP had been incorporated (Fig. 2 B). Phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig.2 C) revealed that VASP was mainly phosphorylated at serine residues even though some phospho-threonine was detectable. These results are in good agreement with a previous study on human VASP (11Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that VASP becomes phosphorylated at three residues, both in human platelets and in vitro: Ser157, Ser239, and Thr278, corresponding to Ser153, Ser235, and Thr274 in murine VASP (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In analogy to the data obtained by Butt and co-workers (11Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that PKA first phosphorylates murine VASP at Ser153 in the proline-rich domain and subsequently at Ser235 and, to a much lesser extent, at Thr274. To analyze the influence of phosphorylation by PKA on VASP interaction with actin, we used unlabeled samples that had been prepared in parallel with the samples for the phosphate incorporation analysis. In a previous study we demonstrated that actin nucleation by VASP as well as its binding to actin filaments is salt-sensitive (8Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), indicating that the complex formation is based on electrostatic interactions. Hence all experiments were performed under low salt conditions (15 or 50 mm KCl). Actin nucleation was monitored in a standard actin polymerization assay where 10% of the G-actin used is labeled with pyrene (Fig.3 A). Actin filament formation causes an increase in fluorescence intensity giving a direct measurement of actin polymerization. When 1 μm G-actin was transferred into a buffer promoting actin polymerization, only negligible filament formation was observed. In the presence of 0.25 μm VASP, PKA, and"

In a separate experiment, an oxidant was developed such that the long-sought C 60 ·+ ion can be synthesized in solution.

Med. 1998; 4: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), an important modulator of muscle growth and differentiation as well as a mitogen for many cell types (14Pedone P.V. Tirabosco R.

In most tissues, both in humans and in mice, the gene is imprinted with only the paternally derived allele being transcribed (15O'Dell S.D. Day I.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Overexpression ofIgf2 has been observed in several types of sporadic human neoplasms and this has been frequently attributed to loss of imprinting (LOI) of the maternal allele (16Reik W. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Miyaki M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1236-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Consequently, LOI ofIgf2 has been proposed as an important mechanism of tumor formation (18Falls J.G. Pulford D.J. Wylie A.A. Jirtle R.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Igf2 could also be caused by uniparental disomy involving duplication of the paternal (non-imprinted), and loss of the maternal (imprinted), locus (16Reik W. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased Igf2 transcription could reflect an amplification of the Igf2 gene in the tumor or Igf2 being the target of an abnormally activated signaling pathway. We have investigated the significance of Igf2 and the mechanism of Igf2 overexpression in tumor formation in Ptch mouse mutants. In this communication we show thatIgf2 is indispensable for the formation of both RMS and medulloblastoma. We propose that Igf2 acts as a downstream target of the Ptch-signaling pathway (19Zhan S. Helman L.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 559-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and as such represents a target for therapies against malignancies caused by loss of Ptch function. Wild-type Ptch +/+ and heterozygousPtch neo67/+ mice on anIgf2-deficient background were obtained by crossing heterozygous Ptch neo67/+ females (maintained on a CD1 background) with heterozygousIgf2+/− males (20DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. A. Efstratiadis, Columbia University, New York). The colony was monitored for tumor formation over a period of 9 months. Mus musculus castaneus males were mated to Ptch neo67/+ females maintained on a CD1 background. The resulting offsprings of CDI (Ptch neo67/+) × CAST/Ei) F1 generation were monitored for tumor formation. The imprinting status of Igf2 and H19 in normal skeletal muscle (SM) and RMS was then investigated by SNuPE (single nucleotide primer extension) assay (see below). To investigate the imprinting status of Igf2 and H19 in E8.5 Ptch +/+, Ptch neo67/+, and Ptch neo67/neo67 embryos,Ptch neo67/+ females derived from the (CDI (Ptch neo67/+) × CAST/Ei) cross were mated to CDI (Ptch neo67/+) males. Embryos that inherited both the M. musculus domesticus and M. musculus castaneus Igf2 alleles were identified by sequencing and pooled according to the Ptch genotype (Ptch +/+, Ptch neo67/+, andPtch neo67/neo67). Considering the small physical distance of 90 kilobases (21Zemel S. Bartolomei M.S. Tilghman S.M. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) between Igf2 andH19 genes on murine chromosome 7, the sequencing of theIgf2 polymorphism was used to determine the origin of both Igf2 and H19 alleles. Genotyping of mice and embryos was performed by PCR on DNA isolated from tail clips or yolksacs, respectively. The genotyping of the wild-type and Ptch neo67/+ mutant loci was described previously (5Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Hall J. Miller G. Zimmer A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The genotyping of the mutantIgf2 allele was performed using the following oligonucleotides: neo3, 5′-AGCGCATCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTT-3′ (derived from the neo cassette of the Igf2 targeting construct) and Igf2wtR, 5′-CCTTCCCCAACTGGGAAATCAAGAGA-3′ (derived from intron 4 of the murine Igf2 gene; GenBankTM accession number U71085, nucleotides 23080–23105). The oligonucleotides amplify a ∼350-base pair fragment of the mutant Igf2 allele. The PCR conditions were 35 cycles of denaturing for 45 s at 95 °C, annealing for 90 s at 55 °C, and extension for 45 s at 72 °C. E8.5 Ptch +/+,Ptch neo67/+, and Ptch neo67/neo67 embryos from crosses between Ptch neo67/+ mice (CD1 background) were isolated and genotyped. Embryos of the same genotype were pooled and total RNA was isolated using a single step acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform procedure (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed in formamide-containing solutions. The amount of total RNA (15 μg/lane) was monitored by ethidium bromide staining and by hybridization with a murine Actin probe. The same protocol was used to investigate RNA isolated from SM and RMS of heterozygous Ptch animals. The Igf2 andGli1 probes were described previously (5Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Hall J. Miller G. Zimmer A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). TheH19 probe corresponds to exon 5 of the murine H19gene. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using a TaqMan (Applied Biosystems 7700) instrument. The murineIgf2-specific primers were 5′-TGTGCTGCATCGCTGCTTAC-3′ and 5′-CGGTCCGAACAGACAAACTGA-3′, and the fluorogenic probe was 5′-CCCGGAGAGACTCTGTGCGGAGG-3′. Amplification of mGAPDH as an endogenous control was performed to standardize the amount of sample RNA or DNA. ThemGAPDH primers were 5′-TCCATGCCATCACTGCCA-3′ and 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTGG-3′, and the fluorogenic probe was 5′-CAGAAGACTGTGGATGGCCCCTC-3′. PCR was carried out with the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using 50 ng of cDNA or 50 ng of genomic DNA, 200 nmamount of the probe and 300 nm forward primer and reverse primer in a 30-μl final reaction mixture. After 2-min incubation at 50 °C to allow for uracil-N-glycosylase cleavage to hydrolyze uracil-glycosidic bonds at dU-containing DNA sites, AmpliTaq Gold was activated by incubation for 10 min at 95 °C. Each of the 50 PCR cycles consisted of 15 s denaturation at 95 °C and hybridization of probe and primers for 1 min at 60 °C. All data shown are the average of at least two independent experiments. SNuPE assay (23Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) was used to assess the imprinting status ofIgf2 and H19 as well as to exclude the uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. The assay is based on exon sequence differences between M. musculus domesticus and M. musculus castaneus. To assess the imprinting status ofIgf2 and H19 in SM, RMS, and in E8.5Ptch +/+ , Ptch neo67/+, and Ptch neo67/neo67 embryos, total RNA was isolated and digested with DNase. Two μg RNA were reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). TheIgf2 and H19 cDNAs were amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotides used were derived from neighboring exons to allow the detection of contamination by genomic DNA (23Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although none of the RT-PCR samples had a detectable contamination with genomic DNA, the PCR fragments were gel-purified prior to the SNuPE assay. The 10 μl SNuPE reaction mix contained 1× PCR buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1.5 mm MgCl2), 10 ng of the amplified cDNA fragment, 10 μmol of the respective SNuPE primer, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, and 2 μCi of the appropriate [α-32P]dNTP (23Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). After denaturing at 95 °C for 5 min, the annealing of the oligonucleotide was performed at 55 °C for 75 s and the oligonucleotide extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The samples were diluted in 30 μl of stop solution (10 mm NaOH, 95% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.01% xylene cyanol). After boiling, 2.5 μl were resolved by electrophoresis on a renaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto Whatman paper, and visualized by autoradiography. Experiments designed to exclude the uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 differed from the above by the omission of the reverse transcription step and usage of genomic DNA instead of cDNA. We investigated the significance of Igf2 and the mechanism of its overexpression in tumor formation in heterozygousPtch neo67/+ mice. To this end, the Ptchmutation was transferred onto an Igf2-deficient background (24DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) by mating of heterozygousPtch neo67/+ females with heterozygousIgf2 +/− males. Offspring animals with a paternally inherited Igf2 mutant allele lackIgf2 expression due to the imprinting of the maternalIgf2 allele (20DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (5Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Hall J. Miller G. Zimmer A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), we observed a relative loss of Igf2 andPtch mutant mice upon weaning (TableI). All surviving animals were monitored for tumor formation over a period of 9 months. HeterozygousPtch neo67/+ mice are mainly predisposed to medulloblastoma and RMS (4Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, 5Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Hall J. Miller G. Zimmer A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Over a period of 9 months, seven heterozygous Ptch neo67/+ animals developed RMS, whereas five developed medulloblastoma manifesting as hydrocephalus. Three Ptch neo67/+ heterozygotes animals died of unknown causes (Table I). Strikingly, tumor formation and animal loss were confined to animals wild-type forIgf2(Ptch neo67/+ /Igf2 +/+), whereas no tumors were found in animals with inherited mutantIgf2 allele (Ptch neo67/+ /Igf2 +/−) (Table I). These results suggest that Igf2 is required for the formation of RMS and medulloblastoma caused by loss ofPtch function.Table ITumor formation and animal loss in Ptch and Igf2 mutant miceIgf2 +/+Igf2 +/−Ptch +/+00(n = 41)(n = 42)Ptch neo67/+150(n = 46)(n = 25)A colony of 154 mice derived from a cross between Ptch neo67/+ females andIgf2 +/− males was monitored for tumor formation over a period of 9 months.

Open table in a new tab A colony of 154 mice derived from a cross between Ptch neo67/+ females andIgf2 +/− males was monitored for tumor formation over a period of 9 months. Only mice with aPtch neo67/+ Igf2 +/+genotype developed tumors. Because Igf2 is overexpressed in RMS (5Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Hall J. Miller G. Zimmer A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and is indispensable for tumor formation, we wished to determine the mechanism involved in Igf2 overexpression.Igf2 transcripts were quantitated using a TaqMan assay. As shown in Fig. 1 a, RMS in Ptch mutant mice show an up to 1000-fold increase ofIgf2 transcription in comparison with normal SM. To assess the imprinting status of Igf2 alleles we introduced into the colony a M. musculus castaneus-specificIgf2 polymorphism (23Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) by mating M. musculus castaneus males with M. musculus domesticus females heterozygous for Ptch in a CDI(Ptch neo67/+) × CAST/EI cross. The allelic origins of Igf2 transcripts in the offspring of this cross were investigated using a SNuPE assay (23Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). RMS expressed Igf2 only from the paternally inheritedIgf2 allele (Fig. 1 b). These results argue against an abnormal Igf2 imprinting in RMS. Unexpectedly (20DeChiara T.M. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1991; 64: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar), we also found a weak level of expression of the maternal Igf2 allele in the normal adult muscle (Fig.1 b). Next, we investigated the imprinting status of the physically linked, paternally imprinted gene H19. H19 andIgf2 expression are functionally linked due to the competition for a common enhancer (25Joyce J.A. Lam W.K. Catchpoole D.J. Jenks P. Reik W. Maher E.R. Schofield P.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1543-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Reduction or loss ofH19 expression would therefore be expected to result in an increase in Igf2 transcription on the same chromosome. As shown in Fig. 1 c, H19 itself is overexpressed in RMS of heterozygous Ptch neo67/+ mice. A SNuPE assay that detects an H19 polymorphism betweenM. musculus domesticus and M. musculus castaneus(23Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1857-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) showed a normal imprinting of H19 in normal and tumorigenic muscle tissue of (CDI (Ptch neo67/+) × CAST/Ei) mice (Fig. 1 d). All these results argue against an abnormal imprinting as a source ofIgf2 overexpression. Other possible mechanisms of Igf2 overexpression are uniparental disomy, amplification of the Igf2 gene, or polyploidy. Uniparental disomy is caused by a loss of the maternal (imprinted) Igf2 locus with a concomitant duplication of the paternal (not imprinted) Igf2 locus (16Reik W. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Henry I. Bonaiti-Pellie C. Chehensse V. Beldjord C. Schwartz C. Utermann G. Junien C. Nature. 1991; 351: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, both the M. musculus domesticus and M. musculus castaneus Igf2 alleles can be detected in genomic DNA isolated from RMS and analyzed by SNuPE assay (Fig. 1 b) and sequencing (not shown). Gene amplification and polyploidy in RMS have been similarly excluded by quantitative PCR (TaqMan) (Fig.2) and flow cytometry (not shown), respectively. These results indicated that Igf2 overexpression in RMS is caused exclusively by an increased transcription of the paternal allele. They also suggest the involvement of a signaling rather than a genetic mechanism. If Igf2 were a target of activatedPtch signaling, its overexpression should be detectable in tissue from a non-tumor bearing, Ptch-deficient animal. We therefore examined Igf2 expression in E8.5Ptch +/+ , Ptch neo67/+, andPtch neo67/neo67 embryos derived from crosses betweenPtch neo67/+ mice. In the embryo proper,Igf2 expression is detectable for the first time at E7.5 in embryonic mesoderm, and at E8.5 Igf2 is expressed in many embryonal tissues (27Lee J.E. Pintar J. Efstratiadis A. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 151-159PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 a, gradual loss of thePtch wild-type alleles correlated with an increase inIgf2 expression in E8.5 embryos. A similar relationship has been found for H19 (Fig. 3 b). The increase in the expression of these genes following the loss ofPtch resembles that of the established Ptchtarget (4Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar), Gli1 (Fig. 3 c). The allelic source of Igf2 and H19overexpression in E8.5 Ptch neo67/+ andPtch neo67/neo67 mutant embryos was investigated using the appropriate SNuPE assays on embryos derived from a (CDI (Ptch neo67/+) × CAST/Ei) F1 × CDI (Ptch neo67/+) backcross. Only paternally derived Igf2 transcripts (Fig. 3 d) were detected in the embryos. The apparent weak expression of the paternalH19 allele (Fig. 3 e) may reflect incomplete imprinting or a contamination with mRNA derived from the yolksac (28Davis T.L. Tremblay K.D. Bartolomei M.S. Dev. Genet. 1998; 23: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results show that, similarly to the tumor tissue,Ptch-deficient embryos overexpress Igf2and H19 and that the process does not involve LOI. Deficiency in the tumor suppressor PTCH has been implicated in a variety of tumors, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Several targets of PTCH signaling have been proposed based on their altered expression in tumors resulting fromPTCH deficiency. We have investigated the mechanism and the functional significance of the Igf2 overexpression, which is a consistent characteristic of RMS in murine Ptchmutants. Overexpression of Igf2 has been reported in several tumors including RMS and the involvement of abnormal imprinting or genomic instability have been discussed as the underlying mechanism (16Reik W. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 330-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we have not detected any evidence for the transcription of the maternal Igf2 gene copy in RMS. Neither have we found evidence for the involvement of genomic instability as judged by the absence of uniparental disomy, amplification of the Igf2 locus, or polyploidy. These observations argue against LOI or genomic instability as a source ofIgf2 overexpression. Rather, similarly toGli1 and Ptch itself (29Ingham P.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Igf2appears to be a downstream target of an activated Ptchsignaling pathway. This conclusion is based on the observation of increased Igf2 expression in non-tumor (embryonic) tissue deficient in Ptch. Abrogation of Igf2 has been previously associated with a reduction in tumor malignancy in a pancreatic endocrine cancer model (30Christofori G. Naik P. Hanahan D. Nature. 1994; 369: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Igf2 has also recently been shown to act as a modifier of adenomatous polyposis-related colorectal tumor progression (31Hassan A.B. Howell J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1070-1076PubMed Google Scholar). In Ptch mutants, Igf2appears indispensable for tumorigenesis, since no medulloblastoma or RMS are observed in animals deficient in the gene's product. The suggested functional link between Igf2 andPtch indicates that prevention of Igf2overexpression should be attainable by the restoration ofPtch function in the tumor. The absolute dependence of RMS and medulloblastoma formation on Igf2 described here suggests that Igf2 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of these malignant tumors. We are grateful to Hannelore Prechtl, Jaqueline Müller, and Anna Nickl for excellent animal care and technical assistance. We thank Dr. A. Efstratiadis, Columbia University, New York, for kindly providing heterozygousIgf2 +/− mice."

We investigated the effect of HA and a HA fragment (10–15 disaccharide units, F1) on primary human endothelial cells (ECs). Human pulmonary ECs (HPAEC) and lung microvessel ECs (HMVEC-L) bound HA (K d ∼1 and 2.3 nm, respectively) and expressed 17,780 and 16,690 HA binding sites, respectively. Both ECs showed HA-mediated cell adhesion; however, HMVEC-L was 1.5-fold better. Human umbilical vein ECs neither bound HA nor showed HA-mediated adhesion. All three ECs expressed CD44 (∼110 kDa). The expression of receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM) (∼80 kDa) was the highest in HMVEC-L, followed by HPAEC and human umbilical vein ECs. RHAMM, not CD44, bound HA in all three ECs. F1 was better than HA and stimulated a 2.5- and 1.8-fold mitogenic response in HMVEC-L and HPAEC, respectively. Both HA and F1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, paxillin, and p42/44 ERK in HMVEC-L and HPAEC, which was blocked by an anti-RHAMM antibody. These results demonstrate that RHAMM is the functional HA receptor in primary human ECs.

An injury to the vascular endothelium marks the beginning of diseases such as atherosclerosis, and the endothelium regeneration signals disease regression (1Martin J.F. Hassall D.G. Warren J.B. The Endothelium: An Introduction to Current Research. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1990: 95-105Google Scholar). Microvessel endothelium is the key element in angiogenesis that involves sprouting of preexisting microvessels. Angiogenesis is necessary for wound healing, collateral blood vessel formation in ischemia, tumor growth, and metastasis (2Kerbel R.S. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 3Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7013) Google Scholar). Endothelial cell (EC)1 functions such as proliferation, migration, and capillary formation regulate the integrity of the normal vascular endothelium and control angiogenesis in microvasculature (4Paku S. Paweletz N. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 334-346PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of cytokines, including the major ones such as basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, stimulate EC functions. In addition to cytokines, extracellular matrix components regulate vascular and microvessel endothelial behavior and play a role in vessel wall diseases and angiogenesis (5Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Hyaluronic acid (HA), a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan, is known to accumulate in the vessel wall intima during early stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation. The concentration of HA is low in the advanced lesions, but HA levels rise once again during plaque regression (6Benerson G.S. Radhakrishnamurthy D. Srinivasan S.R. Vijayagopal P. Dalferes Jr., E.R.

In addition to its structural role, that is keeping tissues hydrated and maintaining osmotic balance, HA regulates cellular processes such as adhesion migration and proliferation (12Laurent T.C.

Different lengths of the HA polymers that are made up of repeated disaccharide units,d-glucuronic acid andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine, affect different cellular processes (12Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E.

Med. 1997; 242: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For example, the high molecular mass HA (∼106 Da) is anti-angiogenic, whereas HA fragments of 3–25 disaccharide units induce angiogenesis (15Deed R. Rooney P. Kumar P. Norton J.D. Kumar S. Int. J.

We have previously isolated small HA fragments (10–15 disaccharide units) from the urine of bladder cancer patients and have shown that these fragments induce the proliferation of human microvessel ECs (11Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57 (; Erratum (1998) Cancer Res.58, 3191): 773-777PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that angiogenic HA fragments induce EC migration and capillary formation (18Montesano R. Kumar S. Orci L. Pepper M.S. Lab.

HA fragments are generated when hyaluronidase, an endoglycosidase, degrades the HA polymer (20West D.C. Kumar S. Exp.

Furthermore, elevated HA and hyaluronidase levels serve as sensitive and accurate noninvasive urine markers for bladder cancer detection and evaluation of its grade (26Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C.

The biological functions of HA are mediated by cell surface HA receptors or HA-binding proteins (27Knudson, C. B., Knudson, W. (1993) FASEB J.1233–1241Google Scholar, 28Entwistle J. Hall C.l. Turley E.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). At present several HA receptors have been described in ECs (29Nishina H. Inageda K. Takahashi K.

Weigel P.H. J. Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 20451-20456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another well characterized HA receptor on ECs is CD44. CD44 denotes a family of glycoproteins that are expressed on a variety of cells and tissues (33Zoller M. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Underhill C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distinct feature of the CD44 family is alternative splicing that gives rise to numerous isoforms. Of the 19 exons present in CD44 mRNA, most often the exons between 5 and 15 are alternatively spliced (33Zoller M. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Underhill C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a chemically transformed bovine EC line 7372A expresses an isoform of CD44 (ex14/v10) that appears to be required for HA-mediated EC proliferation (14Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC), however, do not express CD44 in vivo but begin to express different CD44 isoforms in culture and when activated with basic fibroblast growth factor (35Griffioen A.W. Coenen M.J.H. Damen C.A. Hellwig S.M.M. van Weering D.H.J. Vooys W. Blijham G.H. Groenewegen G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides CD44, another well studied HA receptor is thereceptor for HA-mediatedmotility (RHAMM) (36Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen l. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although RHAMM expression has not been described in ECs, it is expressed in many cell types including fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, T-cells, macrophages, and cancer cells (37Turley E.A. Cancer Met. Rev. 1992; 11: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). RHAMM is probably expressed both on the cell surface and intracellularly (36Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P.

A critical regulator of cell motility, RHAMM causes cellular transformation when overexpressed (40Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C. greenbverg A.H. Turley E.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). RHAMM is known to induce HA-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, p125FAK (41Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is also required for the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by platelet-derived growth factor and Ras (42Zhang S. Chang M.C.Y. Zylka D. Turley S. Harrison R. Turley E.A. J.

In this study we examined HA binding, HA-mediated cell adhesion, and proliferation in primary human ECs. Because ECs from different tissues and vascular origins differ in their structural architecture and functional responses to environmental stimuli, we used human pulmonary artery, lung microvessel, and umbilical vein-derived ECs to perform the experiments described in this study. We also investigated the expression of HA receptors and HA-induced signal transduction events in these ECs. Human pulmonary artery ECs (HPAEC), human lung microvessel ECs (HMVEC-L), and HUVECs were obtained from Clonetics/BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD). HPAEC, HMVEC-L, and HUVEC lines were grown in “endothelial cell growth medium,” which was purchased from Clonetics/BioWhittaker Inc. All of the experiments described in this study were performed on cells between 2 and 3 passages. The company guarantees the EC cultures for 15 population doublings or 3 passages in culture. Human umbilical cord HA was obtained from ICN Biomedicals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated recombinant antiphosphotyrosine RC20 antibody and mouse anti-FAK, anti-paxillin, and anti-pan ERK (the antibody that recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2 and was generated against an ERK2 sequence) antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington KY. A rat anti-CD44 antibody that recognizes a common epitope on all CD44 isoforms was obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc. Inc. A rabbit anti-RHAMM antibody, R3.6, was kindly provided by Dr. Eva Turley, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-Sepharose, goat anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-biotin IgG were obtained from Sigma. [3H]HA was prepared as described previously (21Lokeshwar V.B. Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23853-23864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The specific activity of [3H]HA was 1.0 × 104 cpm/μg, and it had a molecular mass of ∼106 daltons. ECs were grown on 6-well plates, and at ∼80% confluence the cultures were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The ECs were then incubated with various concentrations (0.15–3 μg/ml) of [3H]HA in PBS + 0.2% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer). Following incubation at 4 °C for 4 h (equilibrium binding), the cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4 + 1% SDS (SDS solution). The radioactivity present in the solubilized cell extracts was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled HA and was subtracted from the total binding. For competition binding experiments, ECs were incubated with 1 μg/ml of [3H]HA in the presence of 1–250 μg/ml of unlabeled HA, F1, F2, and F3 HA fragments, in the binding buffer. Following incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, the cell-associated radioactivity was measured as described above. Human umbilical cord HA (500 mg) was digested with 20,000 units of testicular hyaluronidase for different time intervals. The aliquots collected at different time intervals were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to remove protein, dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and then dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid. The mixture of HA fragments was separated on a Sephadex G-50 column (1.5 × 110 cm), and the column fractions were assayed for uronic acid content and the number of reducing ends. The chain length of each fragment was calculated from the number of reducing ends/mole of uronic acid. Three different uronate peaks were isolated from the column, and these peaks were designated as F1 (10–15 disaccharide units), F2 (2–3 disaccharide units), and F3 (≤2 disaccharide units) (14Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). EC cultures at ∼80% confluence were incubated in l-methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by pulse labeling with Tran35S-label (20 μCi/ml) for 1 h. Following labeling, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA solution at 37 °C to obtain a nonadherent single cell suspension. An aliquot of the labeled cells, solubilized in the SDS solution, was counted in the liquid scintillation counter. The cell density was determined by counting cells in a hemocytometer slide, which enabled us to determine cpm/50,000 cells. The HA-coated surfaces were prepared by incubating the wells of a 24-well plate with 1 mg/ml HA solution, prepared in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, at 37 °C for 4 h. Following incubation, the wells were washed in PBS and incubated with PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h to block nonspecific sites on the wells. Fifty thousand 35S-labeled cells were incubated on HA-coated wells in binding buffer at 4 °C for 30 min either alone or in the presence of 300 μg/ml soluble HA (to determine nonspecific cell adhesion). Following incubation, the wells were washed three times in binding buffer and solubilized in SDS solution, and the radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The counts because of nonspecific adhesion were subtracted from total cell adhesion counts. ECs were cultured on 48-well plates. At ∼80% confluence, the cultures were incubated with “endothelial basal medium” (EBM), which lacks all the additives (i.e.bovine pituitary extract, vascular endothelial growth factor, h-epidermal growth factor, ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone, and insulin-like growth factor-1) and serum present in endothelial cell growth medium. ECs were incubated in EBM at 37 °C for 12 h. The cultures were then incubated with various concentrations (0–5 μg/ml) of HA or HA fragments in EBM, at 37 °C for 18 h. Following incubation, [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added to these cultures, and the assay was terminated after a 2-h incubation, as described previously (26Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urology. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The results are represented as mean ± SD from triplicate determinations. Immunoprecipitation with anti-CD44 antibody was as follows. ECs grown on 6-cm dishes (∼80%) confluence were incubated in l-methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 4 h. The cultures were incubated with Tran35S-label (200 μCi/ml; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at 37 °C for 1 h. The radioactively labeled cells were washed in PBS, and 2 × 105 cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated using rat anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody as described previously (21Lokeshwar V.B. Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23853-23864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. EC cultures (∼80% confluence) were treated with PBS + 5 mm EDTA to obtain a single cell suspension. ECs (2 × 105) were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted on to a PVDF membrane. The blot was incubated with rabbit anti-RHAMM antibody, R 3.6 (1:1500 dilution), at 4 °C for 16 h (42Zhang S. Chang M.C.Y. Zylka D. Turley S. Harrison R. Turley E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11342-11348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Following incubation, the blot was washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:7500 dilution) at room temperature for 2 h. The blot was then washed and developed using an alkaline phosphatase color detection system, involving nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indoyl phosphate substrates (Bio-Rad). To confirm that any differences observed in the intensity of bands, following immunoblot analysis, are not because of the differences in protein loading, prior to incubation with anti-RHAMM antibody, the blots were stained with Coomassie Blue and processed as described below. Biotinylated HA was prepared according to a procedure by Hoare et al. (43Hoare K. Savani R.C. Wang C. Yang B. Turley E.A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1993; 30: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ECs grown on 6-well culture plates (∼80% confluence) were extracted in SDS sample buffer as described above. The cell extracts were separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted on to PVDF, and probed with biotinylated HA (60 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing the blot was developed using an anti-biotin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (1:7500 dilution), as described above. Alternatively, ∼80% confluent cultures of ECs grown on 6-well cultures plates were solubilized in RIPA buffer, and the cell lysates (prepared from 2 × 105 cells) were immunoprecipitated by sequential incubations with anti-RHAMM antibody (1:200 dilution) at 4 °C for 16 h and goat anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads at 4 °C for 90 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in RIPA buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was blotted on to a PVDF membrane, and the blots were processed with biotinylated HA as described above. To confirm that any differences observed in the intensity of bands following immunoblot analysis are not because of the differences in protein loading, prior to incubation with biotinylated HA-binding protein, the blots were stained with Coomassie Blue and processed as described below. ECs, grown on 6-well culture plates (∼80% confluence), were incubated in EBM at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were then incubated with HA or the F1 HA fragment at different concentrations (0–10 μg/ml) for 5 min or at 2 μg/ml for different time intervals (0–10 min). At the end of the incubations, the cultures were washed with PBS and solubilized in 0.2 ml of SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts (i.e. 25 μl) of the cell extract from each sample were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. The blotted membranes were stained with 0.15% Coomassie Blue in 30% methanol for 1 min and then destained in 30% methanol for 5 min. This procedure allows the visualization of the total protein profile in each lane. The Coomassie Blue-stained blots were photographed using a Kodak DC-20 camera that comes with gel analysis software (EDAS, Eastman Kodak Co.). Using this system, the intensity of protein bands in each sample lane with molecular masses between 83 kDa and 50 kDa and 50 kDa and 36 kDa were compared for detecting differences in protein loading and possible artifacts during protein transfer. These differences were less than 5%. The Coomassie Blue-stained blots were completely destained in 50% methanol, rehydrated in distilled water for 10 min, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.05% Tween-20. The blots were probed with antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody RC20 (1: 7000 dilution) and developed using a chemiluminescence system (NEN Life Science Products). The autoradiographs were photographed using the same Kodak system, and the intensity of bands among different samples were compared. To be sure that the differences observed in various samples are not because of the differences in protein loading, a ratio of the intensity of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band to the intensity of total protein bands was calculated for each lane, and then the ratios between different lanes were compared. Alternatively, HA- or F1-treated (2 μg/ml for 5 min) HMVEC-L (6-cm dishes, ∼80% confluence) were solubilized in the RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitated using anti-FAK, anti-paxillin, anti-pan ERK antibodies at 5 μg/ml concentration, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The immunoprecipitates were separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted on to a PVDF membrane, and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody as described above. In control experiments, HMVEC-L stimulated with HA or F1 were directly extracted in SDS sample buffer, separated on a 10% gel, and blotted on to a PVDF membrane. The blots were probed with anti-FAK (1:1000 dilution), anti-paxillin (1:5000 dilution), or anti-pan ERK (1:5000 dilution) antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing, the blots were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:7500 dilution) at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were then developed using an alkaline phosphatase system as described above. In one set of experiments, HMVEC-L incubated in EBM at 37 °C for 16 h were treated with rat anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (25 μg/ml), rabbit anti-RHAMM antibody (25 μg/ml), or normal rabbit IgG (25 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were then stimulated with HA or the F1 HA fragment at 2 μg/ml for 5 min. Following stimulation, the cells were extracted in SDS sample buffer, and an equal aliquot from each sample was analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine antibody blotting as described above. Total RNA was extracted from HPAEC and HMVEC-L using the Quiagen RNA extraction kit. Approximately 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II™ (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand cDNA was amplified using Ampli Taq Gold™ (Perkin-Elmer),Taq Gold buffer (with final MgCl2 concentration 1.5 mm), 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and the following RHAMM primer pair: RHAMM L1 (this primer sequence is at nucleotide positions 1639–1659 in a RHAMM clone, GenBankTM accession numberAF032862): GAACCAACTCAAGCAACAGG; RHAMM L2 (this primer sequence is at nucleotide positions 2005–2025 in the RHAMM clone AF032862): AGCAAGCTGACAGCGGAGTT. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min (initial melting), 10 cycles (with annealing temp decreasing by 1 degree in each cycle); 94 °C for 30 s; 70–60 °C for 30 s (touch down PCR); and 72 °C for 1 min and then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s; 60 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min. Final extension was at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR product was analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by eithidium bromide staining. The PCR product was cloned into the PCR TOPO vector, using the TOPO kit and a protocol supplied by the manufacturer (In Vitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Both strands of the cloned cDNA insert were sequenced in the University of Miami's DNA core facility, using an automated DNA sequencer and T7 and SP6 universal primers. To determine whether different vascular ECs differ in their ability to bind HA, we examined [3H]HA equilibrium binding in HMVEC-L (lung microvessel), HPAEC (pulmonary artery), and HUVEC (vein-derived). As shown in Fig.1 A, [3H]HA binds HMVEC-L and HPAEC in a dose-dependent manner that is saturable and specific. However, HUVEC do not display specific HA binding at any concentration tested (even up to 5μg/ml). Scatchard plot analyses indicate that both HPAEC and HMVEC-L contain a single class of high affinity HA binding sites with dissociation constants (K d ) of 1 and 2.3 nm, respectively. The analyses also showed that there are 16,690 and 17,580 binding sites on HMVEC-L and HPAEC, respectively. It has been previously shown that the angiogenic HA fragments (3–25 disaccharide units) are capable of binding to cell surface HA receptors (28Entwistle J. Hall C.l. Turley E.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the ability of F1, F2, and F3 HA fragments to compete with [3H]HA binding. Our results indicated that only the F1 fragment was able to effectively compete with [3H]HA to bind to both HMVEC-L and HPAEC. The dissociation constants for the binding of the F1 fragment to HPAEC and HMVEC-L, as determined by the competition binding curves, were 1.8 nm and 2.6 nm, respectively (data not shown). In this experiment we tested the ability of35S-labeled primary human ECs to adhere to HA-coated surface. As shown in Table I, both HPAEC and HMVEC-L specifically adhere to the HA-coated surface. However, HUVEC, which do not show specific HA binding (as shown in Fig.1 A), do not specifically adhere to a HA-coated surface. Some differences are also observed between the ability of HMVEC-L and HPAEC to adhere to the HA-coated surface. Of the 50,000 cells of each type added onto the HA-coated surface, 24.7% of HMVEC-L (12, 739 cells/well) and 16.9% of"

A chimera of the CRLR and green fluorescent protein (CRLR-GFP) was used to study receptor localization and trafficking in stably transduced HEK 293 cells, with or without co-transfection of RAMPs. CRLR-GFP failed to generate responses to CGRP or AM without RAMPs. Furthermore, CRLR-GFP was not found in the plasma membrane and its localization was unchanged after agonist exposure. When stably coexpressed with RAMPs, CRLR-GFP appeared on the cell surface and was fully active in intracellular cAMP production and calcium mobilization. Agonist-mediated internalization of CRLR-GFP was observed in RAMP1/CGRP or AM, RAMP2/AM, and RAMP3/AM, which occurred with similar kinetics, indicating the existence of ligand-specific regulation of CRLR internalization by RAMPs. This internalization was strongly inhibited by hypertonic medium (0.45m sucrose) and paralleled localization of rhodamine-labeled transferrin, suggesting that CRLR endocytosis occurred predominantly through a clathrin-dependent pathway. A significant proportion of CRLR was targeted to lysosomes upon binding of the ligands, and recycling of the internalized CRLR was not efficient. In HEK 293 cells stably expressing CRLR-GFP and Myc-RAMPs, these rhodamine-labeled RAMPs were co-localized with CRLR-GFP in the presence and absence of the ligands. Thus, the CRLR is endocytosed together with RAMPs via clathrin-coated vesicles, and both the internalized molecules are targeted to the degradative pathway.

CGRP is a 38-amino acid neuropeptide produced by tissue-specific alternative splicing of the primary transcript of the calcitonin gene (3Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). CGRP immunoreactivity is present throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, and release of CGRP from nervous tissue has been demonstrated (4Kruger L. Mantyh P.W. Sternini C. Brecha N.C.

It mainly exerts powerful cardiovascular effects as an autocrine/paracrine regulator. Both peptides have been reported to activate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and to increase the intracellular calcium concentration in various cell types (9Shimekake Y. Nagata K. Ohta S.

This suggests that their receptors activate different G proteins, Gs and Gq. Specific or common binding sites for these peptides have been suggested to be present in both central and peripheral tissues; however, their formal cell receptors have not been identified. Recently, human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) was identified as an accessory protein that enhances the activity of endogenous CGRP receptors in Xenopus oocytes (11McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). This protein consisted of 148 amino acids including an N-terminal signal sequence and putative single transmembrane region, and was shown to induce trafficking of the seven-transmembrane domain calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) to the cell surface by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. RAMP2 and -3 cDNAs (175 and 148 amino acids, respectively) were then cloned by expressed sequence tag analysis (11McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). When co-transfected with RAMP2 or -3 in mammalian cells the CRLR became a functional AM receptor (11McLatchie L.M.

Although RAMP2 and -3 share only 30% homology and they show different tissue distributions, the CRLR/RAMP2 and CRLR/RAMP3 receptors in HEK 293T cells have been reported to be indistinguishable by radioligand binding, functional assay, and biochemical analysis (13Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to agonists often leads to a rapid internalization of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This agonist-promoted phenomenon is common to a large number of GPCRs (14Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Internalization is believed to involve clathrin-coated vesicles and/or caveolin-rich vesicles. The internalized GPCRs may be recycled back to the plasma membrane rather than being trafficked to lysosomes where they are degraded (14Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 15Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The recent development of GPCR conjugated with green fluorescent protein (GFP) has provided the opportunity for a more extensive optical analysis of receptor trafficking events in individual cells (16Tarasova N.I.

In this study, we characterized the biochemical properties of the functional CRLR chimera with GFP fused to the C terminus of the receptor, CRLR-GFP, with or without co-transfection of RAMPs. Moreover, direct visualization of the localization of CRLR-GFP and rhodamine-labeled RAMPs provided evidence that, when stably coexpressed, agonist-induced endocytosis of both molecules occurred together through the same pathways and this was irreversible. A plasmid containing human CRLR cDNA (20Fluhmann B. Muff R. Hunziker W. Fisher J.A. Born W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comun. 1995; 206: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Kenji Kangawa (National Cardiovascular Research Institute, Osaka, Japan). 125I-Labeled human CGRP (specific activity 2177 Ci/mmol) and 125I-labeled human adrenomedullin (specific activity 1260 Ci/mmol) were from Peninsula Laboratories. Human CGRP and adrenomedullin were from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) were from Dako. Tetramethylrhodamine-concanavalin A (ConA), tetramethylrhodamine-transferrin, and LysoTracker Red were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from various suppliers. A bright green mutant of GFP, enhanced GFP (CLONTECH), was attached to the C terminus of human CRLR by standard recombinant techniques. Briefly, the full open reading frame of the human CRLR, modified to provide a consensus Kozak sequence (21Aiyar N. Rand K. Elshourbagy N.A. Zeng Z. Adamou J.E. Bergsma D.J. Li Y. J. Biol.

The 5′ and 3′ ends of CRLR were ligated into theSalI and XbaI sites of modified pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), SmaI → XbaI at its multicloning site. The fused product was then cloned into pCAGGS/Neo, termed pCAGGS-CRLR-GFP. RAMP cDNAs, modified to provide a consensus Kozak sequence, were obtained from a human embryonic cDNA library (CLONTECH). Each RAMP was cloned into pIRES1/Hyg (CLONTECH). The Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) was used in-frame to the 5′ end of cDNAs encoding CRLR and RAMPs. The native signal sequences were removed and replaced with MKTILALSTYIFCLVFA (22Guon X.-M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myc-CRLR and Myc-RAMPs were cloned into pCAGGS/Neo and pIRES1/Hyg, respectively. CRLR-GFP, Myc-CRLR, RAMPs, and Myc-RAMPs cDNAs were all sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 310 Genetic Analyzer. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells grown to 70–80% confluence were transfected with linearized pCAGGS-CRLR-GFP using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days after transfection, cells were plated in selective medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). A pool of G-418-resistant colonies was trypsinized followed by limited dilution and single cell plating into 96-well plates. Stable transfectants were isolated approximately 3 weeks after transfection and screened for expression of GFP by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Thereafter, six clones were selected for stable co-transfection. Each clone was then transfected with linearized pIRES-RAMPs or pIRES-Myc-RAMPs using LipofectAMINE. After 2 weeks of hygromicin B (Wako, Osaka, Japan, 0.4–0.2 mg/ml) selection, individual clonal lines of HEK 293 expressing CRLR-GFP/RAMPs or CRLR-GFP/Myc-RAMPs were established by monitoring with both flow cytometry and sequestration studies under fluorescence microscopy. Stable transfectants with stronger fluorescence tended to be poorly internalized (data not shown). These transfectant cell lines were maintained in the same DMEM buffer containing 0.25 mg/ml G418 and 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B. Myc-CRLR/RAMPs double stable HEK293 cell lines were established by the above-mentioned methods. Flow cytometry was performed to assess expression of constructs of CRLR-GFP in the absence and presence of RAMPs. Cells were dissociated, washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (1% FBS, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), and adjusted to 2 × 105 per tube in the same buffer with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were subjected to flow cytometry on an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using the EXPO 2 software (Beckman Coulter). Fluorophores were excited at 488 nm, and emission was monitored at 530 nm for GFP and 575 nm for phycoerythrin. Viability was assessed by exclusion of propidium iodide. For assay of cAMP accumulation, cells were seeded in 6- or 24-well plates 72 h prior to determination. Cells were replenished with Hanks' buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then treated with the indicated agonists in the presence of 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of lysis buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatants were removed and cAMP content determined using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions for the non-acetylation protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stably transfected HEK 293 cells (1 × 106/ml) were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes Inc.) in Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. After two washes, cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells (2 ml) were prewarmed to 37 °C and stimulated by 100 nm agonists in a quartz cuvette with a continuously stirring magnetic bar using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter. Data were recorded as the relative ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm (y axis) over time (x axis). HEK 293 cells stably expressing CRLR-GFP, CRLR-GFP/RAMPs, CRLR-GFP/Myc-RAMPs, or Myc-CRLR/RAMPs were plated onto 35-mm dishes containing a centered 22-mm well formed from a glass coverslip seated in a hole in the plastic. After rinsing with PBS, human CGRP or adrenomedullin was added to the dishes at a concentration of 100 nm in prewarmed serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA for the indicated times at 37 °C. For receptor recycling studies, following 30-min agonist treatment, cells were washed three times with prewarmed PBS and medium was replaced with fresh DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Internalization and recycling were stopped with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes Inc.). To examine whether Myc-RAMPs localize with CRLR-GFP during internalization and recycling, after the indicated incubation period, cells were fixed as described above followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The first antibody (monoclonal c-Myc, Invitrogen) was added at 1:250 dilution for 1 h at room temperature followed by three successive washes with PBS. Incubation with rabbit anti-mouse fluorescein TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako) diluted 1:30 in 1% BSA/PBS was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade. To simultaneously observe endocytosis of CRLR-GFP and transferrin, cells were incubated with 100 nm human CGRP or adrenomedullin and 100 μm tetramethylrhodamine-transferrin for 15 min at 37 °C, fixed, washed, and mounted. Events following agonist treatment were observed by confocal microscopy. Whole cell radioligand binding assays were performed as follows. Cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (3 × 105 cells/well). After 3 days, cells were pretreated with or without the inhibitor (0.45 m sucrose, 15 min) and the incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% BSA for the indicated periods (up to 3 h) at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 100 nmagonists. Following agonist exposure, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with either 125I-labeled human CGRP (10 pm) or 125I-labeled human adrenomedullin (20 pm) in modified Krebs-Ringers-HEPES medium (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mmd-glucose, 1% BSA) for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were harvested with 0.5 m NaOH, and associated radioactivity was counted in a γ-counter. For receptor recycling studies, following 30-min ligand exposure, cells were washed three times with prewarmed PBS and then incubated with fresh DMEM for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the medium was immediately replaced with ice-cold Krebs-Ringers-HEPES medium. Following the same radioligand treatment for 3 h at 4 °C, cells were harvested and then counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled CGRP or AM. Cells were observed under a Fluoview laser scanning confocal microscope (OLYMPUS). GFP was excited using a 488-nm argon/krypton laser, and emitted fluorescence was detected with a 510-nm band pass filter. For tetramethylrhodamine and LysoTracker Red, a 568-nm helium/neon laser was used for excitation, and fluorescence was detected with a 585-nm band pass filter. For microscopic visualization of CRLR molecules, we constructed a chimera consisting of the human CRLR fused to mutant GFP (EGFP) at its C terminus. To examine the functionality of the CRLR-GFP fusion protein, intracellular cAMP concentrations were measured. The intact HEK 293 cells lacked functional CGRP and AM receptors, because they showed little cAMP response to agonist stimulation (Fig.1 A, left). In contrast to other RAMPs, when stably expressed alone in HEK 293 cells, RAMP1 induced cAMP responses to CGRP (maximal cAMP reached approximately 8-fold basal), but not to AM (data not shown), suggesting that RAMP1 and endogenous calcitonin receptor may function as CGRP receptors (23Christopoulos G. Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tiakaratine N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells stably expressing CRLR-GFP alone, AM, but not CGRP, slightly increased cAMP contents; maximal cAMP level reached approximately 2.5-fold higher than the basal level (Fig. 1 A, right). This was consistent with the finding that HEK 293 cells express endogenous RAMP2 (data not shown). After stable co-transfection of individual RAMPs, expression of constructs of the CRLR-GFP was assessed using flow cytometry. The fluorescence of the CRLR-GFP in the cells expressing RAMP1, -2, or -3 together yielded at least 100-fold greater intensity than HEK 293 control cells, with individual single peaks, indicating that the three types of cells expressed CRLR-GFP at almost 100% (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, RAMPs increased the fluorescence intensity of CRLR-GFP; 11.5% for RAMP1, 6.8% for RAMP2, and 6.7% for RAMP3 (Fig.1 C). When expressed with RAMPs, CRLR-GFP had significant ability to produce cAMP responses to CGRP or AM that were concentration-dependent (Fig.2 A). Expression of CRLR-GFP and RAMP1 (CRLR/RAMP1) induced cAMP responses to CGRP or AM (EC50 of 0.34 or 1.1 nm, respectively), which were 100-fold more potent than that in CRLR-GFP-expressing cells. In contrast, CRLR/RAMP2 or -3 specifically responded to AM, with EC50 of 0.39 or 0.86 nm, respectively. Such ligand specificity of CRLR by RAMPs was also observed in intracellular calcium mobilization (Fig. 2 B). These [Ca2+]i increases by CGRP for CRLR/RAMP1 receptor and by AM for CRLR/RAMP2 or -3 receptor were receptor-mediated, because subsequent rechallenge with the same ligand failed to evoke significant responses, probably due to receptor desensitization. In CRLR/RAMP1 stable transfectants, following exposure to AM or CGRP elicited a small [Ca2+]i increase similar to that in HEK 293 cells stably expressing RAMP1 alone (data not shown), suggesting the existence of another CGRP receptor, calcitonin receptor/RAMP1, as mentioned above. These observations suggested that the fusion of the 238-amino acid GFP protein to the C terminus of the CRLR shows the full functional properties of the receptor in cells coexpressing RAMPs.Figure 2Functional characterization of the cells stably expressing CRLR-GFP and RAMPs. A, cyclic AMP responses. Cells were treated with various concentrations of CGRP or AM for 15 min at 37 °C. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. B, calcium mobilization. Cells were exposed to 100 nm CGRP or AM, and then rechallenged with either agonist (100 nm) to examine receptor desensitization. Representative results from three observations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the distribution of the fluorescent CRLR-GFP without co-transfection of RAMPs, the cell surface was labeled by brief exposure to tetramethylrhodamine-ConA (50 μg/ml in PBS). The green fluorescence corresponding to CRLR showed little co-localization with the red fluorescence of ConA, and was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The staining pattern suggested that CRLR-GFP was probably in the endoplasmic reticulum, representing the pool of newly synthesized molecules not yet transported to the plasma membrane (Fig.3 A). After 30-min exposure to 100 nm CGRP or AM, the distribution pattern of the CRLR-GFP was almost unchanged (Fig. 3, B and C). A large proportion of the green fluorescence corresponding to CRLR-GFP was observed on the cell membrane in cells stably co-transfected with RAMPs, whereas a small number of receptors was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.4). Measurement of radioligand binding revealed that exposure of cells coexpressing RAMPs to 100 nm CGRP or AM for up to 120 min produced rapid internalization of 50–70% of the cell surface CRLR-GFP, with similar kinetics (Fig.5 A). In all three stably transfected cell lines, addition of ligands caused the green fluorescence of the CRLR to disappear almost completely from the cell surface, depending on the ligand specificity; RAMP1/CGRP or AM, RAMP2/AM, and RAMP3/AM (Fig. 5 B). Pretreating cells with a hypertonic sucrose solution has been demonstrated to be effective in blocking receptor endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (24Perkins J.P. Hausdroff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptor. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 125-180Google Scholar, 25Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J.

Therefore, we preincubated our transfected cells with 0.45m sucrose for 15 min, followed by exposure to 100 nm ligands for various periods. Even after 120 min of agonist incubation, almost no receptor sequestration was observed (Fig.6, A and B). Sucrose pretreatment did not affect intracellular cAMP production by ligands (data not shown). The CRLR-GFP fluorescence moved into intracellular vesicles identified by the tetramethylthodamine derivative of transferrin, used as a marker of the endosomal compartment (27Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Then, the majority of receptor molecules showed significant co-localization with the lysosomal marker, LysoTracker Red (28Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) (Fig.8).Figure 6Inhibition of ligand-induced CRLR-GFP internalization by hypertonic medium.

Cycloheximide did not affect ligand-induced internalization of CRLR-GFP (data not shown). The cells were rinsed with medium containing cycloheximide, and incubated for various periods. After removal of the ligands, cell surface CRLR-GFP increased less than 10% in all three stably transfected cell lines (Fig.9, A and B). To investigate whether fusing the C terminus of GFP affects ligand-induced trafficking of CRLR, we have further constructed a chimeric molecule consisting of the CRLR fused to the Myc epitope tag at its N terminus (Myc-CRLR). Examination of numerous HEK293 cells stably co-transfected with RAMPs suggests that the rhodamine-labeled Myc-CRLR was diffusely distributed on the cell surface before agonist treatment (Fig.10). Radioligand binding experiments in three stably transfected cell lines indicate that exposure of 100 nm CGRP or AM caused rapid internalization of the cell surface Myc-CRLR, with similar kinetics (Fig.11 A). In all three transfectants, addition of ligands caused the rhodamine fluorescence of the CRLR to disappear almost completely from the cell surface, depending on the ligand specificity; RAMP1/CGRP or AM, RAMP2/AM, and RAMP3/AM (Fig. 1"

The structural data presented here highlight the flexibility of the kinase domain structure and provide information for the design of selective ATP competitive inhibitors of protein kinase CK2. root mean square hematoepoietic cell kinase Protein kinase CK2 (also misnamed “casein kinase 2,” after its propensity to phosphorylate the artificial substrate caseinin vitro) is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, Ser/Thr protein kinase belonging to the CMGC group (1Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). The CK2 holoenzyme is an heterotetramer composed of two catalytic subunits, α and/or α′, tightly associated with two regulatory β-subunits. The latter share no homology with any known protein except for the product of the stellate gene in Drosophila (2Livak K.J. Genetics. 1990; 124: 303-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of free catalytic subunits playing autonomous role in the cell has been also reported (4Dobrowolska G. Meggio F. Szczegielniak J. Muszynska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Stigare J. Buddelmeijer N. Pigon A. Egyhazi E. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 463-472PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the majority of Ser/Thr protein kinases, whose substrates present consensus sequences generally determined by basic and/or prolyl residues, CK2 recognizes phosphoacceptor sites that are specified by multiple negatively charged amino acids. CK2 is probably the most pleiotropic member of the protein kinase family, with more than 160 substrates known to date (6Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell. Cycle. Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Among these are key enzymes in different metabolic pathways and proteins playing important roles in a wide variety of cellular functions, with special reference to transcription, translation, signal transduction, and cell cycle regulation (7Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Such an extraordinary pleiotropicity is likely related to another unusual feature of CK2, namely its apparent lack of any mechanism of tight control. Unlike most protein kinases, the catalytic subunits of CK2 are in fact constitutively active, either alone or when incorporated into the heterotetrameric holoenzyme. Moreover, its association with the β-subunits may affect in opposite directions the catalytic activity, depending on the nature of the phosphoacceptor substrate (6Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell. Cycle. Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Such a high basal activity has been suggested to underlie the implication of CK2 in neoplasias and possibly also in infectious diseases. Indeed, CK2 activity is always abnormally high in transformed cell lines as well as in solid tumors (8Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and transgenic mice that expressed elevated levels of CK2α in lymphoid organs displayed a stochastic propensity to develop lymphomas (9Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Co-expression of c-Myc (9Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) or Tal-1 (10Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) transgenes in these mice or simultaneous suppression of p53 (11Landesman Bollag E. Channavajhala P.L. Cardiff R.D. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) resulted in neo-natal leukemia. The oncogenic potential of CK2α and α′ is also highlighted by their ability to co-operate with Ha-ras in fibroblast transformation (12Orlandini M. Semplici F. Ferruzzi R. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21291-21297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the constitutive activity of host cell CK2 is exploited by many viruses for the phosphorylation of proteins that are essential to their life cycle (8Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Given these premises, the development of specific inhibitors of CK2 would be highly desirable. On one hand, they may have pharmacological applications in a number of pathological situations; on the other hand, they will help to unravel the still enigmatic role of CK2 in cell regulation and in individual signal transduction pathways. It should be preliminarily noted in this respect that staurosporine, perhaps the most potent broad specificity inhibitor of protein kinases, is poorly effective on CK2 (13Meggio F. Donella Deana A. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Cesaro L. Guerra B. Meyer T. Mett H. Fabbro D. Furet P. Dobrowolska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This observation, in conjunction with the ability of CK2 to use GTP besides ATP as phosphate donor (14Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is symptomatic of a co-substrate binding site with unique features, which could be exploited for tailoring selective inhibitors. The most straightforward strategy toward this aim would be to grow crystals of CK2α in complex with ATP site-directed competitive inhibitors and to solve their structure. Based on our present knowledge, CK2 inhibitors of this type may fall in three categories (Fig. 1): (i) Isoquinoline derivatives (15Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). The lowest Ki value, however, is about 70 μm, denoting a quite modest affinity, especially considering that another acidophilic protein kinase, CK1, is inhibited much more efficiently (Ki = 5 μm). (ii) Halogenated benzimidazole/benzotriazole derivatives, whose parent compound has to be considered 5,6-dichloro-1-(β-d-furanosyl)-benzimidazole (16Zandomeni R. Zandomeni M.C. Shugar D. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), commercially available as DRB and whose inhibitory potential correlates with the number and the size of halogen substituents (17Meggio F. Shugar D. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In particular, the tetrabromo derivative of azabenzimidazole inhibits CK2 with a Ki value around 1 μm, whereas it is very poorly effective on several other protein kinases tested, and it inhibits CK1 much less potently (Ki = 39 μm) (18Szyszka R. Grankowski N. Felczak K. Shugar D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A drawback of tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole is its very low solubility in water, a property that might hamper its availability as well as attempts to co-crystallize it with CK2α. (iii) The natural anthraquinone derivative emodin (Fig. 1), extracted from the rhizomes of Rheum palmatum, a herbal medicine widely used in the Orient as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drug (19Yim H. Lee Y.H. Lee C.H. Lee S.K. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Emodin, in comparison with tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole, is more water soluble and has been recently reported to inhibit CK2 with an IC50 value around 1 μm (19Yim H. Lee Y.H. Lee C.H. Lee S.K. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), while being poorly effective on other Ser/Thr protein kinases. In some way, this observation is surprising, because hemodin was reported in the literature as a relatively specific inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinases (20Jayasuriya H. Koonchanok N.M. Geahlen R.L. McLaughlin J.L. Chang C.J. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 55: 696-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), with special reference to the receptor kinase Her-2 neu (21Zhang L. Lau Y.K. Xi L. Hong R.L. Kim D.S. Chen C.F. Hortobagyi G.N. Chang C. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2855-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The latter property is believed to underlie its potential to counteract cell transformation. However, CK2 is definitely more sensitive than Her-2 neu to emodin inhibition, as judged from theirKi values (1 versus 21 μm), raising the possibility that some of the effects of emodin are mediated by CK2 rather than protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition. Therefore, emodin represents a promising lead for developing more potent and selective inhibitors of CK2. All this prompted us to obtain crystals of maize CK2α (which shares more than 70% identity with the human protein and is easier to crystallize (22Guerra B. Niefind K. Pinna L.A. Schomburg D. Issinger O.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) with emodin in the active site, to compare the structure of the complex with that of ATP-bound maize CK2α. The results, reported and discussed in this paper, highlight some unique features of the active site of CK2α and will allow the design of new and more selective inhibitors of CK2. The catalytic α subunit of Zea mays CK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (22Guerra B. Niefind K. Pinna L.A. Schomburg D. Issinger O.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Z. maysCK2 α-subunit was crystallized as described in Ref. 22Guerra B. Niefind K. Pinna L.A. Schomburg D. Issinger O.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, with a crystallization solution composed of 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm sodium acetate, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in absence of co-substrate, either ATP or GTP. Single crystals grew in several days at 292 K. Because of their small size, data had to be collected at the x-ray beamline of synchrotron ELETTRA in Trieste. Before mounting, crystals were extensively washed and then soaked for several hours with a solution saturated with emodin. The inhibitor, an anthraquinone derivative (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) purchased from Sigma, is poorly soluble in aqueous media, and its solution presents a red color. At the beginning, sitting drops were uniformly colored red, but after some hours the color concentrated in the crystals, whereas the surrounding solution changed to pale orange, indicating the penetration of the inhibitor inside the crystals. Before mounting, the crystal was soaked for some seconds in a cryoprotectant solution, consisting of crystallization buffer and 5% glycerol. Measurements were done with a wavelength of 1.2 Å at 100 K and a crystal to detector distance of 300 mm.

The starting point for the refinement was the structure of the α-CK2 subunit, deprived of the ligand and solvent molecules (23Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The automatic crystallographic refinement was carried out with CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The presence of the inhibitor was revealed by a flat electron density in the active site of the enzyme, clearly visible both in a ‖2Fo − Fc‖ and in a ‖Fo − Fc‖ map. The presence of the anthraquinone derivative was also corroborated by simulated annealing omit maps. During the last cycles of refinement, 58 solvent molecules were introduced in peaks of the Fourier difference map close to hydrophilic residues. The final model, whose statistics are reported in Table I, presents an overall R factor of 19.2 (Rfree = 27.2) and a good stereochemistry: for 2747 protein atoms, the root mean square (r.m.s.)1 deviations from ideal values are 0.009 Å on bond distances and 1.4° on bond angles. No residues lie in disallowed regions, according to program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1F0Q). Crystals of α-CK2 obtained in the absence of co-substrate and subjected to soaking with the inhibitor emodin were isomorphous with that of the protein crystallized in the presence of ATP or GTP (14Niefind K. Putter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,23Niefind K. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2451-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The presence of emodin inside the crystals, suggested by the red color they assumed after the soaking procedure, was confirmed by the presence of a flat electron density in the nuleotide-binding site (Fig.2). This density was visible since the beginning of the refinement, both in the ‖2Fo− Fc‖ and ‖Fo −Fc‖ map, calculated with phases obtained without emodin in the model. As expected, emodin is located in the active site of the enzyme but in a position slightly different from that occupied by the natural co-substrates (Fig. 3). The binding of the inhibitor induces some significant structural changes in the N-terminal lobe of the macromolecule, although the overall architecture of the protein is similar to that observed in the binary complex with the ATP analog. Whereas the C-terminal domains can be almost perfectly superimposed (the r.m.s. deviation for 214 Cαs from positions 120 to 333 is 0.40 Å), the N-terminal domain is affected by the presence of the inhibitor, and the r.m.s. deviation for 113 Cα atoms from positions 7 to 119 increases to 1.29 Å. As shown in Fig.4, the alterations are concentrated in few areas. The two segments from residues 58 to 63 and from residues 102 to 108 are exposed loops, far away from the position of emodin. The electron density of the second long loop is poorly defined, indicating a remarkable flexibility. More interesting are the differences in the position of amino acid Asn118, of the side chain of His160, and of the triplet Arg47-Gly48-Lys49, which is part of the Gly-rich loop. As shown in Figs. 4 and5, the backbone segment composed of the three residues Arg47, Gly48, and Lys49 is shifted toward the interior of the active site, and this movement traps the emodin in an inner cavity. The inhibitor, in fact, is deeper embedded into the protein than the ATP or GTP molecules, with only the two outer six-membered rings roughly superimposing to the nucleotide base (Fig. 3). The inhibitor interacts with the protein mainly through hydrophobic contacts (TableII), filling a hydrophobic pocket between the two lobes of the protein, formed by residues Val45, Val53, Ile66, Leu85, Val95, Leu111, Phe113, Val116, Met163, and Ile174 (Fig.2). This cavity is, at least in part, isolated from the bulk solution not only by the mentioned 46–50 segment but also by residues Asn118 and His160 (Fig. 5). The Cα atom of Asn118 moves of about 1.16 Å from its original position, and its side chain is reoriented in such a way to block the exit of the ligand. The imidazol ring of His160 is turned back forming an H bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Arg47. This hydrogen bond was not present in the ATP-bound enzyme.Figure 4Changes in the structure of CK2 upon replacement of ATP with emodin.

Open table in a new tab Many of the nonpolar residues that make up the hydrophobic pocket surrounding emodin are conserved or conservatively replaced along the primary structure of the majority of protein kinases; this, however, does not apply to Ile66 and Ile174 (27Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The former, in particular, although conserved or conservatively replaced by Val in all the α and α′ CK2 subunits from different species, is replaced by an invariant alanine in all the other protein kinases. The presence of a bulky hydrophobic residue in position 66 could be particularly relevant in the binding of emodin and could confer unique features to the CK2 ATP-binding site. In addition to the hydrophobic pocket, some loose polar interactions may also contribute to anchor the inhibitor into the active site. The emodin groups involved are the two hydroxyls at positions 6 and 8 (Table II). The latter is 3.99 Å away from the side chain carbonyl of Asn118, the former is 3.40 Å away from the backbone carbonyl of Val45, 3.70 Å from the amide nitrogen of Arg47, and 3.98 Å from the imidazol nitrogen of His160. These distances seem too long for justifying the formation of hydrogen bonds, but the relatively low resolution of our model does not allow an unequivocal interpretation. In any case, these polar interactions would be consistent with the requirement of these two OH for optimal inhibitory potential (20Jayasuriya H. Koonchanok N.M. Geahlen R.L. McLaughlin J.L. Chang C.J. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 55: 696-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cavity occupied by emodin is slightly larger than the actual volume of the inhibitor, suggesting that emodin maintains some degree of freedom once encapsulated into the pocket. The shape of the electron density and the mean value of thermal B factor of emodin, higher than that of the backbone atoms of the enzyme (58 Å2 versus 50 Å2), are consistent with this hypothesis. Despite the lack of any strong hydrogen bond or polar interaction, the relatively high affinity of emodin for CK2 could be possibly accounted for by the conformational changes promoted by the binding of the inhibitor, with special reference to the aforementioned movements of strand 46–50 and of the side chains of residues 118 and 160. These conformational changes entrap emodin inside the hydrophobic pocket, and, by hampering its release, they may increase its apparent affinity for CK2α. Emodin is known to inhibit other protein kinases, besides CK2. For instance, its inhibitory activity against CK1 is only slightly lower than that measured for CK2, whereas that against PKA is 2 orders of magnitude lower (19Yim H. Lee Y.H. Lee C.H. Lee S.K. Planta Med. 1999; 65: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the case of CK1, the main requirements for the binding of emodin are essentially conserved. The crucial residue His160 is replaced by Asp135, but its side chain has the possibility to rotate as the His in CK2 does. In PKA the situation is different, and it can explain the much lower activity of emodin on this kinase; a superposition of PKA and CK2 molecular models shows that the positions corresponding to Val66, Ile174, and Phe113 in the CK2 cavity are replaced by Ala70, Thr183, and Met120 in PKA, and that the latter two are closer in space (only 3.80 Å apart). As a consequence, in the case of PKA, emodin cannot stand in the same position occupied in CK2, unless a relevant movement of the two residues Thr183 and Met120takes place. Emodin is also known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (20Jayasuriya H. Koonchanok N.M. Geahlen R.L. McLaughlin J.L. Chang C.J. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 55: 696-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Zhang L. Lau Y.K. Xi L. Hong R.L. Kim D.S. Chen C.F. Hortobagyi G.N. Chang C. Hung M.C.

( Tokyo ). 1995; 48: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but with IC50 values higher than that of CK2. The structure of a tyrosine kinase belonging to the Src family, the hematoepoietic cell kinase (HCK), in complex with ATP and different inhibitors is known. A comparison of these structures with that of the CK2-emodin complex reveals that the binding site of HCK can easily accommodate emodin, but possibly the binding is not so tight because the entrance of the cavity is not blocked after the binding of the inhibitor. In fact, residue His160 is replaced by an alanine (position 390 of HCK), which has a side chain that cannot rotate around its Cβ to form a hydrogen bond between its side chain and the residue corresponding to Arg47 in CK2. Because such a residue in CK2 contributes to lock the binding site and to trap emodin inside, its absence could influence the apparent affinity constant of the inhibitor for HCK. Emodin penetrates into the active site of CK2α, partially overlapping the position occupied by ATP; consequently, it prevents in a competitive manner the binding of the natural co-substrate. Hydrophobic interactions seem to be the driving force for the formation of the complex. The deeper position occupied by emodin in the hydrophobic pocket and the lack of a tail analogous to the triphosphate chain of ATP lead to conformational rearrangements that trap the inhibitor inside the binding site. These conformational changes involve Asn118, the side chain of His160, and three residues of the Gly-rich loop, Arg47-Gly48-Lys49. Superposition to our model of the structures of other protein kinases, whose activity is inhibited by emodin to different extents, discloses the important role played by His160 in the binding of the inhibitor. A movement of Asn118 is also significant; in the ATP bound enzyme, this residue has the function to coordinate the ribose O3′ atom, whereas in our complex it moves and prevents the departure of the inhibitor. The absence of the triphosphate tail is responsible for the inward collapse of the Gly-rich loop. Polar interactions between the backbone of residues 45 and 47 and the hydroxyl group at C6 of emodin may account for the importance of such a group to optimize the inhibitory potential. The elucidation of the molecular details of the interactions of CK2 with emodin discloses the possibility to design more potent and selective inhibitors of this ubiquitous and pleiotropic member of the protein kinase family."
https://openalex.org/W1965668748,"A current hypothesis explaining the toxicity of superoxide anion in vivo is that it oxidizes exposed [4Fe-4S] clusters in certain vulnerable enzymes causing release of iron and enzyme inactivation. The resulting increased levels of “free iron” catalyze deleterious oxidative reactions in the cell. In this study, we used low temperature Fe(III) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to monitor iron status in whole cells of the unicellular eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The experimental protocol involved treatment of the cells with desferrioxamine, a cell-permeant, Fe(III)-specific chelator, to promote oxidation of all of the “free iron” to the Fe(III) state wherein it is EPR-detectable. Using this method, a small amount of EPR-detectable iron was detected in the wild-type strain, whereas significantly elevated levels were found in strains lacking CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) (sod1Δ), Mn-SOD (sod2Δ), or both SODs, throughout their growth but particularly in stationary phase. The accumulation was suppressed by expression of wild-type human CuZn-SOD (in the sod1Δ mutant), by pmr1, a genetic suppressor of the sodΔ mutant phenotype (in thesod1Δsod2Δ double knockout strain), and by anaerobic growth. In wild-type cells, an increase in the EPR-detectable iron pool could be induced by treatment with paraquat, a redox-cycling drug that generates superoxide. Cells that were not pretreated with desferrioxamine had Fe(III) EPR signals that were equally as strong as those from treated cells, indicating that “free iron” accumulated in the ferric form in our strains in vivo. Our results indicate a relationship between superoxide stress and iron handling and support the above hypothesis for superoxide-related oxidative damage.

The doublesod1Δsod2Δ mutant is more severely compromised, exhibiting essentially a summation of the single mutant phenotypes (7Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv.

We have been searching for explanations for the severity of thesod1 mutant phenotype in yeast, and thus for the toxicity of superoxide in vivo. Superoxide is more selective in its chemical reactions than most other reactive oxygen species and thus less likely to exert its toxicity through generalized oxidative damage reactions of the type characteristic of hydroxyl radicals, for example. Recently a particularly attractive mechanism of superoxide toxicity was proposed (10Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), based on the observation that superoxide can very specifically oxidize exposed [4Fe-4S] clusters in certain enzymes, causing release of iron from the cluster and inactivation of the enzyme (3Fridovich I.

This process leads to further oxidative damage of other cellular components, as “free iron” 2It should be noted that there is no such chemical entity as “free iron” in an intracellular environment—it would most certainly exist only in complexes with other as yet undefined cellular components. We use “free iron” in quotes to indicate this fact. can promote, via the Fenton reaction, the formation of hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) (2Fridovich I.

Thus, in this scenario, superoxide is involved in the Fenton reaction by providing the necessary iron catalyst, and SOD both protects the [4Fe-4S] enzymes from inactivation and prevents the accumulation of excess intracellular iron. Support for this hypothesis has come from two directions. First, there is a demonstrated class of enzymes that contain exposed, superoxide-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster, the best-studied example of which is mitochondrial aconitase, which catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle. Other such enzymes include homoaconitase (involved in lysine biosynthesis), isopropyl malate isomerase (Leu1p) (in the leucine biosynthetic pathway), and IRP1 (involved in iron sensing and response in many eukaryotes, but not yeast) (22Flint D.H. Allen R.M. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2315-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R.

The sensitivity of aconitase activity to superoxide has been exploited as a method to measure steady state levels of superoxide in vivo (25Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 26Gardner P.R. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Second, altered iron status has been demonstrated in organisms lacking SOD (21Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 27Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28De Freitas J.M. Liba A. Meneghini R. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11645-11649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli cells lacking SOD have been shown to have elevated levels of iron that can be chelatedin vivo by the cell-permeant chelator desferrioxamine and detected by whole cell Fe(III) EPR (21Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). This pool of chelatable iron or “free iron” is clearly distinguishable from the bulk of cellular iron that is tightly bound to proteins and not accessible to the chelator. In untreated E. coli, the “free iron” is present as Fe(II) (EPR silent); upon addition of desferrioxamine the Fe(II) is bound and converted to Fe(III), which is EPR-detectable. This pool of Fe(II) was shown to accelerate DNA damage (21Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found evidence that a similar process may occur in eukaryotes: yeast lacking SOD have an increased requirement for iron in aerobic growth and show increased iron uptake and accumulation under certain growth conditions (28De Freitas J.M.

In the present study, we have extended this work to eukaryotes and adapted the in vivo whole cell Fe(III) EPR methodology to examine the iron status of yeast lacking either or both of the SODs.

After 72 h of growth, the final A600 of the culture was measured, and about 10–15 ml of the culture was spun down at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet (approximately 109cells) was resuspended in 10 ml of fresh growth medium without sugar (YP or SC) containing 20 mm desferrioxamine. The cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 15 min and then collected and washed once with 10 ml of cold 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol. Exactly 200 μl of this sample was transferred into an EPR tube, and the sample was frozen on dry ice and stored at –70 °C until EPR measurements were performed. The volume of culture used, the final A600 of the culture, and the total volume of EPR sample prior to transferring of the 200 μl to the EPR tube were recorded for calculation purposes. EPR spectra were recorded either using a Varian Century Series E-112 or a Bruker X-band spectrometer. Samples were maintained at –125 °C during the recording of the spectra using a finger Dewar (Wilmad product no. WG-853-B) filled with liquid nitrogen. Parameters used for low temperature Fe(III) EPR (for Bruker instrument) were as follows: center field, 1500 G; sweep width, 500 G; frequency, 9.27 GHz; microwave power, 20 mW; attenuation, 10 dB; modulation amplitude, 20.2 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver gain, 1e+05; sweep time, 41.9 s; time constant, 20.48 ms; conversion time, 10.24 ms; resolution, 4096 points; number of scans, 16. EPR data processing was done using either Origin or the Bruker WinEPR program. The gvalue was calculated using the standard formula g = hν /βH, where h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency, β is the Bohr magneton, and H is the external magnetic field at resonance (around 1550 G for our Fe(III) EPR signal). Quantitation was accomplished by double integration. Levels were calculated after baseline correction and compared with values of iron standards, the spectra of which were recorded on the same day as the samples under identical EPR instrumental conditions. The EPR signal from an external Fe(III) standard along with the intracellular yeast cell volume of 70 μm3 (33Guthrie, C., and Fink, G. R. (1991) Methods Enzymol., 194.Google Scholar) and the number of cells used for EPR sample preparation were used to quantitate the iron levels inside yeast cells. Reported numbers are averages of at least two independent samples. Cells were grown as described above. Typically, duplicate 2–3-ml samples from 50-ml stationary phase cultures were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rpm) and washed once in 5 ml of 10 mm EDTA, pH 8, and twice in 5 ml of metal-free water. The A600 and exact volume of the cell suspension on the last wash were recorded. The final cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of 10% ultrapure nitric acid and heated at 98 °C for 18 h. After complete digestion, 0.5 or 1.0 ml was diluted to 7 ml in metal-free water and subjected to analysis using a Thermo-Jarrel Ash Iris 1000 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. Wild-type yeast and the sod1Δ mutant were grown to stationary phase (72 h) in SDC and treated (15 min) with desferrioxamine to convert “free iron” to the Fe(III) state. Whole cell low temperature Fe(III) EPR spectra were obtained and are shown in Fig. 1 A. A large signal atg = 4.3 was observed for the sod1Δ strain, but the presence of either yeast or human CuZn-SOD was enough to largely prevent its appearance. Quantitation by double integration, comparing to spectra of iron standards measured on the same day, revealed that the yeast wild-type strain had a basal level of EPR-detectable iron of 12.8 ± 1.4 μm, whereas the isogenic yeast sod1Δ strain had a level that was 5-fold higher (49.2 ± 0.15 μm). Expression of the human CuZn-SOD in the sod1Δ mutant, which is known to fully restore that strain to a wild-type phenotype, also prevented the elevation of EPR-detectable iron (level was 15.7 ± 2.9 μm). The Fe(III) EPR signal at g = 4.3 is characteristic of ferric iron in a high spin complex (see Fig. 1 for examples of spectra). Most protein-bound iron does not give rise to an EPR signal at this g value (34Bencini A. Gatteschi D. Solomon E.I. Lever A.B.P. Inorganic Electronic Structure and Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 93-160Google Scholar), and as has been shown in E. coli, desferrioxamine treatment does not remove iron from proteins (21Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Evidence that this is also the case in S. cerevisiaecomes from the fact that our wild-type strain consistently has a very weak Fe(III) EPR signal when compared with the CuZn-SOD (sod1Δ) knockout strain, although they both contain normal amounts of iron. The EPR signal was not affected by variation in the level of iron in the medium used for desferrioxamine incubation. We tested three different incubation media—YP medium, rich in iron; SD medium, low in iron; and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, buffer, very low in iron—for the 15-min incubation of cells with desferrioxamine and saw no significant difference in the Fe(III) EPR signal intensity with any of these media (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that this effect was specific to one culture medium or one growth stage, Fe(III) EPR measurements were also conducted on samples prepared from log phase cultures (A600 0.3–0.5, at least 5 doublings short of the maximum density) grown in either YPD or YPG. In log phase, cells lacking SOD had smaller increases, around 2-fold, in EPR-detectable iron. Due to the requirement for large culture volumes (1–2 liters for log phase versus 10–15 ml for stationary phase experiments) and the smaller difference in the EPR-detectable iron levels between the wild-type and the mutants, the log phase growth conditions were not pursued further. Results similar to those with the 72-h samples were obtained when cells were grown for 24 h (data not shown), but the most consistent effects were seen in 72-h cultures, so we continued with those conditions. Several second site suppressors of the defects of the yeast sodΔ mutants have been identified (29Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol.

Mutations in PMR1, a Golgi P-type ATPase that plays a role in calcium metabolism, have been shown to rescue S. cerevisiae that lack SOD activity, probably by causing the accumulation of manganese, which can scavenge superoxide (35Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If elevated EPR-detectable iron is causally related to the phenotype ofsod1Δsod2Δ mutants, we reasoned that this suppressor would restore iron levels to normal. We tested the effect of the pmr1 mutation on iron accumulation in the yeast sod1Δsod2Δ double knockout strain. Fig. 1 B shows the EPR spectra for wild-type, sod1Δsod2Δ, andsod1Δsod2Δpmr1 yeast strains grown for 72 h and treated with desferrioxamine. The EPR-detectable iron level in the sod1Δsod2Δ strain was more than 7-fold higher than that of the wild-type. For duplicate samples done on the same day, the level for wild-type was 10.5 ± 0.6 μm, and for the sod1Δsod2Δmutant it was 64.5 ± 13.8 μm. The presence of thepmr1 mutation in the sod1Δsod2Δstrain decreased the EPR-detectable iron level to 26.9 ± 3.0 μm, much lower than in thesod1Δsod2Δ strain, but still approximately 3-fold higher than the level seen in the wild-type strain. This result indicates that the pmr1 mutation can partially suppress the elevated EPR-detectable iron phenotype observed insod1Δsod2Δ strain, which correlates neatly with the fact that the pmr1 mutation does not completely suppress the other phenotypes of thesod1Δsod2Δ strain. Absence of either CuZn-SOD or Mn-SOD caused significant increases in EPR-detectable iron. Fig.2 shows a summary of all our data for thesodΔ mutants grown for 72 h. The sod1Δmutant typically had around 5-fold elevation in EPR-detectable iron, the sod2Δ mutant had around 4-fold elevation, and thesod1Δsod2Δ double knockout strain had around 9-fold elevation but also showed greater variability from experiment to experiment. Total iron also increased somewhat under these conditions (72-h growth period), as was previously reported for a shorter growth period of 18 h (28De Freitas J.M. Liba A. Meneghini R. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11645-11649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and this increase in total iron can be fully explained by the increase in “free iron.” In the wild-type and single mutants, the “free iron” pool constitutes a relatively small fraction of the total iron—8% for wild-type and 20–25% for the single mutants—and the increased deposition of iron into the EPR-detectable pool in the single mutants is adequately compensated for by the increase in total iron (i.e. non-EPR-detectable iron is similar in wild-type and the single mutants). On the other hand, in the double mutant, the EPR-detectable pool reaches nearly 50% of the total iron, and the cells are apparently unable to fully compensate, so that the amount of non-EPR-detectable iron is lower in thesod1Δsod2Δ mutant than it is in wild-type. If the increase in EPR-detectable iron in yeast lacking SOD is connected with elevated O⨪2 levels, then it should be possible to replicate the effect in wild-type cells by increasing their O⨪2 production. Therefore, we treated wild-type cells with paraquat and measured EPR-detectable iron. Paraquat is a redox-cycling drug that generates superoxide in vivo. Although very low levels of paraquat (10 μm) are toxic tosod1Δ mutant yeast, wild-type strains tolerate much higher concentrations (up to 50 mm under some conditions), although growth is slowed at very high paraquat concentrations. Wild-type cells cultured in medium containing 10 mmparaquat for 24 h had at least a 5-fold increase in EPR-detectable iron per cell compared with untreated cells (Fig.3 A). A significant increase in EPR-detectable iron was also seen with 1 mm paraquat, a concentration at which the growth rate was only slightly affected (data not shown). These data support the hypothesis that the excess EPR-detectable iron is due to the deleterious effects of superoxide radical. An important feature of the phenotype ofsodΔ yeast strains is that it appears only under aerobic conditions. In order to see whether the elevated EPR-detectable iron seen in sodΔ mutants is due to the effect of aerobic growth, wild-type and sod1Δsod2Δ strains were cultured in air and also anaerobically (under nitrogen) for 24 h. Under aerobic growth conditions, thesod1Δsod2Δ double mutant had about 6-fold higher EPR-detectable iron than did the wild-type, whereas under anaerobic conditions, its level of EPR-detectable iron was not significantly different from that of the wild-type (Fig.3 B). These data clearly indicate that the elevated EPR-detectable iron seen in sod1Δsod2Δ mutant is dependent on the presence of oxygen. In the experiments described so far, we used desferrioxamine to chelate all loosely bound or “free iron” within the cells and convert any Fe(II) present to Fe(III) so that it would be detectable by Fe(III) EPR. (Unlike Fe(III) EPR signals, Fe(II) signals are very broad and difficult to detect.) In order to determine the proportion of iron present as Fe(II), we conducted Fe(III) EPR measurements on identical samples with and without desferrioxamine treatment. To our surprise, the EPR signals seen in untreated and desferrioxamine-treated samples of all the strains tested were practically identical (Fig.4). Similar results were also obtained for the wild-type and the sod1Δsod2Δ mutant when incubation was shortened to 24 h (data not shown). These data indicate that in yeast, unlike in E. coli, most, if not all, of the EPR-detectable iron is present in the Fe(III) state. In this study, we explored the iron status of yeast lacking CuZn-SOD and/or Mn-SOD using an EPR method that measures loosely bound or “free iron,” as opposed to iron bound to protein; this same method had previously been applied to E. coli lacking SOD. This method is particularly advantageous for the study of in vivo status, as sample preparation is minimal and there is no need for cell lysis. This powerful, noninvasive method can be used to monitor the cellular oxidative status as well as to quantify a pool of labile iron. Accumulation of EPR-detectable iron occurred under conditions that increase superoxide levels (in mutants lacking SOD(s) and in wild-type yeast treated with paraquat) and was not observed under conditions that minimize superoxide levels (anaerobic growth or expression of wild-type SOD). The facts that 1) longer culture periods increased the EPR-detectable iron level and 2) genetic changes—either overexpression of human Sod1p or the presence of a pmr1mutation—decreased the EPR-detectable iron signal are good evidence that the Fe(III) EPR signals were due to intracellular, as opposed to extracellular, processes. It is interesting to note that the single sod1Δ orsod2Δ mutant yeast are apparently able to compensate for loss of iron to the EPR-detectable pool by increasing their iron uptake (Ref. 28De Freitas J.M. Liba A. Meneghini R. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11645-11649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and data in Fig. 2), so that the level of non-EPR-detectable (or “normal”) iron is similar to that of wild-type. The doublesod1Δsod2Δ mutant, on the other hand, is not able to fully compensate, losing nearly 50% of its iron to the EPR-detectable pool and showing a somewhat decreased absolute level of “normal” iron relative to wild-type.

Although providing a definite function for p75NTR signaling remains controversial, there is substantial evidence to support the hypothesis that p75NTR can initiate a neural cell death pathway.

Furthermore, the apparent activation of p75NTR by neurotrophins in cells lacking the appropriate Trk receptor results in cell death in a number of experimental paradigms. The addition of NGF to developing chick optic nuclei or NGF (attached to glass beads) applied to developing chick retinas leads to increased cell death (21von Bartheld C.S. Kinoshita Y. Prevette D.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), whereas the addition of blocking antibodies to either NGF or p75NTR decreases naturally occurring chick retinal cell death (23Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Cultured sympathetic neurons and proprioceptive neurons also display increased cell death after the addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and NGF, respectively; and it was again possible to block this cell death by application of p75NTR antibodies (11Bamji S.X.

Despite the presence of a death domain in p75NTR, there is accumulating evidence that this region does not mediate the ability of p75NTR to promote cell death. Unlike the TNFR death domain, the death domain of p75NTR does not interact with other death domain-containing proteins (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol.

Moreover, we have recently shown that without the juxtamembrane sequence, p75NTR is unable to induce neuronal cell death, whereas deletion of the death domain sequence has no effect on the ability of p75NTR to kill (16Coulson E.J.

Little is known about the downstream components of the p75NTR death signaling pathway, although it is known that caspases are ultimately activated (see Ref. 29Coulson E.J. Reid K. Bartlett P.F. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 20: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 does not inhibit cell death induced by p75NTR (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol.

Recently, the six TRAF proteins, which are capable of activating nuclear factor κB, have been shown to associate with various regions of the p75NTR cytoplasmic domain (30Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 31Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. VanArsdale T. Zhang H. Shin H. Wang J.J. Leo E. Zapata J. Hauser C.A. Reed J.C. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30202-30208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Two novel zinc finger proteins, neurotrophin receptor interacting factor and SC-1, have also been found to interact with the cytoplasmic domains of p75NTR and appear to mediate cell death (32Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 33Chittka A. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10705-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of these proteins in p75NTR death signaling is unclear at this stage. Further characterization of the responsible death-inducing portion of p75NTR may ultimately help to determine the role of these and other p75NTR-interacting proteins in p75NTR and Trk signaling. To determine how the p75NTR death signal is transduced, the components within the p75NTR cytoplasmic region required for death signal initiation were sought. The domain that is both necessary and sufficient for initiating p75NTR cell death was found to be the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane 29-amino acid sequence we have named “Chopper.” It was found that membrane attachment was critical for cell death initiated by Chopper and that the ectodomain regulated Chopper activity. Chopper was shown to kill via a calpain- and caspase-mediated death pathway that is independent of Trk signaling and that is present in a variety of cell types. Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from postnatal day 0 C57Bl/6 mice and cultured as described previously (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories), differentiated with NGF (50 ng/ml; Peprotech) and serum withdrawal, and cultured for a further 5 days prior to microinjection. Wild-type Schwann cells and the 293T and M1 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum. Sensory dorsal root ganglial neurons, rat PC12 cells, and human 293T fibroblast cells were microinjected with DNA at individual concentrations ranging from 100 to 20 μg/ml as described previously (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, DNA concentrations were 100 μg/ml. Where two plasmids were injected together, the total DNA concentration did not exceed 220 μg/ml, and toxicity was not observed at this concentration. Live cells were identified by their phase-bright morphology and, in some cases, propidium iodide exclusion. Transient transfections of PC12, 293T, and wild-type Schwann cells were performed using Effectine (QIAGEN Inc.), and the numbers of live GFP-expressing cells were determined by FACS or cell counts. Cell survival of sptc35-transfected cells was compared with cells expressing GFP vectors. M1 cells were treated with 2 μmPalm29pen, and cell survival was compared with PalmCpen-treated cells. GFP protein expression levels were determined 24 h after transfection by FACS. Schwann cells, stably transfected with Bcl-2 (25Soilu-Hänninen M. Ekert P. Bucci T. Syroid D. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected with GFP or c35 by a CaCl2 method and glycerol shock (34Monuki E.S. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9978-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and then sorted by FACS for GFP expression after 24 h. Apoptosis was induced in Schwann cells by the addition of 10 ng/ml NGF in basal medium as described previously (25Soilu-Hänninen M. Ekert P. Bucci T. Syroid D. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All p75NTR plasmids contain modified versions of rat p75 cDNA. Expression vectors were either pPUC9 with a 550-base pair phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) promoter (18Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) or pIRES-EGFP (CLONTECH). All pPUC9 constructs retain p75 3′-untranslated sequences from the BglII site (position 1760). p75NTRnc, p75NTRtr, and p75NTRΔ35 have been previously described (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). sptc (signalpeptide-transmembrane-cytoplasmic) constructs were made by fusing the AflIII site (position 208) with the SacII site (position 849) of rat p75NTR, creating a Trp codon and bringing together Thr32 and Thr247. sptc35 is truncated with an I308A substitution. c35 constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction, amplifying the juxtamembrane 35-amino acid p75NTRfragment, which was then cloned into the pIRES-EGFP vector (EcoRI and BamHI sites), followed by introduction of double-stranded oligonucleotide “fragments” into the NotI and EcoRI sites, which include a Kozak sequence and an initiation methionine. The sptc35 Cys-to-Ala mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction. 2Oligonucleotide sequences are available on request. All constructs were DNA-sequenced; and where possible, protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. The 35-amino acid peptide corresponding to rat p75NTR residues 274–308 was purchased from Chiron (Melbourne, Australia). This sample was ∼40% pure, with the major impurity being a des-Pro 34-residue contaminant. All other peptides were synthesized in-house using Fmoc amino acids activated with O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. Peptides were synthesized on a Rink amide 4 methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin support so that all peptides contained a C-terminal amide group. Fluorescein-labeled peptides were generated by coupling 5- (and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to the amino-terminal end of a resin-bound peptide prior to its cleavage and deprotection. A palmitoylated analog of p75NTR (residues 274–302) was prepared by coupling Fmoc-Lys-(ε-palmitoyl) to the resin-bound 29-residue peptide, removing the Fmoc group, and then fluorescein labeling as described previously. The control peptide, KELPRQPpYFKQNCSQ, was similarly palmitoylated. Peptides were purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC, and their covalent structures were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The penetratin peptide, CRQIKIWFPNRRMKWKK (35Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), contained a unique cysteine residue at the amino terminus to facilitate conjugation, via a disulfide bond, to p75NTR peptides that also contained a unique cysteine residue. The penetratin cysteine residue was activated with 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide to generate the S-2-pyridylsulfenyl derivative, and this product was purified by HPLC. Formation of penetratin-p75NTR peptide conjugates was achieved by mixing 2 eq of derivatized penetratin with 1 eq of p75NTR peptide in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), incubating for several hours at room temperature, and then purifying by HPLC. The caspase inhibitor peptides t-butoxycarbonyl-D-fmk and benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem) were reconstituted in Me2SO and diluted in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The calpain inhibitors N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal and PD150606 (Calbiochem) were reconstituted fresh in Me2SO. Inhibitors were applied to neurons (3-h pretreatment) for a total of 5 h, including the 2-h incubation with 1 μm Chopper peptides, with a final 1% concentration of Me2SO in all conditions. Cell survival was determined by phase-bright morphology and propidium iodide exclusion. Cell death of retinal ganglia from developing chicken embryos was quantified using an enzyme immunoassay for histones (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (22Frade J.M. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 36Frade J.M. Bovolenta P. Martinez-Morales J.R. Arribas A. Barbas J.A. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Development. 1997; 124: 3313-3320PubMed Google Scholar). Using a 30-gauge needle and a Hamilton syringe, 1 μl of solution (100 μm diluted in phosphate-buffered saline) was injected into the eye vitreous of E4.5–5 fertilized chicken embryos. The eggs were allowed to develop for a further 24 h, and the retinal ganglial cell layer was dissected from E5.5–6 embryos into phosphate-buffered saline containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized by trituration through a 25-gauge needle. Cells were lysed and analyzed according to assay instructions by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring relative cell death by absorbance at λ405. To fully characterize the critical region of the p75NTR cytoplasmic domain that is both sufficient and necessary to mediate cell death, a series of expression constructs were made in which one or more protein domains of rat p75NTR were deleted (Fig.1 A). The ability of the resulting truncated p75NTR proteins to mediate cell death was determined by microinjection of these constructs into the nuclei of freshly isolated sensory neurons cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and measuring cell survival over the next 24 h. Constructs retaining the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane 35- amino acid domain along with the ectodomain (p75, p75NTRtr) were able to mediate neuronal death, whereas those lacking this domain (p75NTRnc, p75NTRΔ35) were not (Fig. 1 B), a result that is in agreement with earlier findings (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This indicated that the domain required for p75NTR death signaling is the juxtamembrane domain and not the region with homology to the CD95 and TNFR death domains. To determine whether the ectodomain of p75NTR is necessary to mediate the death signaling pathway, a construct lacking the ectodomain (but retaining the signal peptide sequence, transmembrane domain, and entire 152amino acid cytoplasmic domain, sptc152) (Fig.1 A) was tested for its ability to kill. It was found that removal of the ectodomain significantly increased the killing ability and more than doubled the amount of cell death induced by full-length p75NTR (Fig. 1 B). The construct was then further truncated, removing the region with homology to the CD95 death domain as well as the ectodomain (sptc35) (Fig. 1 A), and this was found to induce significantly more neuronal death compared with sptc152, killing >90% of the cells within 16 h of microinjection (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to full-length p75NTR(16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), these constructs retained the ability to induce cell death in the context of NGF-Trk survival signaling (data not shown). Suprisingly, expression of the juxtamembrane 35-amino acid p75NTR fragment with no transmembrane sequence (c35) (Fig.1 A) did not promote cell death in the presence of LIF; cells expressing c35 (confirmed by FLAG epitope staining (data not shown)) survived as well as cells expressing p75NTR with no cytoplasmic tail (p75NTRnc) (Fig. 1 B). To rule out the possibility that the degree of killing was due to increased expression of the truncated constructs, each p75NTR protein was coexpressed with GFP from an internal ribosome-binding site such that the expression of GFP was proportional to the expression of p75NTR (see “Materials and Methods”). 293T cells were transiently transfected with the various constructs, and the level of GFP expression was determined by FACS. No significant difference in expression was observed between any of the various constructs expressing truncated p75NTR forms and full-length p75NTR-expressing vector (Fig.1 C). The results indicated that the membrane-linked 35-amino acid domain was required not only for p75NTR-mediated death signaling, but was, by itself, sufficient to induce cell death that was of greater potency than when it was linked to other domains. This killing domain of p75NTR has been named Chopper to distinguish it from the CD95 homologous death domain region. As c35 was unable to induce cell death, we examined whether it might act to inhibit p75NTR-mediated cell death by a dominant-negative mechanism. When c35 was coexpressed with sptc35 in neurons, it was found to inhibit cell death in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2 A). To ascertain whether the Chopper sequence also mediates cell death in other paradigms of p75NTR-mediated death, we tested the effect of c35 expression in a Schwann cell system where it has been shown that NGF induces cell death through endogenous p75NTR(25Soilu-Hänninen M. Ekert P. Bucci T. Syroid D. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected Schwann cells expressing c35 or GFP were plated in the presence or absence of NGF, and their survival was monitored over a 24-h period. c35 expression was found to significantly abrogate Schwann cell death, blocking >90% of NGF-induced cell death compared with the GFP control (Fig. 2 B). This strongly suggests that NGF-induced Schwann cell death is mediated through a Chopper-dependent pathway. Previously, we had shown that Bcl-2 enhanced neuronal death mediated by p75NTR overexpression (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), so the effect of c35 on this neuronal death pathway was also examined. When c35 was coexpressed with p75NTR and Bcl-2, it again totally abrogated the effects of p75NTR-mediated killing (Fig. 2 C), again suggesting that this pathway is dependent on Chopper activity. The ability of c35 to inhibit neuronal cell death due to stress stimuli, namely NGF withdrawal, was also tested. No increase in survival of neurons treated with c35 was observed after 48 h (Fig.2 D). This result was consistent with our previous observation that the death pathway used by cells dying from stress stimuli is distinct from the p75NTR-mediated death pathway (16Coulson E.J. Reid K. Barrett G.L. Bartlett P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16387-16391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To further examine the requirements for death induction by the Chopper domain and to confirm the inhibitory action of c35, cell-permeable p75NTR-derived peptides were synthesized. Due to ease of synthesis, a 29-residue (lacking the 6 carboxyl-terminal amino acids), in addition to the 35-residue peptide of the Chopper sequence, was synthesized and modified as shown in Fig. 3 A (see “Materials and Methods”). To facilitate intracellular delivery of synthetic p75NTR-derived peptides, a 17-residue cell-permeable penetratin peptide (35Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) was conjugated to p75NTR peptides via a disulfide bond (see “Materials and Methods”). This linkage is stable in the extracellular, but is rapidly reduced once the complex is internalized, liberating the p75NTR peptide from penetratin (37Papini E. Rappuoli R. Murgia M. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1567-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescein-labeled p75NTR-derived c29 peptide conjugated to penetratin (c29pen) was rapidly taken up by neurons and was observed throughout the cell, as judged by fluorescence microscopy including confocal imaging (Figs. 3 B and4, A, C, and E). At a peptide concentration of 10 or 15 μm, all neurons were found to be fluorescent after 30 min, whereas at 3 μm, <20% of the cells were fluorescent at this time point (Fig. 3 B). Longer treatment of cells with 3 μm peptide (2 h) did, however, result in all cells taking up the peptide (data not shown). In contrast, no appreciable uptake of non-conjugated peptides (c29) could be detected (Fig. 4, B,D, and F), even after a 24-h incubation with 15 μm peptide (data not shown). Treatment for up to 2 h with a 15 μm concentration of the penetratin-linked free Chopper peptides had no significant effect on neuronal survival after 16 h in either NGF (76.2 ± 7.9%) or LIF (88.3 ± 3%) compared with untreated cells (86.6 ± 1.8 and 85.4 ± 5.3%, respectively); however, toxic effects were observed when neurons were treated with penetratin alone or penetratin-linked peptides at concentrations >20 μm and applied for >2 h (data not shown). To test the ability of these p75NTR peptides to prevent cell death, neurons were injected with sptc35 or control GFP expression plasmids and then treated for 30 min with 15 μm synthetic c35-penetratin conjugate (c35pen) or penetratin alone (pen). Neurons injected with sptc35 and then treated with cell-permeable c35pen peptide had a significant survival advantage over penetratin-alone treated cells (Fig. 5 A). The 29-residue peptide (c29pen) lacking the 6 carboxyl-terminal residues of c35 was found to confer equivalent protection against sptc35-mediated cell death (Fig. 5 A). The free Chopper peptides were then utilized to determine whether the Chopper domain functions during development of the nervous system. Developmental cell death of chick retinal ganglial neurons occurs during early embryogenesis (E3–7) and has been shown to be mediated through NGF and p75NTR (22Frade J.M. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 23Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To test if Chopper could inhibit retinal ganglial cell death, various peptides (pen, c29pen, and c29) were injected into the vitreous of E4.5 chick eyes in ovo. At E5.5, the retinal ganglial layer was dissected from the embryos and analyzed for apoptotic cell death. c29pen was found to significantly reduce the degree of cell death by 40% (Fig.5 B), indicating that the Chopper domain is involved in initiating downstream signaling of the p75NTR cell death pathway during the period of naturally occurring cell death. Our observations that transmembrane Chopper (sptc35) was a potent inducer of death and that free Chopper specifically inhibited this activity suggested that both proteins bound to the same accessory protein(s), but that membrane localization was required to activate the death pathway.

In Drosophila, heterochromatin is known to impose silencing on diverse euchromatic genes when these genes are rearranged to lie in heterochromatin or next to a heterochromatic breakpoint (PEV; reviewed in Refs. 26Spofford J.B. Ashburner M. Novitski E. Genetics and Biology of Drosophila. 1c. Academic Press, London1976: 955-1019Google Scholar and 27Weiler K.S. Wakimoto B.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 557-605Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Silencing can extend hundreds of kilobases away from the breakpoint (28Grigliatti T. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 587-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), apparently independent of the underlying DNA sequence. The spreading of silencing is accompanied by the spreading of HP1-staining chromatin (29Belyaeva E.S. Demakova O.V. Umbetova G.H. Zhimulev I.F. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nuclease accessibility of a silenced locus is increased when HP1 dosage is reduced (30Cryderman D.E. Cuaycong M.H. Elgin S.C.R. Wallrath L.L. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that HP1 controls local chromatin structure at a silenced euchromatic locus. Thus, at least some aspect of chromosome structure recognized by HP1-associated complexes is common to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Protein-protein interactions are sufficient to target HP1 to specific chromosomal sites (10Platero J.S. Hartnett T. Eissenberg J.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). HP1 has been found to self-associate (17Ye Q. Callebaut I. Pezhman A. Courvalin J.C. Worman H.J. J. Biol.

Henikoff S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 27-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Among the HP1 target proteins, the Drosophila heterochromatin-associated protein, SU(VAR)3–7, was found to co-localize with HP1 on Drosophilapolytene chromosomes and to co-immunoprecipitate with HP1 fromDrosophila nuclear extract (23Cléard F. Delattre M. Spierer P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5280-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); a mammalian homologue of the Drosophila PEV modifier SU(VAR)3–9 is enriched in heterochromatin and can be co-immunoprecipitated with the mouse HP1 homolog M31 (24Aagaard L. Laible G. Selenko P. Schmid M. Dorn R. Schotta G. Kuhfittig S. Wolf A. Lebersorger A. Singh P.B. Reuter G. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar); and the actin-related protein Arp4 inDrosophila co-localizes with HP1 in pericentric heterochromatin (25Frankel S. Sigel E.A. Craig C. Elgin S.C.R. Mooseker M.S. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The histone H4 isoform acetylated at lysine 12 is enriched in the β-heterochromatin of Drosophila (31Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J. Cell. 1992; 69: 375-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), suggesting that differentially acetylated histone could be a target for HP1 binding. Here, we present the first biochemical evidence thatDrosophila HPl binds nucleosomes and DNA, interactions that could be relevant to HP1-mediated heterochromatin assembly in vivo. HP1-DNA complex formation is length-dependent, cooperative, and relatively sequence-neutral. Peptides based on the sequence of the histone H4 amino terminus bind to monomeric and dimeric HP1 in vitro, although no strong preference was observed for the acetylation state of the peptide. These observations suggest that HP1 may serve as a bifunctional cross-linker in chromatin, linking nucleosomal DNA and nonhistone protein complexes to form higher order chromatin structures. Histone H4 N-terminal peptides were synthesized by the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center. The amino acid sequence of each peptide was NH3-SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRC-COOH. The C-terminal cysteine of the H4 peptides was labeled with Cy5-maleimide, which was prepared from Cy5 monosuccinimidyl ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (32Heyduk E. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3315-3322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 50 μg of H4 peptides in 50 μl of 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, were mixed with an equimolar amount of Cy5 and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mmdithiothreitol. The Cy5-labeled peptides were purified from the unlabeled peptides by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (33Heyduk E. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The purified Cy5-labeled peptides were dried by speed vacuum and redissolved in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.7. The Cy5-labeled peptides were visualized and quantitated by relative fluorescence intensity after being resolved by 40% acid urea PAGE (34West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For labeling of the 146-bp DNA fragment, an oligonucleotide primer labeled at the 5′-end with Cy5 was made as described (32Heyduk E. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3315-3322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the Cy5 primer (5′-CCCGGGATCCGGCTGGGCCCC-3′) at one end and an unlabeled primer (5′-CAAGTACTAACCAGGCCCGAC-3′) at the other end to amplify a 146-bp sea urchin 5 S rRNA DNA fragment (5′-CCC GGG ATC CGG CTG GGC CCC CCC CAG AAG GCA GCA CAA GGG GAG GAA AAG TCA GCC TTG TGC TCG CCT ACG GCC ATA CCA CCC TGA AAG TGC CCG ATA TCG TCT GAT CTC GGA AGC CAA GCA GGG TCG GGC CTG GTT AGT ACT TG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was purified using ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (35Matlock D. Heyduk T. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Core histone proteins from Chironomus tentans were a gift from Dr. J. R. Wiśniewski. The freeze-dried core histones were dissolved in 3 ml of 8 m urea containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the histones were subsequently dialyzed against 6, 4, 2, and 0 m urea, containing 2 m NaCl, 11 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 2–3 h for each buffer change. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 2 m NaCl, 11 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The DNA (146 bp) solution was brought to the salt concentration of 2m with solid NaCl and was mixed with the octamer at a 1:1.2 (DNA/octamer) mass ratio. The sample was then stepwise dialyzed against 11 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing, respectively, 2.0, 0.85, 0.65, 0.5, and 0.1 m NaCl. The dialysis against 2m salt was overnight, whereas the further changes occurred at 2–3-h intervals. The cut-off of the dialysis bags was 10 kDa. Reconstituted nucleosome cores were stored at 4 °C. To prepare nucleosome core particles with trypsinized histones, the reconstituted nucleosomes were treated with trypsin as described (36Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μg of trypsin was incubated overnight with 100 μl of reconstituted nucleosomes containing 0.74 μg of total histones at 4 °C. 2 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to stop the digestion. 10 μm recombinant HP1 (rHP1) (unless specified otherwise) was mixed with 10 nm Cy5-labeled 146-bp DNA or 10 nm Cy5-labeled reconstituted nucleosome in a buffer of 11 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. The sample was incubated on ice for 1 h. Glycerol was then added to a final concentration of 10%, and the samples were loaded onto an 8% native PAGE prepared in TBE buffer. The electrode buffer was also TBE. The electrophoresis was performed at 100 V for 1.5 h with a Bio-Rad Modular Mini-Protean II system. The fluorescent bands were detected on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The oligonucleotides used were based on an idealized Escherichia coli cAMP receptor protein binding site (37Ebright R. Ebright Y. Gunasekera A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10295-10305Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). They represent a nested set derived from the 54-mer sequence shown in Fig.1 and were chosen for reasons of convenience, not because of any special structural properties. Complementary strands were synthesized separately and then annealed in the appropriate combinations: 30 μg of each single-stranded DNA fragment was mixed, and the volume was made up to 8 μl with TE buffer. The sample was heated at 70 °C for 10 min in a beaker containing 250 ml of water. The beaker was placed at room temperature until the water temperature cooled down to about 30 °C. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with 32P using polynucleotide kinase; 2 μl of 10× kinase buffer (500 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol) was added, together with 2 μl of 1 mm ATP, 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN), and 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl; Promega) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were stored frozen at −20 °C until use. For HP1 binding assays, 1 μl of the kinased oligonucleotide was mixed with 10 μm HP1 (unless otherwise indicated) in a buffer of 11 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2 at a final volume of 10 μl. Binding was on ice for 1 h. 2 μl of glycerol was added, and the sample was loaded onto an 8% TBE native gel for electrophoresis. The gel was 15 cm long and 1.2 mm thick. The electrophoresis was carried under constant voltage of 150 V for about 3 h until the bromphenol blue dye ran to about 2 cm from the bottom. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. rHP1 was expressed and purified as reported previously (38Zhao T. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For peptide cross-linking analysis, rHP1 was pretreated with iodoacetamide to block the single cysteine in HP1 from reacting with small amounts of unreacted Cy5 in the labeled peptide preparations. 2 μmiodoacetamide-treated rHP1 was mixed with 2 μm H4 peptides in a buffer of 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl and was kept on ice for 20 min. Then the chemical cross-linker bis-[β-(4-azidosalicylamido)ethyl]disulfide (BASED; Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. The cross-linking was photoactivated with continuous exposure to four 150-watt flood light bulbs at a distance of 30 cm for 1 min. 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min before being loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE. After the electrophoresis, the gel was wrapped in plastic wrap and applied to a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics) to detect the fluorescence signal. Cross-linking analysis of rHP1 to test for self-association was similar but without prior treatment with iodoacetamide and in the absence of peptide. Western blots were performed using the Bio-Rad MiniProtean System according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HP1 antibody is a rabbit polyclonal directed against a chromo domain peptide (Ref. 39Saunders W.S. Chue C. Goebl M. Craig C. Clark R.F. Powers J.A. Eissenberg J.C. Elgin S.C.R. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 573-582PubMed Google Scholar; gift of Dr. S. C. R. Elgin). The N-terminal chromodomain and C-terminal chromo shadow domain were from an rHP1 stock that was purified by chromatographic methods as described previously (38Zhao T. Eissenberg J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15095-15100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) except that the purification was conducted at room temperature instead of at 4 °C. This resulted in degradation of the protein during freeze-thawing although no degradation was noticeable right after the preparation. This may be due to a contaminating protease activity that was not separated well from the HP1 protein. When these peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis, it was found that the two peptides were produced by a single cleavage in the middle of HP1, after Lys125. As a result, the N-terminal part contains the chromo domain, and the C-terminal part contains the chromo shadow domain. These two peptides were further separated with a 1-ml Mono Q column on a Smart System (Amersham Pharmarcia Biotech), which produced a purified N-terminal peptide fraction and a C-terminal peptide-enriched fraction mixed with some N-terminal peptide. A peptide containing the middle region of HP1 was produced using a one-step protein purification system (impect T7, New England Biolabs). To amplify the middle part of HP1 cDNA, two primers (5′-GACAACAATGTCGACTGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGATCGAATTCGGTAGATCC-3′) were used to amplify a central region of the HP1 cDNA. The amplification product was then inserted into the pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs) via SalI and EcoRI cloning sites, and the proteins were expressed in ER2566 cells. Purification of the peptide was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified product was an 84-amino acid peptide in the middle of HP1 (residues Glu58–Phe143), which normally links the chromo domain and the chromo shadow domain. To test whether HP1 can bind to nucleosomes, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using purified recombinant HP1 protein (rHP1) and labeled reconstituted nucleosome core particles. BSA was found to stabilize the reconstituted nucleosome cores, so a 5-fold molar excess of BSA (over HP1) was included as a carrier in all of the gel shift assays. This also provides a negative control for nonspecific nucleosome binding, since we observed that BSA does not affect nucleosome electrophoretic mobility. rHP1 significantly retards the electrophoretic mobility of reconstituted nucleosome core particles in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A), indicating an HP1-nucleosome association. Significant effects on core particle mobility are obvious at 1 μm HP1 or at a molar ratio of 100:1 of HP1 over core particles. Prominent features of the nucleosome surface that could provide substrates for HP1 binding include the N-terminal histone tails and DNA. To test whether this binding depended on the unstructured histone tails that extend from the nucleosome core (40Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar), we repeated the nucleosome electrophoretic mobility assay using trypsinized nucleosomes. Limited trypsin digestion of nucleosome cores selectively digests the N-terminal tails of core histones (36Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a significant fraction of the labeled DNA dissociated from the histone cores and migrated as free DNA. Interestingly, after trypsin digestion, a distinctive electrophoretic behavior is observed (Fig. 2 B). The trypsinized core fraction contained somewhat more free DNA, and this material disappears with increasing HP1, while a distinctive slow mobility complex appears. The trypsinized core particles begin to disappear at higher HP1 concentrations than required for comparable shifts of intact cores, suggesting that trypsin digestion of core particles makes HP1 binding to cores less efficient. In addition, the disappearance of the free DNA band with increasing HP1 concentration suggests that HP1 binds free DNA as well as nucleosome cores. A direct comparison of intact and trypsinized cores (Fig.2 B) showed that the trypsinized cores had significantly higher mobility than intact core particles, consistent with the expected loss of N-terminal tail peptides from the particles. To confirm HP1-DNA interaction, we tested the ability of rHP1 to shift the Cy5-labeled 146-bp DNA alone. Fig. 3 A shows a mobility shift of the DNA fragment with increasing amounts of HP1 protein, indicating DNA binding. Furthermore, the abrupt appearance of complexes between 5 and 10 μm HP1 (between 500- and 1000-fold molar excess of HP1) suggests cooperativity in complex formation. To test for sequence or structural specificity for DNA in HP1-DNA binding, circular BlueScript plasmid DNA (pBS) or linear DNA fragments produced by AluI digestion of the pBS plasmid were included in the gel shift assay, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Both the circular plasmid and the linear DNA fragments were able to eliminate the band shift of the Cy5-labeled 146-bp 5 S rDNA fragment. Thus, the HP1-DNA interaction is not sequence-specific, and HP1 binding does not require free DNA ends. To test whether there is a minimal length requirement for HP1 binding to DNA, labeled oligonucleotides of different lengths from 24 to 54 nucleotide pairs were tested in a band shift assay. As shown in Fig.4 A, HP1 complexes form with increasing efficiency as DNA length increases. Note that the length of the oligonucleotide does not contribute significantly to the band shift. Length dependence is also evident over a wide range of protein concentrations; 40 μm HP1 is required to obtain a detectable band shift using a 30-mer oligonucleotide, while HP1-DNA complexes are detectable with 5 μm HP1 when a 54-mer oligonucleotide is used (Fig. 4 B). When the amount of radioactivity in the HP1–54-mer DNA complex was quantitated (Fig.4 B, lanes 7–10), the relative increase in complex formation with doubling of HP1 concentration was found to be greater than that predicted from a single-site binding model. This observation further points to cooperativity in HP1-DNA complex formation. The distinctly chevron-shaped bands formed by electrophoresis of the HP1-DNA complexes are a reproducible feature of our binding experiments. This electrophoretic behavior was also observed for gel mobility-shifted complexes of DNA with human HP1hsα (19Sugimoto K. Yamada T. Muro Y. Himeno M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and suggests conformational heterogeneity among HP1-DNA protein complexes. Since DNA lies on the outside of the nucleosome, the DNA binding activity of HP1 could account for some or all of the core binding activity of HP1. To compare the relative affinity of HP1 for nucleosomes and DNA, we performed a salt titration on HP1 complex formation in vitro. Nucleosome cores are completely shifted by HP1 at 0.05–0.1m NaCl, and the shift is still evident at up to 0.4m NaCl (Fig. 5 A). Using the same concentrations of HP1 and DNA, a similar profile is observed with HP1-DNA complexes up to 0.3 m NaCl, but HP1 binding to naked DNA is nearly eliminated at 0.4 m NaCl (Fig. 5 B). Thus, while HP1-DNA interactions could substantially account for HP1-nucleosome binding, there appears to be some contribution of histone (and/or DNA conformation imposed by nucleosome wrapping) at high salt concentration. Side by side comparison of the mobility shifts observed with DNA and with nucleosome cores in the presence of HP1 emphasizes the distinct electrophoretic behaviors of these complexes. As shown in Fig.5 C, when the naked DNA and the nucleosome were run side by side in the gel shift assay, the pattern of band shift was different. While a small amount of material in the core fraction co-migrates with the HP1-DNA complex (lane 1), reflecting the presence of histone-free DNA after core reconstitution, most of the HP1-dependent core complex migrates more slowly (lane 2). This difference indicates that HP1 binds to nucleosome core particles instead of just stripping off the DNA from the nucleosome. Since HP1-nucleosome complexes appear somewhat more salt-resistant than HP1-DNA complexes and since the binding of HP1 to trypsinized cores appears less efficient than to intact cores, we considered a role for histone tail binding in the HP1-nucleosome interaction. The histone H4 N-terminal tails have been implicated in nucleosome assembly and the regulation of template accessibility in chromatin (41Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2388) Google Scholar). They extend out from the nucleosome core and contain four acetylatable lysines (Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16). In Drosophila, euchromatic histone H4 can be modified at any of these four lysines, whereas heterochromatic H4 is modified primarily at Lys12(31Turner B.M. Birley A.J. Lavender J.

The distinctive distribution of acetylated histone H4 isoforms suggested that HP1 may recognize and bind to heterochromatin through histone H4 tails specifically acetylated at K12 (45Winston F. Allis C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To test whether HP1 interacts with the H4 N-terminal tail and whether acetylation regulates this interaction, five synthetic 20-amino acid peptides based on the conserved H4 tail sequence were challenged to bind to HP1 in vitro. One peptide was nonacetylated, and the other four peptides were acetylated at one of four different lysines (Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, Lys16). These peptides were labeled with"

Among the most abundant and best understood of these dimers are the p50/p65 heterodimer and the homodimers of p50 and p65 (5Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). The functions of other NF-κB dimers are generally restricted to specific cell types.In most cells the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer exists in the cytoplasm as a complex with the inhibitor protein IκBα. IκBα inactivates the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer by masking the NF-κB nuclear localization sequences (6Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling pathways by extracellular signals, such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1, leads to proteolysis of IκBα, allowing active NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus (7Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).IκBα is composed of three distinct regions: an N-terminal signal receiving domain (SRD),1 a central ankyrin repeat-containing domain (ARD), and an acidic C-terminal/PEST-like region rich in the amino acids proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (8Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). IκBα is phosphorylated my multiple proteins in vivo. The C-terminal/PEST-like region in constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) (9Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10McElhinny J.A. Trushin S.A. Bren G.D. Chester N. Paya C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the SRD contains sites of inducible, signaling-dependent phosphorylation (11DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of IκBα in complex with the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer reveal an extensive and complex protein-protein interface (12Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 13Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The structures reveal that an apparently flexible segment of the NF-κB p65 subunit, which contains the NLS, becomes ordered upon complex formation and makes several contacts with IκBα. Interestingly, no direct contact is observed between the corresponding segment of the NF-κB p50 subunit and IκBα. The structures also reveal that the N-terminal domain of the p65 subunit contacts the C-terminal/PEST-like region of IκBα and its own dimerization domain through long range electrostatic interactions. Included in this interaction are many of the amino acid residues that mediate NF-κB-DNA contacts. These electrostatic interactions and the accompanying conformational change observed in the NF-κB p65 subunit were proposed to provide the DNA-inhibitory binding function of IκBα.Previous experiments have been carried out to define regions of NF-κB dimers that are important for IκBα binding (14Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For these previous experiments, we made use of a fluorescence polarization competition assay to assess the roles of different deletion fragments of NF-κB and IκBα. However, this approach limited our studies to NF-κB deletion protein constructs that display appreciable DNA binding affinity. As a result, we were not able to assess the contribution to overall complex binding affinity by regions of the NF-κB dimers independent of their DNA binding sequences.In this report we make use of a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay to isolate and characterize the interactions observed in the NF-κB·IκBα x-ray crystal structures. Our results show that: 1)Escherichia coli expressed full-length IκBα binds the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer with the highest affinity of the three NF-κB dimers tested. IκBα binding affinity toward the p50 and p65 homodimers is 20- and 2.5-fold lower, respectively, than toward the p50/p65 heterodimer. 2) The segment C-terminal to the NF-κB p65 subunit NLS contributes 5–6-fold to the overall binding affinity both in the case of the p65 homodimer and the p50/p65 heterodimer. By contrast, the corresponding segment of p50 contributes only 2-fold to IκBα binding affinity. 3) Within the context of the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer, neither the N-terminal domain nor the NLS of p50 contributes to IκBα binding. In contrast, the corresponding segments of the p65 subunit do make significant contributions to overall binding affinity. 4) When compared with its unphosphorylated form, casein kinase II-phosphorylated IκBα binds the p50/p65 heterodimer and the p65 homodimer with 33- and 9-fold higher binding affinity, respectively. 5) Finally, we report oxidative cross-linking data that illustrate the dynamic nature of the electrostatic interactions between the acidic C-terminal/PEST-like region of IκBα and NF-κB.DISCUSSIONThe protein-protein interactions at the interface between the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer and IκBα are complicated in nature. This complexity arises from the involvement of multiple modular and flexible components at the complex interface: namely, the ARD and C-terminal/PEST-like region of IκBα, and the N-terminal domains, dimerization domains, and the NLS polypeptides of the NF-κB dimers. We endeavored to quantitate the contributions made by each of these segments toward complex formation. In addition, we attempted to elucidate how CKII phosphorylation of the C-terminal/PEST-like region of IκBα modulates its binding to NF-κB dimers. Finally, we investigated the nature of the interaction between the NF-κB p65 subunit N-terminal domain and the acidic C-terminal/PEST-like region of IκBα.Our results demonstrate that the interactions between IκBα and NF-κB dimers can be divided into two classes. As the x-ray crystal structures of the NF-κB·IκBα complex would clearly indicate, the NLS polypeptide of p65 contributes significantly toward IκBα binding affinity. The primary sequence of the NF-κB p50 and p65 subunit differ significantly in this region which might explain, at least in part, the selectivity of IκBα toward p65. We have also shown that in the p50/p65 heterodimer, the p50 NLS polypeptide, but not the NLS itself (amino acid residues 360–363), contributes to IκBα binding affinity. This observation is particularly interesting in light of several recent reports indicating that the inactive NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer in complex with IκBα shuttles continuously between the cytoplasm and nucleus (20Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 21Tam W.F. Lee L.H. Davis L. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It would seem that although nuclear exit of this complex is mediated by a leucine-rich nuclear exit sequence within the IκBα SRD (amino acids 44–55) (22Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), constitutive nuclear import could depend on the partially unmasked p50 NLS.Our experiments further demonstrate a second class of NF-κB·IκBα interactions involving the acidic/PEST-like region of IκBα and the NF-κB p65 subunit N-terminal domain. We show that although these contacts contribute to a lesser extent toward overall NF-κB·IκBα complex binding affinity, they probably affect significant functional consequences. We characterized these interactions as dynamic in nature. Our cross-linking experiments show that the cysteine mutant IκBα C-terminal/PEST-like region forms covalent bonds with a distance-dependent efficiency at three different positions on the p65 subunit covering a total distance of greater than 20 Å.We observe that the N-terminally truncated p50/p65 heterodimer or p65 homodimer bind IκBα with higher affinities than the respective full-length dimers. This suggests that the absence of the N-terminal domains allows the acidic/PEST-like region of IκBα more freedom of movement, enhancing its ability to mediate further nonspecific interactions. Finally, we also tested which residues at the C terminus of IκBα are essential for NF-κB binding. We observe that in the absence of C-terminal phosphorylation by CKII the boundary is roughly residue Ser287. However, this boundary changes when the acidic PEST is phosphorylated by CKII. It appears that the entire C terminus is required for full binding activity once the PEST-like region of IκBα is phosphorylated.The NF-κB·IκBα x-ray crystal structures indicate that this second interaction that we have described juxtaposes two large, oppositely charged faces. One contains the acidic IκBα PEST-like region, and the other involves the basic DNA binding surfaces of the p65 N-terminal domain in a conformation radically different from that observed in its DNA-bound crystal structures. Though we still cannot rule out crystal packing interactions as a contributor to this observed “closed” conformation of the IκBα-bound NF-κB p65 subunit, these data support our proposed model of NF-κB DNA binding inhibition by electrostatic interference and long range, dynamic interactions with IκBα.

Thus, this system offers an opportunity to test the role of TFIIIB independent of a requirement of TFIIIC.

Analysis of the yeast genome sequence shows that Ty2 and Ty4 also occupy this region upstream of a fraction of tRNA genes. Ty5 integrates into regions of silenced DNA, including the silent mating type loci and telomeres. Hence Ty1, Ty2, Ty4, and Ty5 exhibit regional integration specificity. Despite similarities with these other elements, Ty3 differs in that it integrates within a highly defined window, one or two base pairs (bp) upstream of pol III transcription initiation sites. Targeting of integration appears to be directed by the cooperative actions of Ty3 element- and cell-encoded factors. For example, in addition to the element-encoded integrase protein, Ty3 and Ty1 targeting requires the presence of a transcriptionally competent pol III promoter (5Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Devine S.E. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 620-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and Ty5 targeting requires factors involved in the establishment of silent chromatin (7Zou S. Voytas D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7412-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Class III genes, including plasmid-borne U6, 5S, and tRNA genes, are used in vivo for position-specific Ty3 integration. Comparison of integration sites suggests that Ty3 integration preference is not a direct function of specific local sequences. Each class of pol III-transcribed genes differs from the others in composition of promoter elements (8White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar) and distances of common motifs from the integration site (5Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Pol III promoter mutations that affect transcription factor binding at positions distant from the integration site also block Ty3 integration (5Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results lead to the hypothesis that interactions with the promoter-bound pol III transcription complex determine the selection of Ty3 integration sites. Pol III genes use transcription factors (TF) IIIC and IIIB to assemble pol III at the transcription initiation site (reviewed in Ref. 8White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar). TFIIIC is composed of six subunits and interacts with the box A and box B promoter elements. TFIIIB is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a 68-kDa protein (B“ or Tfc5, also referred to as TFIIIB90), and a 67-kDa protein (Brf, also called TFIIIB70). TBP and Brf are tightly associated in a complex referred to as B′, which is chromatographically separable from B”. The contributions of these transcription factors to the specific integration of Ty3 have been investigated using an in vitrointegration assay. Reconstitution of specific integration into the initiation site of a tRNA gene requires Ty3 virus-like particles (VLPs), the plasmid-borne target gene, and DEAE-purified TFIIIB- and TFIIIC-containing fractions, consistent with DNA-bound TFIIIB, or TFIIIB and TFIIIC together, recruiting the Ty3 preintegration complex to its site of integration (10Kirchner J. Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because TFIIIC is required to load TFIIIB onto DNA at the tRNA gene promoter, the respective roles of these factors could not be distinguished using the tRNA gene target. The roles of TFIIIB and TFIIIC in pol III transcription have been examined in detail. In vivo, TFIIIC recruits TFIIIB to the region upstream of the transcription initiation site of all yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) pol III genes (11Eschenlauer J.B. Kaiser M.W. Gerlach V.L. Brow D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Burnol A.-F. Margottin F. Schultz P. Marsolier M.-C. Oudet P. Sentenac A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TFIIIB then recruits pol III for initiation of transcription (13Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Two sets of observations show that TFIIIB is the central initiation factor of pol III: 1) TFIIIC can be removed from tRNA genes after TFIIIB is assembled at the promoter without loss of transcription activity (13Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). 2) SNR6, which does not require TFIIIC for loading TFIIIBin vitro, can be transcribed by pol III in the presence of TFIIIB only (15Margottin F. Dujardin G. Gerard M. Egly J.-M. Huet J. Sentenac A. Science. 1991; 251: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); TFIIIB components have been demonstrated to contact pol III subunits directly (17Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P.

Biol. 2000; 20: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ability to bind TFIIIB directly to the SNR6 gene in the absence of TFIIIC provides an in vitro system in which TFIIIB-bound DNA can be tested for TFIIIC-independent Ty3 targeting. In the experiments that are presented here, distinct roles for TFIIIB and TFIIIC in Ty3-specific integration have been investigated by developing a variation of a previously devised in vitro integration assay. The use of the three recombinant TFIIIB subunits, TBP, Brf, and B“ (22Kassavetis G.A. Nguyen S.T. Kobayashi R. Kumar A. Geiduschek E.P. Pisano M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9786-9790Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), allows a precise definition of the minimal protein requirements for specific integration of Ty3. We demonstrate that TFIIIB recruits the Ty3 preintegration complex to its site of integration. Recombinant B′ (i.e. TBP + Brf) is sufficient to direct specific integration of Ty3 in vitro and B” contributes strongly to the efficiency of integration, conceivably through the DNA distortion that it generates near the integration site. TFIIIC contributes to targeting specificity and selection by determining the orientation of TFIIIB on the promoter. Standard methods were used for culturing and transforming Escherichia coli andS. cerevisiae and for recombinant DNA constructions (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). All plasmids were amplified in, and prepared from, E. coliHB101. Single-stranded DNA for site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis was prepared from E. coli RZ1032. Plasmid pU6LboxB (24Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was the pol III transcription template and target for Ty3 integration in vitro. Plasmids pDLC370 (5Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and pLY1842 served as PCR controls for integration into r-U6 and l-U6, respectively. Plasmid pDLC370 has a Ty3 insertion with Ty3 sequence beginning at position −5 relative to the transcription start site r-U6. Plasmid LY1842 was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment generated with primers 242 and 411 (see below) and pU6LboxB containing a Ty3 insertion at bp −2 relative to the l-U6 TATA transcription start site (Fig. 2 A) into pCRII-TOPO. The pLY1855 plasmid was generated by removing the δ TATA box from pU6LboxB by site-directed mutagenesis using an oligonucleotide with sequence 5′-GCTGGAGATACAGAACTATTATGG-3′. Plasmid pU6LboxB-G56 was constructed by changing the conserved C56 of the SNR6 boxB to G using an oligonucleotide with sequence 5′-GGGGGGAGTCCAACGCCCGATTGC-3“. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Ty3 VLPs were prepared from S. cerevisiae strain AGY9 (pEGTy3-1) cells as described (25Hansen L.J. Chalker D.L. Orlinsky K.J. Sandmeyer S.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1414-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified TFIIIC (oligobox B+ fraction) and pol III (MonoQ fraction), rTBP, rBrf, and rB“, were prepared and quantitated as described or referenced (13Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H.

TBP and B“ were fully active; Brf was ∼20% active. Under standard conditions (Figs.

These components were preincubated for 30 min at 23 °C, shifted to 15 °C, and then 5 μg (protein) of Ty3 VLP fraction was added for 15 min. When purified TFIIIC was also present, it was preincubated with DNA for 30 min before adding TFIIIB components. Samples contained 10.5 nm TFIIIC for the experiment shown in Fig. 3. For Fig. 4, samples contained the noted multiples of 0.5 nm TFIIIC. For Fig. 5 A, factors were preincubated with DNA for 1 h at 23 °C prior to adding VLPs. For Fig. 5 B, B′-DNA complexes were allowed to form for 30 min prior to an additional 15-min incubation with subsequently added B”. Reactions were stopped by adding proteinase K, SDS, and EDTA, pH 8.0, to final concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml, 0.2% (w/v), and 20 mm, respectively, and incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was precipitated and redissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA.Figure 4TFIIIC affects Ty3 integration by directing the assembly of TFIIIB on the U6 promoter. Integration reactions were performed with 0.7–1.5 nm rTFIIIB subunits and 0.5–4.0 nm TFIIIC (shown as multiples of 0.5 nm).

Sandmeyer S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8229-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with the following changes to make detection specific to the SNR6 target: primer 242 (5′-GGAACTGCTGATCATCTCT-3′) (200 ng) and primer 411 (5′-CGAAACACAAGACAACCC-3′) (164 ng) were used for amplification of 40 ng (18 fmol) of DNA from the integration reactions (first incubation for 2.5 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min and renaturation/extension at 65 °C for 1 min, followed by 5 min at 72 °C). The standard amplification reactions in a total of 40 ng of target plasmid DNA yielded products equivalent to those of reactions containing 1.6 to 8 fg of Ty3-positive target plasmid in a total of 40 ng of target plasmid. Thus, the products are highly specific to positive plasmid templates. To control for consistent DNA recovery from the integration reaction and for consistent operation of the above PCR, primers 679 (5′-ACTCCCCGTCGTGTAGATAACTACG-3′) and 680 (5′-AAGCCATACCAAACGACGAGC-3′) were used to amplify the β-lactamase gene carried by the target plasmids. PCR amplification of 100 pg of DNA (5 μl of 1:200 reaction dilution) was performed using 200 ng of each primer (first denaturation for 2.5 min at 95 °C, followed by 18 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, renaturation at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, with a final 5 min at 72 °C). PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing, 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The fluorescence video image was quantified using a gel documentation program. PCR fragments representing specific integrations were separated as described above. Bands containing specific fragments were excised from the gel, DNA was eluted, ligated into the vector pCRII-TOPO according to the supplier's instructions, and transformed into E. coli.

Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Photochemical cross-linking was performed with an 88-bp DNA probe containing the SNR6 TATA box (31Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The TATA box was modified to TGTAAATA to provide a unique orientation of TFIIIB-DNA complexes in conjunction with the TBP mutant TBPm3 (24Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were formed as described for in vitro integration but in a 20-μl reaction volume, with β-mercaptoethanol in place of dithiothreitol, 10 fmol of photoprobe, 200 ng of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC), and NaCl at 70 mm. Where indicated, B′-DNA complexes were formed with 400 fmol of TBPm3 and 144 fmol of Brf for 60 min at ∼20 °C. B“, in the indicated amounts, 5 μg of VLPs or B” and 5 μg of VLPs (preincubated together for 15 min at 0 °C) was added for an additional 20 min, followed by 2 min of UV irradiation. Reaction mixtures were treated with nucleases and resolved on 9% polyacrylamide-SDS gel as described (32Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In order to investigate whether TFIIIB suffices for Ty3 position-specific integration, a previously used in vitro tRNA gene integration assay (10Kirchner J. Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was modified to utilizeSNR6 as a target. Integration reactions contained Ty3 VLPs, the S. cerevisiae SNR6 gene in plasmid pU6LboxB (24Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and combinations of TFIIIB and TFIIIC. Pol III, previously shown to inhibit Ty3 integration (33Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was omitted. TFIIIC was supplied either as a DEAE column fraction or as highly purified protein (27Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); TFIIIB was added either as a DEAE fraction or as recombinant protein (rTFIIIB). Integration of Ty3 into the target plasmid was detected using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay (Fig.1 A). One PCR primer anneals to the SNR6 gene and the other to a unique sequence in Ty3. A diagnostic PCR template sequence is created when Ty3 integrates into the SNR6 target in one of the two possible orientations, and the length of the corresponding PCR-amplified fragment specifies the position of integration. This assay differs from the previously described tRNA gene assay (10Kirchner J. Connolly C.M. Sandmeyer S.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) in that the target primer does not overlap with the Ty3 insertion, so that detection of integration is not limited to a single location; additional rounds of PCR are used to increase assay sensitivity. The integration assay uses the plasmid pU6LboxB, which contains a modified SNR6 gene with altered flanking DNA sequence (24Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as its Ty3 target. A duplication of the SNR6transcriptional start site and terminator in pU6LboxB allows TFIIIB-DNA complexes oriented to promote transcription away from theSNR6 gene (leftward in Fig. 1 B) to be monitored in a transcription assay. In constructing pU6LboxB, theSNR6 TATA box was inverted to preferentially orient TFIIIB for leftward transcription, and the boxB promoter element was moved closer to the natural SNR6 boxA promoter element in order to optimize the ability of TFIIIC to direct TFIIIB binding at the SNR6 TATA box. TFIIIC shifts the preferred direction of transcription from leftward to rightward (Fig. 1 B) on this template. In constructing pU6LboxB, genomic sequence upstream of theSNR6 TATA box containing a Ty1 LTR (or δ) element was deleted, positioning a second TATA box (which originally flanked theSNR6 gene-distal end of the δ element) between theSNR6 TATA box and the terminator for leftward transcription. This “δ TATA box” (identical in sequence and orientation to theSNR6 TATA box in pU6LboxB) generates its own pair of divergent transcription units. Thus, TFIIIB binding autonomously to either TATA box of pU6LboxB in either orientation generates four primary transcripts (l-U6, r-U6, l-δ, and r-δ in Fig. 1 B). By selecting the site and orientation of TFIIIB binding, TFIIIC favors the formation of the r-U6 transcript and restricts the formation of the others (Ref. 24Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and data not shown). The ability to reconstitute specific integration of Ty3 upstream ofSNR6 in vitro was first tested using DEAE column fractions enriched for TFIIIB and TFIIIC. Plasmid pDLC370 (“Experimental Procedures”), which contains a Ty3 insertion, was used as a template for primers 411 and 242 in PCR to amplify a 442-bp fragment that served as a positive control for integration into the r-U6 initiation site (9Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As a control for the quantity of DNA in each integration reaction, primers 679 and 680 were also used to amplify the β-lactamase gene on pU6LboxB. PCR products were separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Reconstitution of integration at the SNR6gene in these preliminary trials (data not shown) depended on the presence of Ty3 VLPs, as PCR amplification of reactions lacking VLPs was equivalent to amplification of the target plasmid alone. Integration reactions performed with TFIIIB and TFIIIC generated a predominant PCR product, whose length was consistent with specific integration close to the r-U6 transcription initiation site (Fig.2 A). A random (or at least complex and dispersed) pattern of integration was observed with Ty3 VLPs alone (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The advantage of the relatively complex pU6LboxB construct is that it permits a determination of whether TFIIIB alone suffices to mediate Ty3-specific integration, while also examining whether TFIIIC exerts an effect on integration site selection. The binding of rTFIIIB to the target plasmid was verified by its ability to direct transcription by pol III in vitro. The four expected transcription products were generated, with preferential production of the l-U6 transcript, as expected (data not shown). Integration at the four transcription initiation sites is predicted to produce four different classes of PCR products (Fig. 2 A). Integrations were performed under conditions tested for transcription activity, and with comparable concentrations and proportions of rTFIIIB and plasmid DNA (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). The combination of rTFIIIB and TFIIIC yielded a single PCR-amplified integration product (Fig.2 B, lane 3). Integration in the presence of rTFIIIB alone generated three major PCR products (lane 4) each consistent in size with integration at one of the four transcription initiation sites (Fig. 2 A); the size of the smallest PCR fragment corresponded with an integration event near the initiation site of r-U6 transcription (Fig. 2 B, compare lane 4 tolanes 3 and 5). The sizes of the remaining products corresponded to PCR templates generated by specific integration very close to the l-δ (lane 4, largest fragment, ∼552 bp), and r-δ and l-U6 (middle size fragment, ∼492 and ∼501 bp) transcription initiation sites, respectively. To determine whether these PCR products indeed report specific integration events, DNA fragments contained in the bands marked at the side of Fig. 2 B were recovered from a gel (cf. Fig. 2 B, lane 4) and cloned into the vector pCRII-TOPO. Sequences were determined for the Ty3-SNR6 junction in five clones from each fragment preparation using the SNR6internal PCR primer (Fig. 2 A). Sequencing of these clones demonstrated that the smallest fragment corresponds to Ty3 sequence beginning at positions −6 and −7 relative to the r-U6 transcription start site (Fig. 2 C). Because Ty3 integrates by means of a staggered strand transfer that is repaired, resulting in repeats of the intervening sequence on either end of the Ty3, this corresponds to a gene-proximal strand transfer between positions 1 and −1 and between −1 and −2, respectively, relative to the start site of transcription. The middle fragment appears to represent integration events at the l-U6 and/or r-δ transcription initiation sites. The identified integration sites in this region showed Ty3 sequence positioned at −2 and +5 relative to the l-U6 transcription initiation site, but cannot be correlated unambiguously with a specific partner TFIIIB-DNA complex because these two initiation sites are located very close together. Analysis of clones derived from the largest product yielded Ty3 sequence at each transcription initiation site, including +3, relative to l-δ. We interpret this as due to contamination in the region of this weaker and slower migrating band in the gel by shorter PCR products. However, the fragment size, together with the sequence of one of the five analyzed clones (Fig. 2 C), suggests that Ty3 integration was also associated with the l-δ transcription start site. The patterns of integration directed by rTFIIIB alone (Fig. 2B, lane 4) and TFIIIB plus TFIIIC (lane 3) were quite distinctive. The rTFIIIB-mediated integration products represented each of the four initiation sites, as just described, but TFIIIB and TFIIIC together generated PCR products consistent with integration primarily at the r-U6 transcription start site. Although the preceding experiment indicates that TFIIIB is the only pol III factor that is absolutely required for specific integration of Ty3, it is necessary to eliminate the possibility that the Ty3 VLP fraction contains and contributes TFIIIC. This seems unlikely because"

Using antibodies specific for DIPEN341 and342FFGVG neoepitopes, we have detected MMP-derived fragments in conditioned medium and cultured cartilage, by radioimmunoassay, Western blotting, and immunolocalization. Radioimmunoassay revealed that the amount (pmol of epitope/mg of total glycosaminoglycan) of 342FFGVG epitope released from cartilage remained constant over a 5-day culture period and was not increased by IL-1α or retinoate. However, theproportion (pmol of epitope/mg of released glycosaminoglycan) of 342FFGVG epitope released was decreased upon stimulation, consistent with the involvement of a non-MMP proteinase, such as aggrecanase. The data suggest that in vitroMMPs may be involved in the base-line catabolism of aggrecan. Immunolocalization experiments showed that DIPEN341 and ITEGE373 epitopes were increased by treatment with IL-1α and retinoate. Confocal microscopy revealed that ITEGE373 epitope was largely intracellular but with matrix staining in the superficial zone, whereas DIPEN341epitope was cell-associated and widely distributed in the matrix. Surprisingly, the majority of 342FFGVG epitope, determined by radioimmunoassay and Western blotting, was retained in the tissue despite the absence of a G1 domain anchor. Interleukin-1α stimulation caused a marked increase in tissue DIPEN341 and342FFGVG epitope, and the 342FFGVG fragments retained in the tissue were larger than those released into the medium. Active porcine aggrecanase was unable to cleave342FFGVG fragments at the ↓Glu373↓Ala374 bond but cleaved intact aggrecan at this site, suggesting that 342FFGVG fragments are not substrates for aggrecanase. The apparent retention of large 342FFGVG fragments within cartilage, and their resistance to N-terminal cleavage by aggrecanase suggests that 342FF6V6 fragments may have a role in cartilage homeostasis. We have studied aggrecan catabolism mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in a porcine cartilage culture system. Using antibodies specific for DIPEN341 and342FFGVG neoepitopes, we have detected MMP-derived fragments in conditioned medium and cultured cartilage, by radioimmunoassay, Western blotting, and immunolocalization. Radioimmunoassay revealed that the amount (pmol of epitope/mg of total glycosaminoglycan) of 342FFGVG epitope released from cartilage remained constant over a 5-day culture period and was not increased by IL-1α or retinoate. However, theproportion (pmol of epitope/mg of released glycosaminoglycan) of 342FFGVG epitope released was decreased upon stimulation, consistent with the involvement of a non-MMP proteinase, such as aggrecanase. The data suggest that in vitroMMPs may be involved in the base-line catabolism of aggrecan. Immunolocalization experiments showed that DIPEN341 and ITEGE373 epitopes were increased by treatment with IL-1α and retinoate.

This weight-bearing capacity is dependent on the structure and organization of collagen and aggrecan within the extracellular matrix. Normal turnover of aggrecan is a conservative process in which the rate of breakdown and release of fragments from the tissue does not exceed the rate at which it is replaced by newly synthesized molecules. In pathology, an increased rate of degradation results in a net loss of aggrecan, and the tissue becomes thin and mechanically weak.Aggrecan is lost from cartilage following proteolysis of the core protein. Aggrecanases are thought to be the enzymes primarily responsible for this proteolysis. Two ADAM1 proteins with thrombospondin motifs, ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase-1) (1Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Furthermore, the exact relationship between MMP and aggrecanase activities remains poorly understood. A number of studies have examined aggrecanase-mediated loss of aggrecan fragments in cell and tissue culture systems, but there is no information regarding MMP-mediated loss of aggrecan fragments.In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of MMP-mediated aggrecan catabolism in a cartilage explant system. We show that DIPEN341 epitope is more widely distributed in the cartilage matrix, compared with the ITEGE373 epitope, which is mostly intracellular, presumably following endocytosis. We also show that the majority of MMP-derived 342FFGVG fragments remain in cartilage during a 5-day culture experiment, and only a proportion are released into the medium. Once created, 342FFGVG fragments are resistant to cleavage in the IGD by aggrecanase. The finding that 342FFGVG fragments are retained in cartilage matrix and resistant to aggrecanase digestion raises the possibility that they may have other roles in cartilage homeostasis.DISCUSSIONWe describe several new findings relating to the generation and distribution of MMP-derived aggrecan fragments in a cartilage culture system. First, we present direct quantitation of aggrecan catabolites from one turnover pathway and show that in pig cartilage explants, MMPs account for 1% or less of the total aggrecan released. This is in agreement with estimates made by Little et al. (12Little C.B. Flannery C.R. Hughes C.E. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Dent C. Caterson B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 62-68Crossref Google Scholar) and is compatible with other reports that MMP processing does not appear to occur in cultures of rat chondrosarcoma cells (11Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C.R. Carlson S.S. Iwata M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol.

Hughes C.E. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Dent C. Caterson B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 62-68Crossref Google Scholar) systems. Our results support the conclusion that MMPs are not significantly responsible for aggrecanolysis. Second, we provide the first evidence that342FFGVG fragments appear to be selectively retained in the cartilage matrix. These fragments may be retained for a role in cartilage homeostasis and suggest that although 1% MMP-mediated aggrecan loss may not impact significantly on load-bearing capacity, MMP-meditated catabolism may initiate other important physiological events. Third, we demonstrate that native 342FFGVG fragments are resistant to aggrecanase, and in our companion paper (56Mercuri F.A. Maciewicz R.A. Tart J. Last K. Fosang A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33038-33045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) we provide evidence to suggest that at least part of the … FVDIPEN341 sequence flanking the MMP cleavage site may be required for binding of aggrecanase to its substrate. Our previous studies suggested that MMP and aggrecanase activities in pig cartilage explants were mutually exclusive (38Fosang A.J. Weeks D.B. Last K. Hardingham T.E. Campbell I.K. Maciewicz R.A. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23: 83Google Scholar, 39Fosang A.J. Bradshaw D. Nixon J.S. Bottomley K. Metalloproteinases as Targets for Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Birkhauser Publishing Ltd., Basel, Switzerland1999: 117-143Crossref Google Scholar). This can now be explained by our finding that FFGVG342 fragments are not substrates for aggrecanase and, consequently, that 374ARGSV fragments cannot be derived from 342FFGVG fragments. Fourth, we show that the DIPEN341 epitope is widely distributed in the cartilage matrix, whereas the ITEGE373 epitope is often intracellularly localized in chondrocytes. The different distribution of the G1 neoepitopes suggests that MMP and aggrecanase activities may be spatially distinct. Fifth, we present novel data from Western blotting, radioimmunoassay, and immunolocalization showing that DIPEN341 and 342FFGVG epitopes are significantly increased in pig cartilage explants by IL-1α treatment.We were surprised to find such high relative proportions of342FFGVG epitope in cartilage extracts, since aggrecan fragments are removed from cartilage. The diffusion of fragments from regions containing high concentrations of aggrecan can be rapid due to large thermodynamic chemical potential gradients or effective concentration gradients (40Comper W.D. Williams R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13464-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ilic et al. have characterized aggrecan in human (41Ilic M.Z. Mok M.T. Williamson O.D. Campbell M.A. Hughes C.E. Handley C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and bovine (6Ilic M.Z. Robinson H.C. Handley C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17451-17458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) cartilage matrix by sequencing the predominant components and found that only large molecules with intact N termini are retained in the tissue. In the same studies,374ARGSV fragments of varying sizes and fragments derived from the chondroitin sulfate-rich region were rapidly lost from the tissue and recovered in the conditioned medium. While most degraded components are quickly released in culture, we now show that the majority of 342FFGVG fragments are retained in the tissue. IL-1α stimulation of pig cartilage significantly increased342FFGVG fragments in tissue but without a corresponding increase in 342FFGVG epitope in the medium. The ratio of medium 342FFGVG to tissue 342FFGVG was in the range 1:4.5 for control, 1:10.8 for IL-1α-stimulated, and 1:1.8 for retinoate-stimulated cartilage (Table I). Given that the ratio of medium/tissue fragments would be dramatically lower for 374ARGSV fragments released from human and bovine cartilage cultures (6Ilic M.Z. Robinson H.C. Handley C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17451-17458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Ilic M.Z. Mok M.T. Williamson O.D. Campbell M.A. Hughes C.E. Handley C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and assuming that this would be similar for the pig, the retention of342FFGVG fragments appears to be selective. The374ARGSV fragments present in conditioned media of bovine and human cartilage cultures range in size (6Ilic M.Z. Robinson H.C. Handley C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17451-17458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Ilic M.Z. Mok M.T. Williamson O.D. Campbell M.A. Hughes C.E. Handley C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), so size selection does not appear to be the criterion for retention. Instead, it is possible that 342FFGVG fragments are specifically recognized and retained in the tissue by binding of the neoepitope sequence to matrix molecules or cells. Preliminary immunolocalization experiments did not detect the 342FFGVG epitope in tissue cultured with or without IL-1α, consistent with the hypothesis that the epitope sequence was involved in binding elsewhere and was therefore unavailable for detection by AF-28 antibody. We have conducted some preliminary experiments to determine whether342FFGVG fragments bind cartilage cells or matrix. The preliminary results indicate that cultured pig chondrocytes do not bind125I-labeled 342FFGVG G2 domain at 4 or 15 °C but that there may be some binding of 125I-labeled FFGVGGEEDITVQTY 15-mer to cartilage slices, in a highly regionalized manner. 2A. J. Fosang, K. Last, and H. Stanton, unpublished results. Our results show that not all 342FFGVG fragments are retained in cartilage (Figs. 2, 3, and 8), and indeed other studies have shown that 342FFGVG fragments generated by MMP-3 digestion of tissue or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate activation of endogenous MMPs leads to release of 342FFGVG-aggrecan (15Flannery C.R.

Eyre D.R. Grodzinsky A.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, 342FFGVG fragments are present in human synovial fluid (16Fosang A.J. Last K. Maciewicz R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2292-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and conditioned medium of IL-1-stimulated human osteoarthritic cartilage (12Little C.B. Flannery C.R. Hughes C.E. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Dent C. Caterson B. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 62-68Crossref Google Scholar). It is interesting to consider the possibility that the 342FFGVG-aggrecan described in this study may represent the “non-aggregating” large proteoglycan. A number of studies have shown that cartilage extracts from mature animals contain a proportion of extractable aggrecan that does not aggregate with hyaluronan and link protein (43Sandy J.D. Brown H.L. Lowther D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 44Franzen A. Inerot S. Hejderup S.O. Heinegard D. Biochem.

Plaas A.H. Sandy J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, we have extracted human and porcine cartilage with 4 mguanidine and found 342FFGVG fragments that distribute in the A2 and A3 fractions of cesium chloride density gradients,2 indicating that these fragments are large but nonaggregating. Thus, while the proportion of 342FFGVG fragments generated in cultured tissue may only be 1% or less of the total, an accumulation of this product in vivo might represent a significant pool in mature tissue.The 32-amino acid keratan sulfate containing fragment Phe342–Glu373, which migrates on SDS gels with an approximate M r of 35,000 (27Fosang A.J. Last K. Gardiner P. Jackson D.C. Brown L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was not detected in our experiments. This fragment can only come from processing of ITEGE373 G1 to DIPEN341 G1, since the 342FFGVG fragment is resistant to aggrecanase cleavage at the Glu–Ala bond. Based on Western blotting of sequential daily extracts (Fig. 4) it is possible that ITEGE373 to DIPEN341 processing may occur following IL-1α stimulation, since the ITEGE373 epitope was reduced concomitant with increased DIPEN341 epitope. Alternatively, ITEGE373 epitope could be decreased by release of ITEGE373-G1 into the culture medium or internalization by chondrocytes (Fig. 7 B). However, the marked increase in large molecular weight 342FFGVG epitope in the tissue suggests that the majority of the increased DIPEN341epitope derives from MMP cleavage of aggrecan and that MMP processing of G1 contributes minimally to the pool of DIPEN341fragments. In addition to the concomitant increase in the342FFGVG epitope, we have also shown 3H. Stanton and A. Fosang, unpublished results. that increased DIPEN341 epitope is not derived from cathepsin activity (47Mort J.S. Magny M.C. Lee E.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in this system. We cannot exclude the possibility that our inability to detect the 32-mer fragment in guanidine extracts on Western blots is due to its internalization by chondrocytes. Indeed, we do not know whether the internalized ITEGE373 epitope seen in Fig. 7 B represents intact G1, Phe342–Glu373 32-mer fragment, an intermediate, or a combination of all of these. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that 342FFGVG fragments may also be internalized, causing an underestimate of MMP activity in the AF-28 radioimmunoassay.Several kinetic studies have shown that in normal mature articular cartilage there are at least two metabolic pools of aggrecan that turn over at different rates (48Lohmander S.

Raven Press, New York1992: 21-33Google Scholar). These studies have determined long and short half-lives for different populations of aggrecan and shown the presence of a metabolically active pool with a short half-life and a metabolically inactive pool with a correspondingly longer half-life. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the metabolically active pool is located in the pericellular and territorial matrix surrounding chondrocytes, while the inactive pool is located in the interterritorial matrix, more remote from the cells (49Hascall V.C. Sandy J.D. Handley C.J. Caterson B. Archer C. Benjamin M. Ralph J. Biology of the Synovial Joint. Harwood Academic Publishers, Reading, UK1999Google Scholar). If the half-life of aggrecan were a function of its microanatomical location in cartilage, this would support the hypothesis that turnover pools reflect the different microdistribution of degradative enzymes. The immunolocalization data (Figs. 6 and 7) show that when the DIPEN341 epitope was present, both cells and matrix were stained; however, ITEGE373 staining was mostly cell-associated and intracellular throughout the depth of the tissue, often in the absence of any matrix staining. One interpretation of this finding is that expression of active aggrecanase may be restricted to the pericellular region and therefore contribute to catabolism of the active pool. Active MMPs, as detected by DIPEN341 staining, may have a wider distribution and therefore make a greater contribution toward turnover of aggrecan in the inter-territorial matrix during normal conservative turnover. Based on this hypothesis, we speculate that the pericellular location of aggrecanase would increase the opportunity for internalization of aggrecanase-generated ITEGE373 G1 domain, while the inter-territorial location of MMPs would limit the opportunity for internalization of DIPEN341 G1 domain.Because it is a qualitative technique, immunolocalization of DIPEN341 and ITEGE373 epitopes may not reflect their true tissue content. For example, in control tissue, neither epitope is detected in 8-μm sections (Fig. 6, a andf), but tissue extracts of approximately 1–3 mg (Fig. 4) contain these epitopes in low abundance, relative to IL-1-treated tissue. Certainly, ITEGE373 epitope is not restricted to an intracellular location, since it was present in the superficial layer of IL-1α-treated cartilage (Fig. 6 g) and is released in large amounts from cartilage and also found in human synovial fluids (53Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H.K. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 26-32Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The lack of ITEGE373 matrix staining in deeper zones does not exclude the possibility of its presence there altogether but suggests either that the epitope is much less abundant in matrix than cells or that it may be more reactive in cells than in matrix. This could be due to variable accessibility of the antibodies or altered presentation of epitope.In summary, our data suggest that in pig cartilage explants MMPs are involved in the conservative base-line turnover of aggrecan, which may amount to catabolism of around 1% o"

The mechanisms leading to these diverse manifestations of lead toxicity are mostly unknown. The biochemical and molecular mechanism(s) of action of lead neurotoxicity have not yet been fully elucidated. Several studies have shown, however, that calcium-dependent events are potential intracellular targets of lead (9Goldstein G.W. Ar D.

Lead is reported to alter a number of calcium-mediated cellular processes including calcium channels and second messenger systems. Lead is a potent blocker of calcium channels, activates calmodulin with higher affinity than calcium (Ca2+), and most importantly picomolar concentrations can substitute for Ca2+ in activating protein kinase C (PKC)1(11Markovac J.

Homodimerization (Jun family proteins) and heterodimerization (Jun and Fos family members) of these early response gene proteins form the activator protein-1 complex (AP-1) that mediates its subsequent effects on gene transcription (18Halazonetis T.D.

Recent studies using rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells show that lead increases AP-1 DNA binding activity via a PKC-dependent pathway (21Chakraborti T. Kim K.A. Goldstein G.G. Bressler J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and NF-κB activity through the activation of the MAP kinase family of kinases (22Ramesh G.T. Manna S.K. Aggarwal B.B. Jadhav A.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 155: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Given the ability of lead to interfere with several signal transduction pathways and transcription factors, it is likely that lead alters gene expression in its target cells and thereby interferes with multiple cellular events in the developing brain (14Kikkawa U. Kishimoto A. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar,23Singh A.K. Neurotoxicology. 1995; 14: 417-428Google Scholar). Experimental evidence points to multiple cellular targets including neurons, astroglia, and the microvasculature, at which lead may act in the developing brain (24Goldstein G.W. Needleman H.L. Human Lead Exposure. CRC, Boca Ratan, FL1991: 125-135Google Scholar). Astroglia are particularly important as the signals leading to expression of the blood-brain barrier phenotype appear to originate in the astrocytes and depend upon intimate astroglial-endothelial interactions (25Ling T.L. Mitrofanis J. Stone J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 286: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Bradbury M.W. Fed. Proc. 1984; 43: 186-190PubMed Google Scholar, 27Goldstein G.W. Ann. N. Y.

Lead has been shown to increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, the function of which is regulated by perivascular astrocytes (6Clasen R.A. Hartmann J.F. Starr A.J. Coogan P.S.

Astrocytes, therefore, appear particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of lead (28Gebhart A.M. Goldstein G.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1988; 94: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Holtzman D. Olson J.E. DeVries C. Bensch K. Toxicol. Appl.

In this study, we have examined the effects of lead on (a) differential gene expression using cDNA expression microarrays and (b) the activity of transcription factors and related signal responsive kinases involved in the intracellular signal transduction leading to gene expression in immortalized human fetal astrocyte (SV-FHA) cultures. Our results indicate that among the genes induced by lead, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) known also as vascular permeability factor is one of the most sensitive. Subsequent experiments determine the relative contributions of PKC, AP-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) regulatory pathways on lead- induced VEGF expression.

Random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were purchased for probe labeling. Immortalized human fetal astrocyte (SV-FHA) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Stanimirovic (Institute of Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada) and cultured in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (30Muruganandam A.

Cells were grown to 80–90% confluency prior to treatment with lead acetate, sodium acetate, and PMA. Lead acetate and sodium acetate were dissolved in sterile-distilled water and PMA in Me2SO, and directly added to the complete medium. Final concentration of Me2SO in the medium was 0.006% (v/v) and equal volume was used as control for PMA-exposed cells. To study the effects on VEGF expression, cells were exposed to 10 μm lead acetate for 24 h or 100 nm PMA for 6 h in complete medium unless otherwise mentioned. To study the effects on transcription factors AP-1 and HIF-1, cells were exposed to 10 μm lead acetate for 3 and 4 h, respectively, and to 100 nm PMA for 1 h prior to isolation of nuclear proteins. SV-FHAs, grown in 10-cm culture dishes to 80–90% confluency, were exposed to either 10 μm lead acetate or 10 μm sodium acetate as control. Total cellular RNA was extracted from the cells 24 h later using RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total cellular RNA samples and reverse transcribed in the presence of [32P]dATP to generate radiolabeled cDNA probe, and purified onto Chromaspin-200 DEPC H2O column chromatography according to the Atlas Pure RNA labeling protocol (CLONTECH). Neuroarray cDNA microarrays (CLONTECH) were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes from each experimental condition according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the membranes were soaked in deionized H2O and then blocked with sheared salmon testes DNA in ExpressHyb solution at 68 °C for 30 min. Five μl of Cot-1 DNA was added to the labeled cDNA probe and heat denatured for 2 min followed by chilling on ice for 2 min. The cDNA probes were then added to ExpressHyb solution and the microarray blots were hybridized overnight with continuous agitation at 68 °C. The membranes were washed with Wash Solution 1 and Wash Solution 2 (supplied with kit) for 30 min each at 68 °C, and finally with 2 × SSC for 5 min at room temperature. The blots were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen at room temperature for overnight and the array image was visualized by phosphorimaging using the Bio-Image analyzer BAS 2500 (Fujifilm). Hybridized dot intensities on the microarrays were quantified using CLONTECHAtlasImage software. Normalization of the data was performed by dividing the intensity for each gene on a blot by the average intensity of all of the genes on that blot. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using an RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen Inc.) as above. Northern blot analysis was performed according to the method of Sambrook and co-workers (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 7.35-7.39Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described previously (32Hossain M.A. Fielding K.E. Trescher W.H. Ho T. Wilson M.A. Laterra J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for human VEGF (KpnI-SpeI restriction fragment/582 base pairs) was labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Heat-denatured probe was hybridized to the membrane at 42 °C overnight (16–18 h) in 10 ml of hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSE, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon testes DNA). The blots were washed as follows: three times in 0.1% SDS in 1 × SSC for 20 min at room temperature; and two times in the same buffer for 30 min each at 65 °C. Radioactivities corresponding to mRNA signals for VEGF were quantified by phosphorimaging using the Bio-Image analyzer BAS 2500 (Fujifilm). Membranes were stripped of probe by washing in 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 85–90 °C for 10 min and then rehybridized with cDNA probe to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Results are expressed relative to GAPDH. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Stein and co-workers (33Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A.L.M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice and harvested by scraping in 1 ml of cold PBS. The harvested cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 × protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The nuclei recovered in the pellet were washed with 100 μl of lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of nuclear suspension buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed by three cycles of quick freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. The nuclear lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C until use for the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (gel-shift) was carried out to analyze the DNA binding activity of AP-1 and HIF-1 according to Ying and co-workers (34Ying Z. Reisman D. Buggy J. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 39: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, AP-1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The sense (5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′) and antisense (5′-TGAGACAGCACGTAGGGC-3′) HIF-1 binding sequences were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Core Facility of Johns Hopkins University. The AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide (5 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then purified through Sephadex G-25 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To generate double stranded HIF-1 consensus oligonucleotide probes, the sense oligonucleotides underwent 5′ end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The labeled sense strands were then annealed to a 10-fold excess of antisense strands by heating to 85 °C for 10 min, allowed to cool down to room temperature over a period of 2–3 h, and then purified through Sephadex G-25. Nuclear extracts (10–15 μg) were incubated on ice for 20 min with 5 μl of a reaction buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 24 μl. One microliter of respective 32P-labeled (25,000–30,000 cpm) oligonucleotide probe was added to the reaction mixture and incubated further at room temperature for 20 min. For competition studies, 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture during the incubation on ice before the addition of labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 6% nondenaturing gel at 180 V for 3 h in 0.25 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate and 1 mmEDTA). Gels were vacuum dried and specific bands were quantified by phosphorimaging using the Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS 2500 (Fujifilm). To evaluate VEGF protein levels, cells were exposed to lead acetate (10 μm) or sodium acetate for 24 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping in 1 ml of cold PBS and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 5 min. Three hundred μl of RIPA buffer (1 × PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) were added to each tube and sonicated for 10 s, centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 5 min and the supernatants were stored at −70 °C. One hundred μg of cell extracts were diluted to a total volume of 1 ml using 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl; 30 μl of equilibrated heparin-agarose beads (Sigma) were added and the mixture rocked at 4 °C overnight as described by Ferrara and Henzel (35Ferrara N. Henzel W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). The beads were pelleted at 5,000 × g for 1 min, washed in 400 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and recentrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min; the supernatant was removed and discarded. Next, 20 μl of 2 × loading buffer (20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) were added and the slurry was heated at 100 °C for 10 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed according to the method of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) with modifications. Samples (20 μl ) were loaded onto a 4–20% gradient Tris glycine pre-cast gel (Novex) together with a full range Rainbow recombinant protein molecular weight marker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and run at 150 V for 1 h. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane at constant current of 50 mA for 1 h. After blocking with 5% nonfat dried milk in 1 × Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) and 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) overnight at 4 °C, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with VEGF monoclonal antibody (Oncogene) at 1:1000 dilution in 1 × TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 3 times with 1 × TBST for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A/G (Pierce) at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase reaction product was then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the digitized images were quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics).

Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Thejun mutant (TAM-67) lacks the transactivation domain while retaining full DNA binding capacity and inhibits AP-1 function by homodimerizing and binding to the DNA at the AP-1 sites as well as by forming heterodimers with wild type c-Fos to produce inactive heterodimers (39Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Four μg of AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid DNA along with either 20 μg of TAM-67 or control (CMV) plasmid DNA were used for electroporation as indicated above. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. The cells were given fresh medium containing 10% serum and either lead acetate (10 μm) or sodium acetate (10 μm) as control and incubated for an additional 24 h. Alternatively, cells received PMA (100 nm) or Me2SO (0.06% v/v) as control and were incubated for an additional 6 h. The involvement of HIF-1 was examined by using a VEGF-luciferase reporter construct (pGL-MAP11wt) and a dominant-negative form of HIF-1α (HIF-1αDN) plasmid expression vector (pCEP/HIF-1αDN) kindly supplied by Dr. Greg Semenza (40Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). The pGL-MAP11wt construct includes the 5′-flanking region of human VEGF promoter containing the HIF-1 consensus DNA-binding site cloned to an SV40 promoter-luciferase transcription unit (40Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). The pCEP/HIF-1αDN construct encodes a form of HIF-1α lacking both the amino-terminal basic domain required for DNA-binding and the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain. HIF-1αDN heterodimerizes with endogenous HIF-1β, generating biologically inactive heterodimers that are unable to bind DNA. Cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of pGL-MAP11wt plasmid DNA along with either 20 μg of pCEP/HIF-1αDN or control (pCEP4) plasmid DNA by electroporation as mentioned above. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 24 μg. Twenty-four hours later cells were given fresh complete medium containing either lead acetate (10 μm) or sodium acetate (10 μm) as control and incubated for 24 h. In addition, plates containing transfected cells were incubated in 1% O2 for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested and cell extracts were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luminescence was measured in 20 μl of cell extract using a luciferase assay system kit (Promega). Activity was expressed as relative light units/mg of cellular protein as determined by the Bradford method (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of AP-1 and HIF-1 in lead-induced VEGF expression, cells were electroporated with either 20 μg of TAM-67 or control (CMV) plasmid DNA and 20 μg of pCEP/HIF-1αDN or control (pCEP4) control plasmid DNA, respectively. Transfected cells were exposed to either lead or sodium acetate as indicated above. Total cellular RNA was extracted and VEGF and GAPDH levels were measured by Northern blot analysis as described above. Comparisons involving multiple groups were done by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni/Dunn post-hoc test. Comparison between any two groups was done by two-tailed Student'st test. An overall level of significance of 0.01 was used to determine differences. cDNA expression microarray analyses were performed to identify lead-sensitive genes in SV-FHA cells. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from SV-FHAs exposed to either lead acetate (10 μm) or sodium acetate as control for 24 h and used for cDNA expression microarray analysis. The cDNA microarrays used contain 588 selected genes of which 131 were consistently expressed in the SV-FHAs. Among these expressed genes, 12% appeared induced following exposure to lead. Of these induced genes one of the most lead-sensitive was VEGF (Fig. 1,A and B). Subsequent quantification of spot intensities using CLONTECH AtlasImage software revealed that lead induced VEGF mRNA 3.0-fold (p < 0.005) compared with sodium-treated controls (Fig. 1 C). No significant difference in VEGF expression levels was observed between sodium-treated and untreated controls (not shown). Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA confirmed that lead induced VEGF mRNA levels in SV-FHAs compared with cells treated identically with sodium acetate. Induction of VEGF mRNA in SV-FHAs by lead was concentration and time-dependent, with maximal induction observed at 10 μm lead following 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2,A and B). Quantification of VEGF hybridization by phosphorimaging revealed that lead induced VEGF expression 3-fold (312 ± 25% versus 100 ± 9%; p< 0.001) compared with sodium-treated controls (Fig. 2, Aand B) consistent with the magnitude of induction found in the microarray analysis. The effect of lead on VEGF protein levels was examined. Cells were exposed to 10 μm lead acetate or sodium acetate as control for 24 h and cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody. An intense VEGF immunoreactive protein band at ∼46 kDa (Fig. 3) was detected. Densitometric quantification showed that VEGF protein levels were increased ∼2-fold (188 ± 20% versus 100 ± 16%; p< 0.01) by lead (Fig. 3).Figure 3Lead induces VEGF protein levels in SV-FHAs. Cells were exposed either to lead acetate (10 μm) or sodium acetate (10 μm) as control for 24 h. One hundred micrograms of total cellular extract were incubated with heparin-agarose beads and the heparin binding fraction subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A/G as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Blots were exposed to ECL-film and the 46-kDa VEGF-immunoreactive protein band was quantified by densitometry. Values are shown as percent induction (mean ± S.E.;n = 6) relative to sodium-treated controls set as 100%. *, p < 0.01. Blots shown are from representative experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The signal transduction mechanism involved in the induction of VEGF mRNA by lead was examined. Since, lead is a potent activator of PKC in other cell types, the PKC dependence of lead-induced VEGF expression in SV-FHAs was examined.

https://openalex.org/W2150913819,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is frequently associated with mutations in the β-cardiac myosin heavy chain. Many of the implicated residues are located in highly conserved regions of the myosin II class, suggesting that these mutations may impair the basic functions of the molecular motor. To test this hypothesis, we have prepared recombinant smooth muscle heavy meromyosin with mutations at sites homologous to those associated with FHC by using a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Several of the heavy meromyosin mutants, in particular R403Q, showed an increase in actin filament velocity in a motility assay and an enhanced actin-activated ATPase activity. Single molecule mechanics, using a laser trap, gave unitary displacements and forces for the mutants that were similar to wild type, but the attachment times to actin following a unitary displacement were markedly reduced. These results suggest that the increases in activity are due to a change in kinetics and not due to a change in the intrinsic mechanical properties of the motor. In contrast to earlier reports, we find that mutations in residues implicated in FHC affect motor function by enhancing myosin activity rather than by a loss of function.

Bonow R.O. Cannon R.O. Leon M.B. Epstein S.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recent molecular genetic studies have demonstrated that the disease is caused by missense mutations in the β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene in roughly 30 FHC kindreds, and more than 40 distinct mutations have been identified so far (2Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A.

Schwartz K. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). All of the myosin heavy chain mutations have been located in the globular head of myosin (subfragment 1) or near the head-rod junction in subfragment 2 (4Rayment I. Holden H.M. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3864-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Many of these residues are conserved in a wide variety of myosin II isoforms, suggesting that they may be important for the normal function of the molecule. For example, Arg403, whose mutation to Gln (R403Q) causes one of the most severe phenotypes of the disease, is located at the base of a surface loop believed to interact with actin (5Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 6Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). Earlier studies showed that cardiac isoforms with this mutation were impaired in both enzymatic (lowerV max and higher K m of actin-activated ATPase activity) and motile activities (lower actin translocation velocity in the in vitro motility assay) (7Cuda G. Fananapazir L. Zhu W. Sellers J.R. Epstein N.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2861-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Sweeney H.L. Straceski A.J. Leinwand L.A. Tikunov B.A. Faust L. J.

A number of mutations have also been located in the C-terminal region of subfragment 1 that is associated with the light chains. Several lines of evidence suggest that the light chain-binding domain acts as a “lever arm” to amplify and transmit conformational changes that originate in the motor domain (5Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 11Lowey S.

Nature. 1995; 378: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region often occur in close proximity to the essential light chain (ELC), suggesting that the interface between the motor domain and the ELC may be important for coupling ATP hydrolysis with mechanical movement (4Rayment I. Holden H.M. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3864-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the functional consequences of introducing missense mutations into the “myopathy loop” (Arg403), and into the “lever arm” region (Arg719 and Asp778) of a vertebrate muscle myosin. A smooth muscle myosin fragment, similar to heavy meromyosin (HMM) prepared by chymotryptic digestion, was expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell system and isolated in sufficient yield for extensive biochemical and mechanical studies. Although human β-cardiac myosin would clearly be the isoform of choice for such mutational studies, expression levels of human β-cardiac heavy chain (9Sata M. Ikebe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and of rat α-cardiac myosin (8Sweeney H.L. Straceski A.J. Leinwand L.A. Tikunov B.A. Faust L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1603-1605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been very low, thus limiting the extent to which the properties of the protein can be analyzed. Transgenic mice carrying the equivalent FHC mutations in their heart muscles are a valuable model system for studying FHC, but the functional consequences of mutations in a fast myosin isoform, such as mouse α-cardiac myosin, may well be different from those in β-cardiac myosin, a slow myosin isoform. Despite sequence differences, smooth muscle myosin is in many respects functionally similar to a slow β-cardiac myosin, insofar as they both share low values for actin-activated ATPase activity and actin translocation velocity (15VanBuren P. Harris D.E. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Margossian S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13747-13754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important advantage in studying point mutations in the smooth muscle heavy chain is that the crystal structure of the expressed motor domain with its associated ELC has been solved (17Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and thus provides a framework for considering the effect of point mutations on the functional properties of myosin. The three-dimensional structure of the smooth muscle myosin motor domain is virtually identical to that of the chicken skeletal isoform (5Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar), and therefore the cardiac myosin motor domain will also have a similar fold. The sequences flanking the mutated residues are highly conserved between cardiac and smooth muscle isoforms, and therefore it was expected that smooth muscle HMM containing FHC mutations would show the same loss of function as reported for cardiac myosin. Instead, we find an increase in actin-binding affinity, actin-activated ATPase activity, and actin translocation velocity for several of the mutants compared with wild-type smooth HMM, while preserving the intrinsic force- and motion-generating capacities of the individual motors. The possibility exists that some of these functional differences between smooth and cardiac mutants may be isoform-specific, but this explanation cannot account for all of the discrepancies in the literature. Instead, we favor the view that these mutations affect cardiac function by a gain in function, presumably leading to an increase in power output beyond that normally tolerated. Furthermore, since patients are heterozygous for FHC mutations, their thick filaments will probably contain a heterogeneous mixture of myosin heads with different cycling kinetics, a condition that might alter ventricular performance, and thereby contribute to a compensatory hypertrophy in cardiac muscle tissue. Chicken gizzard myosin heavy chain cDNA (18Yanagisawa M. Hamada Y. Katsuragawa Y. Imamura M. Mikawa T. Masaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Five distinct point mutations were introduced at three different residues (R406Q, R406W, R731Q, R731W, and D789G) in the smooth muscle myosin sequence, equivalent to R403Q, R403W, R719Q, R719W, and D778G in FHC, respectively, by the method of Kunkel (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). Thereafter, each mutant is designated by the human β-cardiac sequence. To study the functional differences between equivalent “myopathy loops” (i.e. sequences flanking the Arg403 residue) of cardiac and smooth muscle isoforms, we created cardiac/smooth muscle chimeras by replacing the native smooth muscle myosin loop with the wild-type human β-cardiac sequence or with the human β-cardiac sequence containing the R403Q mutation (see Table I). These chimeric mutants have been named the cardiac myopathy loop (CML) and CML/R403Q, respectively. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IMutations in the actin-binding region of HMMRegionSequenceMyopathy loop sequence Cardiac (403–413)R V K V G N E Y V T K: . : : : . : : Smooth (406–416)R I K V G R D V V Q KPoints mutants R403QQ I K V G R D V V Q K R403WW I K V G R D V V Q KChimeras CMLR V K V G N E Y V T K CML/403QQ V K V G N E Y V T KSequences in the smooth muscle myosin surface loop equivalent to the “myopathy loop” in human β-cardiac myosin are shown with the corresponding point mutations.

Recombinant baculovirus was isolated by conventional protocols (20O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were coinfected with recombinant virus coding for a truncated heavy chain fragment similar to chymotryptic HMM (intermediate HMM, 1175 amino acids) and another virus coding for both the smooth muscle regulatory light chain (21Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ELC (22Nabeshima Y. Nonomura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10608-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expressed protein was isolated by actin binding and release with MgATP (23Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by chromatography of a fusion-tagged HMM on an anti-FLAG affinity column (24Trybus K.M. Naroditskaya V. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18423-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The yields of wild type and mutant HMMs were similar by either purification method (approximately 5 mg/liter culture cells), and the properties of the proteins from independent preparations were invariant. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the protein was as described (23Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20819-20822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 1-M was a generous gift from T. Haystead (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Immunoblots of glycerol gels were used to verify complete phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of regulatory light chain (25Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Actin filament velocity was measured at 30 °C as described (21Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMM samples at a final concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml were ultracentrifuged with an equimolar concentration of F-actin in the presence of mm MgATP to remove any ATP-insensitive (rigor) HMM heads. An anti-rod monoclonal antibody (Ab S2.2; Ref. 26Trybus K.M. Henry L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2879-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used to bind HMM to the nitrocellulose surface. The assay buffer contained 25 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgATP, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% methylcellulose, and oxygen scavengers (0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, and 2 mg/ml glucose). The assay was also performed at higher KCl concentration (60 mm with 0.7% methylcellulose). The fraction of phosphorylated filaments moving continuously for 5 s or more was >95% under these conditions. The velocities of ∼50 filaments were averaged to obtain the mean ± S.D. The small S.D. value is consistent with a highly homogeneous population of molecules. To study motility under more stringent conditions, experiments were done by stepwise decreasing, in the same flow cell, the methylcellulose concentration from 0.5 to 0% at 25 mm KCl, and from 0.7 to 0% at 60 mm KCl. At lower methylcellulose concentrations, the actin filament velocity was measured manually to distinguish HMM-driven directional movement from Brownian motion. Briefly, traces of directional movement of actin filaments were transferred to transparencies, and an average velocity was calculated by dividing the measured displacements by the elapsed time. The concentration of HMM was determined from its NH4-ATPase activity relative to a standard curve constructed from purified myosin, since expressed proteins are not always free from minor contaminants (27Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To establish that wild type (WT) and mutants have the same NH4-ATPase activity, aliquots of protein with equivalent amounts of NH4-ATPase activity were loaded on SDS gels and scanned by densitometry. Within experimental error, bands of equal intensity had equal NH4-ATPase activity (data not shown). The actin-activated MgATPase activity was measured in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 8 mm KCl, 37 °C essentially as described previously (27Rovner A.S. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30260-30263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of actin ranging from 5 to 120 μm were mixed with 0.2 mg/ml of HMM in a buffer containing 5 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, with and without 1 mm EGTA for dephosphorylated and phosphorylated HMM experiments, respectively. After the addition of 1 mm MgATP, the sample was spun immediately at 350,000 × g for 20 min. Equal volumes of the supernatant and pellet were run on 10% SDS gels. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and scanned by a Gel Document System (Bio-Rad), from which the percentage of HMM bound to actin was determined. Control experiments showed that in the absence of MgATP all HMM bound to actin. Unitary mechanical parameters were measured at 25 °C as described elsewhere (28Dupuis D.E. Guilford W.H. Wu J. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys.

Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 825-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, flow cells were preincubated with S2.2 antibody (0.1 mg/ml) followed by an addition of bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) to block the coverslip surface. Expressed HMMs were then applied to the flow cell at a concentration of 1–5 μg/ml. Following a 2-min incubation period to allow for HMM to bind to the antibody-coated surface, the chamber was washed with motility buffer (25 mm imidazole-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm KCl, oxygen scavenger, and 10 μm Na2ATP at pH 7.4) to remove any unbound protein. The final addition to the flow cell included a dilute concentration of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate phalloidin-labeled F-actin and N-ethylmaleimide-myosin-coated polystyrene beads in motility buffer. Experiments were initiated by capturing anN-ethylmaleimide-myosin-coated bead in each optical trap and manipulating the microscope stage so as to secure the ends of an actin filament to each of the beads. When the taut filament (>4 pN) was brought into close proximity to the HMM-coated surface, unitary events were recorded. Unitary displacements (d) were typically measured at a low optical trap stiffness of approximately 0.02 pN/nm, while unitary forces (F) were measured under nearly isometric feedback control with an apparent stiffness of approximately 2 pN/nm. In order to extract estimates of d, F, and the unitary displacement event duration (t on)from the raw time series, we performed mean variance analysis (31Patlak J.B. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 29-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), an ion channel analysis procedure that was adapted to analyze single molecular motor data (29Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The estimated number of events measured by mean variance analysis ranged from ∼700 to ∼2500 depending on the HMM species. A basic residue, Arg403, located at the base of a surface loop that is assumed to interact with actin, is conserved virtually in the entire myosin II class, see Fig.1. To test the hypothesis that this residue is important for the optimal function of any myosin motor, we engineered two point mutations (R403Q and R403W) at the equivalent site in the smooth muscle HMM backbone and expressed these mutants using the baculovirus/insect cell system. The sequences of the cardiac and smooth muscle myosin loops are compared in TableI. The most notable difference between the smooth and cardiac “myopathy” loops is one additional positive charge in the smooth muscle sequence (Arg411 in smoothversus Asn408 in cardiac). The phosphorylated R403Q and R403W mutants showed 30–40% higher velocities than wild type HMM in the motility assay at both 25 and 60 mm KCl (Fig. 2 and TableII). The dephosphorylated R403Q and R403W mutants showed approximately 10% of the velocities of the phosphorylated species at both 25 and 60 mm KCl (values for deP ranged from 0.16–0.2 μm/s; see Table II), indicating that attainment of a completely “off” state is compromised as a result of these mutations.Table IIProperties of HMM with mutations in the “myopathy loop”ConstructMotility (25 mm KCl)Motility (60 mm KCl)ATPase V maxATPaseK mActin binding K dμm/sμm/ss −1μmμmWT1.1 ± 0.101.56 ± 0.171.8 ± 0.428 ± 758R403Q1.56 ± 0.262-ap < 0.01versus WT.2.02 ± 0.422-bp < 0.05versus WT.3.4 ± 0.52-ap < 0.01versus WT.18 ± 511(deP, 0.16 ± 0.07)(deP, 0.2 ± 0.04)R403W1.45 ± 0.052-ap < 0.01versus WT.2.07 ± 0.082-ap < 0.01versus WT.3.8 ± 0.12-ap < 0.01versus WT.16 ± 613(deP, 0.2 ± 0.01)(deP, 0.2 ± 0.02)CML1.11 ± 0.041.29 ± 0.162-bp < 0.05versus WT.1.4 ± 0.225 ± 495CML/R40 3Q1.19 ± 0.051.55 ± 0.072.3 ± 0.32-cp < 0.01versus CML.61 ± 16 a,c118The motility values for dephosphorylated HMM mutants are in parentheses.

The absence of such values indicates that no movement was observed in the dephosphorylated state, as is the case for completely regulated smooth HMM. The given values represent the mean ± S.D. for four or more independent preparations. The actin-activated ATPase activity of the phosphorylated R403Q and R403W mutants differed from wild type HMM in bothV max and K m . Both mutants showed a 2-fold higher V max as well as a 40% lower K m for actin (Fig.3 A and Table II). Since theK m for actin is a function of the rate constants of the actin binding step as well as other kinetic transitions in the ATPase cycle (32Taylor E.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 6: 103-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), a sedimentation assay was performed to directly evaluate the strength of actin binding in the presence of MgATP (Fig.3 B). The binding constant of phosphorylated wild type HMM was 1.7 × 104m−1, consistent with earlier measurements on chymotryptic smooth muscle HMM (33Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13880-13883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the affinity of both phosphorylated mutants was 5-fold higher than wild type HMM (Fig. 3 B and Table II). Based on the higher rate of motility, the higherV max, the lower K m , and the lower K d for actin, both R403Q and R403W mutations in the context of the smooth muscle backbone enhanced rather than impaired the enzymatic and mechanical properties of the molecule. At the single molecule level, the faster velocity of the R403Q mutant in the motility assay could be due to a larger unitary displacement, d, or to a decreased time of attachment to actin following the powerstroke,t on. This is because the velocity in a motility assay is approximated by the ratio ofd/t on. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the unitary displacements and attachment times of the wild type and mutant HMMs were measured using the optical trap. Representative data traces of unitary displacements and forces are shown in Fig. 4, A andB, respectively. Wild type and the R403Q mutant produced very similar unitary displacements and forces at ∼10.5 nm and ∼1.3 pN, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table III). Both of these estimates are similar to values previously reported for smooth and skeletal muscle myosins (29Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Moreover, the distribution of mean displacement values in the scatter plot in Fig. 4 C(where each data point represents a mean variance analysis of a time record containing a large number of events generated by a single molecule) is narrow, suggesting a very homogeneous population of molecules.Table IIIUnitary force and displacement of mutant HMMsD uniF unit onnmpNmsWT10.9 ± 0.4 (11)1.3 ± 0.1 (9)222 ± 34 (11)R403Q10.2 ± 0.5 (13)1.3 ± 0.1 (15)90 ± 103-ap < 0.05versus WT.

The quantity in parentheses represents the number of mean variance histograms used to calculate the mean. Analysis of the event durations of the displacement records based on mean variance analysis (29Guilford W.H. Dupuis D.E. Kennedy G. Wu J. Patlak J.B. Warshaw D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) showed a difference int on between wild type and the mutants. The duration of the events was ∼2-fold shorter for R403Q than for wild type HMM under the lightly loaded and subsaturating 10 μmMgATP conditions of the optical trap (Fig. 4 A and TableIII). The shorter event duration is consistent with the 30–40% increase in velocity in the motility assay. This mutation, therefore, affects the rate at which transitions occur in the cross-bridge cycle but does not alter the intrinsic displacement or the unitary force of the power stroke. Since the available literature on the R403Q mutation in cardiac myosin predicted a loss of functional properties, we tried to determine if the increase in activity arising from the R403Q mutation in smooth muscle myosin could be accounted for by the different sequence of the myopathy loop itself. We therefore generated a chimeric HMM in which the 11-residue myopathy loop was composed of the cardiac sequence, hence referred to as the CML, or “cardiac myopathy loop.” The R403Q mutation was also engineered into this chimera (CML/R403Q) (see Tables I and II). The introduction of the cardiac sequence into this surface loop had relatively little effect on the properties of the molecule. Thein vitro motility rates (Fig. 2) and actin-activated ATPase activity (V max and K m ) (Fig.3 C) for CML were similar to wild type HMM. The dissociation constant (K d ) for actin binding in the presence of MgATP, as determined by a sedimentation assay, increased, from 58 μm for wild type to 95 μm for CML, indicating that the affinity for actin was somewhat weakened by the introduction of the cardiac sequence (Fig. 3 D and TableII). Further introduction of the R403Q mutation into the CML chimera did not cause a significant increase in motility (Fig. 2 and Table II) but increased both K m for actin (61 versus 25 μm) and K d (118 versus 95 μm), in contrast to the results obtained for the R403Q mutation in smooth HMM. However, the ATPase activity (V max) of CML/R403Q was significantly higher than for CML, mimicking the higher V max of the R403Q mutant compared with wild type HMM. Two sites were targeted for mutation in the motor domain/lever arm interface. One site is in the so-called converter region, which couples the motor domain to the lever arm (Arg719 in cardiac or Arg731 in smooth), and the other site is at the amino terminus of the long α-helix that binds the regulatory light chain and ELC (Asp778 in the cardiac sequence or Asp789 in smooth) (see Fig. 1). The D778G mutant showed one of the highest velocities of any of the mutants that were characterized here, as much as 50% higher than that of wild type HMM (2.37 μm/s versus 1.56 μm/s at 60 mm KCl; Fig. 5 and TableIV). As with the R403Q mutation, the increase in velocity may be accounted for by an alteration to the kinetics of the attached state (i.e. decreasedt on compared with wild type, 87versus 222 ms; Table III) rather than an alteration tod, which is similar to wild type (Table III). The lack of any effect of the mutation on the motor's intrinsic mechanics is also reflected in similar unitary forces compared with wild type (TableIII). The D778G mutant also showed a high actin-activated ATPase activity (3.0 s−1 versus 1.8 s−1) with a K m value comparable with that of wild type HMM (Table IV).Table IVProperties of mutants at motor domain/lever arm interfaceCons"

The protein products of some of these genes are transcriptional factors that regulate the general or specific expression of many genes. The ELL gene was initially identified on chromosome 19p13.1, which undergoes frequent translocation with the trithorax-like MLL(ALL-1, HRX) gene on chromosome 11q23 in acute myeloid leukemia (1Thirman M.J.

ELL is a 621 amino acid-containing protein that can increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation of RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing at multiple sites along the DNA from both promoter-dependent and promoter-independent templates (3Shilatifard A.

Some can prevent arrest, like P-TEFb and SII. Some can regulate the rate of transcription elongation through nucleosomes, such as FACT (20Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.-H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Others operate to increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by altering the K m and/or the V max of the polymerase, such as TFIIF, elongin (SIII), the ELL complex, and ELL2 (4Shilatifard A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Conaway J.W. Conaway R., C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand how transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II is controlled under normal conditions and in disease states, we are attempting to reconstitute RNA polymerase II transcription elongation machinery in vitro. In so doing, we have now identified and cloned a novel ELL family member, ELL3, and characterized its biochemical role in regulating transcription elongation. Searches of GenBankTM identified a short expressed sequence tag (accession number AA527300) that exhibited homology to the 3′-end of the coding regions of human ELL and ELL2. This partial sequence of human ELL3 enabled us to design a gene-specific primer 5′-GGTAGTCTGGTATATCTTCAGGACTTGGGGAT-3′, which was used to obtain the 5′-end of ELL3 by rapid amplification of the cDNA ends with Marathon Ready Human cDNA as the template (CLONTECH). The full-length human ELL3 ORF1 was obtained by PCR amplification of a human cDNA library using ELL3-specific 5′ primer (5′-GAGGTGTCGACATGGAGGAGCTCCATGAGCCTCTG-3′) and 3′ antisense primer (5′-GTGTGGATCCTCTCATCAGCTGCCCCTGTTCTTTTCCTC-3′) using DNA polymerase Tli (Promega) with proofreading ability. The construct for expression of histidine-tagged ELL3 in bacteria was prepared by introducing the ELL3 ORF-containing PCR product into theSalI and BamHI sites of M13mpET bacteriophage vector, which contains the complete pETT7 transcription-translation regions as well as the sequence encoding the His tag. Recombinant ELL3 protein was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified from guanidine-solubilized inclusion bodies as described previously (3Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We were able to express ELL3 in E. coli in an insoluble form; however, we were not able to either produce soluble ELL3 or renature ELL3 in a soluble form when expressed in E. coli inclusion bodies. Therefore, we set to express ELL3 in mammalian cells. The construct for expression of N-terminal histidine-tagged and C-terminal FLAG-tagged ELL3 in 293 tissue culture cells was obtained by PCR amplification using ELL3 specific 5′ primer (5′-AATGAGAATTCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGTATGGAGGAGCTCCATGAGCCTCTG-3′) and 3′ antisense primer (5′-GTTTTTCTAGACTATTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTGTAGTCGTTCTTTTCCTCAAACTCCAGGAT-3′). The digested PCR product was introduced into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the tetracycline-regulated pTRE mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH). One μg of pTRE-ELL3 expression vector and 500 ng of pTK-Hyg selection vector (CLONTECH) were cotransfected into 6 × 106 293 cells cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418 sulfate by lipofection. 48 h after transfection, cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418 sulfate, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Individual clones were trypsinized using cloning cylinders and plated into individual flasks. To induce expression of ELL3, 6 × 106 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418 sulfate, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. After 48 h, cells were harvested in 300 mm AmSO4 extraction buffer and lysed by sonication. ELL3 was purified from total cell extracts by affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was washed twice with high salt buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Approximately 100 μl of gel was incubated in batch with 500 μl of cell extract and tumbled at 4 °C for 1 h. The gel was collected by low speed centrifugation for 30 s and washed three times by resuspension in 500 μl of high salt buffer followed by three washes in 500 μl of low salt buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in low salt buffer). Protein elutions were aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C until use. The ELL3 that was purified via this method was used in our biochemical analysis. Poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml)-coated coverslips were placed in six-well tissue culture plates. 1 × 106 ELL3 293 cells were plated on the coverslips and grown to approximately 70% confluency in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418 sulfate, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, with or without 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Coverslips were washed briefly three times with 1× PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by methanol for 6 min at −20 °C. Slides were stained with M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (1:1000) in 1× PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide for 45 min at 37 °C followed by staining with rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (1:1000) in 1× PBS, 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 15 min at 37 °C. Slides were washed three times with 1× PBS after each incubation. Slides were mounted with elvanol mounting medium (12% elvanol, 3% glycerol, 60 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine) and photographed with an Olympus microscope. Preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter with recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and purified rat TFIIH and RNA polymerase II as described (3Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Transcription was initiated by the addition of 50 μm ATP, 50 μm GTP, 2 μm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (ICN), and 7 mmMgCl2. After 10 min at 28 °C, 100 μmnonradioactive CTP was added to the reaction mixture, and short transcripts were chased in the absence or presence of affinity-purified ELL3 purified from 293 cells or purified protein from mock-transfected 293 cells for the times indicated. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel and developed using a Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) PhosphorImager instrument. Nitrocellulose filters containing approximately 2 mg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from 16 different adult human tissues (CLONTECH) were used for Northern analysis. Filters were prehybridized and hybridized in 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSPE, 0.5% SDS, and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. Blots were hybridized with32P-labeled full-length ELL3 probe or β-actin cDNA probes for 16 h at 42 °C. The filters were washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. A search of the GenBankTM expressed sequence tag data base identified multiple short expressed sequence tag clones that had great identity to the C-terminal domains of ELL and ELL2. Since we recently demonstrated that this domain of ELL is required for the immortalization of myeloid progenitors by MLL-ELL found in human leukemia, 2DiMartino, J. F., Miller, T., Ayton, P., Landewe, T., Hess, J. L., Cleary, M. L., and Shilatifard, A. (2000) Blood, in press. we set out to identify this full-length protein. Employing rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR and library hybridization methods, we obtained the ORF encoding ELL3. An approximately 1.2-kb DNA fragment containing the entire predicted ELL3 ORF was obtained by PCR using DNA polymerase Tli (Promega) with proofreading ability, and several clones were sequenced. The ELL3 ORF encodes an approximately 400-amino acid protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kDa. As determined by the BESTFIT program of the Genetics Computer Group (GCG, Madison, WI) package (21Genetics Computer Group Program Manual for the GCG Package , Version 9. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar), ELL3 has about 50% identity with ELL and ELL2 throughout its ORF (Fig. 1). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that both ELL and ELL2 are capable of stimulating the overall rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing along the DNA template (19Shilatifard A. Duan R.D. Haque D. Florence C. Schubach W.H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3639-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Shilatifard A. Haque D.

Our structure/function studies demonstrated that the elongation activation domain of ELL and ELL2 lies within the N-terminal 150 amino acids (19Shilatifard A. Duan R.D. Haque D. Florence C.

Since ELL3 demonstrated regions of high homology in its N terminus compared with ELL and ELL2, we set out to determine if ELL3 can also increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II in an in vitroreconstituted transcription elongation system. A DNA fragment containing the ELL3 ORF was introduced into bacterial and mammalian expression vectors. Recombinant ELL3 proteins were expressed and were purified with either nickel affinity chromatography or with FLAG antibodies from bacterial or mammalian cells, respectively. The homogeneity of the purified recombinant ELL3 proteins were tested by the application of the purified protein to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analysis by either Colloidal staining or Western analysis (Fig. 2, A andB). The molecular mass of the recombinant ELL3 protein was approximately 50 kDa, in agreement with the predicted size of the protein based on amino acid composition. We next sought to determine if ELL3 could increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. As shown in Fig.2 C, ELL3 is an RNA polymerase II elongation factor with functional properties similar to those reported for ELL and ELL2 (3Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C.

The ability of ELL3 to increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation was tested employing transcription reactions initiated from promoters and the basal transcription machinery. Briefly, preinitiation complexes were assembled by preincubation of purified RNA polymerase II, recombinant TBP, recombinant TFIIB, recombinant TFIIE, recombinant TFIIF, and purified TFIIH with DNA template containing AdML promoter. Highly radioactive transcripts were synthesized during a brief pulse carried out in the presence of ATP, GTP, UTP, and a limiting concentration of [α-32P]CTP. These short promoter-specific transcripts were then elongated into full-length run-off transcripts in the presence of either purified protein from mock-transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1–4) or purified ELL3 from 293 cells (Fig.2 C, lanes 5–8) and excess nonradioactive CTP. Transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide, 7.0 m urea gel and developed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager instrument. As shown in Fig.2 C, transcripts synthesized in the presence of ELL3 (lanes 5–8) were substantially longer than those synthesized in its absence (lanes 1–4). To investigate the expression pattern of ELL3 in human tissue, Northern blots containing poly(A) RNA from various human tissues were hybridized with a full-length ELL3-specific probe. As shown in Fig. 3, only RNA from the testis showed a single band at approximately 2-kb hybridizing with human ELL3 probe. With lower stringency washes, a faint band co-migrating with the testis-specific band was observed in the liver and pancreas mRNA (data not shown). The blots were stripped and reprobed with a human actin cDNA probe to ensure equivalent mRNA loading. We developed stable cell lines regulated for the expression of ELL3 as described under “Materials and Methods.” We constructed the FLAG-ELL3 cDNA under the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter regulated by the tetracycline operator and developed ELL3 293 Tet cell lines expressing full-length ELL3 under control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter. Removal of tetracycline from the tissue culture medium for 24 h resulted in the expression of full-length ELL3 of approximately 50 kDa as determined by Western blot using FLAG monoclonal antibody (data not shown). To determine the subcellular localization of ELL3, we employed FLAG-ELL3 Tet Off cell lines and FLAG monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig.4 A in the presence of tetracycline, the expression of ELL3 is off. However, when tetracycline is removed, we can see good expression of ELL3 by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 4 C) and Western analysis (data not shown). The same cells that were stained with monoclonal antibodies for the recognition of ELL3 were also stained with DAPI to visualize DNA (Fig. 4 B). It is clearly obvious from this experiment that ELL3 immunoflurescence co-localizes with DAPI staining (compare Fig. 4,B and C), indicating that ELL3 is targeted to the nucleus of these mammalian cells (25Tollefson A.E. Hermiston T.W. Lichenstein D.L. Colle C.F. Tripp R.A. Dimitrov T. Toth K. Wells C.E. Doherty P.C. Wold W.S.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We report here the identification, expression, and biochemical analysis of ELL3, a novel RNA polymerase II elongation factor that is specifically expressed in human testis. ELL3 is an approximately 400 amino acid-containing protein that has approximately 50% sequence identity to both ELL and ELL2 proteins (Fig. 1). Like ELL and ELL2, ELL3 is also capable of increasing the catalytic rate of transcription elongation catalyzed by RNA polymerase II initiated from promoters and the basal transcription machinery. Our immunoflurescence studies have indicated that ELL3 is localized in the nucleus of mammalian cells. We note that proteins expressed under the transient trasfection conditions are extremely overexpressed in cells and may result in the incorrect interpretation of the localization data. For this reason, we have developed an ELL3-stable cell line (which contains about 1 copy of ELL3/cell) and have demonstrated that when ELL3 is expressed in these cells, all of the ELL3 in all of the cells expressing ELL3 is found within the nucleus. We find ELL3 diffused evenly within the nucleus, a common characteristic of most general transcriptional elongation factors (23Thirman M.J. Diskin E.B. Bin S.S. Ip H.S. Miller J.M. Simon M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1408-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 3T. Landewe and A. Shilatifard, unpublished data. This method of localization has also been used for both ELL and ELL2 and also the MLL protein. We have recently demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of ELL is required and sufficient for the immortalization of myeloid progenitors by the MLL-ELL fusion protein found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.2 Our data also indicated that the presence of the elongation activity of ELL can increase the number of immortalized cells after the third round of passage.2 Very little is known about the role of the C-terminal domain of ELL and how it may function in biological systems. Since both ELL2 and ELL3 have strong conservation of their C-terminal domain and exhibit a great degree of homology to the C-terminal domain of ELL, we can speculate that this domain of the ELLs plays a pivotal physiological role. It has been demonstrated that expression of ELL in RAT1 cells leads to increased colony formation, which is coincident with expression of the AP-1 protein, c-Fos (5Conaway J.W. Conaway R., C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two functions depend on the presence of a lysine-rich region within the C terminus present in both ELL1 and ELL2 but not entirely present in ELL3. Whether ELL2 and/or ELL3 have similar oncogenic properties to those apparently mediated by ELL remains to be determined. We also note that a homology search of the GenBankTM data base has revealed that the conserved C-terminal domain of the ELLs bears a striking resemblance to the ZO-1 binding domain of occludin (26Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 27Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). This similarity of the C-terminal domain of ELL to the ZO-1 binding domain of occludin is about 42% for ELL2, 44% for ELL3, and 40% for ELL. The ZO-1 protein is a member of the family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs that is thought to be important for signal transduction (28Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Itallie C.V. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The ZO-1 protein, which is predominantly found in the cytosol of contact-inhibited cultured cells, was recently demonstrated to translocate to the nucleus of subconfluent cells (29Gottardi C.J. Arpin M. Fanning A.S. Louvard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10779-10784Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This indicates that ZO-1 may be involved in signaling pathways controlled by cell-cell contact. Whether the conserved C-terminal domain of the ELLs can interact with either ZO-1 or ZO-1-like proteins or with proteins that interact with ZO-1 or ZO-1-like proteins is currently unknown. However, it is feasible to speculate that the ELLs can regulate transcription via a signal transduction pathway involving the ZO-1 or ZO-1-like protein(s). Studies of the functional interaction of ELL have demonstrated that ELL is capable of interaction with p53 (2Maki K. Mitani K. Yamagata T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3216-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shinobu N. Maeda T. Aso T. Ito T. Kondo T. Koike K. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17003-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This interaction of ELL with p53 results in the regulation of transcriptional activities of both ELL and p53 in vitro (33Shinobu N. Maeda T. Aso T. Ito T. Kondo T. Koike K. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17003-17010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Structure/function studies have demonstrated that functional interaction of ELL with p53 requires the N-terminal half of ELL protein. We have tested if both ELL2 and ELL3 interact with p53. Our functional interaction studies indicate that ELL2 and ELL3 are both capable of physical interaction with p53 and that this interaction requires the C-terminal domain of p53 (data not shown). The investigation of the physiological role for such interactions between the ELLs with p53 is under way in our laboratories. Our Northern analysis which was probed with a full-length ELL3 probe has demonstrated that ELL3 is testis-specific. This is in contrast to ELL, which is ubiquitously expressed, and ELL2 which is expressed in most tissues tested except for the kidneys (19Shilatifard A. Duan R.D. Haque D. Florence C. Schubach W.H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3639-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). There are other testis-specific RNA polymerase II elongation factors such as SII and elongin A2 (7Weaver Z.A. Kane C.M. Genomics. 1997; 46: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Umehara T. Kida S. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6546-6552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). What is the function of these testis elongation factors in vivo? The data presented, together with other reports that have shown a dramatic increase of RNA polymerase II and several other general transcription initiation factors during late spermatogenesis in rodents (32Schmidt E.E. Schibler U. Development. 1995; 121: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also the lack of the expression of ELL3 in ovaries, suggest that ELL3 may play an important role in the process of spermatogenesis. However, the expression of ELL3 is not detectable in ovaries; therefore, ELL3 may not play any general role in meiosis. Currently, we are pursuing the cell type specificity of ELL3 and plan to generate ELL3-deficient mice to determine the role of this protein in vivo. Finally, the ability of the ELLs to regulate the rate of messenger RNA synthesis, catalyzed by RNA polymerase II, makes the study of the mechanism of action of these proteins extremely important in understanding the mechanism of regulation of mammalian gene expression. While our manuscript was in proof, a search of the newly released database with ELL3 cDNA indicated that the gene encoding for human ELL3 is located on chromosome 15q15. A. S. thanks Dr. William S.

Transfection experiments demonstrate that each ligand requires α1,3-fucosylation for selectin-binding. However, the relative contributions made by the two known myeloid α1,3-fucosyltransferases Fuc-TVII or Fuc-TIV to this α1,3-fucosylation are not yet clear. To address this issue, we have used mice deficient in Fuc-TIV and/or Fuc-TVII to examine how these enzymes generate selectin-binding glycoforms of PSGL-1 and ESL-1 in mouse neutrophils. Selectin binding was analyzed by affinity isolation experiments using recombinant, antibody-like forms of the respective endothelial selectins. We observe essentially normal binding of E- or P-selectin to PSGL-1 expressed by Fuc-TIV-deficient neutrophils but find that PSGL-1 expressed by Fuc-TVII-deficient neutrophils is not bound by E- or P-selectin. By contrast, E-selectin binds with normal efficiency to ESL-1 on Fuc-TVII-deficient neutrophils but exhibits an 80% reduction in its ability to bind ESL-1 isolated from Fuc-TIV-deficient neutrophils. The same specificity with which Fuc-TVII and Fuc-TIV generate selectin-binding forms of PSGL-1 and ESL-1 was found in transfection experiments with CHO-Pro−5 cells. In contrast, each fucosyltransferase alone could generate selectin-binding glycoforms of each of the two ligands in CHO-DUKX-B1 cells. Our data imply that in mouse neutrophils and their precursors, Fuc-TVII exclusively directs expression of PSGL-1 glycoforms bound with high affinity by P-selectin. By contrast, Fuc-TIV preferentially directs expression of ESL-1 glycoforms that exhibit high affinity for E-selectin. This substrate specificity can be mimicked in CHO-Pro−5 cells.

By contrast, dimeric (230 kDa) and monomeric (130 kDa) forms of the mouse homologue of human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) are recognized by both P-selectin and E-selectin (4Borges E.

Furthermore, PSGL-1 is indeed relevant for the extravasation of leukocytes in vivo, because adhesion blocking antibodies against mouse PSGL-1 inhibit migration of mouse Th1 cells into inflamed skin and of mouse neutrophils into inflamed peritoneum (4Borges E.

ESL-1, in contrast to most known selectin ligands, requires N-linked carbohydrates for E-selectin binding. These essential N-linked carbohydrates must be modified with sLex-like structures generated by α(2,3)-sialylation and α(1,3)-fucosylation (3Levinovitz A. Mühlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J.

These observations suggest the possibility that the apparently inconsistent ability of Fuc-TIV to direct E-selectin ligand activity may be accounted for by protein-specific glycosylation processes. Indeed, in cultured CHO-DUKX-B1 cells, we have shown that E-selectin-binding glycoforms of ESL-1 are generated by Fuc-TIV as well as by Fuc-TVII and that both enzymes selectively modify ESL-1, relative to other cellular proteins also capable of modification by Fuc-TIII, a fucosyltransferase with a more promiscuous acceptor substrate specificity (30Zöllner O.

However, the mean leukocyte rolling fraction in the microvasculature of the cremaster muscle in Fuc-TIV(−/−) mice is diminished and the population of leukocytes that roll at very low velocities (<10 μm/s) is absent.2 To begin to define the biochemical basis for these observations and to illuminate the relative roles for Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII in the modification of E- and P-selectin ligand activity in myeloid lineage cells, we have examined the relative contributions of these two fucosyltransferases to the generation of selectin-binding forms of PSGL-1 and ESL-1 in mouse neutrophils. Analysis of neutrophil ESL-1 and PSGL-1 in mice deficient in the loci encoding Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII discloses that each fucosyltransferase uniquely modifies PSGL-1 and ESL-1, implying that each maintains a glycoprotein-specific substrate recognition repertoire that can account for differential yet overlapping contributions to E- and P-selectin ligand activity.DISCUSSIONWe have shown recently that the two leukocytic fucosyltransferases Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII, when transfected into CHO cells, specifically and selectively generate sLex-like carbohydrate epitopes on ESL-1 with great preference over other cellular glycoproteins (30Zöllner O. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33002-33008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for this selectivity is yet unexplained. Here we show that the two fucosyltransferases can direct ligand formation in mouse neutrophils with an even higher selectivity. In mouse neutrophils, Fuc-TVII is necessary for expression of the selectin-binding glycoform of PSGL-1. By contrast, Fuc-TIV is not required for E-selectin reactivity of PSGL-1 but makes a small contribution to the P-selectin reactivity of PSGL-1. On the other hand, Fuc-TIV makes a substantial contribution to the E-selectin reactivity of ESL-1, whereas Fuc-TVII provides only a modest contribution to the E-selectin-binding glycoform of ESL-1.How does the ability of the two different FucTs to generate selectin-binding glycoforms of ESL-1 and PSGL-1 (as defined by affinity isolation experiments) correspond with the physiological function of these enzymes in leukocyte extravasation? Fuc-TVII deficiency abolishes neutrophil and monocyte E- and P-selectin ligand activity (31Maly P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), as assessed using E- and P-selectin-IgM flow cytometry probes. Neutrophils deficient in Fuc-TVII also exhibit defective extravasation to extravascular sites in the thioglycollate-induced peritoneal inflammation model (31Maly P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This correlates with the complete loss of binding of PSGL-1 to E- and P-selectin in our affinity isolation experiments, indicating the importance of PSGL-1 for neutrophil interactions with P-selectin and maybe E-selectin. The in vivo relevance of PSGL-1 for the migration of neutrophils into inflamed peritoneum has been demonstrated (4Borges E. Eytner R. Moll T. Steegmaier M. Matthew A. Campbell P. Ley K. Mossmann H. Vestweber D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Yang J. Hirata T. Croce K. Merrill-Skoloff G. Tchernychev B. Williams E. Flaumenhaft R. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1769-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and is certainly based on interactions with P-selectin. The functional relevance of PSGL-1 as an E-selectin ligand is still unclear, because neutrophils from PSGL-1-deficient mice still roll on E-selectin (39Yang J. Hirata T. Croce K. Merrill-Skoloff G. Tchernychev B. Williams E. Flaumenhaft R. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1769-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In contrast to PSGL-1, ESL-1 on Fuc-TVII-deficient neutrophils can be affinity isolated by an E-selectin probe with similar efficiency as ESL-1 on wt neutrophils. This suggests that ESL-1 is not sufficient to generate E-selectin binding activity on neutrophils, which would be detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with an E-selectin-IgM probe or which would be sufficient for leukocyte extravasation. One possible explanation for this is that ESL-1, although clearly detectable by antibodies on the surface of neutrophils and lymphocytes (40Steegmaier M. Borges E. Berger J. Schwarz H. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 687-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed on the cell surface at levels that cannot be easily detected by an E-selectin-IgM probe. Furthermore, although ESL-1 is selectively expressed along the surface of microvillous processes and not on the planar cell body, ESL-1 is not located on the tips of the processes where PSGL-1 and l-selectin are located (40Steegmaier M. Borges E. Berger J. Schwarz H. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 687-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that ESL-1 is not involved in the capturing process mediated by PSGL-1 and l-selectin and that ESL-1 alone is not sufficient to mediate leukocyte extravasation in case ligands on the tips of microvilli are dysfunctional. Whether ESL-1 might be involved in functions related to the minor defects observed in Fuc-TIV(−/−)Fuc-TVII(−/−) mice still needs to be investigated.The defects in Fuc-TIV (−/−) mice are more subtle than those of Fuc-TVII (−/−) mice.2 No defect was seen in the efficiency of neutrophil migration into inflamed peritoneum. However, examining these mice in controlled detachment assays revealed that Fuc-TVII(−/−) granulocytes display residual shear-resistant adhesive interactions with E- and P-selectin, whereas Fuc-TIV (−/−)Fuc-TVII (−/−) granulocytes do not.2 The residual adhesive interactions of Fuc-TVII (−/−) granulocytes with P-selectin suggests that Fuc-TIV contributes to the interactions of PSGL-1 with P-selectin. This is in agreement with the slight decrease in the efficiency with which PSGL-1 can be affinity isolated with P-selectin from Fuc-TIV-deficient granulocytes. This suggests that Fuc-TIV-dependent modifications have a subtle effect on the binding of PSGL-1 as can be detected by affinity isolation and by the slightly more sensitive method of cell rolling under shear force. We conclude that Fuc-TVII alone but not Fuc-TIV alone can direct the generation of a PSGL-1 glycoform that binds well to E- and P-selectin. The binding efficiency of a Fuc-TVII modified glycoform can be slightly further increased by the additional modification via Fuc-TIV. The triple fucosylated oligosaccharide sequence SAα2–3′Lexβ1–3′Lexβ1–3′Lex is believed to contribute to the binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin (13Wilkins P.P. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18732-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It was shown recently by in vitro studies that Fuc-TIV can generate the two internal fucose linkages of such an oligosaccharide, whereas Fuc-TVII can only generate the distal fucose linkage (41Niemelä R. Natunen J. Majuri M-L. Maaheimo H. Helin J. Lowe J.B. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In combination with our results this would suggest that the distal fucose residue in this oligosaccharide is indispensable for selectin binding, that the two internal fucose residues alone are not sufficient for binding, and that the triple fucosylated structure is binding only slightly better than the same structure lacking the two internal fucose residues.The lack of any effect of the Fuc-TIV deficiency on neutrophil migration into inflamed peritoneum is in agreement with the only weakly affected binding of PSGL-1 to E- and P-selectin in these mice. By contrast, the only strong effect detected in Fuc-TIV-deficient mice was the strong although not complete reduction in the binding of ESL-1 to E-selectin. Because ESL-1 is an E-selectin-specific ligand that does not bind to the other selectins the strong reduction of ESL-1 binding to E-selectin can only affect E-selectin specific functions. E-selectin deficiency does not affect neutrophil migration into inflamed peritoneum (42Labow M.A. Norton C.R. Rumberger J.M. Lombard-Gillooly K.M. Shuster D.J. Hubbard J. Bertko R. Knaack P.A. Terry R.W. Harbison M.L. Kontgen F. Stewart C.L. McIntyre K.W. Will P.C. Burns D.K. Wolitzky B.A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar); thus, it is not surprising that the strong reduction of ESL-1 binding to E-selectin does also not affect this process. However, more detailed analysis revealed that slowly rolling leukocytes (∼5 μm/s) are missing in E-selectin-deficient mice (43Kunkel E.J. Ley K. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1196-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this context it is interesting that a large fraction of the slow rolling class of leukocytes in wild type cremaster muscle or ear vasculature are absent from the Fuc-TIV (−/−) mice.2 In combination these results could indicate that Fuc-TIV may indeed contribute to ESL-1-dependent E-selectin activity that is physiologically detectable using intravital microscopy and that correlates with thein vitro biochemical analyses shown here. This might be partially responsible for the enhanced rolling velocity of leukocytes in Fuc-TIV-deficient mice in vivo.The selectivity with which PSGL-1 and ESL-1 are modified in neutrophils by either Fuc-TVII or Fuc-TIV is surprising. Fuc-TIV alone could not generate a selectin-binding glycoform of PSGL-1, whereas it was sufficient to generate an E-selectin-binding form of ESL-1, in contrast Fuc-TVII alone was clearly less efficient than Fuc-TIV in generating an E-selectin-binding form of ESL-1. This selectivity must be determined by cell type-specific factors because it was observed in neutrophils but not in CHO-DUKX-B1 cells where each fucosyltransferase alone was sufficient to generate selectin-binding glycoforms of each ligand. In contrast, a similar selectivity as in mouse neutrophils was observed in CHO-Pro−5 cells. The selectivity of Fuc-TVII for PSGL-1 that was found in neutrophils could be mimicked in CHO-Pro−5 cells. The dominance of Fuc-TIV for the generation of E-selectin-reactive ESL-1 in neutrophils could not be reproduced in CHO-Pro−5 cells, because each of the two fucosyltransferases generated equivalent amounts of E-selectin-binding ESL-1. Nevertheless, the factors that determine ligand selectivity of Fuc-TIV and Fuc-TVII for PSGL-1 are present in CHO-Pro−5 cells but not in CHO-DUKX-B1 cells. It will be interesting to elucidate the mechanism by which the two fucosyltransferases select their glycoprotein substrates. The endothelial selectins, P- and E-selectin, are inducible adhesion molecules that initiate the tethering of granulocytes, monocytes, and subsets of lymphocytes to endothelium in inflamed tissues (1Vestweber D. Vadas M.A. Harlan J. The Selectins: Initiators of Leukocyte Endothelial Adhesion. 3. Harwood Academic Publisher, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1997: 225Google Scholar). Two major glycoprotein ligands for E- and P-selectins have been identified on mouse neutrophils (2Lenter M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). One of these, a 150-kDa molecule termed E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1)1 (3Levinovitz A. Mühlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), is recognized by E-selectin but not by P-selectin. By contrast, dimeric (230 kDa) and monomeric (130 kDa) forms of the mouse homologue of human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) are recognized by both P-selectin and E-selectin (4Borges E.

Polyclonal antibodies against ESL-1 partially inhibit binding of mouse myeloid cells to E-selectin in nonflow adhesion assays (7Steegmaier M. Levinovitz A. Isenmann S. Borges E. Lenter M. Kocher H.P. Kleuser B. Vestweber D. Nature. 1995; 373: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against PSGL-1 almost completely block binding of human (8Moore K.L. Patel K.D.

Blood. 1996; 87: 4176-4186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) neutrophils to P-selectin under flow and nonflow conditions in vitro. These in vitro observations have a physiologically faithful in vivo correlate, because a monoclonal antibody against human PSGL-1 has been shown to block rolling of human neutrophils in postcapillary venules of the mouse cremaster muscle (10Norman K.E. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Ley K. Blood. 1995; 86: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PSGL-1 is indeed relevant for the extravasation of leukocytes in vivo, because adhesion blocking antibodies against mouse PSGL-1 inhibit migration of mouse Th1 cells into inflamed skin and of mouse neutrophils into inflamed peritoneum (4Borges E. Eytner R. Moll T. Steegmaier M. Matthew A. Campbell P. Ley K. Mossmann H. Vestweber D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Borges E. Tietz W. Steegmaier M. Moll T. Hallmann R.

This pair of selectin ligands require certain post-translational modifications for selectin binding. ESL-1, in contrast to most known selectin ligands, requires N-linked carbohydrates for E-selectin binding. These essential N-linked carbohydrates must be modified with sLex-like structures generated by α(2,3)-sialylation and α(1,3)-fucosylation (3Levinovitz A. Mühlhoff J. Isenmann S. Vestweber D. J.

Mast cells can produce a significant amount of IL-4 and have been proposed to play a major role in the induction of Th2 responses. Recently, it has been reported that mast cells have a distinct IL-15 receptor system different from that of T or natural killer cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that IL-15 induced IL-4 production from a mouse mast cell line, MC/9, and bone marrow-derived mast cells. IL-4 mRNA expression was increased by IL-15, suggesting that IL-15 promotes IL-4 expression at the transcriptional level. In these mast cells, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 were rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-15. In MC/9 cells, the expression of a C-terminally truncated dominant negative form of STAT6 significantly suppressed the IL-4 mRNA up-regulation by IL-15, suggesting that STAT6 activation is essential for the IL-15-mediated IL-4 production. Additionally, tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 was rapidly increased by IL-15 treatment in this cell line.

T cells of the T helper 2 (Th2) phenotype, which first require the presence of IL-4 for their own development, produce this cytokine by themselves along with IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 (6Seder R.A.

Although it has been postulated that naive CD4+ T cells can differentiate along the Th2 pathway through the production of small amounts of autocrine IL-4, it is generally conceived that bystander cells producing IL-4 also have a significant effect on the initiation and amplification of the Th2 response. A number of different cell types are known to be responsible for such early IL-4 production (5Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mast cells, widely distributed through vascularized tissues, are able to produce a significant amount of IL-4 as well as a variety of other cytokines (9Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to play a major role in the generation of Th2 responses (10Coffman R.L. von der Weid T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of great interest to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling the IL-4 production in mast cells. The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is an important cytokine-induced signal transduction pathway that directly transfers signals from the cell surface cytokine receptor to the nucleus (11Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5025) Google Scholar, 12Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 13Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Among STAT proteins, STAT6 was first isolated as a protein tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-4 stimulation (14Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). STAT6 has been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulating the Th2 response based on the analyses of STAT6-deficient mouse models (15Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 16Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that STAT6 is activated by IL-13 that shares many biological properties with IL-4 (17Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). IL-15 is a member of the cytokines that have a T cell growth promoting activity (18Bamford R.N. Grant A.J. Burton J.D. Peters C. Kurys G. Goldman C.K. Brennan J. Roessler E. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4940-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 19Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Many functional properties of IL-15 in T and NK cells are shared by IL-2 (20Grabstein K.H. Eisenman J.

Science. 1994; 264: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) probably because the receptor complexes for IL-15 and IL-2 share two signal-transducing subunits, IL-2 receptor (R)β and γc chains, in these cell types (18Bamford R.N. Grant A.J. Burton J.D. Peters C. Kurys G. Goldman C.K. Brennan J. Roessler E. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4940-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 21Giri J.G.

In contrast, it has recently been reported that IL-15 uses a distinct receptor system in mast cells (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although mast cells do not respond to IL-2 because of the lack of IL-2Rβ expression, they proliferate in response to IL-15. IL-15 seems to work on mast cells through a novel 60–65-kDa IL-15R molecule, IL-15RX (19Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). However, the physiological roles of IL-15 in mast cell functions have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we have demonstrated that IL-15 induces IL-4 production from a mouse mast cell line, MC/9 and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). IL-4 mRNA expression is induced by IL-15, suggesting that IL-15 promotes IL-4 production at the transcriptional level. Surprisingly, STAT6, but not STAT1, -3, or -5, is rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-15. In MC/9 cells, expression of a C-terminally truncated dominant negative form of STAT6 significantly suppressed IL-4 gene expression induced by IL-15, indicating that the activation of STAT6 is involved in the IL-15-mediated IL-4 production. Furthermore, Tyk2 was suggested to be responsible for the IL-15-mediated STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation, because Tyk2 but not Jak1, Jak2, or Jak3 was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-15 treatment in this cell line. Altogether, our results suggest that IL-15 may play an important role in the initiation of Th2 response by stimulating IL-4 expression in mast cells.

After 3 weeks of culture with 10% WEHI-3-conditioned medium, the cells were harvested for the experiments and consisted of more than 98% mast cells assessed by toluidine blue staining. For all experiments described here, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated in the serum-free medium before cytokine stimulation. Cytokine concentrations used for the stimulation experiments were as follows: 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-15, 10 ng/ml IL-3 plus IL-15 unless otherwise indicated. MC/9 cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium and stimulated under various conditions. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScriptTM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 20 pmol of random primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl of reaction buffer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Synthesized first-strand of cDNA was amplified by means of PCR using specific sense and antisense primers (20 pmol each) with 1.25 unit of recombinant Taq (Takara Shuzou, Osaka Japan) in a total volume of a 50-μl reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, and 0.2 μm dNTP. The amplification procedure performed in a temperature controller was as follows: after an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles were performed at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. 5 μl of each PCR product was run on a 2% agarose gel (Life Technologies, Inc.) for UV visualization. Primer sequences were as follows: IL-4 sense, 5′-CGAAGAACACCACAGAGACTGAGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-GACTCATTCATGGTGCAGCTTATCG-3′; IL-13 sense, 5′-ATGAGTCTGCAGTATCCCG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGTGGCAGACAGGAGTGTT-3′; tumor necrosis factor-α, 5′-GGCAGGTCTACTTTGGAGTCATTGC-3′; antisense, 5′-ACATTCGAGGCTCCAGTGAATTCGG-3′. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium and stimulated under various conditions. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described above. 20-μg aliquots of the total RNAs were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmEDTA (pH 7.0), and 6% (v/v) formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. After UV-cross-linking, membranes were soaked in prehybridization solution (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) for 3 h at 65 °C followed by incubation with 32P-labeled probe in hybridization solution (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) for 14 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice at room temperature, in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min twice at 50 °C and were exposed to Fuji RX-U films (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA fragments of the coding regions of mouse IL-4 and β-actin were used as specific probes. The luciferase reporter vector containing the IL-4 promoter (pIL-4 (−766) Lu) was described previously (23Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). MC/9 cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg of pIL-4 (−766) Lu and 0.5 μg of pRL/SV40 (an internal control) by 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxyethylammonium bromide-C Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after the transfection, the transfected cells were stimulated with IL-15 (10 ng/ml) or left untreated. After a 12-h incubation with IL-15, cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Toyo Ink Co., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data were presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium and stimulated under various conditions; they were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmNaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride with aprotinin and leupeptin at 10 μg/ml) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged (15000 rpm, 5 min), and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C for further experiments. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of cell lysate (from 1 × 107 cells) was rotated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, added with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (1:1, beads:lysis buffer), and incubated further for 1 h at 4 °C. In all cases, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in the loading buffer before electrophoresis. Lysates or immunoprecipitates were analyzed on a 7.5, 10, or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h, and Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Matsuguchi T. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17450-17459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) followed by detection using enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MC/9 cells were sensitized by incubating for 2 h with 1 μg/ml anti-DNP IgE in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, washed, and incubated (2 × 106 cells/ml) with 50 ng/ml DNP-human serum albumin, in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-15 or not. The cell-free culture supernatants were collected after 48 h of culture. The IL-4 concentrations in the culture supernatants were assayed by ELISA using a mouse IL-4 ELISA system (Genzyme, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MC/9 cells were stained with anti-mouse IL-2Rβ, γc chain antibody, or isotype-matched control rat IgG, followed by the phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG. After washing, the cells were resuspended and analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The dominant negative STAT6 expression plasmid was generated by cloning the DNA encoding C-terminally truncated human STAT6 (containing amino acid 1–662) into pCEV29 vector. MC/9 cells were transfected with an electroporator using 20 μg of plasmid DNA at the condition of 800 microfarad and 300 V. Transfectants were selected with G418 (1 mg/ml). Resistant clones were screened for the right sized protein expression by Western blotting using an anti-STAT6 antibody (directed against amino acid 280–480). The statistical significance of the data was determined by the Student's t test. A pvalue of less than 0.05 was taken as significant. It is generally accepted that the IL-15 receptor is composed of three subunits, two of which (IL-2Rβ and γc) are shared by IL-2 (20Grabstein K.H. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Rauch C. Srinivasan S. Fung V. Beers C. Richardson J. Schoenborn M.A. Ahdieh M. Science. 1994; 264: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 21Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). However, in a previous report, it has been reported that the IL-2Rβ chain is not expressed on mast cells, and IL-15 seems to utilize a novel receptor, IL-15RX (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine the surface expression of IL-2Rβ and γc chains on MC/9, a well established mouse mast cell line used in the experiments, flow cytometry analyses were performed using specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). As shown in Fig.1, there was no detectable surface expression of IL-2Rβ on MC/9 cells, although they expressed the γc chain as previously reported (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To confirm that the expression profile is not specific to this cell line, we also examined mouse BMMCs for IL-2R expression. They also expressed γc but not IL-2Rβ on the surface as reported earlier (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although it has been reported that IL-15 supports the growth of mast cells (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), other effects of IL-15 on mast cells have not been fully explored. As mast cells are able to produce a variety of cytokines including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor-α, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to various stimulations (25Galli S.J. Gordon J.R. Wershil B.K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 26Galli S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 27Plaut M. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Hanley-Hyde J. Nordan R.P. Paul W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 28Wodnar-Filipowicz A. Heusser C.H. Moroni C. Nature. 1989; 339: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 29Burd P.R. Thompson W.C. Max E.E. Mills F.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we sought to examine whether exogenous IL-15 affects cytokine mRNA expression in MC/9 cells. Cells were incubated with IL-15 for 0, 1, 2, or 4 h and harvested for RNA preparation. Total RNAs from these cells were reverse-transcribed and then used for PCR amplification with pairs of specific primers for IL-4, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Reverse transcriptase-PCR products for β-actin were measured to verify the integrity of the RNA. As shown in Fig.2 A, factor-derived MC/9 cells expressed a low level of mRNA for IL-4. IL-4 mRNA was significantly increased after 2- and 4-h stimulations by IL-15. In contrast, either IL-13 or tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA was not altered by the IL-15 stimulation. To know the concentration of IL-15 needed to induce IL-4 mRNA, MC/9 cells were stimulated with various concentration of IL-15 for 4 h and harvested for Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, IL-15 induced a weak IL-4 mRNA increase at 100 pg/ml, whereas 1000 and 10,000 pg/ml IL-15 induced more evident increase. IL-4 mRNA was also significantly increased by IL-15 treatment in BMMCs (Fig. 2 C). We next examined IL-4 promoter activity in IL-15-treated mast cells. MC/9 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct that contained an IL-4 promoter region (IL-4 (−760) Lu), and luciferase activity was measured after a 12-h stimulation by IL-15. As shown Fig. 2 D, IL-15 significantly increased the promoter activity of the IL-4 gene. To confirm whether the increase of IL-4 induced by IL-15 stimulation might contribute to the increase of IL-4 itself, we utilize a neutralizing antibody against mouse IL-4. MC/9 cells were incubated with IL-15 in the presence of the anti-IL-4 mAb for 6 h, and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed. The effectiveness of the neutralization was confirmed by the observation that the same concentration of this antibody could abrogate the IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 (data not shown). As shown in Fig.2 E, the existence of Anti IL-4 mAb did not affect the increase of IL-4 mRNA. To determine whether IL-15 stimulates IL-4 protein secretion from mast cells, we measured IL-4 concentration in the culture supernatants of mast cells incubated with IL-15. BMMCs were incubated with IL-15 or not for 24 h. As shown in Fig.3 A, IL-15, when added to the culture, significantly increased the IL-4 concentration in the culture supernatant. MC/9 cells that we used produced a very small amount of IL-4 even when stimulated by ionomycin (data not shown), which is a strong inducer of IL-4 production (27Plaut M. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Hanley-Hyde J. Nordan R.P. Paul W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), and they hardly produced IL-4 in the presence of IL-15 (data not shown). Thus, we used IL-15 in combination with antigen/antigen-specific IgE stimulation that is a potent inducer of IL-4 from mast cells (27Plaut M. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Hanley-Hyde J. Nordan R.P. Paul W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 B, MC/9 cells secreted a small amount of IL-4 in the presence of DNP/DNP-specific IgE. IL-15, when added to the culture, increased the IL-4 concentration. These data provide evidence that IL-15 is a potent inducer of IL-4 production from mast cells. The JAK/STAT pathway is an important cytokine-induced signal transduction pathway that directly transfers signals from cell surface cytokine receptor to the nucleus. As it had been known that STAT6 played an important role in the regulation of IL-4 gene expression by IL-4 in helper T cells (30Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we sought to examine STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation after IL-15 stimulation in MC/9 cells. Factor-deprived MC/9 cells were stimulated with various concentration of IL-15 for 30 min before lysis. STAT6 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, and subsequent Western blotting analysis was performed using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. To compare the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation, MC/9 cells were also stimulated for 30 min with IL-3, a major growth factor for mast cells. As shown in Fig.4 A, IL-15 clearly induced STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation within 30 min. At 100 or 1000 pg/ml, IL-15 induced moderate STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas 10,000 pg/ml IL-15 induced it more evidently. In the time course analysis, the maximum induction of STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation was found to occur between 15 and 30 min of IL-15 stimulation (Fig. 4 B). Although it has been reported that IL-15 stimulates STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation in another mast cell line (PT-18) (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we could not detect any STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation in MC/9 cells after IL-15 stimulation (Fig. 4 C). Additionally, IL-15 did not induce any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of other members of STAT, STAT1, STAT3, or STAT4 (data not shown). Additionally, IL-15 also stimulated STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation in BMMCs (Fig.4 D). To confirm STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation that we observed was directly regulated by IL-15 and not because of the autocrine effect by IL-4, we examined STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation under an IL-4 depletion condition. As shown Fig. 4 E, IL-4 depletion from the culture supernatant by the neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb did not affect the STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation by IL-15 stimulation (Fig. 4 E). To examine if the activation of STAT6 was responsible for the IL-4 production in response to IL-15, we transfected an expression plasmid encoding a C-terminally truncated form of STAT6 in MC/9 cells. This mutant lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain. Three clones expressing this short form of STAT6 were isolated for analyses. The Western blotting result of a typical clone was shown in Fig.5 A. To examine if this STAT6 mutant worked in a dominant negative fashion, we stimulated a positive clone with IL-4 or IL-15 and analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous STAT6. As shown in Fig. 5 B, both IL-4- and IL-15-mediated STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylations were significantly inhibited in this clone, suggesting that this C-terminally truncated STAT6 mutant worked in a dominant negative fashion. When IL-15-induced IL-4 mRNA expression was examined by the semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, it was significantly decreased in these cells compared with that of the parental MC/9 cells (Fig. 5 C). These results strongly indicated that STAT6 activation is essential for the IL-4 production mediated by IL-15. To study the upstream regulators of STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation, the activation of JAK family kinases was examined in IL-15-stimulated MC/9 cells. Factor-starved MC/9 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of IL-15 for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min before cell lysis, and JAK kinases were immunoprecipitated by their specific antibodies to examine the tyrosine phosphorylation status by immunoblotting using an antiphosphotyrosine mAb (4G10). As shown Fig. 6 A, Tyk2 was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-15. Although IL-15-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported in another mast cell line (PT-18) (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we could not detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 in MC/9 cells (Fig. 6 B). Also, IL-15 did not induce any detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the other members of JAKs, JAK1, or JAK3 (data not shown). In this study, we have shown that IL-15 induces IL-4 production from a mouse mast cell line, MC/9, and BMMCs. IL-4 mRNA expression is also induced by IL-15, suggesting that the induction is regulated at the transcriptional level. We have found that Tyk2 and STAT6, but not JAK1, -2, -3, STAT1, -3, -4, or -5, are rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-15 in MC/9 cells. STAT6 is also rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-15 in BMMCs. Additionally, the expression of a C-terminally truncated dominant negative form of STAT6 significantly suppressed the IL-4 mRNA up-regulation by IL-15, suggesting that STAT6 activation is essential for the IL-15-mediated IL-4 production. Although the exact molecular mechanisms for the tissue-specific expression of the IL-4 gene have not been clearly shown, IL-4 gene expression is primarily controlled by transcriptional factors binding to the 5′-regulatory regions of the IL-4 promoter (31Todd M.D. Grusby M.J. Lederer J.A. Lacy E. Lichtman A.H. Glimcher L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IL-4 gene expression during Th2 cell differentiation is at least partly because of c-maf and GATA-3, transcription factors expressed specifically in Th2 cells (30Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, other transcription factors, nuclear factor of activation in T cells (NF-AT), NF-AT interacting protein, and activator protein-1 have also been reported to be involved in the IL-4 gene activation (30Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). STAT6, first identified as a transducer of IL-4 receptor signaling, binds both the promoter and the silencer of the IL-4 gene (23Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Lederer J.A. Perez V.L. DesRoches L. Kim S.M. Abbas A.K. Lichtman A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 33Georas S.N. Cumberland J.E. Burke T.F. Chen R. Schindler U. Casolaro V. Blood. 1998; 92: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Huang H. Hu-Li J. Chen H. Ben-Sasson S.Z. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3731-3738PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is still not clear whether STAT6 directly regulates IL-4 gene transcription, the critical role of STAT6 in Th2 cell development was demonstrated by the targeted disruption of the STAT6 gene in mice. These mice were severely defective in generating the Th2 type immune responses (15Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Nature. 1996; 380: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 16Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that STAT6 may mediate the Th2-specific expression of IL-4 through an autocrine mechanism by binding and transactivating the IL-4 promoter in T lymphocytes (30Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Ho I.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that bystander cells responsible for early IL-4 production play an important role in the initiation of Th2 response of the early stage of immune response. Among these cells, mast cells may play an essential role, as they are widely distributed through vascularized tissues and are able to produce a large amount of IL-4 (27Plaut M. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Hanley-Hyde J. Nordan R.P. Paul W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Our current data suggest that IL-15, a cytokine produced by a wide variety of cell types including macrophage and epithelial cells in the early phase of infectious diseases (19Waldmann T.A. Tagaya Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), may play a part in the initiation of Th2 type immune responses by inducing IL-4 production from mast cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 by IL-15 and the suppression of IL-15-mediated IL-4 mRNA expression by a dominant negative form of STAT6 strongly suggest that STAT6 is essential in the process (Figs. 4and 5). Additionally, IL-15 induced the activation of IL-4 promoter, which contains three STAT-responsive elements (23Kubo M. Ransom J. Webb D. Hashimoto Y. Tada T. Nakayama T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4007-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Georas S.N. Cumberland J.E. Burke T.F. Chen R. Schindler U. Casolaro V. Blood. 1998; 92: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is not a cell line-specific phenomenon, because mouse BMMCs also showed increased IL-4 mRNA and STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-15 (Figs. 2 C and 4 D). In contrast to our present findings, it has been reported that BMMCs from STAT6−/− mice can express IL-4 comparable to those of wild-type mast cells, and mutation of the consensus STAT6 sites does not diminish IL-4 promoter activity (35Sherman M.A. Secor V.H. Lee S.K. Lopez R.D. Brown M.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this study, mast cells were stimulated by ionomycin, a strong inducer of IL-4 production from mast cells (27Plaut M. Pierce J.H. Watson C.J. Hanley-Hyde J. Nordan R.P. Paul W.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), and the IL-15-mediated IL-4 expression has never been explored. In T cells, it is still uncertain if the activated STAT6 directly induces IL-4 production. As multimers of STAT6-corresponding elements were inducible by IL-4 when linked to heterologous promoters and transfected into STAT6-expressing B-cell lines (32Lederer J.A. Perez V.L. DesRoches L. Kim S.M. Abbas A.K. Lichtman A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to conclude that STAT6 would directly enhance IL-4 transcription in T cells. However, a recent study using STAT6-deficient Jurkat T cells has suggested that although cotransfected STAT6 strongly enhanced transcription from the multimerized STAT6 response elements, the human IL-4 promoter was significantly repressed under similar conditions (33Georas S.N. Cumberland J.E. Burke T.F. Chen R. Schindler U. Casolaro V. Blood. 1998; 92: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that STAT6 might directly inhibit the IL-4 promoter function in some types of cells. In mast cells, mechanisms of IL-4 production have not been well understood but seem to be different from those in T cells. Another evidence for this hypothesis in addition to our present findings is a recent report that IL-4 production by mast cells does not require c-maf (36Sherman M.A. Nachman T.Y. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1733-1736PubMed Google Scholar). It is of note that a novel STAT6 isoform has been reported to be present in mast cells (37Sherman M.A. Secor V.H. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2703-2708PubMed Google Scholar). In the report, this STAT6 isoform is also tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-4, 65 kDa in size, and lacks reactivity with an anti-STAT6 antibody directed toward the C terminus, suggesting that it is a C-terminally truncated form. We sought to examine the existence of this short form of STAT6 in the MC/9 cell line we used. Although we utilized the same antibody used in the previous report, which was against the middle portion of STAT6, we could not detect a molecule around 65 kDa in MC/9 cells (data not shown). This is probably not because of the problem with our MC/9 cells, because the same antibody did not detect this short STAT6 isoform in mouse BMMCs (data not shown). Currently, we consider that the different antibody batches could cause the different Western blotting results. Because mast cells constitutively produce a small amount of IL-4 (38Yoshikawa H. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6162-6170PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-15 induces the IL-4 secretion (Fig. 3), STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation that we observed might not be directly regulated by IL-15 and may be because of the autocrine effect by IL-4. However, we consider this possibility unlikely by the following reasons. First, Tyk2 and STAT6 were very rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated as early as 15 min after stimulation with IL-15. Second, IL-4 depletion from the culture supernatant by a neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb did not affect the STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation by IL-15 (Fig. 4 E). In our study, we have demonstrated that exogenous IL-15 induces IL-4 mRNA synthesis, a phenomenon that has not been reported in T cells. Recently it has been reported that IL-15 uses a distinct receptor system in mast cells, which does not utilize IL-2 Rβ and is designated as IL-15 RX (22Tagaya Y. Burton J.D. Miyamoto Y. Waldmann T.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4928-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that the mast cell-specific downstream signals from IL-15RX may play a role in the induction of IL-4 expression. Our current findings suggest that the IL-15-mediated IL-4 production from mast cells may play an important part in some types of infectious diseases. For example, IL-15 is produced early in the intracellular parasite infections (39Doherty T.M. Seder R.A. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nishimura H. Hiromatsu K. Kobayashi N. Grabstein K.H. Paxton R. Sugamura K. Bluestone J.A. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 663-669PubMed Google Scholar). In a mouse model, it has been reported that IL-15·IgG2b fusion protein accelerates and enhances Th2 type response in vivo (41Ruckert R. Herz U. Paus R. Ungureanu D. Pohl T. Renz H. Bulfone-Paus S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This fusion protein seems to prolong its half-life in vivo and enhances IL-15 effects. This report is consistent with our current findings and suggests that at least in some cases IL-15 is responsible for the initiation of Th2 type immune responses. Also epithelial cells are known to produce an appreciable level of IL-15 following infection (42Hirose K. Suzuki H. Nishimura H. Mitani A. Washizu J. Matsuguchi T. Yoshikai Y. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5677-5683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sakai T. Kusugami K. Nishimura H. Ando T. Yamaguchi T. Ohsuga M. Ina K. Enomoto A. Kimura Y. Yoshikai Y. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1237-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that IL-15 produced locally stimulates mast cells to secret IL-4 and in turn serves to alert a host defense system to local infection. In conclusion, our present data have suggested that IL-15 may play a role in the initiation of Th2 type immune responses by inducing IL-4 production from mast cells through its unique receptor."

OSM has been implicated as a powerful proinflammatory mediator and may represent a potentially important, novel therapeutic opportunity for treatment of established rheumatoid arthritis. To further investigate the role of OSM in inflammatory disorders, we have isolated a series of RNA aptamers that bind specifically to human OSM. The highest affinity aptamer, designated ADR58, has been characterized in a series of in vitro and cell based assays. ADR58 has an affinity of 7 nm for human OSM, and it can antagonize OSM binding to the gp130 receptor and specifically antagonize OSM mediated signaling. The aptamer has been truncated in length to 33 bases, all pyrimidine positions are substituted with 2′ fluorine, and 14 of 18 purine positions have been substituted with 2′ O-methyl to increase stability toward nucleases. This truncated, modified form of ADR58 retains complete affinity and functional activity for OSM. This aptamer may be used as a tool to further investigate the role of OSM in inflammatory disorders and may also have role as a therapeutic agent.

A complex and poorly understood interplay between resident and infiltrating cell types leads to the chronic secretion of metalloproteinases, resulting in the destruction of articular cartilage, ligaments, and subchondral bone (1Firestein G.S. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1992; 4: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In recent years, considerable evidence has emerged that indicates that the cytokine OSM1 may be a powerful mediator of the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis. OSM (2Rose T.M. Bruce A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) is a 28-kDa glycoprotein that belongs to a family of cytokines comprising interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin 1 (3Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). The receptors for all family members share a common signaling chain, gp130, as part of a complex family of hetero- and homodimeric receptors (4Grotzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rosejohn S. Proteins. 1997; 27: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). OSM shares a common heterodimeric receptor with LIF (LIF receptor: gp130, type I) and also has its own unique receptor comprising OSM receptor β chain and gp130 type II (5Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). OSM has long been known to have effects on cell growth and differentiation (6Horn D. Fitzpatrick W.C. Gompper P.T. Ochs V. Bolton-Hansen M. Zarling J. Malik N. Todaro G.J. Linsley P.S. Growth Factors. 1990; 2: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). OSM has also been shown to have potent proinflammatory properties in mice (7Modur V. Feldhaus M.J. Weyrich A.S. Jicha D.L. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and demonstrates potent synergy with interleukin-1 to promote articular cartilage degradation in model systems ex vivo (8Cawston T.E. Ellis A.J. Humm G. Lean E. Ward D. Curry V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). OSM induces a prolonged increase in P-selectin in endothelial cells (9Yao L. Pan J. Setiadi H. Patel K.D. McEver R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), stimulates urokinase-type plasminogen activator activity in human synovial fibroblasts (10Hamilton J.A. Leizer T. Piccoli D.S. Royston K.M. Butler D.M. Croatto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Makino H. Ota Z. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mouse OSM has been shown to induce tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in mouse fibroblasts and will induce acute-phase protein production by rat hepatocytes in vitro (15Richards C.D. Kerr C. Tanaka M. Hara T. Miyajima A. Pennica D. Botelho F. Landgon C.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2431-2437PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that mouse OSM can induce both local and systemic effects in vivo. (16Kerr C. Langdon C. Graham F. Gauldie J. Hara T. Richards C.D. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Amelioration of arthritis in two murine models has been demonstrated using antibodies to OSM (17Plater Zyback C. Buckton J. Thompson S. Spaull J. Zanders E. Papworth J. Life P. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: S123Google Scholar). The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure is a protocol in which single stranded oligonucleotides are selected from vast libraries of sequences, based on a desired activity at a target protein or other molecule (18Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7888) Google Scholar, 19Green R. Ellington A.D. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 75-86Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev.

The SELEX procedure is usually initiated with an RNA or DNA library consisting of some 1014-1015 random oligonucleotide sequences. In a fully randomized oligonucleotide library, each molecule will exhibit a unique tertiary structure that will be dependent on the nucleotide sequence of that molecule. The binding affinity of the oligonucleotide for that protein will be determined by the fit between moieties on the surface of the oligonucleotide and epitopes on the target protein. As a consequence of starting from a library of vast diversity, it is often possible to identify aptamers of nanomolar or subnanomolar affinity for the target protein with selectivity for that target protein over other proteins with a high degree of structural homology (18Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7888) Google Scholar, 19Green R. Ellington A.D. Bartel D.P. Szostak J.W.

Using SELEX methodology, RNA or DNA aptamers have been generated to many proteins, peptides, and small molecules, including dopamine (22Mannironi C. Di Nardo A. Fruscoloni P. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9726-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), substance P (23Nieuwlandt D. Wecker M. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5651-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), subtilisin (24Takeno H. Yamamoto S. Tanaka T. Sakano Y. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), platelet derived growth factor (25Green L.S. Jellinek D. Jenison R. Ostman A. Heldin C-H. Janjic N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14413-14424Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor (26Green L.S. Jellinek D. Bell C. Bebe L.A. Feistner B.D. Gill S.C. Jucker F.M.

Nature. 1992; 355: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar), and l-selectin (28O'Connell D. Koenig A. Jennings S. Hicke B. Han H.L. Fitzwater T. Chang Y.F. Varki N. Parma D. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5883-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Aptamers have been demonstrated to have biological activity, bothin vitro and in vivo. For example, an RNA aptamer to the bacterial protease subtilisin was generated (24Takeno H. Yamamoto S. Tanaka T. Sakano Y. Kikuchi Y. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The aptamer was able to block the protease activity of subtilisin using a small chromogenic peptide and showed no inhibitory activity to trypsin or chymotrypsin. In a second example high affinity DNA aptamers have been raised against platelet-derived growth factor and used to investigate the role of platelet-derived growth factor in renal disease (29Floege J. Ostendorf T. Janssen U. Burg M. Radeke H.H. Vargeese C. Gill S.C. Green L.S. Janjic N. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The modified aptamer was evaluated in a rat mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis model. The aptamer lead to a 95% reduction in proliferating mesangial cells and a 78% reduction in glomerular mitosis. The investigation of the role of OSM in proinflammatory disorders has been hampered by the lack of selective antagonists. In view of the recent advances in SELEX methodology and numerous reports demonstrating the successful generation of aptamers against proteins, we decided to use the SELEX procedure to generate RNA aptamers to human OSM. We report the isolation of a series of RNA aptamers with high binding affinity for human OSM that act to antagonize the binding of OSM to the gp130 receptor in a number of in vitro and cell based assays. Human OSM with the 25-amino acid leader sequence removed was cloned using the polymerase chain reaction from a human activated leukocyte cDNA library. The open reading frame was further modified by removal of the C-terminal 33 amino acids of the protein, which are normally removed upon protein maturation (2Rose T.M. Bruce A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) Following these manipulations, human OSM was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein inEscherichia coli. Following purification, OSM was cleaved from glutathione S-transferase by treatment with thrombin, and OSM was further purified from the glutathioneS-transferase moiety. Iterative rounds of selection/amplification were performed as described (30Fitzwater T. Polisky B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) except that protein was bound to a 96-well plate for the partition phase of the SELEX process (36Drolet D.W. Jenison R. Smith D. Pratt D. Hicke B. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 1999; 2: 271-278PubMed Google Scholar). 2′-Fluoropyrimidine-modified RNA containing a randomized region of 40 nucleotides was prepared by in vitro transcription from synthetic random DNA templates. Template DNA (5′-gggaggacgaugcgg-40N-ccgcatcgtcctccc-3′), designated 40N7, was prepared on an automated solid-phase synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the SELEX experiment, human OSM at 3 μg/μl was diluted to the required concentration in SCHMK buffer (110 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl) and incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate (Labsystems) overnight at 4 °C to allow plate binding. The solution was removed from each well, and 200 μl of block buffer (0.1% I-block (Tropix) in SCHMK buffer) was added. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. RNA, diluted in 200 μl of wash buffer (0.1% I-block, 0.05% Tween 20 in SCHMK buffer), was added to individual wells at the concentrations shown in Table I. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, after which, individual wells were washed six times (200 μl each) with wash buffer at 37 °C to remove unbound RNA. To elute specifically bound RNA 50 μl of water was added to individual wells, and the plate was heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Reverse transcription was then carried out in individual wells, followed by polymerase chain reaction and transcription to generate RNA for the next round of SELEX as described previously (30Fitzwater T. Polisky B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Table IProtein/RNA ratios used during each round of the SELEX experimentRound of SELEXOSM coating concentrationRNA added per wellμg/100 μlpmol1310002350033500435005350060.640070.640080.1240090.12400100.06400110.06400120.06400 Open table in a new tab Binding assays were carried out by nitrocellulose filter partitioning as described (30Fitzwater T.

A. 1993; 90: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Aptamer DNA was cloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) in the plasmid pCR2.1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid clones were sequenced according to a polymerase chain reaction sequencing protocol (32Adams S.M. Blakesley R. Focus. 1991; 13: 56Google Scholar). Aptamers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 394 oligonucleotide synthesizer according to optimized protocols. Controlled pore glass functionalized with the appropriate protected ribonucleoside or with 3′ dimethoxytrityl-thymidine was purchased from Proligo Biochemie GmbH (Hamburg, Germany). Purine ribophosphoramidites, 2′-OMe purine ribonucleotide phosphoramidites, and 2′-F pyrimidine phosphoramidites were also purchased from Proligo. After deprotection using standard conditions for ribo-oligonucleotides, purification was achieved by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography using a Dionex DNAPacTM PA-100 column. The purified aptamers were characterized by negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Nunc immunoplates (F6 Maxisorp) were coated overnight (4 °C) with human OSM (50 μl/well, 1 μg/ml in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4). Plates were washed (six times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 0.05% Tween 20, using Skatron Plate washer), tapped dry, and blocked to reduce nonspecific binding (200 μl/well, 1% BSA/PBS). Following a 1-h incubation (room temperature on a shaking platform), the plates were tapped dry, and aptamer was added (50 μl/well, 0.34 nm-20 μm, titrated in SCHMK buffer). As positive controls, polyclonal anti-human OSM antibody and monoclonal anti-human gp130 (both from R&D Systems) were also tested. Following a 2-h incubation (room temperature on a shaking platform), a complex of gp130-Fc (300 ng/ml) and anti-human IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:500, Sigma) in 2% BSA/SCHMK buffer (50 μl/well) was added. Following a 5-h incubation (room temperature on a shaking platform), the plates were washed (six times) and developed using an ELISA amplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. On each plate, the total binding was determined by gp130-Fc conjugate and OSM in the presence of BSA/SCHMK, and nonspecific binding was determined by gp130-Fc conjugate in absence of OSM or conjugate binding to OSM in absence of gp130-Fc. The gp130 control ELISA was carried out as for the OSM-gp130 ELISA except that plates were coated with gp130 (50 μl/well, 200 ng/ml in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4). Nunc immunoplates (F6 Maxisorp) were coated overnight (4 °C) with sheep anti-human IgG (50 μl/well, 1 μg/ml in PBS). Plates were washed (six times in PBS 0.05% Tween 20, using Skatron plate washer), tapped dry, and blocked for 1 h (room temperature on a shaking platform) to reduce nonspecific binding (200 μl/well, 1% BSA in PBS). Plates were washed as above, and TNF receptor-IgG-Fc fusion protein was added (50 μl/well at 1:2 dilution, Glaxo Wellcome). Following a further 1-h incubation (room temperature on a shaking platform), the plates were washed as above, and aptamer was added (50 μl/well, 0.34 nm-20 μm, titrated in SCHMK buffer). As a positive control, an anti-TNF receptor 1 monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems) was included. Following a 2-h incubation (room temperature on a shaking platform), a complex of biotin-TNF-α (1 ng/ml, NEN Life Science Products) and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 2% BSA/SHMCK buffer (50 μl/well) was added. Following a 2-h incubation (room temperature on a shaking platform), the plates were washed (six times) and developed using ELISA amplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm. On each plate, the total binding was determined by TNF receptor 1 and biotin-TNF-α/conjugate in the presence of BSA/SCHMK buffer and nonspecific binding of biotin-TNF-α/conjugate in absence of the receptor or binding of the conjugate to the receptor in the absence of biotin-TNF-α. A HepG2 (HepG2B6) cell line stably transfected with a reporter gene containing six functional signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 response elements upstream of a secreted placental alkaline phosphatase reporter was previously generated at Glaxo Wellcome. 2M. Saunders, unpublished observations. HepG2B6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 500 μg/ml G418 (growth medium), at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 92% humidity. For assay, cells were plated into 96-well plates to a final concentration of 3 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of growth medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 48 h. Anti-OSM aptamer was serially diluted in 2 ng/ml OSM or 4 ng/ml IL-6 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Dilutions were made in HepG2 B6 medium with 1% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The old medium was removed from the wells and replaced with 100 μl/well of aptamer/OSM mixture, and cells were incubated for a further 20 h. Each dilution was performed in triplicate. 20 μl of medium was removed from each well and assayed for secreted placental alkaline phosphatase activity using p-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma) substrate (33McDonnell J. Latif M.L. Rees E.S. Bevan N.J. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Endogenous alkaline phosphatase was blocked withl-homoarginine. Absorbance was read at 405–650 nm. To test for selectivity, the experiment was repeated, diluting the aptamer in 4 ng/ml IL-6. The experiments were performed on three separate occasions. KB cells (ECACC NO 94050408) were plated into 96-well plates to a final concentration of 2 × 104 cells/well in 100 μl of medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin) and allowed to adhere overnight. Aptamers were preincubated with human OSM or LIF (R&D Systems, carrier-free) for 2 h at 37 °C in KB cell medium prior to addition to the cell monolayer. Following a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were harvested and stored at –20 °C for subsequent IL-6 measurement by ELISA (using antibody pairs from R&D Systems as described briefly below). Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with monoclonal anti-human IL-6 at 4 μg/ml, 50 μl in PBS. Following incubation overnight at 4 °C, the plates were washed six times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and blotted dry. All further incubations were carried out at room temperature on an agitated platform. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, 200 μl/well for 1 h. Plates were washed as before, 150 μl of 1% BSA in PBS was added to all wells with 50 μl of the tissue culture supernatants or standard IL-6 (31–8000 pg/ml; R&D Systems), and the plates were incubated for 2 h. The plates were washed, and biotinylated anti-human IL-6 was added at 25 ng/ml in 1% BSA in PBS (50 μl/well). Following a further 2-h incubation, the plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (50 μl/well, 1:1000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1% BSA in PBS. The plates were washed before developing with p-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma, Alk Phos fast kit) for 20 min. The absorbance was read at 405 nm. Human OSM with both the N-terminal 25-amino acid leader sequence and the C-terminal 33 amino acids removed was expressed and purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from E. coli. Following purification, the integrity of the expressed OSM was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). To demonstrate that purified human OSM retains biological activity, the ability of this protein to stimulate secreted placental alkaline phosphatase expression in HepG2B6 cells was examined. The purified protein was shown to be equipotent to recombinant human OSM purchased from R&D Systems in this assay (data not shown). In competition experiments performed in the same cell line using both anti-human OSM and anti-gp130 antibodies, increasing amounts of antibody progressively reduced human OSM stimulated secreted placental alkaline phosphatase production to baseline. 3J. Spaull, unpublished observations. To generate high affinity RNA ligands for human OSM, 12 iterative rounds of SELEX were performed using the conditions described in TableI. To ensure the isolation of high affinity aptamers, the stringency of the SELEX was increased in later rounds by reducing the amount of protein in the experiment (30Fitzwater T. Polisky B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of RNA pools for the starting protein was assessed after 7, 8, 10, and 12 rounds of SELEX. The fully randomized starting pool of RNA did not bind to human OSM at any concentration tested up to 1 μm. The apparent affinity dissociation constant (K d) of the round 7 RNA pool for human OSM was 72 nm; this was further decreased to 20 nm after 12 rounds of SELEX. The round 12 pool was cloned, and 50 individual aptamer clones were sequenced. The sequence from these clones was aligned using the Clustal software package of the GCG suite of molecular biology programs (Fig. 1). To characterize individual aptamers, RNA was made from representative clones of each sequence family by in vitro transcription and the binding affinity for OSM determined (Fig. 1). Within the major family of 16 sequences, the affinity for OSM varied from 6 nm for aptamer ADR152 to 228 nm for ADR157. ADR70 was tested as a representative of the second major family of 11 members. This bound to human OSM with an apparent K d of greater than 1 μm. ADR159 and 165 were tested as representatives of the fourth major family. Neither sequence bound to OSM at any concentration tested. The binding affinities of sequences ADR56, ADR63, and ADR117 were determined as representatives from the three minor sequence families. ADR63 bound to human OSM with high affinity (K d = 38 nm), and ADR117 bound with lower affinity (K d = 600 nm). ADR56 did not appear to bind human OSM at any concentration tested. To determine whether the high affinity aptamers generated in this study were capable of functionally antagonizing the activation of the OSM receptor on HepG2 cells, a reporter gene experiment was performed. The three high affinity binding aptamers ADR58, ADR120, and ADR152 dose-dependently blocked the ability of human OSM to activate the secreted placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene in HepG2 B6 cells with an IC50 of 100 nm (Fig.2). An oligonucleotide with low affinity for human OSM (ADR66) and an RNA of random sequence (ADR147), which had an affinity for OSM similar to random RNA, were used as controls. and neither showed activity. The highest affinity aptamer, ADR58, was selected for further characterization. An ELISA was performed to investigate the ability of ADR58 to prevent the binding of human OSM to the gp130 receptor. ADR58 blocked the binding of human OSM to the gp130 receptor in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent IC50 of 1 μm, whereas the nonspecific sequence ADR147 showed no activity in this assay (Fig.3 a). To determine that the activity of ADR58 in the ELISA was specifically due to the ability of the aptamer to prevent the binding of OSM to gp130, a control ELISA experiment was performed. In this experiment, the ability of the aptamer to prevent binding of the primary antibody to assay plates coated with the gp130 receptor was examined. As expected, ADR58 showed no activity in this assay (Fig. 3 b), indicating that the effects observed in the OSM/gp130 ELISA are specifically due to the binding of aptamer to human OSM. A number of experiments were performed to examine the specificity of aptamer ADR58 for human OSM over other homologous proteins. Human and mouse OSM are 42% identical at the protein level. Dissociation binding experiments were performed using human and murine OSM both purchased from R&D Systems. Although ADR58 bound to human OSM with an apparentK d of 7 nm, the aptamer did not bind to murine OSM at any concentration tested (Fig.4). In a second experiment, the binding of ADR58 to another proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, was examined by ELISA. ADR58 had no effect upon the binding of TNF-α to the TNF receptor 1 (Fig. 5). In a third experiment, the effect of ADR58 on LIF- and OSM-induced IL-6 release from KB cells was examined. KB cells are an oral epithelial cell line that releases IL-6 following stimulation with OSM or LIF. LIF is a member of the same gene family and is believed to be structurally related to OSM (47Kitchen D. Hoffman R.C. Moy F.J. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10581-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ADR58 and ADR147 both showed a slight potentiation of LIF-induced IL-6 release from KB cells, which was attributed to a nonspecific effect of RNA (Fig.6 a). ADR58 but not ADR147 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of OSM-induced IL-6 release from KB cells, with an apparent IC50 of 3 nm (Fig. 6 b). Finally, the ability of aptamer ADR58 to prevent IL-6 mediated activation of the signal transduction and activator of transcription-secreted placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene in HepG2 cells was tested. Although ADR58 was capable of dose-dependently inhibiting OSM-induced activation of the reporter gene, neither ADR58 nor the control RNA, ADR147, showed any inhibition of IL-6 mediated activation of the reporter gene (Fig.7).Figure 5Activity of aptamers in TNF -α-TNF receptor ELISA.

Subsequent modifications characteristic of the SL RNA cap 4 were added successively in a 5′ to 3′ direction and appeared to be independent of core ribonucleoprotein formation. Transcripts between 56 and 67 nucleotides in length were partially modified and carried methyl groups on the first two adenosine residues, whereas a fully modified cap 4 structure was present on transcripts arrested at position 117 and beyond. Taken together, our results are consistent with a cotranscriptional mechanism for generating the cap 4 structure on the SL RNA."

It is here that nascent secretory and membrane proteins are translocated across or integrated into the membrane. However, before moving to the final destination, these proteins have to be appropriately modified, folded, and assembled. Among the modifications affecting proteins targeted to the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells, N-linked glycosylation is often observed (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

In addition, N-linked glycosylation allows newly synthesized glycoproteins to interact with a lectin-based chaperone system in the ER, which plays a major role in protein folding and quality control (3Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 4Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct.

It has been shown in a cell-free translation system that oligosaccharide transfer only occurs when 12–14 amino acids C-terminal to a sequon have been translocated into the ER lumen (6Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the active site of the oligosaccharyltransferase and dolichol oligosaccharide donor, which are tethered to the luminal surface (7Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J.

Core glycosylation determines the number of individual oligosaccharides attached to a given polypeptide and involves the transfer of a presynthesized Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 unit from a membrane-associated donor, oligosaccharide-pyrophosphodolichol (9Pless D.D. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), to asparagine residues in the tripeptide acceptor sequon Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) (10Marshall R.D.

Although the sequon is essential for core glycosylation, it is observed that all potential glycosylation sites are not utilized (14Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), and some sequons are inefficiently glycosylated (15Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the amino acid present at the X position of the sequon may modulate the efficiency of core glycosylation (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of disulfide bond formation may increase the level of modification of a naturally occurring glycosylation sequon, suggesting that there may be a link between folding and utilization of glycosylation sequons in vivo (17Capellari S.

In a study using carboxypeptidase Y in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, the introduction of new sites for N-glycosylation at positions buried in a folded protein structure did not necessarily lead to glycosylation of these sites, indicating that folding and glycosylation can compete in vivo and that glycosylation does not necessarily precede folding (19Holst B. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).The maturation of viral proteins in infected cells involves mostly the host cell metabolic pathway, including localization mechanisms, folding proteins, and enzymes that modify the primary translation product. For this reason, viral envelope proteins have often been used as tools for cell biology studies. In this work, we used hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E1 as a model to study N-glycosylation in a cell culture system. The HCV genome encodes two envelope proteins, E1 and E2, which form a noncovalent heterodimer (20Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). These two envelope proteins are released from HCV polyprotein precursor after cleavage by host signal peptidase(s) (21Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Stud. Hematol. Blood Transf. 1998; 62: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They are transmembrane proteins with a large N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal hydrophobic anchor, and they are heavily modified by N-linked glycosylation (20Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). E1 has been shown to be glycosylated at positions 196, 209, 234, and 305 (positions on the polyprotein) (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we show that E1 was not efficiently glycosylated when expressed alone. However, glycosylation of E1 was improved when expressed as a polyprotein with the full-length or a truncated form of E2, indicating that glycosylation of E1 is dependent on the presence of polypeptide sequences located downstream of E1 on HCV polyprotein.DISCUSSIONThe modification of Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequences with oligosaccharides is one of the ubiquitous features of the eukaryotic secretory pathway. The number and position of oligosaccharides added to a protein by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase can influence its expression and function. However, it remains poorly understood why some sequons are glycosylated to a variable extent. Here, we report that a sequence located far downstream of the glycosylation sites of HCV envelope protein E1 modulates the efficiency of glycosylation of these sites.HCV envelope protein E1 is not efficiently glycosylated when expressed in the absence of E2. Indeed, approximately 50% of E1 was partially glycosylated when expressed in HepG2 cells by a vaccinia virus recombinant. Residues like Trp, Leu, Asp, and Glu at position X have been shown to be associated with less efficient core glycosylation in a cell-free system (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, large hydrophobic amino acids may inhibit core glycosylation by producing an unfavorable local conformation, and the charge of the X residue may influence the ability of oligosaccharyltransferase to bind simultaneously to the sequon and the negatively charged dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide precursor (13Imperiali B. Shannon K.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4374-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Bause E. Hettkamp H. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A Ser (N1 and N2), an Ala (N3), and a Cys (N4) occupy the X positions in the sequence of the E1 protein used in our study (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and these residues are usually associated with highly efficient core glycosylation. However, the Cys residue is uncommon at the X position in core-glycosylated sequons (36Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This probably reflects the potential of the Cys residues to participate in disulfide bonding (37Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Bause E. Hettkamp H. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, one hypothesis to explain the lower efficiency of E1 glycosylation at site 4 is that in the absence of E2, the Cys residue might be partially reactive to form disulfide bonds. More recently, it has been shown that the residue in position Y can also influence the efficiency of glycosylation in the sequon Asn-X-Ser-Y (39Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the presence of an Ile at position Y as seen at site 4, is not the most favorable residue for maximum efficiency of glycosylation. This might also explain why in vitro core glycosylation is partial at site 4 (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Core glycosylation can also be influenced by the position of the sequon in a protein (6Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 40Livi G.P. Lillquist J.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15348-15355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the location of site 1 of E1, five residues from the N terminus, is not favorable for glycosylation. However, when the efficiency of glycosylation of this site was studied in a cell-free system, it was fully glycosylated (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors probably involving folding (18Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Holst B. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R.

J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) might play a role in modulating the efficiency of its glycosylation.Our data indicate that glycosylation of E1 is improved when expressed as a polyprotein including full-length or truncated forms of E2, indicating that glycosylation of E1 is dependent on the presence of a polypeptide located downstream of E1 on HCV polyprotein. How can such a sequence, which is rapidly cleaved from the polyprotein by signal peptidase, improve the efficiency of glycosylation of E1? Recently, it has been shown that some mutations of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) lead to a reduced interaction with the ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 and inefficient N-glycosylation, suggesting that glycosylation can be individually regulated by an interaction with ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (41Schroder K. Martoglio B. Hofmann M. Holscher C. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4804-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism might be specific for Ii. In this model, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 is proposed to mediate a translocational pause by interacting with a sequence of Ii immediately downstream of the two glycosylation sites. In the case of E1, the sequence responsible for improvement of glycosylation is located 188 and 79 residues downstream from sites N1 and N4, respectively. In addition, there seems to be no specificity in the sequence involved in assisting glycosylation. A study using rabies virus glycoprotein as a model has shown that core glycosylation can be influenced by the presence or absence of regions more than 68 amino acids C-terminal to a specific glycosylation site (42Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with recent data showing that, in the absence of a stop transfer sequence between the glycosylation acceptor sequon and the C terminus, the efficiency of glycosylation increases as the stop codon is moved further away from the sequon and plateaus at a distance of ∼60 residues or more (43Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These data suggest that glycosylation is inefficient when chain termination happens before the acceptor site reaches the oligosaccharyltransferase active site. Indeed, in a nascent polypeptide, the distance between the ribosomal peptidyl transferase site, and the oligosaccharyltransferase active site has been estimated to be ∼65 residues (44Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the case of E1 expressed alone, the N4 site is located 79 residues from the stop codon, which had been introduced at the C terminus of E1. However, the stop transfer sequence of E1 was not deleted and the N1 site, which is also less efficiently glycosylated is located 188 residues from the C terminus of E1. An alternative explanation of E2-dependent glycosylation of E1 is that the folding of this protein might be different depending on whether it is expressed alone or coexpressed with E2, and the folding of E1 expressed alone might compete with its glycosylation. In vitro studies have shown that the acceptor peptide probably has to adopt a specific conformation, the Asn-X turn, to become glycosylated (45Imperiali B. Shannon K.L. Rickert K.W. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7042-7044Google Scholar). Formation of an alternative secondary structure forced by a change in the folding pathway could disrupt such a conformation. We have previously reported that E2 plays a role in the assisted folding of E1, and this might be a way for E2 to improve the efficiency of glycosylation of E1 (27Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we show in this work that E2-dependent glycosylation of E1 and assisted-folding are not linked together. Alternatively, the presence of E2 downstream of E1 on the polyprotein might impose a conformation to E1 which is more favorable for N-glycosylation. This conformation would be transient and only observed before cleavage, and such a transient conformation would not be observed in the absence of a sequence downstream of E1. Pulse-chase experiments suggest that E1E2 polyprotein is not completely cleaved during the pulse (Fig.4 b). This slight delay in E1E2 cleavage might be necessary for E2-dependent glycosylation of E1. We have recently observed a conformational modification in the transmembrane domain of E1 after cleavage between E1 and E2. 2L. Cocquerel and J. Dubuisson, unpublished data. Such a conformational change might have some impact on the folding of the ectodomain of E1 and potentially on its glycosylation.Because the glycosylation of a protein can influence its expression and function, it is important to understand why some proteins are only partially glycosylated. It has been shown that the type of amino acid present at the X position of the sequon can modulate the efficiency of core glycosylation in vitro (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and in some instances, folding has been shown to compete with glycosylation (17Capellari S. Zaidi S.I. Urig C.B. Perry G. Smith M.A. Petersen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34846-34850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Control of glycosylation as described for E1 has never been reported before and it is likely because of the constraints imposed by the way HCV expresses its proteins. Whether it is unique to HCV envelope proteins or it applies to other glycoproteins synthesized as polyprotein precursors remains to be shown. Proteins that are transported and sorted by the secretory pathway begin their journey at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane. It is here that nascent secretory and membrane proteins are translocated across or integrated into the membrane. However, before moving to the final destination, these proteins have to be appropriately modified, folded, and assembled.

In addition, N-linked glycosylation allows newly synthesized glycoproteins to interact with a lectin-based chaperone system in the ER, which plays a major role in protein folding and quality control (3Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 4Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The addition of N-linked oligosaccharides is catalyzed by the oligosaccharyltransferase, an enzyme closely associated with the translocon and generally thought to have access only to nascent chains as they emerge from the ribosome (5Silberstein S. Gilmore R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It has been shown in a cell-free translation system that oligosaccharide transfer only occurs when 12–14 amino acids C-terminal to a sequon have been translocated into the ER lumen (6Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the active site of the oligosaccharyltransferase and dolichol oligosaccharide donor, which are tethered to the luminal surface (7Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) are projected 30–40 Å into the ER lumen (6Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Core glycosylation determines the number of individual oligosaccharides attached to a given polypeptide and involves the transfer of a presynthesized Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 unit from a membrane-associated donor, oligosaccharide-pyrophosphodolichol (9Pless D.D. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), to asparagine residues in the tripeptide acceptor sequon Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) (10Marshall R.D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1974; 40: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar), where X is any amino acid except Pro (11Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 12Lehle L. Bause E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 799: 246-251Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Imperiali B. Shannon K.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4374-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the sequon is essential for core glycosylation, it is observed that all potential glycosylation sites are not utilized (14Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), and some sequons are inefficiently glycosylated (15Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10690-10698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the amino acid present at the X position of the sequon may modulate the efficiency of core glycosylation (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of disulfide bond formation may increase the level of modification of a naturally occurring glycosylation sequon, suggesting that there may be a link between folding and utilization of glycosylation sequons in vivo (17Capellari S. Zaidi S.I. Urig C.B. Perry G. Smith M.A. Petersen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34846-34850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In a study using carboxypeptidase Y in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, the introduction of new sites for N-glycosylation at positions buried in a folded protein structure did not necessarily lead to glycosylation of these sites, indicating that folding and glycosylation can compete in vivo and that glycosylation does not necessarily precede folding (19Holst B. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The maturation of viral proteins in infected cells involves mostly the host cell metabolic pathway, including localization mechanisms, folding proteins, and enzymes that modify the primary translation product. For this reason, viral envelope proteins have often been used as tools for cell biology studies. In this work, we used hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E1 as a model to study N-glycosylation in a cell culture system. The HCV genome encodes two envelope proteins, E1 and E2, which form a noncovalent heterodimer (20Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). These two envelope proteins are released from HCV polyprotein precursor after cleavage by host signal peptidase(s) (21Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Stud. Hematol. Blood Transf. 1998; 62: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They are transmembrane proteins with a large N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal hydrophobic anchor, and they are heavily modified by N-linked glycosylation (20Dubuisson J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). E1 has been shown to be glycosylated at positions 196, 209, 234, and 305 (positions on the polyprotein) (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we show that E1 was not efficiently glycosylated when expressed alone. However, glycosylation of E1 was improved when expressed as a polyprotein with the full-length or a truncated form of E2, indicating that glycosylation of E1 is dependent on the presence of polypeptide sequences located downstream of E1 on HCV polyprotein. DISCUSSIONThe modification of Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequences with oligosaccharides is one of the ubiquitous features of the eukaryotic secretory pathway. The number and position of oligosaccharides added to a protein by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase can influence its expression and function. However, it remains poorly understood why some sequons are glycosylated to a variable extent. Here, we report that a sequence located far downstream of the glycosylation sites of HCV envelope protein E1 modulates the efficiency of glycosylation of these sites.HCV envelope protein E1 is not efficiently glycosylated when expressed in the absence of E2. Indeed, approximately 50% of E1 was partially glycosylated when expressed in HepG2 cells by a vaccinia virus recombinant. Residues like Trp, Leu, Asp, and Glu at position X have been shown to be associated with less efficient core glycosylation in a cell-free system (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, large hydrophobic amino acids may inhibit core glycosylation by producing an unfavorable local conformation, and the charge of the X residue may influence the ability of oligosaccharyltransferase to bind simultaneously to the sequon and the negatively charged dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide precursor (13Imperiali B. Shannon K.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4374-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Bause E. Hettkamp H. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A Ser (N1 and N2), an Ala (N3), and a Cys (N4) occupy the X positions in the sequence of the E1 protein used in our study (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and these residues are usually associated with highly efficient core glycosylation. However, the Cys residue is uncommon at the X position in core-glycosylated sequons (36Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This probably reflects the potential of the Cys residues to participate in disulfide bonding (37Bulleid N.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Freedman R.B. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Bause E. Hettkamp H. Legler G. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, one hypothesis to explain the lower efficiency of E1 glycosylation at site 4 is that in the absence of E2, the Cys residue might be partially reactive to form disulfide bonds. More recently, it has been shown that the residue in position Y can also influence the efficiency of glycosylation in the sequon Asn-X-Ser-Y (39Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the presence of an Ile at position Y as seen at site 4, is not the most favorable residue for maximum efficiency of glycosylation. This might also explain why in vitro core glycosylation is partial at site 4 (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Core glycosylation can also be influenced by the position of the sequon in a protein (6Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 40Livi G.P. Lillquist J.S. Miles L.M. Ferrara A. Sathe G.M. Simon P.L. Meyers C.A. Gorman J.A. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15348-15355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the location of site 1 of E1, five residues from the N terminus, is not favorable for glycosylation. However, when the efficiency of glycosylation of this site was studied in a cell-free system, it was fully glycosylated (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that other factors probably involving folding (18Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Holst B. Bruun A.W. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R.

J. 1992; 286: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) might play a role in modulating the efficiency of its glycosylation.Our data indicate that glycosylation of E1 is improved when expressed as a polyprotein including full-length or truncated forms of E2, indicating that glycosylation of E1 is dependent on the presence of a polypeptide located downstream of E1 on HCV polyprotein. How can such a sequence, which is rapidly cleaved from the polyprotein by signal peptidase, improve the efficiency of glycosylation of E1? Recently, it has been shown that some mutations of the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) lead to a reduced interaction with the ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 and inefficient N-glycosylation, suggesting that glycosylation can be individually regulated by an interaction with ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (41Schroder K. Martoglio B. Hofmann M. Holscher C. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4804-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism might be specific for Ii. In this model, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 is proposed to mediate a translocational pause by interacting with a sequence of Ii immediately downstream of the two glycosylation sites. In the case of E1, the sequence responsible for improvement of glycosylation is located 188 and 79 residues downstream from sites N1 and N4, respectively. In addition, there seems to be no specificity in the sequence involved in assisting glycosylation. A study using rabies virus glycoprotein as a model has shown that core glycosylation can be influenced by the presence or absence of regions more than 68 amino acids C-terminal to a specific glycosylation site (42Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9465-9472Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with recent data showing that, in the absence of a stop transfer sequence between the glycosylation acceptor sequon and the C terminus, the efficiency of glycosylation increases as the stop codon is moved further away from the sequon and plateaus at a distance of ∼60 residues or more (43Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17338-17343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These data suggest that glycosylation is inefficient when chain termination happens before the acceptor site reaches the oligosaccharyltransferase active site. Indeed, in a nascent polypeptide, the distance between the ribosomal peptidyl transferase site, and the oligosaccharyltransferase active site has been estimated to be ∼65 residues (44Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the case of E1 expressed alone, the N4 site is located 79 residues from the stop codon, which had been introduced at the C terminus of E1. However, the stop transfer sequence of E1 was not deleted and the N1 site, which is also less efficiently glycosylated is located 188 residues from the C terminus of E1. An alternative explanation of E2-dependent glycosylation of E1 is that the folding of this protein might be different depending on whether it is expressed alone or coexpressed with E2, and the folding of E1 expressed alone might compete with its glycosylation. In vitro studies have shown that the acceptor peptide probably has to adopt a specific conformation, the Asn-X turn, to become glycosylated (45Imperiali B. Shannon K.L. Rickert K.W. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7042-7044Google Scholar). Formation of an alternative secondary structure forced by a change in the folding pathway could disrupt such a conformation. We have previously reported that E2 plays a role in the assisted folding of E1, and this might be a way for E2 to improve the efficiency of glycosylation of E1 (27Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we show in this work that E2-dependent glycosylation of E1 and assisted-folding are not linked together. Alternatively, the presence of E2 downstream of E1 on the polyprotein might impose a conformation to E1 which is more favorable for N-glycosylation. This conformation would be transient and only observed before cleavage, and such a transient conformation would not be observed in the absence of a sequence downstream of E1. Pulse-chase experiments suggest that E1E2 polyprotein is not completely cleaved during the pulse (Fig.4 b). This slight delay in E1E2 cleavage might be necessary for E2-dependent glycosylation of E1. We have recently observed a conformational modification in the transmembrane domain of E1 after cleavage between E1 and E2. 2L. Cocquerel and J. Dubuisson, unpublished data. Such a conformational change might have some impact on the folding of the ectodomain of E1 and potentially on its glycosylation.Because the glycosylation of a protein can influence its expression and function, it is important to understand why some proteins are only partially glycosylated. It has been shown that the type of amino acid present at the X position of the sequon can modulate the efficiency of core glycosylation in vitro (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and in some instances, folding has been shown to compete with glycosylation (17Capellari S. Zaidi S.I. Urig C.B. Perry G. Smith M.A. Petersen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34846-34850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3538-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Control of glycosylation as described for E1 has never been reported before and it is likely because of the constraints imposed by the way HCV expresses its proteins. Whether it is unique to HCV envelope proteins or it applies to other glycoproteins synthesized as polyprotein precursors remains to be shown. The modification of Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequences with oligosaccharides is one of the ubiquitous features of the eukaryotic secretory pathway. The number and position of oligosaccharides added to a protein by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase can influence its expression and function. However, it remains poorly understood why some sequons are glycosylated to a variable extent.

A Ser (N1 and N2), an Ala (N3), and a Cys (N4) occupy the X positions in the sequence of the E1 protein used in our study (22Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and these residues are usually associated with highly efficient core glycosylation. However, the Cys residue is uncommon at the X position in core-glycosylated sequons (36Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys.

It has been shown that the type of amino acid present at the X position of the sequon can modulate the efficiency of core glycosylation in vitro (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J.

Control of glycosylation as described for E1 has never been reported before and it is likely because of the constraints imposed by the way HCV expresses its proteins. Whether it is unique to HCV envelope proteins or it applies to other glycoproteins synthesized as polyprotein precursors remains to be shown.

According to current theories, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A) is responsible for the former and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B) for the latter reaction. CYP7A is believed to have a very high substrate specificity whereas CYP7B is active toward oxysterols, dehydroepiandrosterone, and pregnenolone. In the present study, 7α-hydroxylation of various oxysterols in liver and kidney was investigated. Surprisingly, human cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, CYP7A, expressed as a recombinant in Escherichia coli and COS cells, was active toward 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol. This enzyme has previously been thought to be specific for cholesterol and cholestanol. A partially purified and reconstituted cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme fraction from pig liver showed 7α-hydroxylase activity toward the same oxysterols as metabolized by expressed recombinant human and rat CYP7A. The 7α-hydroxylase activity toward 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol in rat liver was significantly increased by treatment with cholestyramine, an inducer of CYP7A. From the present results it may be concluded that CYP7A is able to function as an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, in addition to the previously known human oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, CYP7B.

Primary bile acids are formed from cholesterol in the liver, either through the “neutral pathway” or the “acidic pathway,” involving several cytochrome P450 enzymes. The first and rate-limiting reaction in the neutral pathway is a 7α-hydroxylation by the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A),1 an enzyme believed to be specific for cholesterol and cholestanol (10Ogishima T.

Binding of ligand to the LXR induces transcription of CYP7A, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis.

Although 20(S)- and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol affect genes that are expressed in the liver, very little information is available on a possible hepatic metabolism of these oxysterols.

Thus, CYP7A has the ability to function as an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase, in addition to the previously known oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase(s) such as CYP7B (16Norlin M. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys.

A role for CYP7A as an oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase in vivo is supported by the finding that a cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase fraction from pig liver is active toward all oxysterols metabolized by the expressed recombinant CYP7A. The inhibition experiments with 7-oxocholesterol also support the contention that CYP7A catalyzes the 7α-hydroxylation of 27-hydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, the experiments with cholestyramine-treated rats support a physiological role for CYP7A in the 7α-hydroxylation of 20(S)-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol. As expected, the data on 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol suggest that CYP7A is not the sole enzyme responsible for the 7α-hydroxylation of these oxysterols, which is consistent with the concept that CYP7B is important in these reactions (18Stapleton G.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2195-2203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the experiments with dehydroepiandrosterone, it may be concluded that CYP7B is not induced by cholestyramine treatment. The finding that 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol is 7α-hydroxylated in experiments with porcine but not human enzyme may reflect species differences with respect to the 7α-hydroxylation of oxysterols. The present experiments do not exclude that a yet unknown cytochrome P450 may catalyze 7α-hydroxylation of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol in pig liver.CYP7A is considered to be expressed only in the liver whereas CYP7B mRNA has been detected in extrahepatic tissues, including kidney (21Wu Z. Martin K.O. Javitt N.B. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2195-2203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that pig kidney cytochrome P450 and human kidney cells do not 7α-hydroxylate cholesterol, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, or 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol. These results support the conclusion that CYP7B is not responsible for 7α-hydroxylation of these steroids.The results of this investigation may have implications for oxysterol-mediated regulation of gene expression as well as for pathways of bile acid biosynthesis. Furthermore the results provide new insight into the substrate specificity of 7α-hydroxylating cytochrome P450 enzymes in liver and kidney.LXR and 7α-Hydroxylation of OxysterolsThe oxysterols 7α-hydroxylated by CYP7A (20(S)-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol) are reported to be ligands for the LXR receptor (5Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 6Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A. Corey E.J. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Thus, some of the ligands of the liver X receptor, a nuclear receptor that induces expression of CYP7A in rodents, are metabolized by the very enzyme they induce. To our knowledge there is no information on what effects the 7α-hydroxylated derivatives of 20(S)- or 27-hydroxycholesterol may have on the LXR. However, Janowski et al. (5Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar) reported that 25-hydroxycholesterol is a several-fold more potent ligand for LXRα than 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol. It may be speculated that 7α-hydroxylation of LXR ligands could reflect a way of controlling the level of expression of CYP7A by means of a feed-back mechanism.7α-Hydroxylating Enzymes in Bile Acid BiosynthesisThe surprising finding that 27-hydroxycholesterol is a substrate for cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase have yet unclear implications for our understanding of the biosynthesis of bile acids. The data do not contradict the concept of two 7α-hydroxylases acting in the neutral and acidic pathways of bile acid biosynthesis. However, the results show that CYP7A has the ability to participate in both pathways. The results of the cholestyramine induction experiments indicate that CYP7A may have a regulatory function also in the acidic pathway. Our findings in rats are consistent with the data obtained by Martin et al. (14Martin K.O. Budai K. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in hamsters. These authors reported that cholestyramine treatment of animals maintained on a cholesterol-free diet resulted in a similar increase in hepatic 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol as compared with untreated litter mates (14Martin K.O. Budai K. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quantitative contributions by CYP7A and CYP7B for 27-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylation in vivo remain to be investigated. Possible species differences cannot be excluded.The catalytic activity of recombinant CYP7A toward 27-hydroxycholesterol is high and the K m for 27-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylation by CYP7A is the same as for cholesterol. A physiologically significant role for CYP7A in 27-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylation is supported by the results obtained with COS cells. In these experiments, 27-hydroxycholesterol was efficiently 7α-hydroxylated by living transfected cells at physiological concentrations of substrate (37Babiker A. Andersson O.

Kok E. Burstein S. Cohen B. Kutscher J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12644-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is notable that presence of 27-hydroxycholesterol substantially decreased the 7α-hydroxylase activity of these cells toward cholesterol.The present results showing that CYP7A is able to 7α-hydroxylate 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol appear to be in contrast to some previous studies (14Martin K.O.

Biochem. 1994; 224: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reported that recombinant human CYP7A, expressed in COS cells, did not show any significant 7α-hydroxylase activity toward 25-hydroxycholesterol. In those experiments, COS cell homogenate was incubated with 25-hydroxycholesterol for 60 min, 48 h after transfection. This means that the enzyme was exposed to 25-hydroxycholesterol for only 60 min whereas the incubation time for endogenous cholesterol was 49 h. However, in the present experiments the oxysterols were added to the cell medium immediately after transfection. Thus, the incubation time for oxysterols and cholesterol was the same. It is noteworthy that a large part of the formed 7α-hydroxycholesterol was retained within the cells, whereas almost all of the more polar 7α-hydroxylated derivatives formed from oxysterols were excreted into the medium. Martin et al. (14Martin K.O. Budai K. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol is performed by different enzymes in hamster liver.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) do not exclude overlapping substrate specificity of these enzymes.It is possible that CYP7A and CYP7B have different roles in bile acid biosynthesis during different periods of life. Setchell and collaborators (42Setchell K.D. Schwarz M. O'Connell N.C. Lund E.G. Davis D.L. Lathe R. Thompson H.R. Weslie Tyson R. Sokol R.J. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1690-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) described a newborn child with severe neonatal cholestasis with a mutation in the CYP7B gene. The authors concluded that CYP7B is critical for bile acid biosynthesis in infants. Although this patient had a normal CYP7A gene, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity was not detectable in the liver samples. Interestingly, control samples from the livers of normal infants (<1 year of age) also lacked detectable cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity.Substrate Specificity of CYP7A and CYP7BWhereas the presence of an accessible hydrophilic group on the steroid side chain seems to be obligatory for catalysis by CYP7B, this enzyme apparently does not distinguish between C27- and C19/C21-steroids. CYP7A on the other hand, although effectively 7α-hydroxylating several C27-steroids, shows very low, if any, 7α-hydroxylase activity toward dehydroepiandrosterone or pregnenolone. In contrast to CYP7B, the presence of a hydroxyl group on the side chain reduces the catalytic activity of CYP7A. Information on the substrate specificity of CYP7A and CYP7B may be of interest for studies of the structure-function relationship of steroid-metabolizing enzymes.From the present data it may be concluded that 27-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylation is not specific for CYP7B. Studies on CYP7B should include assays of 7α-hydroxylase activity toward dehydroepiandrosterone to distinguish between the contributions of CYP7A and CYP7B toward the reaction.The finding that 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol is a good substrate for CYP7A opens the possibility that 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol could be used as a specific marker in studies of this enzyme. Because of the presence of endogenous cholesterol in microsomes and cell cultures, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylation is sometimes difficult to measure. The activity toward 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol is high and can be measured in a simple and inexpensive way. Oxysterols are important degradation products of cholesterol and are intermediates in biosynthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids. These compounds have a broad spectrum of biological effects including modulation of the activity of enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (1Schroepfer G.J. Physiol.

Primary bile acids are formed from cholesterol in the liver, either through the “neutral pathway” or the “acidic pathway,” involving several cytochrome P450 enzymes. The first and rate-limiting reaction in the neutral pathway is a 7α-hydroxylation by the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A),1 an enzyme believed to be specific for cholesterol and cholestanol (10Ogishima T.

Employing a differential screening strategy, we identified a taste receptor gene, Tre1, that controls the taste sensitivity to trehalose in Drosophila melanogaster. The Tre1 gene encodes a novel protein with similarity to G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors. Disruption of the Tre1 gene lowered the taste sensitivity to trehalose, whereas sensitivities to other sugars were unaltered. Overexpression of the Tre1 gene restored the taste sensitivity to trehalose in the Tre1 deletion mutant. The Tre1 gene is expressed in taste sensory cells. These results provide direct evidence that Tre1 encodes a putative taste receptor for trehalose in Drosophila."

Cys of N2C subunit b was cross-linked with Cys at positions 74, 75, and 78 of subunit c. In each case, a maximum of 50% of the b subunit could be cross-linked to subunit c, which suggests that either only one of the twob subunits lie adjacent to the c-ring or that both b subunits interact with a single subunitc. The results support a topological arrangement of these subunits, in which the respective N- and C-terminal ends of subunitsb and c extend to the periplasmic surface of the membrane and cAsp-61 lies at the center of the membrane. The cross-linking of Cys between bN2C andcV78C was shown to inhibit ATP-driven proton pumping, as would be predicted from a rotary model for ATP synthase function, but unexpectedly, cross-linking did not lead to inhibition of ATPase activity. ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping are therefore uncoupled in the cross-linked enzyme. The c subunit lying adjacent to subunit b was shown to be mobile and to exchange withc subunits that initially occupied non-neighboring positions. The movement or exchange of subunits at the position adjacent to subunit b was blocked by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.

Cross-linking and modeling experiments do indicate that helix-1 of subunit c should be packed on the inside of the ring and helix-2 on the outside (19Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

The placement of helix-2 at the periphery of the cylinder is consistent with the cross-linking of this helix, but not helix-1, toaTMH-4 (20Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous electron microscopic studies also indicate that subunit a, as well as subunit b,should lie at the periphery of the ring (16Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F.

The elongated, polar, and largely helical C-terminal domain is thought to be anchored to the lipid bilayer by a single N-terminal α-helix, which should extend to the periplasmic surface of the bacterial inner membrane (47Walker J.E.

Chem. Int. Ed. 1998; 37: 2308-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The positioning of the TMHs of the twob subunits relative to the c-oligomeric ring has yet to be determined. As shown here, at least one of the TMHs must be spatially proximal to the ring, as a Cys sulfhydryl substituted into the N-terminal segment is efficiently cross-linked to Cys in the C-terminal region of subunit c. We also report experiments, using subunit b-c cross-link formation, that support the idea of subunit c movement relative to a subunitb stator, as is predicted from rotary models for ATP synthase function.DISCUSSIONThe cross-linking of Cys at position 2 of subunit bwith Cys at positions 74, 75, and 78 of subunit c supports the previously assumed topological arrangement of these subunits, in which the N-terminal end of subunits b and the C-terminal end of subunit c extend to the periplasmic surface of the membrane (Fig. 7). Lötscheret al. (69Lötscher R.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4128-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) had previously demonstrated cross-linking of the α-carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue of subunit c,i.e. Ala-79, with the amino group of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine in a reaction catalyzed by the water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-carbodiimide. According to the measurements of Wiener and White (70Wiener M.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 434-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), the ethanolamine moiety of the phospholipid should lie 20–25 Å from the center of the membrane. The Ala-79 α-carboxyl lies 29 Å from the Asp-61 side chain carboxyl in the NMR model (23Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which would place the Asp-61 carboxyl group in the fatty acyl region of the cytoplasmic leaflet near the center of the lipid bilayer. The cross-linking of Cys from positions 74 and 75 of subunit c with Cys-2 of subunitb suggests that a more substantial region of the C-terminal segment of subunit c may pack in the periplasmic, polar head group region of the membrane. The positioning of Asp-61 toward the center of the membrane differs from the suggested placement for the Na+ binding carboxyl group of the Propionigenium modestum subunit c at the cytoplasmic surface (36Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and would lead us to predict the necessity of H+ access channels from both sides of the membrane. In a study reporting the NMR structure of the N-terminal region of subunit b, together with an analysis of b-b dimer formation with Cys-substituted subunits, the TMHs of subunit b were proposed to associate at a preferred 20° packing angle to cross the membrane as a dimer. The cross-linking results shown here indicate that only one of the two subunit b can dimerize with subunit c and suggest that the second b TMH may lie more to the periphery of the complex, perhaps in association with subunit a, or that a single subunit c interacts simultaneously with both of theb subunit transmembrane domains.The cross-linking of subunit bN2C with subunitcV78C can be causally related to inhibition of ATPase-coupled proton pumping. Such inhibition is expected in the rotary model. A small amount of cV78C-cV78C cross-linked product was observed in these experiments, but by use of appropriate controls, the major effects on proton pumping could clearly be attributed to b-c cross-link formation. Unexpectedly,b-c cross-link formation did not result in substantial inhibition of ATPase activity, which suggests an uncoupling of ATPase function and proton-translocating function. ThebN2C/cV78C mutant F0F1 is unusual in that the membrane ATPase activity, in its reduced state, was markedly inhibited relative to the lauryldimethylamine oxide activated state. The combined effect of the double Cys substitutions at the periplasmic side of the membrane, and their cross-linking, clearly perturb the interaction of F1 with F0 at the other side of the membrane.DCCD-inhibitable movement of subunit c relative to the subunit b stator was demonstrated in the experiment described schematically in Fig. 6 A. FollowingbN2C/cV78C disulfide bond formation and NEM modification of the remaining free sulfhydryl groups, the disulfide bond was reduced, and the c-oligomer was allowed to reposition itself relative to the b-stator. Modification of the c-oligomer with DCCD to inhibit further movement prevented re-formation of the disulfide bond. The experiment proves, first, that the c subunit in disulfide linkage with subunitb can move away from subunit b by thermal motion and, second, that DCCD reaction with the c-oligomer prevents movement of the subunit c back to the original position. The lack of an ATP requirement for movement of subunit c away from subunit b, after reduction of the disulfide bond, indicates that the repositioning is occurring by thermal motion rather than as a part of the ATP-coupled transport cycle. However, in order to see an ATP effect, the ATP induced movement would have to be rate-limiting relative to the disulfide reduction step.In summary, this study provides the important supportive evidence consistent with the rotary mechanical model for F0F1 ATP synthase. In the recent studies of Sambongi et al. (37Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M. Science. 1999; 286: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and Pänke et al. (38Pänke O. Gumbiowski K. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the rotation of the c-oligomer was directly observed by microscopy following attachment of an actin filament to thec-ring by independent approaches. However, Tsunoda et al. (39Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have recently questioned whether the rotation observed is with a nondisrupted F0F1 complex. The results presented here provide biochemical evidence that subunit ccan move relative to the subunit b stator by DCCD-inhibitable thermal motion. Previously, independent evidence was provided in support of a second tenet of the rotary catalytic mechanism, i.e. that the εγ subunit complex should remain fixed to the polar loops of a specific set of subunitc during enzyme function (71Schulenberg B.

Although a case is building for a fixed interaction between thec 12-rotor and γε shaft and for the movement of the c 12-rotor relative to ab 2 stator, other seemingly contradictory evidence remains to be explained (73Birkenhager R. Greie J.-C. Altendorf K. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and additional evidence is required for a complete proof of the rotary catalytic mechanism. H+-transporting F1F0 ATP synthases utilize the energy of a transmembrane electrochemical H+ gradient to drive formation of ATP. Closely related enzymes are found in the plasma membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of distinct extramembranous and transmembranous sectors, termed F1 and F0, respectively. Proton movement through F0 is reversibly coupled to ATP synthesis or hydrolysis in catalytic sites on F1. Each sector of the enzyme is composed of multiple subunits, with the simplest composition being α3β3γδε for F1 anda 1 b 2 c 12for F0 in the case of the Escherichia colienzyme (2Fillingame R.H.

An atomic resolution x-ray structure of the α3β3γ portion of bovine F1shows the 3 α and 3 β subunits alternating around a centrally located γ subunit, with the γ subunit interacting asymmetrically with the 3 β catalytic subunits (5Abrahams J.P.

Subunit γ was subsequently shown to rotate with respect to the 3 β subunits during catalysis (6Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, Ras-GRF1 acts as a GEF for Rac when tyrosine-phosphorylated following G protein-coupled receptor stimulation. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of Ras-GRF1 functions remain incompletely understood. We show here that activated ACK1, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the focal adhesion kinase family, causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1. On the other hand, kinase-deficient ACK1 exerted no effect. GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 toward Ha-Ras, as defined by in vitroGDP binding and release assays, was augmented after tyrosine phosphorylation by ACK1. In contrast, GEF activity toward Rac1 remained latent, implying that ACK1 does not represent a tyrosine kinase that acts downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. Consistent with enhanced Ras-GEF activity, accumulation of the GTP-bound form of Ras within the cell was shown through the use of Ras-binding domain pull-down assays. Furthermore, Ras-dependent activation of ERK2 by Ras-GRF1 was enhanced following co-expression of activated ACK1.

In most cases, the activity of Ras is regulated through the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 which increase the active GTP-bound form of Ras in living cells depending on upstream signals. In mammalian cells, several proteins that exhibit GEF activity toward Ras, such as mSos, Ras-GRF, and Ras-GRP, have been identified (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F.

In particular, the role of mSos in Ras regulation has been explored intensively, leading to the notion that mSos acts as a regulator downstream of a wide variety of receptors, including tyrosine kinase-type (5Schlessinger J.

Ras-GRF1 is expressed exclusively in the brain, whereas Ras-GRF2 transcripts are detected in several tissues including brain and lung. The physiological functions of Ras-GRF1 in neuronal signal transduction remain largely unknown. However, Ras-GRF1 is thought to play an important role because mice lacking Ras-GRF1 show defects in brain functions such as memory consolidation, whereas learning and short term memory seem to be intact (14Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G.N. Chapman P.F. Lipp H. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In addition to the CDC25 homology domain, both Ras-GRF proteins possess a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an IQ motif, and tandem Dbl homology (DH)/PH domains. The IQ motif is responsible for the interaction with the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin, which mediates signals triggered by an increase in the intracellular Ca2+concentration. Thus, Ras-GRF1 is considered to be involved in Ca2+ influx-dependent activation of Ras, particularly in neuronal cells (15Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+-responsive, Ras-independent as well as constitutive, Ras-dependent pathways downstream of Ras-GRF1 were shown to direct Raf and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activities (16Anborgh P.H. Qian X. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. DeClue J.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4611-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Tandem DH/PH domains are conserved among Dbl family proteins, GEFs that target Rho family GTP-binding proteins (17Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been revealed that Ras-GRFs exhibit GEF activity toward Rac as well, for which the DH/PH domains are required. While Rac-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 becomes evident following stimulation by G protein βγ subunit (Gβγ) signals (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Ras-GRF2 shows constitutive and Ca2+-enhanced Rac-GEF activities (19Fan W. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Fam N.P. Moran M.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 935-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates Ras-GRF1, thereby inducing its Rac-GEF activity like Gβγ (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In response to G protein-coupled receptor signals, not only Rac-, but also Ras-GEF activity is promoted (21Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a serine residue is important for triggering Ras-GEF activation (22Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas tyrosine phosphorylation is indispensable for Rac-GEF activation (18Kiyono M. Satoh T.

Oligomerization seems to be required for biological functions, because a mutation within the DH domain that abolishes oligomerization rendered Ras-GRFs incapable of inducing transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. ACK1 was isolated as a target of the Rho family GTP-binding protein Cdc42 (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Like other target molecules, ACK1 binds to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 through the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) region (24Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). On the basis of the sequence similarity of the catalytic domains, ACK1 is thought to belong to the focal adhesion kinase family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase catalytic domain and the CRIB motif, ACK1 possesses an Src homology 3 domain and several proline-rich motifs. ACK1 interacts with the Grb2 adaptor protein through its proline-rich motifs and thus is thought to act downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor as well (25Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, the tyrosine phosphorylation level of ACK1 was transiently increased upon EGF treatment (25Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding partner of the Src homology 3 domain of ACK1 remains to be identified. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK1 is also induced in response to temperature shift down or an increase in osmolarity (25Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We recently found that ACK1 leads to phosphorylation of Dbl, a GEF toward Rho family proteins, thereby promoting its activity (26Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, ACK1 may link Rho family GTP-binding proteins through the action of specific GEFs. However, the physiological function as well as specific target molecules of ACK1 are still obscure. ACK2, a close relative of ACK1, is activated following treatment with fetal bovine serum, EGF, and bradykinin but neither platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor α, nor interleukin-1 (27Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that ACK2 mediates cell adhesion signals initiated by integrin β1 in a Cdc42-dependent manner (28Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Hence, ACK2 is likely to participate in signaling pathways directed by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Another ACK-related kinase, Tnk1, was isolated from umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (29Hoehn G.T. Stokland T. Amin S. Ramı́rez M. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Small D. Civin C.I. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 903-913PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from the lack of the CRIB motif, overall structural features of Tnk1 are similar to ACK1. Tnk1 may play a pivotal role in fetal development because its transcripts are widely detected in fetal tissues examined. Through investigation of the regulatory mechanism of Ras-GRF1 upon tyrosine phosphorylation, we identified ACK1 as an upstream kinase that induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1. Subsequent to ACK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, GEF activity toward Ras was enhanced. In contrast, Rac-GEF activity remained latent after tyrosine phosphorylation by ACK1, suggesting that ACK1 is not implicated in Gβγ-dependent signaling pathways. Antibodies including anti-Ras-GRF antibody (sc-226), anti-Ha-Ras antibody (sc-520), anti-Ki-Ras antibody (sc-30), anti-N-Ras antibody (sc-31), and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99, sc-7020) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies including anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Babco), anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Eastman Kodak Co.), anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma), anti-mouse Ig antibody (55480; Cappel), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody (NA931; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were purchased from the indicated commercial suppliers. EGF was purchased from TaKaRa Biomedicals (Tokyo, Japan). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A was purchased from Calbiochem. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Transfection of 293 cells with expression plasmids was carried out as described previously (25Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The rat Ras-GRF1 cDNA was a generous gift from Larry Feig (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA) (11Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). pCMV5-Myc-Ras-GRF1 and pCMV5-Myc-Ras-GRF1(ΔN582) were previously described (20Kiyono M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). pCMV5-FLAG-Ras-GRF1(ΔN690) was constructed by subcloning a FLAG-tagged C-terminal sequence (amino acids 691–1244) of Ras-GRF1 into pCMV5. Expression plasmids for Gβ1, Gγ2, Ras(S17N), and Cdc42(G12V) (pCMV5-β1, pCMV5-γ2, pCMV5-FLAG-Ras(S17N), and pCMV5-FLAG-Cdc42(G12V), respectively) were previously described (18Kiyono M. Satoh T.

Expression plasmids for two ACK1 mutants (constitutively active ACK1(L543F) and catalytically inactive ACK1(K214R)) and Cdc42(G12V/T35A) (pCMV5-ACK1(L543F), pCMV5-ACK1(K214R), and pCMV5-FLAG-Cdc42(G12V/T35A), respectively) were described elsewhere (26Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). pGEX-c-Raf-1-RBD (an expression plasmid for the Ras-binding domain (amino acids 51–131) of c-Raf-1 fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST)) (32de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Kenji Tago. The recombinant Ha-Ras protein was described elsewhere (33Satoh T. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recombinant Rac1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein and purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. GST was subsequently removed by digestion with thrombin, and Rac1 was further purified as described previously (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were dissolved in IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mmNaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate), and the supernatant of centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C was used as a cell lysate. The anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (2 μg) was mixed with a rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates were mixed gently with the antibody·protein A-Sepharose complex for 2 h at 4 °C, and precipitates were washed four times with IP buffer. Precipitated proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, followed by visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (NEN Life Science Products). GDP/GTP exchange assays were performed essentially as described (21Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 293 cells transfected with various combinations of plasmids were serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.45 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl), dissolved in RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Na4P2O7), and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (2 μg) and a rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose were added to cell lysates, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with exchange buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) and subjected to GDP/GTP exchange assays. For [3H]GDP binding assays, immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with Ha-Ras (40 ng) on ice or Rac1 (200 ng) at 30 °C, respectively, in exchange buffer supplemented with 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm [3H]GDP (1,265 TBq/mol). After incubation for specified periods, ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2) was added, and samples were filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane, which was subjected to extensive washing with wash buffer. Radioactivity remaining on the filter was quantitated by the liquid scintillation counter. For [3H]GDP release assays, Ha-Ras·[3H]GDP complex was prepared by incubation of Ha-Ras in exchange buffer supplemented with 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm [3H]GDP (1,265 TBq/mol) for 10 min at 30 °C. 5 mmMgCl2 was added to terminate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with the Ha-Ras·[3H]GDP complex on ice in exchange buffer supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm GDP. After incubation for specified periods, radioactivity remaining in the complex was quantitated by filter binding assays as described above. Affinity precipitation of Ras using GST-c-Raf-1-RBD was performed essentially as described elsewhere (32de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).E. coli BL21 cells transformed with pGEX-c-Raf-1-RBD were grown at 30 °C to early logarithmic phase. Expression of GST-c-Raf-1-RBD was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Harvested cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, and disrupted by sonication. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with the lysate containing 20 μg of GST-c-Raf-1-RBD for 30 min at 4 °C and washed twice with lysis buffer. 293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-c-Raf-1-RBD conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Subsequently, glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with wash buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, and 150 mmNaCl. Precipitated Ras was detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Ectopically expressed HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells with 0.2 μg of an anti-HA antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose. ERK2 assays were performed as described previously (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 was examined using a transient cDNA expression system (Fig.1). Both full-length Ras-GRF1 and its N-terminally deleted mutant (Ras-GRF1ΔN582) were tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed with wild-type ACK1 and GTPase-deficient Cdc42(G12V) (Fig. 1 A). Cdc42(G12V/T35A), an effector domain mutant that is unable to bind and activate ACK1 (26Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), did not show any stimulatory effect. The expression level of Cdc42(G12V/T35A) as determined by immunoblotting was virtually the same as that of Cdc42(G12V) (data not shown). The constitutively active mutant ACK1(L543F) (26Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 in the absence of Cdc42(G12V), whereas kinase-deficient ACK1(K214R) exhibited no effect (Fig. 1 B). The tyrosine phosphorylation level of Ras-GRF1 in ACK1(L543F)-expressing cells was not further enhanced by co-expression of Cdc42(G12V) (data not shown). We are currently unsuccessful in detecting in vitro phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 by the ACK1 kinase catalytic domain produced inE. coli as a GST fusion protein (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, an autocrine mechanism for Ras-GRF1 tyrosine phosphorylation seems quite unlikely, because conditioned medium of 293 cells expressing ACK1(WT) and Cdc42(G12V) did not cause tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 when added to Ras-GRF1-expressing 293 cells (data not shown). EGF transiently induces tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of ACK1 (25Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) 2J. Kato, Y. Kaziro, and T. Satch, unpublished results. and thus is thought to regulate the ACK1 pathway. Therefore, we next examined the effect of EGF on Ras-GRF1 tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2, EGF rapidly triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1(ΔN690) in an ectopically expressed ACK1-dependent manner with maximal phosphorylation detected at 1 min, diminishing thereafter. EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of full-length Ras-GRF1 was also observed with a similar time course (data not shown). We are currently unable to block EGF-induced Ras-GRF1 tyrosine phosphorylation by dominant-negative Cdc42(T17N), because Cdc42(T17N) by itself activates ACK1 by unknown mechanisms. As a first step to assess the physiological significance of ACK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, GEF activity toward Ha-Ras was measured. Time courses of [3H]GDP binding and release in the presence of anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from mock- or Myc-tagged Ras-GRF1-transfected 293 cell lysates are illustrated in Fig. 3. Ectopically expressed Myc-Ras-GRF1 stimulated the exchange rate, which represents basal GEF activity of Ras-GRF1. Notably, tyrosine-phosphorylated Myc-Ras-GRF1 recovered from cells co-expressing ACK1(WT) and Cdc42(G12V) exhibited markedly enhanced GEF activity. Likewise, co-expression with ACK1(L543F) stimulated Ras-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 (Fig. 4), whereas ACK1(K214R) exerted no effect (data not shown). Cdc42(G12V/T35A) also did not enhance Ras-GEF activity (Fig. 4). Overall, tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 was paralleled with its activation as a Ras-GEF. The deletion mutant Ras-GRF1(ΔN582) showed GEF activity toward Ha-Ras, which was also enhanced upon activated ACK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A are shown in Fig. 5. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1 following co-expression with ACK1(WT) and Cdc42(G12V) was potently inhibited by herbimycin A (Fig.5 A). The expression level of Ras-GRF1 remained unchanged after treatment with herbimycin A (data not shown). Correspondingly, herbimycin A treatment abrogated GEF activity toward Ha-Ras to the level of unphosphorylated Ras-GRF1 (Fig. 5 B). Thus, activated ACK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation seems to be required for enhancement of GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 toward Ha-Ras.Figure 4GEF activity toward Ha-Ras of full-length and N-terminally deleted Ras-GRF1. Anti-Myc 9E10 immunoprecipitates from 293 cells transfected with pCMV5-Myc-Ras-GRF1 or pCMV5-Myc-Ras-GRF1(ΔN582) with indicated plasmids were subjected to the [3H]GDP binding assay for Ha-Ras.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Formation of the GTP-bound form of endogenous Ras proteins was assessed by a pull-down assay using a GST-fused Ras-binding domain construct (Fig. 6). When Ras-GRF1 was expressed with ACK1 activated by co-expression with Cdc42(G12V) or the L543F mutation, the GTP-bound form of all three subtypes of Ras (Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras) was significantly accumulated. In contrast, GTP-bound Ras yielded in response to unphosphorylated Ras-GRF1 was virtually undetectable under these conditions. To obtain further evidence for the enhancement of Ras-GEF activity in response to ACK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, we measured the activity of ERK2, a serine/threonine kinase downstream of Ras (Fig. 7). Whereas Ras-GRF1 alone enhanced ERK2 activity, which may be ascribed to the basal Ras-GEF activity, ACK1 did not exert any stimulatory effect in the absence of Ras-GRF1. ERK2 activity was increased upon activated ACK1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Ras-GRF1, which parallels the activation of Ras-GEF activity. The enhanced ERK2 activity was entirely sensitive to inhibitory action of Ras(S17N), suggesting the involvement of endogenous Ras. Gβγ-dependent signals induced GEF activity toward Rac1 through the action of a still unidentified tyrosine kinase (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates and thereby stimulates Rac-GEF activity (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, we subsequently examined the effect of ACK1 on Rac-GEF activity. As described in Fig.8, Cdc42(G12V)-activated ACK1 did not induce Rac-GEF activity in contrast to Gβγ. Ras-GRF1 co-expressed with the activated mutant ACK1(L543F) as well exerted no effect on GEF activity toward Rac1 (data not shown). The GDP/GTP cycle of Ras is regulated by GEFs in response to extracellular stimuli. Virtually all types of receptors that trigger the accumulation of Ras·GTP employ mSos, a ubiquitously expressed GEF for Ras, as a regulator of the GDP/GTP state (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 6Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Translocation of mSos from the cytosol to the plasma membrane through the interaction with the adaptor Grb2 is critical, while GEF activity itself remains unaffected (5Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In support of this, forced association of mSos with the plasma membrane resulted in constitutive activation of the Ras pathway (34Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 35Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast to mSos, the signaling mechanism through Ras-GRF1 seems to be more complicated. Although an artificial modification leading to membrane localization rendered Ras-GRF1 constitutively active, it is unclear whether such translocation occurs within the cell in response to upstream signals (35Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8512-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+/calmodulin-binding-dependent or serine phosphorylation-dependent activation was reported (15Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 21Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Herein, we show tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation of Ras-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1. Transient co-expression of Ras-GRF1 with ACK1 activated by the interaction with GTPase-deficient Cdc42 or a single amino acid mutation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation and remarkable enhancement of GEF activity toward Ras. However, we are currently unable to demonstrate that ACK1 directly phosphorylates Ras-GRF1 as a substrate in a cell-free system using purified recombinant proteins. For this, we utilized the GST-fused catalytic domain of ACK1, which was indeed active in phosphorylating myelin basic protein or glutamate/tyrosine polymers. We speculate that domains other than the catalytic domain of ACK1 may be required for recognition of physiological substrates. Alternatively, the involvement of other tyrosine kinases downstream of ACK1 is also possible. In either case, ACK1 plays a crucial role in modulating Ras activity through Ras-GRF1. As shown in Fig. 6, activated Ras-GRF1 acts on all three subtypes of Ras within 293 cells. Furthermore, unphosphorylated Ras-GRF1 also stimulated the formation of the GTP-bound form of Ha-, Ki-, and N-Ras, when expressed alone at higher levels than in Fig. 6 (data not shown). In contrast, Jones and Jackson (36Jones M.K. Jackson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1782-1787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that Ras-GRF1 activated Ha-Ras, but not Ki- and N-Ras, in NIH3T3 cells. Although we did not compare activation levels of three Ras subtypes quantitatively, our observation suggests that Ras-GRF1 may not absolutely discriminate Ras subtypes at least in our systems. Recently, we have shown that G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signals induced Rac-GEF activity of Ras-GRF1 through Gβγ (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation was required for the induction of Rac-GEF activity (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylates and thereby stimulates Rac-GEF activity, leading to the notion that tyrosine phosphorylation of critical residues occurs in response to both Gβγ-dependent tyrosine kinase and Src (20Kiyono M. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5441-5446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, ACK1 enhances Ras-GEF activity without affecting Rac-GEF activity. Therefore, phosphorylation of a set of tyrosines distinct from those phosphorylated by Src may be crucial for the enhancement of Ras-GEF activity. We are currently attempting to identify individual sets of phosphorylated tyrosine residues in Ras-GRF1. Our preliminary results by the use of an array of deletion mutants suggested that multiple but different tyrosines are indeed subjected to phosphorylation by Src and ACK1, respectively. As illustrated in Figs. 1, 4, and 7, the C-terminal half of Ras-GRF1 (Ras-GRF1ΔN582) consisting of the CDC25 domain and its flanking regions is also tyrosine-phosphorylated, thereby being activated. Hence, it is possible that enhancement of Ras-GEF activity may solely depend on a local conformational change in the CDC25 domain upon tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, it is unclear whether one Ras-GRF1 molecule can stimulate Ras and Rac simultaneously when phosphorylated, for instance, by both ACK1 and Src. Presumably, subcellular localization and the interaction with unknown scaffold proteins like MP1 and JIP1 for mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (37Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 38Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) may determine the substrate specificity of an individual Ras-GRF1 molecule. Further studies will be required to reveal the precise regulatory mechanism of Ras- and Rac-GEF activities at the molecular level. In contrast to diverse Rac/Cdc42 effectors that regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, the physiological role of ACK1 as a Cdc42-specific effector remains largely unknown. The involvement of ACK in integrin (28Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (39Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L.T. Iida J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) signaling was proposed, although downstream molecules are still obscure. Recently, we have shown that ACK1 triggers phosphorylation of Dbl, thereby promoting its GEF activity toward Rho family proteins (26Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ACK1 may link Rho family proteins to compose a signaling cascade or a positive feedback loop. Moreover, ACK1 phosphorylates and activates Ras-GRF1 as described in this paper. Taken together, an important role for ACK1 may be the regulation of GTP-binding protein networks by targeting GEFs for Ras or Rho family proteins. The role of Ras and Rho family proteins in neuronal cells remains poorly understood. Possible regulators for Ras and Rac, such as Ras-GRF1 and synGAP, a synapse-specific GTPase-activating protein for Ras, are components of the postsynaptic density fraction, suggesting a role at the synaptic junction (40Sturani E.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In fact, Ras-GRF1 is implicated in signaling mediated by G protein-coupled receptors, such as receptors for a variety of neurotransmitters (18Kiyono M. Satoh T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4826-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Mattingly R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37379-37384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, Ras and Rac may regulate, for instance, the expression of specific genes and channel activity, thereby ultimately leading to the modulation of electrophysiological functions in postsynaptic cells. Furthermore, they may act downstream of specific channel-type receptors such as the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, which is localized in the postsynaptic density fraction. Recently, two DH/PH domain-containing proteins, termed collybistin I and II, were identified as binding partners of the peripheral membrane protein gephyrin (43Kins S. Betz H. Kirsch J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Gephyrin is associated with neurotransmitter receptors, such as glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and is required for receptor clustering. Hence, Rho family proteins, when activated by collybistins, may exert critical functions in the formation of postsynaptic receptor clusters. It will be important to investigate further the role of Ras and Rho family proteins and their regulatory mechanisms, particularly in the brain."

PDE is regulated by Pγ, the regulatory subunit of PDE, and GTP/Tα, the GTP-bound α subunit of transducin. In previous studies (Tsuboi, S., Matsumoto, H., Jackson, K. W., Tsujimoto, K., Williamas, T., and Yamazaki, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15016–15023; Tsuboi, S., Matsumoto, H., and Yamazaki, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15024–15029), we showed that Pγ is phosphorylated by a previously unknown kinase (Pγ kinase) in a GTP-dependent manner in photoreceptor outer segment membranes. We also showed that phosphorylated Pγ loses its ability to interact with GTP/Tα, but gains a 10–15 times higher ability to inhibit GTP/Tα-activated PDE than that of nonphosphorylated Pγ. Thus, we propose that the Pγ phosphorylation is probably involved in the recovery phase of phototransduction through shut off of GTP/Tα-activated PDE. Here we demonstrate that all known Pγs preserve a consensus motif for cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5), a protein kinase believed to be involved in neuronal cell development, and that Pγ kinase is Cdk5 complexed with p35, a neuronal Cdk5 activator. Mutational analysis of Pγ indicates that all known Pγs contain a P-X-T-P-R sequence and that this sequence is required for the Pγ phosphorylation by Pγ kinase. In three different column chromatographies of a cytosolic fraction of frog photoreceptor outer segments, the Pγ kinase activity exactly coelutes with Cdk5 and p35. The Pγ kinase activity (∼85%) is also immunoprecipitated by a Cdk5-specific antibody, and the immunoprecipitate phosphorylates Pγ. Finally, recombinant Cdk5/p35, which were expressed using clones from a bovine retina cDNA library, phosphorylates Pγ in frog outer segment membranes in a GTP-dependent manner. These observations suggest that Cdk5 is probably involved in the recovery phase of phototransduction through phosphorylation of Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα in mature vertebrate retinal photoreceptors.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Pγ release also reduces the affinity of noncatalytic cGMP binding sites to cGMP (14Yamazaki A. Bartucca F. Ting A.

A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, amphibian Pγ functions as an inhibitor of cGMP hydrolysis by Pαβ and as a stimulator of cGMP binding to noncatalytic sites on Pαβ. These functionally different Pγs appear to be released by GTP/Tα in different steps of phototransduction (16Yamazaki A. Bondarenko V.A. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32495-32498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In mammalian rod PDE, GTP/Tα activates PDE catalytic activity (17Fung B.K.-K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 78: 152-156Crossref Scopus (512) Google Scholar); however, whether the Pγ release acts as an activation mechanism is controversial (5Deterre P. Bigay J.

However, a recent study has indicated that the interaction between GTP/Tα and Pαβγγ reduces the Pαβ affinity to Pγ (22Lin W. Clark W.A. Sharma P. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34284-34292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), implying that the GTP/Tα-Pαβ interaction is involved in the release of Pγ from Pαβ. Moreover, using new column chromatography, we have recently confirmed previous data (5Deterre P. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that Pγ is released from bovine Pαβ by GTP/Tα in vitro. 2M. Tatsumi, Y. Yamazaki, and A. Yamazaki, unpublished observations. Together with previous studies (5Deterre P. Bigay J. Forquet F. Robert M. Chabre M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Fung B.K.-K.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), these results strongly suggest that physical release of Pγ from Pαβ is a mechanism of PDE activation by GTP/Tα in mammalian systems. It has been believed that cGMP binding to noncatalytic sites on mammalian Pαβ is not regulated by Pγ, because the cGMP binding to Pαβ has been shown to be very tight (23Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, we (24Yamazaki A. Kachi S. Usukura J. Yamazaki M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: s953Google Scholar) and another group (25Mou H. Grazio III, H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have recently shown that Pγ is also involved in the regulation of cGMP binding to noncatalytic sites on mammalian Pαβ. In addition, PDE in cone photoreceptors is believed to be regulated in a manner similar to that of amphibian rod PDE. Thus, it is clear that the role of Pαβ-Pγ interaction and its regulation by GTP/Tα are crucial in vertebrate phototransduction. Recent studies have suggested that post-translational modifications of Pγ are involved in the regulation of Pαβ-Pγ interaction by GTP/Tα. In frog ROS membranes, Pγ complexed with Pαβ, but not with GTP/Tα, is ADP-ribosylated by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ADP-ribosyltransferase, and the ADP-ribosylated Pγ is not released from Pαβ by GTP/Tα (26Bondarenko V.A. Desai M. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Amin R.H. Yousif K.K. Kinumi T. Ohashi M. Komori N. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Hayashi F. Usukura J. Lipkin V.M. Yamazaki A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7755-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Pγ is also phosphorylated by several kinases in vitro, such as PI-stimulated kinase (28Hayashi F. Lin G.Y. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), PKC (29Udovichenko I.P. Cunnick J. Gonzalez K. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9850-9856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKA (30Xu L.X. Tanaka Y. Bondarenko V.A. Matsuura I. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and Pγ kinase (31Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI-stimulated kinase phosphorylates threonine 35 or serine 40 in Pγ; however, its characteristic change by the phosphorylation is unknown (28Hayashi F. Lin G.Y. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PKC and PKA phosphorylate threonine 35 in Pγ, and the phosphorylated Pγ has a higher inhibitory activity against GTP/Tα-activated PDE than that of nonphosphorylated Pγ (29Udovichenko I.P. Cunnick J. Gonzalez K. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9850-9856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Xu L.X. Tanaka Y. Bondarenko V.A. Matsuura I. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The real function of Pγ phosphorylation by PI-stimulated kinase, PKC and PKA, is not clear in the current model of phototransduction, because their phosphorylation steps in the phototransduction cascade are unknown. Contrary to these Pγ phosphorylations, Pγ phosphorylation by Pγ kinase appears to have interesting functions in the current model of phototransduction (31Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A crucial point of this Pγ phosphorylation is that Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα is the best substrate for Pγ kinase and that Pγ kinase phosphorylates Pγ in ROS membranes in a GTP-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the Pγ phosphorylation occurs only after PDE activation. Another important point is that the phosphorylated Pγ loses its ability to interact with GTP/Tα; however, the Pγ gains a 10–15 times higher ability to inhibit GTP/Tα-activated PDE than that of nonphosphorylated Pγ. These observations indicate that GTP/Tα-activated PDE can be deactivated by the Pγ phosphorylation, even in the presence of GTP/Tα. Thus, these observations imply three important possibilities as follows. 1) The Pγ phosphorylation can be involved in the recovery phase of phototransduction to the dark state. 2) After activation of PDE, GTP/Tα may interact with another effector, and the interaction may be involved in the recovery of phototransduction. 3) When the Pγ phosphorylation occurs, the lifetime of GTP/Tα-activated PDE can be regulated by the Pγ phosphorylation. The hydrolysis of GTP is not involved in the regulation under the conditions. In this series of experiments, we show that Cdk5 is involved in the Pγ phosphorylation in vitro (in this paper) and in vivo (in the accompanying paper (61Hayashi F. Matsuura I. Kachi S. Maeda T.

Cdk5 shares a high degree of homology to Cdk2 kinases (33Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Meyerson M.

Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Cdk5 is one of the proline-directed protein kinases that phosphorylate a serine or a threonine residue immediately preceding a proline residue (36Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

Cdk5 and its neuronal activator p35 are required for various neuronal developments, including neurite growth, cortical lamination, and fasciculation of axon fibers (38Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 39Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.-H.

Cdk5 is also suggested to be involved in retina development (41Hirooka K. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Tokuda M. Itano T. Hasegawa E. Wang J.H. Hatase O. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2478-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 42Nakayama T. Goshima Y. Misu Y. Kato T. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 41: 326-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates tau, a microtubule-associated protein. It is now clear that the tau hyperphosphorylation is involved in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome (43Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that Cdk5 phosphorylates exclusively same sites in tau as those in the tau from Alzheimer's disease brain (44Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently Patrick et al. (45Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. De la Mnnte S. Dikkers P. Tsai L. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar) have suggested that conversion of p35 to a 25-kDa protein (p25) by an unknown proteinase deregulates Cdk5 activity and that the deregulated Cdk5 hyperphosphorylates tau and promotes neurodegeneration. It has also very recently been shown that Cdk5 is involved in actions of dopamine (46Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.-H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. Huganir R.L. Hemmings H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nature. 1999; 402: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), indicating that Cdk5 is also involved in neuronal signal transduction mechanisms. In the present study, we show that the phosphorylation motif for Cdk5 is preserved in the amino acid sequence of all known Pγs and that Pγ kinase is in fact Cdk5. We also show that recombinant Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates Pγ in ROS membranes in a GTP-dependent manner, strengthening a previous conclusion that Pγ kinase phosphorylates Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα after activation of PDE (31Tsuboi S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that Cdk5 can be involved in the recovery phase of phototransduction through stimulation of PDE turnoff by Pγ phosphorylation.

Chemical reagents were purchased from the following sources: [γ-32P]ATP, [3H]cGMP, and125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG from New England Nuclear; ATP, cGMP, GTP and GTPγS from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase, PMSF, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin from Sigma; okadaic acid from LC Services; Immobilon-P from Millipore; protein A-Sepharose and a Ultra Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate from Pierce. A Cdk5 antibody, a p35 antibody, and MAP kinase antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Cdk5 antibody was prepared using a peptide corresponding to 8 amino acids at the COOH-terminal of human Cdk5. The p35 antibody was prepared using a peptide corresponding to 19 amino acids at the COOH-terminal of human p35 (identical to corresponding bovine sequence). Specificity of these antibodies and cross-reactivities with frog proteins will be shown in Fig. 5. MAP kinase antibodies used were prepared against extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (a peptide corresponding to amino acids 352–367) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (a peptide corresponding to amino acids 345–358). All mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (Table I) were purchased from DNAgency.

Frog Pγ was isolated from ROS membranes by washing with an isotonic buffer containing GTP as described previously (13Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated frog Pγ was prepared as described previously (31Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We note that recombinant bovine Pγ has the same functions as frog Pγ in known reactions and that both Pγs contain the same amino acid sequence required for the Pγ phosphorylation by Pγ kinase, as described under “Results and Discussion”. Thus, data obtained using both Pγs are comparable. Frog ROS membranes containing GTP/Tα-activated PDE were prepared as described previously (13Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and designated as GTP/Tα-activated PDE. PDE in these membranes is activated about 10 times (13Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GTP/Tα-activated PDE appears to tightly bind to membranes. 3V. A. Bondarenko, M. Yamazaki, and A. Yamazaki, unpublished observations. Pγ kinase was prepared from a soluble fraction of frog (Rana catesbiana) photoreceptor outer segments by a Mono Q column as described previously (31Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after illumination, ROS membranes (10–20 mg of protein) were washed (×7) with 1.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm PMSF). The extract was applied to a Mono Q column, and Pγ kinase was eluted with a NaCl gradient. Under our conditions, Pγ kinase was eluted consistently in fractions 10–14. The mixture of these fractions was used as Pγ kinase. In addition to the Mono Q column chromatography, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (0.9 × 15 cm) was also used to isolate Pγ kinase from a frog ROS extract and to investigate the contents of Cdk5 and p35 in Pγ kinase fractions. The chromatography buffer was 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μmpepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, and 20% glycerol. Elution of Pγ kinase was performed by a NaCl gradient (0 → 1.2m/120 ml) under the conditions that the flow rate was 1 ml/10 min, and the fraction volume was 2 ml. Pγ phosphorylation by Pγ kinase was measured as described previously (31Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Pγ kinase (2–3 μg of protein) was preincubated (30 min at 33 °C) in 40 μl of a concentrated (×1.25) buffer B (final concentration, 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, 100 μm ATP, 100 nm okadaic acid, 15 mm phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase (0.1 mg/ml)) to phosphorylate components I and II, which might be contaminants in the Pγ kinase. Components I and II, if present, may interfere with the precise measurement of Pγ phosphorylation due to their similar molecular weights. We note that, without Pγ added, phosphorylation of a ∼13-kDa protein (on SDS gels) was not detected. This indicates that an endogenous protein with molecular mass ∼13 kDa, which can be phosphorylated under the conditions, is not present in the Pγ kinase preparation and that preincubation of Pγ kinase with ATP is not required. Indeed, the level of Pγ phosphorylation was not changed with or without the preincubation (data not shown). However, components I and II may be contaminated in Pγ kinase, because these proteins were eluted in fractions 7–9 in Mono Q column chromatography under the conditions that Pγ kinase was isolated in fractions 10–14 (31Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, before Pγ phosphorylation, we usually did not try to exclude these proteins from the Pγ kinase preparation by other column chromatography. Thus, we constantly preincubated the Pγ kinase preparation with ATP. Pγ phosphorylation was initiated by adding Pγ (0.1–2.0 μg) solubilized in 10 μl of water with [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.2 μCi) and then the phosphorylation was carried out for 30 min unless otherwise noted. The reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 80 °C. Phosphorylated Pγ was isolated by SDS-PAGE, and the level of phosphorylation was measure"

In the accompanying paper (Matsuura, I., Bondarenko, V. A., Maeda, T., Kachi, S., Yamazaki, M., Usukura, J., Hayashi, F., and Yamazaki, A. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 32950–32957), we have shown that all known Pγs contain a specific phosphorylation motif for cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (Cdk5) and that the unknown kinase is Cdk5 complexed with its activator. Here, using frog rod photoreceptor outer segments (ROS) isolated by a new method, we show that Cdk5 is involved in light-dependent Pγ phosphorylation in vivo. Under dark conditions only negligible amounts of Pγ were phosphorylated. However, under illumination that bleached less than 0.3% of the rhodopsin, ∼4% of the total Pγ was phosphorylated in less than 10 s. Pγ dephosphorylation occurred in less than 1 s after the light was turned off. Analysis of the phosphorylated amino acid, inhibition of Pγ phosphorylation by Cdk inhibitors in vivo and in vitro, and two-dimensional peptide map analysis of Pγ phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro indicate that Cdk5 phosphorylates a Pγ threonine in the same manner in vivo and in vitro. These observations, together with immunological data showing the presence of Cdk5 in ROS, suggest that Cdk5 is involved in light-dependent Pγ phosphorylation in ROS and that the phosphorylation is significant and reversible. In an homogenate of frog ROS, PDE activated by light/guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) was inhibited by Pγ alone, but not by Pγ complexed with GDP/Tα or GTPγS/Tα. Under these conditions, Pγ phosphorylated by Cdk5 inhibited the light/GTPγS-activated PDE even in the presence of GTPγS/Tα. These observations suggest that phosphorylated Pγ interacts with and inhibits light/GTPγS-activated PDE, but does not interact with GTPγS/Tα in the homogenate. Together, our results strongly suggest that after activation of PDE by light/GTP, Pγ is phosphorylated by Cdk5 and the phosphorylated Pγ inhibits GTP/Tα-activated PDE, even in the presence of GTP/Tα in ROS.

Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. George J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11539-11548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the GDP/Tα/Pγ complex interacts with membrane-bound Tβγ, Pγ is released from the complex and reassociates with Pαβ, resulting in the turnoff of PDE (10Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Tatsumi M.

Pγ is phosphorylated by PI-stimulated kinase (13Hayashi F. Lin G.Y. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the PI-dependent Pγ phosphorylation (13Hayashi F. Lin G.Y. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), threonine 35 or serine 40 in Pγ may be phosphorylated. PKC (14Udovichenko I.P. Cunnick J. Gonzalez K. Takemoto D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) phosphorylates threonine 35 in Pγ. The phosphorylated Pγ has a higher inhibitory activity against GTP/Tα-activated PDE than that of nonphosphorylated Pγ. The important point in the Pγ phosphorylations by these protein kinases is that the Pγ phosphorylations appear not to occur when Pγ binds to GTPγS/Tα. We have shown that Pγ phosphorylations by PI-stimulated kinase (13Hayashi F. Lin G.Y. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and PKA (15Xu L.X. Tanaka Y. Bondarenko V.A. Matsuura I. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were inhibited by GTPγS/Tα. In the case of Pγ phosphorylation by PKA (15Xu L.X. Tanaka Y. Bondarenko V.A. Matsuura I. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the inhibition is due to the unavailability of the phosphorylation site in Pγ, because a Pγ region, including threonine 35, is involved in its interaction with GTP/Tα, and the region is masked when Pγ is complexed with GTP/Tα. The same kind of inhibition was also observed in the ADP-ribosylation of Pγ, because the Pγ ADP-ribosylation site (arginines 33 or 36) is masked when Pγ is complexed with GTP/Tα (18Bondarenko V.A. Desai M. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Amin R.H. Yousif K.K. Kinumi T. Ohashi M. Komori N. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Hayashi F. Usukura J. Lipkin V.M. Yamazaki A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7755-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is very likely that the phosphorylation of threonine 35 in Pγ occurs when Pγ is complexed with Pαβ. We have shown that arginine 33 or 36 in Pγ is ADP-ribosylated when Pγ is complexed with Pαβ (18Bondarenko V.A. Desai M. Dua S. Yamazaki M. Amin R.H. Yousif K.K. Kinumi T. Ohashi M. Komori N.

In contrast to these Pγ phosphorylations, Pγ phosphorylation by Pγ kinase appears to be light-dependent and thus can be brought into agreement with in the current model of phototransduction (16Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15016-15023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the phosphorylation, Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα is the best substrate for Pγ kinase, and the Pγ phosphorylation is dependent upon GTP in ROS membranes. These results indicate that the Pγ phosphorylation occurs after PDE activation. Threonine 22 in Pγ is phosphorylated. The phosphorylated Pγ loses its affinity to GTP/Tα, but gains a 10∼15 times higher ability to inhibit PDE activity than that of nonphosphorylated Pγ. Thus, the phosphorylated Pγ more effectively inhibits GTP/Tα-activated PDE than nonphosphorylated Pγ, and the inhibition occurs even in the presence of GTP/Tα. These observations imply that 1) the Pγ phosphorylation is probably involved in the recovery phase of phototransduction to the dark state, 2) after activation of PDE, GTP/Tα may interact with another effector and the interaction may be associated with mechanisms for the recovery of phototransduction, and 3) the lifetime of GTP/Tα-activated PDE can be regulated by the Pγ phosphorylation when the Pγ phosphorylation functions. In this series of experiments, we showed that Cdk5 phosphorylates Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα in vitro (in the accompanying paper (20Matsuura I. Bondarenko V.A. Maeda T. Kachi S. Yamazaki M. Usukura J.

We have also demonstrated that recombinant Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates Pγ in a GTPγS-dependent manner in ROS membranes, suggesting that Cdk5 is involved in the phosphorylation of Pγ complexed with GTP/Tα. In the present study, we link these observations with light-dependent Pγ phosphorylation in vivo(21Hayashi F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Using frog photoreceptor outer segments isolated by a new method, we show that Cdk5 is involved in the light-dependent Pγ phosphorylation in vivo, that the Pγ phosphorylation is significant and reversible, and that the Pγ phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are rapid enough to be involved in the recovery phase of phototransduction. Moreover, in an homogenate of photoreceptor outer segments, the phosphorylated Pγ inhibits light/GTPγS-activated PDE, even in the presence of GTPγS/Tα. These observations suggest that the Pγ phosphorylation verified in the in vitro system (16Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol.

The MAP kinase antibody used (New England Biolabs) was prepared against peptides corresponding 350–360 amino acids of human p44 MAP kinase. A Pγ antibody was prepared using a peptide corresponding to bovine Pγ Arg24–Gly46. This antibody recognizes bovine and frog Pγ. All experiments described were carried out using frogs (Rana catesbiana). Recombinant bovine Cdk5/p35 was prepared by a Mono S column (22Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

To prepare Pγ complexed with GTPγS/Tα or GDP/Tα, these Tαs were incubated with equimolar concentration of Pγ at 4 °C overnight, and these complexes were isolated by gel-filtration columns. Frogs were fully dark-adapted (>12 h) at room temperature. Before bleaching samples, all manipulations were done under infrared light. Photoreceptor outer segments were isolated as described previously (19Bondarenko V.A. Yamazaki M. Hayashi F. Yamazaki A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7755-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the frontal hemisphere of an eyeball was removed by a razor blade, and the resulting eye-cup was vertically cut in half. The half-eye-cup was put on two layers of curved filter paper (Toyo Filter Paper 5B, 3 × 6 cm). After its vitreous body was soaked by the filter papers, the retina layer adhered to the filter paper. The retina could be peeled off from the eye-cup when the curved filter paper was flattened. The pigment epithelium layer stayed on the eye-cup. The retina was covered with 100 μl of Ringer's solution (105 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mmtaurine, and 5 mm glucose) containing [33P]phosphorus (∼1 mCi/ml) and incubated for 30 min under O2/CO2 (95:5) atmosphere. [33P]Phosphorus was used to avoid illumination of rhodopsin by the Cerenkov effect of [32P]phosphorus. The pH value of the incubation medium was exactly adjusted to 7.50 by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH. After rinsing with Ringer's solution, the retina was placed on a flat end of a plastic plunger, and the excess Ringer's solution was removed by dry filter paper. The retina on the plastic plunger was exposed to white light (2% rhodopsin bleached/min) for the indicated periods and quickly frozen by attaching its photoreceptor outer segment layer to the surface of a copper block pretreated with liquid N2. The retina was moved into cold acetone (−20 °C, 100 ml) containing 5 g of molecular sieve (4A 1/16) and incubated (−20 °C, 3 days) with acetone. The acetone was replaced each day. Acetone was removed by decantation, and dehydrated retinas were dried under vacuum. A piece of an adhesive tape (Scotch 3M) was attached to the outer segment surface of the retina layer. After the backing filter paper was removed, another piece of tape was attached to the neural retina layer. By pulling these two tapes apart, the outer segment layer and the neural retina layer, including the photoreceptor inner segments, were separated. The outer segment layer attached to the tape is observed by light microscopy (× 500) (Fig. 1 A). The purity of the outer segments will be described later. The outer segment layer was solubilized with 100 μl of buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 nm okadaic acid) containing 1% SDS, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and diluted with 900 μl of buffer A. Insoluble materials were spun down by ultracentrifugation. The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay method (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) after proteins were precipitated with deoxycholic acid/trichloroacetic acid. Pγ and phosphorylated Pγ in each sample (1.0 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated using a Pγ-specific antibody and further purified by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands corresponding to phosphorylated Pγ were detected by using an image analyzer and were cut out. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the Pγ was carried out as described previously (16Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15024-15029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 33P-Labeled spots were detected on an image analyzer. Radioactive spots were recovered, and their radioactivities were measured. The purity of photoreceptor outer segments isolated was investigated using antibodies against MAP kinase, which are believed not to be present in outer segments (20Matsuura I. Bondarenko V.A.

Photoreceptor outer segments and the neural retinal layer were solubilized in 200 μl of SDS-sample buffer containing 70 mm DTT and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins (20 μg) in these samples were isolated by SDS-PAGE, and MAP kinase was detected by Western blot. The protein concentration was measured as described previously (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Fresh frog retina was immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.13m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with the same buffer (×3), the retina was equilibrated with 30% sucrose solution. Cryosections (14 μm thick) were prepared with a Cryostat (Leica CM3050 Bensheim, Germany), and mounted on glass slides. These specimens were blocked with the phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were incubated with a Cdk5 antibody at the IgG concentration of 1 ng/ml for 2 h. For controls, the same concentration of the antibody was mixed with the peptide antigen (20 ng/ml) prior to application. Specimens were incubated with a secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (15 mg/ml), for 1 h. These specimens were washed with the phosphate buffer (×3). Finally, antibody binding sites were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyl phosphatep-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. Before illumination of samples, all manipulations were done under infrared light. Retinas were isolated from frog eye-cups as described above. These retinas were incubated in Ringer's solution (20 min). After exposure to white light (2% rhodopsin bleached/min) for indicated times, these retinas were quickly frozen as described above. As a control, all procedures were carried out without light. The photoreceptor outer segment layer was isolated from dried retina as described above and then solubilized with 50 μl of 1% SDS containing 100 mm DTT. Solubilized outer segment sample was diluted by 10-fold with buffer B (2% Triton X-100, 1% Pharmalyte (pH 8–10.5), 0.5% Bio-Lyte (pH 5–7), 0.5% Bio-Lyte (pH 6–8), 1 mmPMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 9.2 m urea in final concentrations). Pγ and phosphorylated Pγ in the solubilized outer segments (50 μg protein) were isolated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using Immobiline DryStrip gels, consisting of isoelectric focusing (pH 6–11) in the first dimension and SDS-gradient gel (10–20%) electrophoresis in the second dimension. Pγ and phosphorylated Pγ were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes, and membranes were blocked by 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. A Pγ-specific antibody diluted in the same blocking buffer was used to identify Pγ, and the bound antibody was detected by a chemiluminescence detection kit. After development of x-ray films, Pγ spots were scanned by Paragon 1200A3 ProScanner and relative density (mm2 × OD) was calculated by Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). The location of phosphorylated Pγ in gels was confirmed using 33P-phosphorylated Pγ. In the in vivo system, Cdk inhibitor, olomoucine (100 μm), or roscovitine (50 μm) were applied to retinas incubated in Ringer's solution containing [33P]phosphorus. Other experimental conditions were the same as those described above. An inactive analogue of olomoucine, iso-olomoucine (100 μm), was used as a control. Isolation of Pγ and phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated Pγ were carried out as described above. Effects of these inhibitors on Pγ kinase and recombinant Cdk5/p35 were also measured using Pγ phosphorylation in vitro (16Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T. Yamazaki A. J.

As Pγ phosphorylated in vitro, frog Pγ (10 μg) was phosphorylated by using ∼10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and Pγ kinase, as described previously (16Tsuboi S. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Tsujimoto K. Williams T.

As Pγ phosphorylated in vivo, after incubation of retinas in Ringer's solution containing [33P]phosphorus, Pγ was phosphorylated by 10-min light exposure (20% rhodopsin was bleached), as described above. These phosphorylated Pγs were isolated by immunoprecipitation using a Pγ-specific antibody and SDS-PAGE. Pγ radioactive spots were identified by autoradiography and cut out. Extracted Pγs were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using two-dimensional peptide map analysis as described previously (26Geer P.D. Luo K. Scfton B.M. Hunter T.

CAK (the Cdk-activating kinase complex, composed of cdk7, cyclinH, and MAT1) phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II largest subunit (4Weeda G. Rossignol M. Fraser R.A.

The TFIIH role in nucleotide excision repair, a DNA repair pathway essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome, is also firmly established (7de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H.

The p44 amino terminus shares sequence homology with S5a, a proteasome subunit, leading to the proposal that this homologous region could be a ubiquitous regulating motif for both transcription and translation (17Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Additionally, the p44 subunit possesses a carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich region (residues 252 to 395) (10Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Its sequence analysis reveals relationships to three different zinc binding motifs: a C4 zinc binding motif followed by either a TFIIIA-like zinc finger or a RING-related sequence (see Ref. 18Adachi N. Matsumoto M. Hasegawa S. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Yeast. 1999; 15: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar and Fig. 2).Here we demonstrate through biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies that the carboxyl-terminal portion of p44 is essential for the integrity of TFIIH transcriptional activity. This role is supported by two distinct zinc binding modules belonging to the C4 zinc finger family and to the interleaved zinc-binding protein family. The solution structure of this latter module reveals an unexpected homology with the regulatory domain of protein kinase C and provides a framework to study its role at the molecular level.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe amino-terminal portion of the p44 subunit of TFIIH is involved in the regulation of XPD helicase activity (15Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of the carboxyl-terminal portion of p44, we generated, based on limited proteolysis, two recombinant TFIIH complexes in which the p44 subunit was deleted. In parallel, the corresponding carboxyl-terminal domains were cloned, expressed, and purified for biophysical and structural studies.The p44 Carboxyl-terminal Domain Is Essential for Transcription ActivityTwo recombinant TFIIH complexes in which the p44 subunit was deleted at its carboxyl-terminal end from amino acid 252–395 (p44Δ(252–395)) and from 321–395 (p44Δ(321–395)) were generated. After being overexpressed in the baculovirus expression system, rIIH9-wt, rIIH9-p44Δ(252–395) and rIIH9-p44Δ(321–395) were purified by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody directed toward the amino-terminal end of p44. The composition of rIIH9-p44Δ(321–395) complex assayed by Western blotting was similar to that of rIIH9-wt, whereas the p34 subunit was missing in rIIH9-p44Δ(252–395) (data not shown). These complexes were tested in an in vitro transcription system containing all the basal transcription factors in addition to the RNA polymerase II and the adenovirus major late promoter template. Both rIIH9-p44Δ(252–395) and rIIH9-p44Δ(321–395) are deficient in transcription activity (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 6–11 with lanes 3–5) but keep the same XPD helicase activity as rIIH9-wt (Fig. 1 B). The deficient TFIIH transcription activity of rIIH9-p44Δ(321–395) is due to the truncated p44 protein itself, since its subunit composition is similar to that of rIIH9-wt, whereas the deficient TFIIH transcription activity of rIIH9-p44Δ(252–395) is due to the absence of p34 subunit, as it was shown (19Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) that the absence of a single subunit abolishes TFIIH transcription activity. Together, these data demonstrate a crucial involvement of the carboxyl-terminal domain of p44 in the TFIIH transcriptional activity.Figure 1Transcriptional (A) and helicase (B) activities of endogenous and recombinant TFIIH, either wild type or harboring deletion in the carboxyl terminus of the p44 subunit. Equivalent amounts of recombinant TFIIH complexes, either wild type (rIIH9-wt) or harboring deletion in carboxyl terminus of the p44 subunit (rIIH9-p44Δ(252–395), rIIH9-p44Δ(321–395)) were tested for their ability to allow the transcription of a 309 nucleotide sequence under the control of adenovirus major late promoter or displace an oligonucleotide.

As shown in Fig. 2, 13 of the 14 cysteines (* residues) and 4 of the 9 histidines (● residues) present in the human p44 are conserved among all species from Homo sapiensto Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two blocks of conservation can be defined: block I (Gly-288 to Leu-328) and block II (Cys-345 to Cys-385) are separated by an insertion of 12 to 23 residues. Block I contains five cysteines and one histidine and possesses a CX 2CX 10CX 2C amino acid sequence that corresponds to a C4 zinc binding motif (36Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Block II contains eight cysteines and two histidines and possesses a typical sequence CX 2CX 2–4 FCADCD (A is an aliphatic residue) that is found only in human p44 and its orthologues. Block II also exhibits similarities with a consensus TFIIIA zinc finger (37Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) and with a derived C3HC4 RING finger motif (38Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2).To determine whether the p44 carboxyl-terminal portion binds a metal through the detected motifs, three expression vectors that enable the production of p44(252–395) (Blocks I and II) as well as p44(252–320) (Block I) and p44(321–395) (Block II) were constructed (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and3; see also “Experimental Procedures”). The p44(252–320) and p44(321–395) fragments were chosen on the basis of limited proteolysis of p44(252–395). The metal content of the purified recombinant polypeptides was analyzed. Atomic absorption measurements revealed the presence of zinc atoms within the protein fragments, whereas no trace of metal such as Ca2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Li+, Mn2+, or Mg2+ could be detected. The accurate zinc stoichiometry was determined from mass spectrometry measurements by comparing the mass measured for the denatured protein (Fig. 3, B andD) with that of the native one (Fig. 3, C andE) for p44(252–395), p44(252–320), p44(321–395) (see also Table I). Apart from the primary ion peaks, minor peaks belonging to sodium (Fig. 3, *) or 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3, ♦) adducts were detected. The mass spectrometry data obtained under denaturing conditions fit the theoretical values. Mass spectrometry measurements of the native protein fragments show additional molecular masses of 191.1, 63.8, and 127.9 Da for p44(252–395), p44(252–320), and p44(321–395), respectively (Fig. 3, C, E, andF). These correspond to 3, 1, and 2 zinc atoms associated with the three fragments, respectively (Table I).Figure 3Mass spectrometry measurements of p44(252–395), p44(252–320), and p44(321–395) (electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry).

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13825-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Upon treatment with EDTA, we observed that the 9015.9-Da protein peak (Fig. 3 F) gives rise to two different species of 8888.0 Da and 8950.8 Da corresponding to the loss of two and one zinc atoms, respectively (Fig. 3, F and G). The addition of a large excess of zinc acetate restores the native state of the protein, leading to a species of 9015.7 Da, which corresponds to the back addition of the two zinc atoms (Fig. 3 H). The zinc binding to the protein is specific since no additional species is observed. Together, these data demonstrate that p44 carboxyl-terminal domain contains three zinc atoms coordinated by two independent domains that correspond to p44(252–320) and p44(321–395).Identification of Zinc Binding Amino AcidsTo identify the zinc coordinating amino acids, p44(252–395), p44(252–320), and p44(321–395) were treated by p-(hydroxymercuri)benzene sulfonate (PMPS) or diethylpyrocarbonate, which react with cysteine and histidine residues, respectively, and the amount of zinc released upon treatment was quantified. These experiments revealed that only cysteines are involved in zinc chelation for p44(252–320), whereas in p44(321–395), both cysteine and histidine residues bind zinc (TableII).Table IIZinc content of wild type and mutants p44(252–320) and p44(321–395) deduced from mass spectrometry measurements and amount of zinc released upon p-(hydroxymercuri)benzene sulfonate (PMPS) or diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treatmentMassPMPSDEPCp44(252–320)-wt110 H275A110 C291ANSNSNS C294ANSNSNS C299A110 C305ANSNSNS C308ANSNSNSp44(321–395)-wt221 H324A221 C345A11.10.6 C348A11.20.8 C360ANSNSNS C363ANSNSNS C368A11.21 C371A11.10.8 H376A21.91.1 H380A21.90.8 C381A221 C382A22.11.2 C385A22.11.3H376A/H380ANSNSNSC382A/C385A21.81.1H376A/C382A21.80.9H376A/C385A21.91.1H380A/C382A22.11.2H380A/C385A221NS, insoluble protein. Open table in a new tab In a second set of experiments, we overexpressed and purified p44 variants where conserved cysteines and histidines were mutated to alanine. Their metal content was then analyzed using mass spectrometry and through chemical modification experiments (Fig. 2 and Table II). Mutation of His-275 and Cys-299 does not modify the zinc content of p44(252–320), whereas mutations at positions Cys-291, Cys-294, Cys-305, and Cys-308 yield an overexpressed insoluble protein. These data suggest that these four cysteine residues are putative zinc ligands. Mutations in p44(321–395) at positions Cys-345, Cys-348, Cys-368, or Cys-371 alter the zinc content of the protein, leading to the loss of one zinc atom. Mutations of Cys-360 and Cys-363 make the protein insoluble, thus providing evidence for the structural role of these cysteine residues. Mutations of His-376, His-380, Cys-382, and Cys-385 residues do not alter the zinc content nor the solubility of the protein. However, a double mutation at position His-376/His-380 results in an insoluble polypeptide. It was also found that the non-conserved Cys-381 did not substitute for zinc binding (data not shown), nor did the conserved His-324. Together, these data suggest that Cys-345, Cys-348, Cys-360, Cys-363, Cys-368, Cys-371, and at least one histidine (His-376 or His-380) are involved in the coordination sphere of the two zinc atoms in p44(321–395).Three-dimensional Solution Structure of p44(321–395)The three-dimensional structure of p44(321–395) was determined by NMR spectroscopy using both unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled protein (“Experimental Procedures”). Backbone and side chain protons are assigned for 72 residues out of the 75. One unique set of resonance is observed for all residues; however, line broadening is found to occur for some residues located in the carboxyl and amino termini of the sequence. This phenomenon is due to an intermediate time scale conformational exchange and leads to a complete coalescence of resonances for amino-terminal residues including histidines 323 and 324. A significant line broadening is also found to affect carboxyl-terminal residues located in the vicinity of zinc binding site. Large line-widths are found for amide protons of serine 378 and glycine 383, which are bracketed by residues potentially involved in the binding of the zinc atom (His-376 to His-380 and Cys-382 to Cys-385, respectively). This dynamic behavior affects the structure precision of the tail residues of p44(321–395) but not those located in the core of the structure (Fig.4 A). Structure calculations were performed using dynamic simulated annealing using 456 intra-residual, 382 medium, and 244 long range restraints (Fig.4 A) to generate a set of 50 structures, 23 being retained and shown in the stereo view (Fig. 4 B) (See “Experimental Procedures” and Table III).Figure 4Solution structure of p44(321–395).

Open table in a new tab The p44(321–395) core domain consists of a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet packed against a small α-helix, the carboxyl terminus being spatially close to the amino terminus (Fig.4 C, left). Residues Gln-332 to Ile-334, Val-357 to Val-359, and Val-366 to Cys-368 form strands β1, β2, and β3, respectively. One face of the β-sheet is partially covered by the α-helix, the other by a loop that begins with one turn of a 310 helix. The domain is stabilized by two small clusters of buried and partially buried hydrophobic residues located on both sides of the β-sheet. The first cluster includes the conserved aromatic residues Phe-331, Tyr-346, Tyr-358, and Phe-367, stabilizing the face covered by the α-helix. The second cluster located on the other face consists of Tyr-339, Val-357, Val-359, and Val-368. The well defined compact core of p44(321–395) domain partially exposes conserved hydrophobic residues including Phe-331 and Ile-334, located on β1. The three-dimensional distribution of charges at the protein surface reveals that the conserved negatively charged residues Glu-333, Asp-370, Asp-372, and Asp-377 are grouped on one side of the molecule (Fig. 4 C, right). Two of them, Asp-370 and Asp-372, are located on the α-helix and are part of the conserved motif CX 2 CX 2–4FCADCD that is a defining feature of p44.As inferred from spatial localization of conserved cysteines and histidines, p44(321–395) possesses two independent zinc binding sites that are separated by 14 Å and located on the face of the β sheet covered by the α-helix. The first zinc binding site (ZNI), organized into a C4 type, is composed of the first pair and the third pair of conserved cysteines (Cys-345/Cys-348 and Cys-368/Cys-371). When mutated, these residues prevent zinc binding. The second zinc binding site (ZNII) involves the cysteine residues Cys-360 and Cys-363 together with His-376 and His-380, which are the best candidates for the zinc binding ligands on the basis of the observed NOE. The possible presence of a minor conformation involving one of the two cysteines Cys-382 or Cys-385 could not be discarded and may be responsible of the localized line broadening.p44(321–395) and PKC Exhibit a Similar Three-dimensional FoldA data base search for structural homologues of p44(321–395) using the DALI program revealed significant homologies (Z-score > 3) with other proteins that bind two zinc atoms: the cysteine-rich domain of protein kinase C (PKC) (39Hommel U.

Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The domains of PKC and Vps27p are involved in binding phorbol ester and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, respectively. The serine/threonine kinases PKC and Raf-1 play a role in signal transduction; Vps27p is involved in membrane trafficking within the cell.The p44(321–395) domain and the cysteine-rich domains of PKC or Raf-1 share the same topology with three anti-parallel β strands covered by an α helix (Fig. 5 A). When their Cα atoms are superimposed, both the secondary structure elements and the two zinc atoms match. The structural homology between p44(321–395) and PKC/Raf-1 spreads over 39 and 36 Cα atoms with a root mean square deviation value of 1.41 and 1.94 Å, respectively; the ligand binding loop of PKC is not included. The homology between p44(321–395) and Vps27p includes the β2/β3 hairpin and the β1/β2 hairpin, respectively (Fig. 5 B). This substructure also exists within RING finger domains, GATA-1, the second unit of LIM domains, and the first zinc binding site of nuclear receptors (43Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). All these domains have a β hairpin that corresponds to the β2/β3 strands of p44(321–395) as well as a zinc binding site equivalent to the ZNI site in p44(321–395). The p44(321–395) domain, the cysteine-rich domains of PKC/Raf-1, the Vps27p FYVE domain, and RING domains all possess two interleaved zinc binding sites separated by approximately 14 Å, which are built on a common scaffold. ZNI site of the p44(321–395) domain is conserved with fully superimposable zinc ligands, whereas the ZNII site remains specific for each protein family (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Structural neighbors of p44(321–395).

This domain binds exactly three zinc atoms via specific cysteine and histidine residues through two independent modules. The first contains a C4 zinc binding motif, whereas the second is characterized by a CX 2 CX 2–4FCADCD motif. In addition, the determined solution structure of the second module reveals homologies with interleaved zinc binding domains.How is the cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of p44 involved in TFIIH transcriptional activity?

The p44 protein is a subunit of TFIIH, a stable macromolecular assembly known to interact with both proteins and DNA. The charge distribution of p44(321–395) rules out a possible role in the recognition of DNA via the α-helix as observed in the structurally related GATA-1 zinc fingers. The conserved solvent-accessible hydrophobic conserved residues in p44(321–395) three-dimensional structure suggest a role in protein-protein interactions. This is supported by the fact that the p44 subunit likely nucleates the formation of TFIIH complex through interaction with p34, p62, XPB (14Iyer N. Reagan M.S. Wu K.J. Canagarajah B. Friedberg E.C.

Importantly, repolymerization of the microfilaments in the absence of thyroid hormone does not alter D2 turnover or activate the actin-based endocytosis of D2-containing vesicles (5Farwell A.P.

Inhibitor studies showed that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by dihydrocytochalasin or depletion of cellular ATP stores block the T4-induced loss of D2 (4Leonard J.L. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Zuckerman C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 940-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that intact microfilaments and an energy source are required for the dynamic regulation of the turnover of this membrane-bound enzyme. One of the first steps in the T4-dependent regulation of astrocyte D2 activity is the hormone-induced binding of D2-containing vesicles to filamentous actin (F-actin). This is rapidly followed by the translocation of the actin-bound vesicle to the perinuclear space (5Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin motor proteins mediate the translocation of vesicle on actin fibers. Myosins comprise a superfamily of actin-binding, Mg2+-ATPase, motor proteins (11Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and unconventional myosins are found in virtually all cell types, where they participate in cell contraction, cell motility, and vesicle trafficking (12Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Four unconventional myosin family members (I, V, VI, and VII) have been reported to participate in membrane trafficking (12Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar,13Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Myosin V is the most abundant of this subset in brain, where it is found to be associated with vesicles in nerve terminals (13Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Myosin V forms calcium-dependent complexes with the synaptic vesicle proteins, synaptobrevin and synaptophysin (14Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although this motor protein does not appear to associate with the mature synaptic vesicle, ultrastructure analysis showed that larger-sized, SV2-positive vesicles in the synapse were decorated with myosin V (15Evans L.L. Lee A.J. Bridgman P.C. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2055-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that myosin V is bound to endosomes and/or to recycling synaptic vesicles (16Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr D.W. Mooseker M.S. Jercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the participation of myosin V in the thyroid hormone-dependent binding of D2-containing vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton. Using both the native, affinity-radiolabeled D2, and exogenous expression of a GFP-tagged D2 fusion protein, we show that an actin-bound protein with calcium-dependent ATPase activity tethers the D2-containing endosome to F-actin. Deletion analysis and antibody inhibition studies showed that the COOH-terminal 21 amino acids anchored the D2 vesicle to the myosin motor in a hormone-dependent manner. These data suggest that the processive myosin V motor participates in the T4-dependent actin-based endocytosis of D2. T4, Triton X-100, ATP, Bt2cAMP, hydrocortisone, colchicine, bovine serum albumin, and rabbit anti-actin IgG were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). DMEM, antibiotics, Hanks' solution, and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Acrylamide was purchased from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA).

The TNT-coupled transcription-translation kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Astrocytes were prepared from 1-day-old neonatal rats as described previously (18Leonard J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and grown in growth medium composed of DMEM supplemented with 10% supplemented bovine calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 90 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 culture flasks in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C and used at passages 1–3. Cell lysates with intact microfilaments (F-lysate) were prepared from thyroid hormone-deficient astrocytes treated for 24 h with 10 μm retinoic acid in serum free media as detailed previously (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates with BrAc[125I]T4-labeled p29 vesicles (V-lysate) were prepared from cAMP-stimulated astrocytes in serum free media that were labeled with 2 nmBrAc[125I]T4 as described previously (5Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microtubules were depolymerized in all cells using 10 μmcolchicine for 30 min before cell isolation. Cells were then scraped from the flask, collected by centrifugation (500 × gfor 5 min), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and the cell pellets were lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles (5Farwell A.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates could be stored at −70 °C for up to 4 weeks without loss of hormone-dependent actin binding. F- and V-lysates (100 μg of cell protein each) were combined on ice, 10 nm T4, 10 nm rT3, or 10 nm T3 were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Mixtures were then chilled on ice for 2 min, Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v, final concentration) was added, and the soluble (Triton supernatant) and particulate (Triton pellet) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 65,000 ×g·min. The distribution of 125I-labeled p29 between the Triton supernatant and Triton pellet was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the last 22 amino acids COOH-terminal to myosin V (NH2-YSLALETIQIPASLGLGFIARV-COOH) were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Core at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. An NH2-terminal tyrosine was added to facilitate diaminobenzidine coupling to KLH and for radioiodination. The peptide-KLH conjugate (750 μg of KLH conjugate/500 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant and injected intradermally at 20 sites on the back of 2.2-kg female New Zealand white rabbits. Antibodies were also raised against an internal myosin V domain corresponding to the last IQ domain and the coiled-coil region (residues 892 to 1040, myosin Vmid). Polymerase chain reaction amplified myosin V cDNA was prepared using site-specific, 20-mer oligonucleotides and the ∼500-bp fragment was cloned into theEcoRV site of the pThioHis B prokaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The fusion protein was synthesized in isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducedEscherichia coli. The myosin Vmid fusion protein was purified on Ni-Sepharose from cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 75 μg of myosin Vmid was diluted 50:50 with complete Freund's adjuvant used to immunize rabbits as described above. The specificity of the two rabbit anti-myosin V antisera was documented by immunoblot analysis. Brain homogenates were prepared from normal, heterozygous (myosin V+/−) and myosin V-deficient, homozygous dilute mouse (myosin V−/−). Both antibodies recognized a 190-kDa protein in the brain homogenates containing myosin V (heterozygotes) but showed no immunoreactive band in the homogenates of dilute mouse brain that lacks myosin V (Fig. 1).Figure 1Characterization of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against myosin V. 50-μg aliquots of myosin V enriched vesicle protein prepared from cerebella of normal (±) ordilute lethal (−/−) mice were separated on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond. Blots were probed with antibodies specific for the COOH terminus (A) or the coiled-coil (B) region of myosin V ± 10 μg/ml blocking peptide, as indicated. Immune complexes were detected by chemiluminescence as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Total cell protein was measured by the Bradford dye binding assay (Sigma), and 20–50 μg of cellular protein was reduced, denatured, and separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond membranes by electrotransfer using a semidry transfer apparatus (200 mA for 1 h). The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) and 5% powdered milk (w/v). Immunoblots were then probed with primary antibodies (1:500 for anti-myosin V antisera; 2 μg/ml for anti-GFP IgG) for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing, immune complexes were detected with HRP-conjugated, goat, anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 final dilution), and the specific complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence and Kodak X-Omat AR5 radiographic film. The 3280-bp fragment containing the coding sequence of the globular myosin V tail cDNA (myosin Vtail) was excised from clone D64 (a gift from Dr. Nancy Jenkins, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) with SspI and Eco47III and ligated into the EcoRV site of the AdpREC shuttle vector. The shuttle construct was linearized with EcoRI and cotransfected with Xba-ClaI linearized Ad5-βgal into HEK 293 cells using Lipofect AMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Replication-deficient Ad5-myoV-containing virus particles were purified from the HEK-293 cell lysates by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Expression of myosin V from Ad5-myoV-infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The Ad5-p29GFP virus particles were generated as detailed previously (20Leonard D.M. Stachelek S.J.

Astrocytes were seeded onto poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml)-coated coverslips and grown for 24–48 h in growth medium. Medium was changed to serum-free DMEM ± 10 nm T4 and treated with 1 mmBt2cAMP, 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid, and 100 nm hydrocortisone for 16 h. Microtubules were depolymerized with 10 μm colchicine for 30 min before fixation. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with anti-myosin V antisera (COOH terminus, 1:500), and immune complexes were visualized using a Texas Red-conjugated, anti-rabbit IgG. Images were collected by digital imaging microscopy in the Biomedical Imaging Facility at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. 20–50 random fields were examined per treatment group. All experiments were done a minimum of three times, and, where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Myosin V comprises ∼0.3% of total protein in brain. To determine the myosin V content in cultured astrocytes, we examined untreated and T4-treated cells for the presence and distribution of myosin V using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 2 A, >90% of the 190-kDa, immunoreactive myosin V was found in the Triton-insoluble pellets prepared from retinoid-treated astrocytes in the absence or presence of T4. Preincubation of the anti-myosin V antibody with excess blocking peptide (10 μg/ml) eliminated the 190-kDa immunoreactive band (see Fig. 1), indicating that the myosin V present in astrocytes is predominantly associated with the F-actin cytoskeleton. Also shown in Fig.2 A is the distribution of immunoreactive actin between the Triton supernatant and Triton pellet from retinoid-treated astrocytes that were grown in the absence and presence of T4. No differences in total actin content were observed, and >90% of the immunoreactive actin was found in the Triton-insoluble pellet in both thyroid hormone-deficient and T4-treated cells as determined by densitometry (data not shown). In control experiments, no specific immune complexes were observed in the 200-kDa range of immunoblots of astrocyte cell lysate, indicating that the anti-actin IgG did not cross-react with myosin V (data not shown). These data illustrate that, as reported previously (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar), the retinoid-treated, thyroid hormone-deficient astrocyte contained a fully polymerized actin cytoskeleton and indicate that myosin V is constitutively bound to F-actin. Fig. 2 B shows representative photomicrographs of the cellular distribution of immunoreactive myosin V in retinoid-treated astrocytes treated in the absence and presence of 10 nm T4. Specific immunoreactive myosin V was found distributed throughout the cell in linear arrays and punctate clusters both in the absence and in the presence of T4. These data show that astrocytes express abundant myosin V and that thyroid hormone does not affect the distribution of myosin V in the cell. T4 specifically promotes the rapid redistribution of affinity-labeled p29 between the Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions in living cells (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). We exploited this to develop an in vitro binding assay to identify the components that mediate the hormone-dependent binding of the p29-containing vesicles to F-actin. Two different pools of astrocytes were prepared: one, the F-lysate, provided fully polymerized F-actin with its associated myosin V and was prepared by treating thyroid hormone-deficient astrocytes with 10 μmretinoic acid as described previously (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). The other, V-lysate, provided the affinity-labeled p29 vesicles in thyroid hormone-deficient astrocytes (5Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows a representative fluorograph of the effects of thyroid hormone on the distribution of affinity-labeled p29 vesicles in our in vitro actin-binding assay. As expected, comparable levels of affinity-labeled p29 were present in the lysate mixtures, as judged by the intensity of the lower band of the doublet of radiolabeled proteins at a region of ∼30 kDa (21Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of hormone, >90% of the affinity-labeled p29 was found in the Triton supernatant. Addition of 10 nm T3 to the mixed cell lysates had no effect on the distribution of affinity-labeled p29, because >90% of the affinity-labeled p29 remained in the Triton-soluble fraction. In contrast, addition of 10 nm T4 to the mixed cell lysates resulted in the binding of >70% of the affinity-labeled p29 to the Triton-insoluble, F-actin fraction. These data show that the T4-dependent binding of the p29 vesicle to the actin cytoskeleton in a broken cell preparation mimics that observed in the living astrocyte (5Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the in vitro actin binding assay showed that T4 can initiate the binding of p29 endosomes to F-actin, whether this is a direct interaction between the vesicle and F-actin or is mediated by other actin-bound proteins, such as myosin V, remains to be established. A characteristic of myosin V is the ability to release the motor from F-actin by activating the Ca2+-dependent Mg-ATPase found in the actin binding head of myosin V (14Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 22Nascimento A.A.C. Cheney R.E. Tauhata S.B.F. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17561-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We next examined whether activating the Ca2+-dependent Mg-ATPase would release p29 vesicles bound to F-actin. Equal volumes of F-lysate and V-lysate were mixed, and p29 vesicle:F-actin binding was initiated by adding 10 nm T4 for 20 min. The reconstituted lysates were then treated with 0.1 mmCa2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 0.1 mmATP, and/or 5 mm EGTA as indicated and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. Triton-insoluble pellets were separated from the Triton-soluble fraction, and the distribution of p29 was determined. As shown in Fig. 4, ∼80% of the total p29 vesicles added were bound to F-actin at the start of the experiment. Activation of Ca2+-dependent Mg-ATPase(s) by the addition of divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2) and ATP resulted in the release of ∼70% of the p29 vesicles from F-actin without altering the F-actin content in the Triton pellet. The calcium chelator, EGTA, blocked >50% of release of p29 from F-actin. Similarly, removing the substrate, ATP, or either divalent ion completely blocked the release of p29 vesicles from F-actin. These data suggest that myosin motor protein(s), presumably myosin V, participate in the binding of the p29 vesicle to F-actin. Although the actin binding region of myosin V is located at the NH2 terminus of the protein, the vesicle binding region of myosin V appears to be located in the unique ∼80-kDa globular tail (14Prekeris R. Terrian D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the next series of studies, we generated truncation mutants of myosin V that lack the actin-binding head and examined the ability of these myosin V tail mutants to compete with the native, F-actin-bound myosin V for the p29 vesicles. Initial studies used the entire COOH terminus of myosin V synthesized in vitro from a 4.2-kb fragment (nucleotide 2911–7087) of the myosin V cDNA (Δ myosin Vtail) using the coupled transcription and translation system (TNT, Promega). Cell-free synthesis of the appropriate myosin V mutant was confirmed by immunoblot, and an 88-kDa band was detected using anti-myosin V antibodies directed against the COOH-terminal 21 amino acids (Fig.5, inset). Increasing volumes (5 or 10 μl) of Δ myosin Vtail or a comparable volume of control reticulocyte lysate were added to the in vitroactin binding assay and preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Actin binding of the p29 vesicles was then initiated by 10 nmT4. As illustrated in Fig. 5, addition of 5 μl of Δ myosin Vtail blocked ∼50% of the T4-dependent binding of p29 vesicles to F-actin, whereas 10 μl of Δ myosin Vtail blocked >95% of the p29 binding. In control actin binding assays, addition of up to 10 μl of the reticulocyte lysate failed to affect the T4-dependent p29 vesicle binding to F-actin. These data indicate that the tail region of myosin V competes with the wild type motor and blocks the T4-dependent binding of p29 vesicles to F-actin. Based on the dominant negative effect of the Δ myosin V tail on p29 vesicle binding in vitro, we created a series of deletion mutations to define the specific region(s) of myosin V tail that interact with the p29 vesicle. To simplify the analysis of the competition of the myosin V deletion mutations on T4-dependent binding of p29 vesicles to F-actin, we modified the in vitro assay by replacing the affinity-labeled p29 with a GFP-tagged p29 fusion protein (p29GFP) (5Farwell A.P. Lynch R.M. Okulicz W.C. Comi A.M. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18546-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Farwell A.P. DiBenedetto D.J. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5055-5062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This allowed direct evaluation of the binding of fluorescent vesicles to F-actin without affinity labeling of the p29 or SDS-PAGE analysis. Exogenous p29GFP was introduced into the astrocytes used to prepare the V-lysate by infection with replication-deficient Ad5-p29GFP virus particles. 48 hours after infection, >99% of the infected astrocytes expressed the p29GFP. Cells expressing the p29GFP were then used to prepare the V-lysate as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Equal volumes of F-lysate and V-lysate containing p29GFP-labeled vesicles were incubated with increasing concentrations of T4, rT3, or T3 (0–100 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C, and the quantity of p29GFP in the Triton pellets was determined by fluorometry. Fig.6 shows representative dose-response curves for thyroid hormone-dependent p29GFPvesicle binding to F-actin. As expected, both T4 and rT3 initiated increases in the quantity of p29GFP bound to the F-actin with EC50 values of ∼1 nm, in close agreement to those reported previously (10Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar). T3 had little, if any, effect on p29GFPvesicle binding to F-actin, except for a modest 10–20% effect observed at 100 nm T3, the highest concentration of hormone used. To determine if the Δ myosin V tail was directly bound to the p29 vesicle, we introduced a Δ myosin Vtail into p29GFP-expressing astrocytes by infection with Ad5-ΔmyoVtail virus particles and examined the effects of T4 on the binding of the myosin Vtail to immunopurified p29GFP vesicles. Cells were treated with or without 10 nm T4 for 20 min, and the cell was lysed with 0.1% Triton. Vesicles containing the p29GFP in the clarified extract were immunoprecipitated by anti-GFP IgG (2 μg/ml), and those in the immunoprecipitated vesicles were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Shown in Fig. 7 is a representative immunoblot of Δ myosin Vtail associated with affinity-purified vesicles from control p29GFP cells and from p29GFP cells expressing the Δ myosin Vtail. In control cells, no myosin V immunoreactive protein(s) was detected in the purified vesicle pool, because the native, F-actin bound myosin V was removed during clarification. In contrast, the Δ myosin Vtail showed a T4-dependent association with the p29GFP vesicle, as judged by the co-purification of this 88-kDa immunoreactive band. These data show that the direct interaction between the p29 vesicle and myos"

An affinity labeling approach has been implemented to probe the interactions of the neuropeptide with the receptor using the photolabile nociceptin derivative, [p-benzoyl-l-Phe10,Tyr14]nociceptin ([Bpa10,Tyr14]noc). In recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human ORL1 receptor, [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc binds the receptor with high affinity (Ki ∼0.7 nm) and is as potent as nociceptin in the inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP synthesis (EC50 ∼0.5 nm). UV irradiation at 365 nm of the complex formed by the ORL1 receptor and radioiodinated [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc results in the irreversible labeling of a glycoprotein of ∼65 kDa, determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complete digestion of the partially purified 65-kDa complex with kallikrein generates a single labeled fragment (∼6.5 kDa) that is readily cleaved by endoproteinase Glu-C to yield a labeled fragment of ∼3.2 kDa. Kallikrein treatment of the photoaffinity cross-linked Glu295 → Asp mutant receptor also yields a single labeled fragment of ∼6.5 kDa but is resistant to further cleavage by endoproteinase Glu-C. Based upon the expected proteolytic fingerprint of the labeled receptor, the photoreactive region can be identified as ORL1-(296–302; residues Thr-Ala-Val-Ala-Ile-Leu-Arg) spanning the C terminus of extracellular loop 3 and the N terminus of transmembrane helix VII. Molecular modeling of the ORL1 receptor complex with [Bpa10]noc suggests that reaction of the Bpa carbonyl group may occur with the side chain of Ile300 within the experimentally identified photoreactive region.

Based upon the expected proteolytic fingerprint of the labeled receptor, the photoreactive region can be identified as ORL1-(296–302; residues Thr-Ala-Val-Ala-Ile-Leu-Arg) spanning the C terminus of extracellular loop 3 and the N terminus of transmembrane helix VII. Molecular modeling of the ORL1 receptor complex with [Bpa10]noc suggests that reaction of the Bpa carbonyl group may occur with the side chain of Ile300 within the experimentally identified photoreactive region. nociceptin p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine bovine serum albumin Chinese hamster ovary Hartree-Fock human opioid receptor-like 1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-[12-hydroxy-1,1-bis-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl Nociceptin (Phe-Gly-Gly-Phe-Thr-Gly-Ala-Arg-Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Ala-Asn-Gln, noc)1 (1Meunier J.-C.

Nociceptin bears structural resemblance to opioid peptides, particularly dynorphin A, the presumed natural agonist of the κ-opioid receptor. The peptide has been variously shown to modulate nociception, locomotion, stress and anxiety, food intake, neuroendocrine secretion, learning and memory, drug addiction, and smooth musculature tone in the cardiovascular system and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts (see Refs. 4Henderson G.

The broad pharmacological spectrum of nociceptin suggests that ORL1 receptor agonists and/or antagonists may find several therapeutic applications, for example as analgesics or nootropic agents (7Meunier J.-C. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents. 2000; 10: 371-388Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An understanding of the underlying molecular basis of how nociceptin binds and activates the ORL1 receptor is of key importance in the rational design of new pharmacophores.

Screening of a combinatorial library, however, has uncovered hexapeptides that are as potent ORL1 receptor agonists as nociceptin (14Dooley C.T. Spaeth C.G. Berzetei-Gurske I.P. Craymer K. Adapa I.D. Brandt S.R. Houghten R.A. Toll L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 735-741PubMed Google Scholar). Although these hexapeptides, Ac-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-(Arg/Lys)-(Ile/Trp)-(Arg/Lys)-NH2, bear little obvious sequence similarity with nociceptin, the three positively charged amino acid residues may mimic the electrostatic properties of the basic noc-(8–13) sequence. Consistent with other observations that the second, highly negatively charged exofacial loop of the receptor is required for activation (15Lapalu S. Moisand C. Butour J.-L. Mollereau C. Meunier J.-C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Mollereau C. Moulédous L. Lapalu S. Cambois G. Moisand C. Butour J.-L. Meunier J.-C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the positively charged Arg8-Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Lys nociceptin core is necessary for biological activity. We have proposed a molecular model of the ORL1 receptor complex with nociceptin (17Topham C.M. Moulédous L. Poda G. Maigret B. Meunier J.-C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1163-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in which noc-(8–13) engages in multiple electrostatic interactions with the second exofacial receptor loop, and the N-terminal Phe1-Gly-Gly-Phe tetrapeptide, which closely resembles the Tyr1-Gly-Gly-Phe opioid “message” sequence, binds in a structurally conserved transmembrane cavity formed by helices III and V–VII. Here we have sought to probe the model experimentally by covalent modification of the ORL1 receptor with a synthetic photoactivable analogue of nociceptin, [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc. The Bpa-based photoaffinity labeling approach (18Dormán G. Prestwich G.D.

We report the specific reaction of125I-labeled [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc with the ORL1 receptor sequence (Thr296-Ala-Val-Ala-Ile-Leu-Arg302), comprising the C terminus of extracellular loop 3 and the N terminus of transmembrane helix VII. Molecular modeling of the [Bpa10]noc·ORL1 receptor complex directly based on our nociceptin·ORL1 model complex (17Topham C.M. Moulédous L. Poda G. Maigret B. Meunier J.-C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1163-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) predicts the Bpa side chain to bind in a pocket formed by the second and third extracellular loops. The reactive Bpa ketone oxygen is able to make Van der Waals contact with the side chain of Ile300, which lies within the experimentally identified photoreactive region of the receptor. These data lend strong support in favor of the correct positioning and orientation of the nociceptin Ser10 side chain in the original model and are thus also consistent with the proposed participation of the flanking positively charged side chains of the neuropeptide in a hydrogen bonding network with the negatively charged side chains of the second extracellular loop of the receptor (17Topham C.M. Moulédous L. Poda G. Maigret B. Meunier J.-C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1163-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All were of the highest grade available. Fmoc-p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine was purchased from Bachem. Staphylococcus aureus (strain V) endoproteinase Glu-C (EC 3.4.21.19) and porcine pancreatic kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.35) were from Sigma. Flavobacterium meningosepticumpeptide:N-glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52) was from New England BioLabs. [Bpa10,Tyr14]Noc was synthesized using standard Fmoc solid phase strategy on Wang resin. The synthetic peptide was >95% pure, as assessed by semi-preparative, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and had the expected mass, as assessed by electron-spray ionization mass spectrometry. Radioiodination of [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc was performed using immobilized N-chloro-benzenesulfonamide (IODO-BEADS®, Pierce) as oxidizing agent, as originally described by Markwell (32Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Typically, two beads were washed in 0.5 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 6.8), dried, and incubated for 5 min with 1 mCi of Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) in 0.2 ml of phosphate buffer. Ten nmol (10 μl) of [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for a further 5 min. The solution was removed and loaded onto an HPLC semi-preparative C18 column. Elution with acetonitrile (25–60%, v/v; 30 ml) in 0.08% TFA was performed at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and radioactivity was counted in a Cobra Auto-Gamma (Packard) counter. A single symmetrical peak of bound radioactivity, corresponding to the mono-iodinated peptide derivative (specific radioactivity, ∼2,000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) eluted just behind [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc, used as a reference. The radioactive fractions were pooled, evaporated under a nitrogen stream, and brought to the desired concentration with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with proteinase-free BSA (0.1 mg/ml). Recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the human ORL1 receptor (∼20 pmol/mg membrane protein) were engineered and selected for and grown in culture essentially as described previously (3Mollereau C. Parmentier M. Mailleux P. Butour J.-L. Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.-C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Mutant ORL1-(Glu295 → Asp) was obtained by introduction of the appropriate point mutation in the Bluescript SK+/hORL1 construct using mutated oligonucleotides (Genosys Biotech), the ExSite PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), as described previously (33Moulédous L. Topham C.M. Moisand C. Mollereau C. Meunier J.-C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutant construct was subcloned in pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), and the recombinant vector was used to transfect COS-7 cells (see Ref. 3Mollereau C. Parmentier M. Mailleux P. Butour J.-L. Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.-C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar for details). The cells were harvested, frozen at −70 °C for at least 1 h, and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. The nuclear pellet was discarded by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, and the crude membrane fraction was collected upon centrifugation at 100,000 ×g (3Mollereau C. Parmentier M. Mailleux P. Butour J.-L. Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.-C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 25 °C in polypropylene tubes. Custom-labeled [3H]nociceptin ([3H]noc, 23 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for competition binding studies, and 125I-labeled [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc (∼ 2,000 Ci/mmol, this study) was used in saturation binding experiments. CHO[hORL1] cell membranes (5–30 μg) were incubated for 1 h with 1 nm [3H]noc and a variable concentration of unlabeled ligand or with increasing concentrations of125I-labeled [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc, in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with proteinase-free BSA (0.1 mg/ml) to avoid tube wall adsorption of the radioligand. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled nociceptin. Bound radioligand was collected by filtration on polyethyleneimine-treated glass fiber filters (GF/B; Whatman), and radioactivity was counted in a Packard model 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer. The competition data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope parameter using the Prism program (GraphPad software). Slope factors close to unity indicated homogenous binding site populations in the membrane preparations examined. IC50 values (the concentration of inhibitor giving half-maximal specific binding of radio-ligand) were converted to Ki values using the Cheng and Prussof (34Cheng Y.-C. Prussof W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar) equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + ([L]/Kd), where [L] and Kdare the concentration and dissociation constant of radioligand, respectively. Sterile hemolysis tubes were seeded with 2 × 105 recombinant cells in culture medium and incubated for approximately 16 h at 37 °C. The culture medium was removed, and 200 μl of fresh medium containing 0.1 μm adenine and 0.6 μCi of [3H]adenine (24 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. After 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were rinsed with 400 μl of Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer saline (KRH, 124 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm Hepes, 8 mm glucose, 0.5 mg/ml BSA; pH 7.4), and 180 μl of fresh KRH was added to each tube. Intracellular accumulation of cAMP was initiated by the addition of 100 μm forskolin (Sigma), 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), 1 mm Ro20-1724 (Biomol), and the ligand(s) to be tested at the desired concentration in 20 μl of KRH. The reaction was stopped after exactly 10 min at 37 °C by the addition of 20 μl of HCl 2.2 n and rapid mixing (Vortex). The [3H]cAMP content of each tube was determined by selective batch elution on acidic alumina columns, essentially as described by Alvarez and Daniels (35Alvarez R. Daniels D.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope parameter using Prism. The crude membrane fraction (50–100 μg of protein) from CHO[hORL1] or COS(hORL1-(Glu295 → Asp)) cells and freshly prepared 125I-labeled [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc (5–10 × 106 cpm) were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in polypropylene hemolysis tubes, with no other addition or in the presence of 1 μm nociceptin. The contents of each tube were then transferred to a 24-well Nunclon plate and UV-irradiated at 365 nm and ∼10 milliwatts/cm2 for 1 h at 4 °C, using a Black Ray lamp (model B-100 AP, Ultraviolet Products). The labeled membrane preparations were then recovered by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol), and stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The labeled membrane suspension was heated at 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis in 1.5-mm 8% acrylamide gels according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The gel was then vacuum-dried on filter paper and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat), with two intensifying screens, for 18 h at −70 °C. The radioactive band was excised from the dried gel and immersed in 6 ml of 0.1% (w/v) SDS in 100 mmNH4HCO3 buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0). Extraction was performed over 4 days with constant shaking at 4 °C. The eluate (6 ml + 10 ml buffer rinse) was filtered through 0.22-μm Minisart (Sartorius) membranes, and concentrated to 0.2–0.3 ml by centrifugation in Centricon-20 tubes. Samples were then twice desalted by dilution with 15 ml of water and re-centrifugation. Recovery of radioactivity was in the range 70–80%. Proteins were precipitated (5 h at −20 °C) in 80% (v/v) acetone, dried, and stored at −80 °C for further use. The dry acetone precipitate (see above) was dissolved in 25 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 500 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F was added. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 5 h at 37 °C, at which point a 25-μl aliquot of 2× concentrated Laemmli (sample) buffer was added, and the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 1.5-mm 8% acrylamide gels. The dry acetone precipitate was dissolved in 20–50 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS prior to treatment with endoproteinase Glu-C, or 100 mm Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 for treatment with kallikrein. Samples were incubated with either endoproteinase Glu-C for 4 days at 20 °C or kallikrein for 2 h at 37 °C. They were then diluted with an equal volume of 2× concentrated sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) Bleu Serva, and 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol), heated to 65 °C for 10 min, and electrophoresed in Tris/Tricine 16% gels (NOVEX), according to Schägger and von Jagow (37Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The anode buffer was 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, and the cathode buffer was 100 mm Tris/Tricine, pH 8.25, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The non-covalent complex formed by the receptor with [Bpa10]noc was built from the coordinates of our model of the nociceptin·ORL1 receptor complex (17Topham C.M. Moulédous L. Poda G. Maigret B. Meunier J.-C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1163-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Initial inspection of possible χ1 side chain rotamers (see Fig.1 A) revealed torsion angles of −60° or +60° to result in severe steric clashes with the receptor, and in the latter case with the peptide main chain also. The Bpa χ1 side chain torsion angle was therefore set to 180°, compatible with the main chain conformational class at position 10 (see Ref. 17Topham C.M. Moulédous L. Poda G. Maigret B. Meunier J.-C. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1163-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The complex was then energy-minimized to a final convergence gradient of 0.1 kcal mol−1Å−1. Some manual intervention and limited reconstruction of the second and third extracellular loops was required to avoid trapping of the complex in high energy local minima. Interactive graphics manipulations were performed using the SYBYL (version 6.5) software package (Tripos Inc.). Energy minimization was carried out using the SYBYL implementation of the Powell torsional gradient algorithm and the AMBER 1986 all-atom force field of Weineret al. (38Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3597) Google Scholar), extended as described below to accommodate Bpa. The electrostatic model comprised a distance-dependent dielectric constant with a non-bonded cut-off of 8 Å and an ε value of 4. A total of six additional harmonic constraints of 1 kcal mol−1 were applied to prevent buckling of the Bpa ring systems in response to external forces. All the Bpa residue atoms can be represented by the AMBER atom types defined in the Weineret al. (38Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3597) Google Scholar) force field (see Fig. 1 B). Most parameters in the potential function could therefore be abstracted directly from the all-atom protein set. Assignment of the remaining terms was assisted by ab initio quantum mechanical calculations on the model compound, 4-methyl-benzophenone (Fig.1 C) using GAUSSIAN 94 (39). In order for the sum of the three equilibrium bond angle (θ0) values used to describe the angular geometry around the ketone carbon to be 360°, θ0 for CA−C−O was set to 120°, with an associated force constant (Kθ) of 85 kcal mol−1 radian−2, equal to that for the CA−C−CA bond angle. The average value for the two CA−C−O angles in the HF/6-31G* geometry-optimized 4-methyl-benzophenone structure was 119.7 ± 0.1°, and the CA−C−CA bond angle was 120.6°. An improper dihedral angle term for the CA−CA−CA−C atom quartet was also added to the potential function with Vn/2 = 2 kcal mol−1, γ = 180°, and multiplicity,n = 2. Partial charges for the Bpa residue are presented in Fig. 1 B. They were obtained by mapping of charges calculated for 4-methyl-benzophenone onto the side chain benzophenone moiety, and re-distribution of the excess charge required for neutrality onto the Cβ, Hβ1, and Hβ2 Bpa bridge atoms according to the (C + H): H charge ratio in the 4-methyl group of the model compound. The 4-methyl-benzophenone point charge set was calculated by two-stage restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting (40Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5694) Google Scholar). The fit to the 6-31G* quantum mechanical potential was performed using default weights of 0.0005 in the first stage and 0.001 in the second stage in which conformationally interchangeable atoms are equivalenced. The resultant partial charges were then scaled by a factor of 0.91 for a more balanced integration with the Weiner et al. (38Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3597) Google Scholar) charges, derived for the most part using the STO-3G basis set. Conjugate gradient energy minimization of the HF/6-31G* 4-methyl-benzophenone structure to a convergence gradient of <0.001 kcal mol−1 Å−1 was performed as a check on the assigned Bpa force field parameter values. This resulted in a root mean square distance of 0.065 Å for the 14 heavy atoms in the model compound. The angle formed between the two ring systems in the molecular mechanics energy-minimized structure, which may be calculated as the sum of χ3 and χ4 (see Fig. 1 A), was 52.8° as compared with 57.3° (χ3 = −152.9°; χ4 = −149.8°) for the HF/6-31G*-optimized geometry. The choice of [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc as a photoaffinity probe of the ORL1 receptor was guided by observations that (i) various substitutions at position 10 in nociceptin, such as alanine (8Dooley C.T.

Butour, unpublished data. do not significantly affect either binding or biological activity, and (ii) [Tyr14]noc and the mono-iodo-Tyr14 analogue bind and activate the ORL1 receptor with essentially the same affinity and biological potency as nociceptin (2Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc binds the ORL1 receptor with high affinity (Ki ∼0.7 nm). [Bpa10,Tyr14]Noc is also a potent agonist of the ORL1 receptor with an EC50 value of ∼0.5 nm for the inhibition of forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in intact recombinant CHO[hORL1] cells (Fig.2 B). Likewise, binding of 125I-labeled [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc to CHO[hORL1] cell membrane preparations displays a hyperbolic concentration dependence, with a Kd of 0.15 nm (Fig. 2,C and D). UV irradiation of the pre-equilibrated mixture of radioiodinated [Bpa10,Tyr14]noc and CHO[hORL1] cell membranes, followed by solubilization with SDS under reducing conditions and gel electrophoresis, yields a radioactive macromolecular species that migrates as a diffuse band centered at ∼65 kDa (Fig.3). This band is absent when photoactivation is carried out either in the presence of an excess of nociceptin or with membrane preparations from wild-type CHO cells (data not shown), indicating specific irreversible modification of the receptor. Treatment of the photolabeled ORL1 receptor withN-glycosidase F results in a discrete radioactive macromolecular species of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 3), in good agreement with the value calculated from the amino acid sequence of the ORL1 receptor. The receptor thus appears to be heavily glycosylated in CHO[hORL1] cells, consistent with the presence of three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser) in the N-terminal domain (3Mollereau C.

To identify the covalently modified receptor region, the 65-kDa labeled species was recovered and treated with the specific endoproteinases, tissue kallikrein and endoproteinase Glu-C, both separately and in series. Since nociceptin does not possess cleavage sites for these enzymes, digestion of the cross-linked receptor leads to labeled fragments with molecular mass contributions of ∼2.1 kDa from the ligand. Under appropriate conditions, tissue kallikrein (EC"

The importance of CD11a/CD18 for leukocyte extravasation is exemplified by the existence of an inherited disease (leukocyte adhesion deficiency) in which leukocytes exhibit a deficient expression of the three leukocyte integrins and the clinical symptoms of which are secondary to the lack of phagocyte migration into inflammatory sites (6Springer T.A.

So far, Sp1- and ets-binding sites have been located within the CD11a proximal promoter (12Shelley C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The members of the polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2)1/core binding factor (CBF)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) family of heterodimeric (α/β) transcription factors play important roles in hematopoiesis and osteogenesis (16Ito Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar). To date, three distinct α subunits (AML-1/CBFα-2/PEBP2α-B, AML-2/CBFα-3/PEBP2α-C, and AML-3/CBFα-1/PEBP2α-A) and one β subunit (CBFβ/PEBP2β) have been reported in mammalian cells (16Ito Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The α subunits exhibit sequence-specific DNA binding ability, whereas the β subunit does not bind to DNA by itself but interacts with the α subunit and increases its DNA binding affinity (18Bae S.-C. Ito Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1213-1221PubMed Google Scholar). The AML-1/CBFβ transcription factor complex is one of the most frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias (17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 18Bae S.-C. Ito Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1213-1221PubMed Google Scholar, 19Speck N.A. Stacy T. Wang Q. North T. Gu T.-L. Miller J. Binder M. Marı́n-Padilla M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 Suppl.: 1789s-1793sGoogle Scholar), as a high percentage of AML and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias have alteredAML1 or CBFβ alleles. Some of these translocations transform AML-1 into a constitutive transcriptional repressor and disrupt normal hematopoietic cell differentiation (17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the identification of acis-acting element (CD11a-110) specifically recognized by members of the PEBP2/CBF/AML family of transcription factors and implicated in the cell-type restricted activity of the CD11a promoter. Our results indicate the involvement of PEBP2/CBF/AML factors in the restricted expression of the CD11a leukocyte integrin and suggest that CD11a/CD18 expression might be deregulated in leukemic cells harboringAML1 or CBFβ gene rearrangements. The cell lines HepG2 (hepatoma), HeLa (epithelial carcinoma), Jurkat (T cell lymphoma), JY (lymphoblastoid B), U937 (histiocytic lymphoma), and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Induction of differentiation of K562 cells was accomplished in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate at 10 ng/ml for 24 h. Transfection in COS-7, HepG2, Jurkat, and K562 cells was performed with Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were carried out using 1 μg of reporter plasmid in 24-well plates and with 4 × 104 (COS-7 and HepG2) or 8–15 × 105 (K562 and Jurkat) cells/well. In all cases, the amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized by using the corresponding insertless expression vectors (CMV-0) as carrier. Each transfection experiment was performed at least three times with different DNA preparations. Transfection efficiencies were normalized by cotransfection with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV-β-galactosidase, and β-galactosidase levels were determined using the Galacto-Light kit (Tropix). The CD11a-based reporter gene construct pCD11A170-Luc, in which the expression of the firefly luciferase cDNA is directed by the CD11a promoter region –170/+83, has been previously described (11Nueda A. Lopez-Cabrera M. Vara A. Corbı́ A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19305-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The promoterless plasmid pXP2 was used as a control in some transfection experiments. Drs. S. Hiebert (Vanderbilt Cancer Center, Nashville, TN), M. A. Vega (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas, Madrid, Spain) and Y. Ito (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) generously provided the expression plasmids CMV-AML1B, CDM8-CBFβ1, and pEF-BOS-αA1 (AML3), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the CD11a promoter construct pCD11A170-Luc using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach. For mutation of the CD11a-110 site, oligonucleotides MS7MUTS ((–120) 5′-CTCCCTGAACCCGAATTCTTTCACAACTCCTG-3′ (–89)) and MS7MUTAS ((–88) 5′-GCAGGAGTTGTGAAAGAATTCGGGTTCAGGGA-3′ (–119)) were synthesized substituting the sequence (–111) 5′-CCCCTGCGGTTT-3′ (–100) for the EcoRI-containing sequence 5′-CCCgaattcTTT-3′. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on pCD11A170-Luc using either oligonucleotides MS7MUTS and LFA-1α PE#1, which spans +62/+84 (11Nueda A. Lopez-Cabrera M. Vara A. Corbı́ A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19305-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and including a naturally occurring XhoI site, or MS7MUTAS and LFA-1α170, which contains the promoter region –170/–140 and a HindIII recognition site at the 5′ end. After EcoRI/XhoI or EcoRI/HindIII digestion, both polymerase chain reaction products were ligated intoHindIII/XhoI-digested pXP2 to yield pCD11A170(–110mut)-Luc. DNA constructs and mutation were confirmed by DNA sequencing. EMSAs were performed as described (20López-Rodrı́guez C. Kluin-Nelemans H.C. Corbı́ A.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3780-3787PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled at specific activities of 108 cpm/μg using AMV reverse transcriptase and 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP. The probe (0.5 ng with approximately 50,000 cpm) was incubated at 4 °C with 2–5 μg of nuclear extract (or 1–3 μl of transfected COS-7 cells) in 20 μl containing 28 mm EDTA, 15 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 7 mm Hepes (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 7% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of acetylated DNase-free bovine serum albumin. Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added to the nuclear extracts at a 100-fold molar excess and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min before the addition of the radioactive probe. For antibody inhibition/supershift experiments, 0.5 μl of R-3034 (polyclonal antiserum against the DNA-binding domain of AML-1, generously provided by Dr. N. A. Speck) or α-AML1 (polyclonal antiserum against the N-terminal region of AML-1) was incubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min before the addition of the probe. The binding reaction was then carried out for 20 min at 4 °C and 1.5 μl of a 10× loading buffer (10 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added to the reaction. Samples (12 μl) were analyzed by electrophoresis at 15 V/cm and 4 °C on 4–5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.4× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin, and Pefabloc). Extracts from 5 × 104AML1B-, AML3-, or CBFβ-transfected COS-7 cells were prepared in 250 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and protein inhibitors. Extracts from CMV-0-transfected COS-7 cells were used to normalize the amount of extract in each EMSA binding reaction. The CD11a promoter-based oligonucleotides MS4-MS9 and their relative positions are indicated in Table I. Additional double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors and/or probes included NFkBCONS (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), which contains the NFκB consensus binding site, AP2CONS (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′), which contains the human metallothionein IIa promoter AP-2-binding site (22Imagawa M.

Lopez-Cabrera M. Vara A. Corbı́ A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19305-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To locatecis-acting elements in the CD11a proximal promoter, DNase I protection experiments were performed on the –170/+43 DNA fragment using Jurkat (CD11a+), K562 (CD11a−), and HeLa (CD11a−) nuclear extracts. Several areas of DNA-protein interaction were identified, the boundaries and intensities of which differed among the cell lines tested. Protected sequences included the major transcriptional start site, a consensus ets-binding sequence GGAA, and a previously identified Sp1-binding site at –70 (data not shown). The most prominent footprint, spanning from –90 to –115, could be detected in both strands and was always stronger in Jurkat and HeLa than in K562 cells (Fig. 1). Increasing amounts of Jurkat nuclear extracts were used to determine the boundaries of this footprint (–90/–115) (Fig. 1), further demonstrating the existence of DNA-protein interactions around position –110 within the CD11a integrin promoter. To characterize the factor(s) giving rise to the –90/–115 footprint, EMSA was performed using partly overlapping probes spanning the region between –120 and –79 (TableI). This region is located immediately upstream from the Sp1-binding element at –70 (15López-Rodrı́guez C. Chen H. Tenen D.G. Corbı́ A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3496-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and downstream from the sequence recognized by an unidentified and ubiquitousets-related factor (–130) (12Shelley C.S. Farokhzad O.C. Arnaout M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5364-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using the MS7 probe (–120/–88), a low mobility complex, which resolved as a doublet in some experiments, was produced by Jurkat nuclear extracts (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 2 and hereafter termed AML-110). A specific complex of higher mobility was detected with extracts from the B lymphoblastoid cell line JY (Fig.2 A). By contrast, no retarded complex was produced by nuclear extracts from K562, whereas phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated K562 cells exhibited a complex similar to that seen in Jurkat extracts (Fig. 2 A). The specificity of the AML-110 complex was demonstrated as it was completely inhibited in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled MS7, it was partially competed by AP2CONS and unaffected by the unrelated NFkBCONS oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A). In addition, formation of the AML-110 complex was prevented by oligonucleotides MS6 (–110/–79) or MS8 (–130/–99) (Fig. 2, A and B) but was not affected by MS4 (–80/–51), MS5 (–95/–64), or MS9 (–140/–111) (Fig. 2, B and C), thus demonstrating the dependence of the AML-110 complex on the sequence (–110) 5′-CCCTGCGGTTTC –3′ (–99). In fact, EMSA of MS6 (–110/–79) also yielded the AML-110 complex, and its formation was similarly abrogated by either MS8 (–130/–99), MS7 (–120/–88), or MS6 (–110/–79) but not altered by either MS5 (–95/–64) or MS9 (–140/–111) (data not shown). The involvement of the identified sequence in AML-110 complex formation was further confirmed by the lack of inhibitory activity of a mutated MS7 probe (MS7MUT), in which the core of the sequence (–110) 5′-CCCTGCGGTTTC-3′ (–99) had been replaced by an EcoRI site ((–110) 5′-CCgaattcTTTC-3′ (–99)) (Fig. 2 C). To find out the functional contribution of the CD11a-110 element to the whole CD11apromoter activity, the CD11a-110 sequence CTGCGG was replaced by GAATTC in the context of the CD11a promoter region –170/+83, as this mutation had been shown to prevent AML-110 complex formation (Fig. 2). Mutation of the CD11a-110 element reduced the activity of theCD11a promoter to 30% of the wild-type value in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the CD11a-110 element greatly contributes to the CD11a integrin gene transcription. More importantly, the role of CD11a-110 was cell type-dependent because its disruption had a lower effect in K562 (reduced to 65%) and HepG2 cells (reduced to 80%) (Fig. 3). Therefore, the CD11a-110 element is required for an optimal activity of the CD11a gene promoter and participates in the cell type-dependent activity of the CD11a promoter. This result suggests that the factors involved in AML-110 complex formation contribute to the restricted expression of the CD11a/CD18 integrin by recognition of the CD11a-110 element. Comparison of the pattern of EMSA complexes among distinct hematopoietic cell lines indicated that recognition of CD11a-110 was cell type-specific. Search for cell type-specific transcription factors of which the cognate sequences were homologous to CD11a-110 suggested the involvement of the CBF/AML family of transcription factors (17Westendorf J.J.

Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1213-1221PubMed Google Scholar), a hypothesis further supported by the weak expression of CBF/AML factors in K562 cells (25Pardali E. Xie X-Q. Tsapogas P. Itoh S. Arvaniditis K. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Grundström T. Sideras P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3552-3560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), in which no AML-110 complex was observed (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the CD11a-110 element was identical to one of the consensus CBF-binding sequences (23Ning Y.-M. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30624-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and therefore, we tested whether CBF/AML proteins contribute to formation of the AML-110 complex. As shown in Fig.4, formation of the retarded complexes on the MS7 probe with Jurkat or JY nuclear extracts was completely abrogated in the presence of the AML1CONS oligonucleotide, which contains a consensus binding site for members of the CBF/AML transcription factor family. In addition, the MS7 probe prevented recognition of the consensus CBF/AML-binding sequence (AML1CONS) by CBF factors, whereas MS7MUT had no effect, thus suggesting that CBF/AML factors recognize the sequence CTGCGG (Fig. 4). The binding of CBF/AML-related factors to the CD11a-110 element was further demonstrated using polyclonal antibodies against AML1; a polyclonal antiserum against the N-terminal region of AML1B produced a supershift, and the R-3034 polyclonal antiserum, which recognizes the AML1B DNA-binding domain, also inhibited complex formation (Fig. 4). Therefore, proteins structurally related to the PEBP2/CBF/AML family of transcription factors specifically bind the CD11a-110 element and give rise to the AML-110 complex. To further demonstrate recognition of the CD11a-110 element by CBF/AML factors, AML1B, AML3, and CBFβ were overexpressed in COS-7 cells, and the resulting extracts were assayed for binding to MS7. MS7 was recognized by either AML1 or AML3 alone, and coincubation with CBFβ-containing extracts produced a strong retarded complex (Fig.5). The intensity of the AML3-containing complex was considerably higher, an effect that might reflect differences between the levels of expression obtained from pEF-BOS and pCDM8 plasmids. More importantly, AML1/CBFβ or AML3/CBFβ recognition of CD11a-110 was competed by either MS7 or AML1CONS, but unaffected by the MS7MUT oligonucleotide. Therefore, CBF/AML factors recognize the CD11a-110 element within the CD11a promoter and participate in formation of the AML-110 complex. Because mutation of CD11a-110 has a cell type-dependent effect on the activity of the CD11a promoter, we tested the functional effect of overexpressing CBF/AML factors in K562 cells, which express extremely low levels of CBF/AML (23Ning Y.-M. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30624-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of AML1B alone had a minimal effect on the CD11apromoter activity, whereas expression of CBFβ always produced a considerable reduction in the activity of the promoter (Fig.6). However, co-expression of both AML1B and CBFβ produced a considerable increase (12–16-fold) in the activity of the CD11a promoter (Fig. 6). The CD11a promoter transactivation was observed at distinct reporter:vector ratios (Fig.6), and its dependence on the co-expression of AML1B and CBFβ was in agreement with the structural data shown in Fig. 5 and the known functional activities of CBF/AML factors (16Ito Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 18Bae S.-C. Ito Y. Histol.

Therefore, CBF/AML factors directly contribute to the activity of the CD11aintegrin gene promoter. Because CD11a-110 mutation prevented its recognition by CBF/AML factors, we analyzed the effect of disrupting CD11a-110 on the CBF/AML-mediated transactivation of the CD11a promoter. As shown in Fig. 7, mutation of CD11a-110 greatly reduced the AML1B/CBFβ-mediated transactivation of the CD11apromoter. On average, disruption of CD11a-110 reduced the transactivation to 25% of the level observed on the wild-type promoter (Fig. 7). In addition, AML3 was also capable of transactivating theCD11a promoter in a CD11a-110-dependent manner, although its level of transactivation was always lower than that produced by AML1 (data not shown). Therefore, CBF/AML transactivation depends on the integrity of CD11a-110, and CBF/AML factors contribute to CD11a promoter activity by recognizing the CD11a-110 element. The CD11a/CD18 integrin mediates essential adhesive interactions during leukocyte transendothelial migration, in CTL- and NK-mediated killing, in antigen presentation, and in T cell hybridoma and lymphoma metastasis (reviewed in Ref. 1Corbı́ A.L. Leukocyte Integrins: Structure, Expression and Function. R. G. Landes Biomedical Publishers, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). CD11a/CD18 expression is leukocyte-restricted by transcriptional mechanisms acting on the regulatory regions of the CD11a and CD18 genes (11Nueda A. Lopez-Cabrera M. Vara A. Corbı́ A.L. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that deletion of the –170/–100 fragment greatly reduces the basal activity of theCD11a promoter (11Nueda A. Lopez-Cabrera M. Vara A. Corbı́ A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19305-19311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate the presence of a CBF/AML-binding site at –110 (CD11a-110) that is specifically recognized by members of the CBF/AML family of transcription factors and contributes to the cell type-specific activity of the CD11a promoter. Consequently, CBF/AML factors appear as essential players in the control of the cell type-specific transcription of the CD11a gene through recognition of the CD11a-110 element. CD11a-110 is the first functionally characterized cis-acting element within theCD11a gene promoter of which the contribution to the cell type-specific activity of the CD11a promoter resembles that of Sp1-binding sites within the CD11b and CD11c promoters (15López-Rodrı́guez C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8230-8239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AML-1/CBFβ transcription factor complex is one of the most frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias (17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 18Bae S.-C. Ito Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1213-1221PubMed Google Scholar, 19Speck N.A. Stacy T. Wang Q. North T. Gu T.-L. Miller J. Binder M. Marı́n-Padilla M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 Suppl.: 1789s-1793sGoogle Scholar). Both genes are affected by as many as 11 chromosomal translocations in either AML or B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and some of these rearrangements transform AML-1 or CBFβ into constitutive transcriptional repressors (e.g. AML1/ETO and CBFβ/MYH11) that disrupt normal hematopoietic cell differentiation (17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 30Behre G. Zhang P. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. Methods. 1999; 17: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). AML1/ETO can act as a dominant negative inhibitor of AML1 transactivation (31Meyers S. Lenny N. Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), although AML1/ETO and AML1 can also synergistically transactivate the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter (32Rhoades K.L. Hetherington C.J. Rowley J.D. Hiebert S.W. Nucifora G. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of AML1 and CBFβ in theCD11a gene transcription raises the possibility that CD11a/CD18 integrin expression might be altered in some of these lymphoproliferative disorders. In this regard, diminished or absent CD11a/CD18 expression has been noted in cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (33Kawada H. Fukuda R. Yoshida M. Takei M. Kobayashi N. Masumoto A. Ogawa Y. Sasao T. Kubota N. Watanabe S. Umeda Y. Yamauchi K. Yonekura S. Ichikawa Y. Leuk. Res. 1996; 20: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the expression of CD11a/CD18 significantly correlates with splenomegaly, resistance to induction chemotherapies and short survival periods in AML patients (34Geijtenbeek T.B. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S.J. Renes M.H. Raymakers R.A. Figdor C.G. Blood. 1999; 94: 754-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether an association exists between AML1 or CBFβ chromosomal translocations and the expression of the CD11a/CD18 integrin, a task we are currently undertaking. AML1 products are expressed in most tissues and at high levels in hematopoietic cells (16Ito Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 18Bae S.-C. Ito Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1213-1221PubMed Google Scholar, 19Speck N.A. Stacy T. Wang Q.

Methods. 1999; 17: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), in which they collaborate in the organization of promoters prior to transcriptional activation, and are transcriptional activators of myeloid and lymphoid-specific genes, including T cell receptor subunits, (35Hernández-Munain C. Krangel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3090-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), myeloperoxidase (36Suzow J. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2141-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), interleukin-3 (37Cameron S. Taylor D.S. TePas E.C. Speck N.A. Mathey-Privot B. Blood. 1994; 83: 2851-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and neutrophil elastase (38Nuchprayoon I. Meyers S. Scott L.M. Suzow J. Hiebert S. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5558-5568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CBF/AML proteins are relatively weak transcriptional activators in isolation, and they potently enhance transcription rates in cooperation with several factors (e.g. Ets-1, PU.1, c-Myb, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α) via cooperative DNA binding or interactions with co-activators (17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 39Friedman A.D. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1932-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In fact, CBF/AML-binding sites are usually flanked by sites for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, Myb, or Ets factors (16Ito Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Westendorf J.J. Hiebert S.W. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 51-58Crossref Google Scholar, 18Bae S.-C. Ito Y. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 1213-1221PubMed Google Scholar, 19Speck N.A. Stacy T. Wang Q. North T. Gu T.-L. Miller J. Binder M. Marı́n-Padilla M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 Suppl.: 1789s-1793sGoogle Scholar). In the case of the CD11apromoter, the CD11a-110 element is adjacent to an Ets-binding element and to putative CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein- and Myb-binding sites, suggesting that some of these interactions may participate in the transactivation of the CD11a promoter by CBF/AML proteins and contributing to the cell type-specific expression of the CD11a integrin. On the other hand, a different type of interaction might also affect the involvement of CBF/AML factors in the transcriptional activity of the CD11a promoter. Thus, in agreement with the partial inhibitory effect of AP2CONS on AML-110 complex formation (shown in Fig. 2), we have obtained evidence that AP-2α and AP-2β can transactivate the CD11a promoter and that recombinant AP-2 factors bind the CD11a-110 element in vitro, although with lower affinity than CBF/AML factors (data not shown). Because AP-2 factors are capable of preventing the binding of other transcription factors to overlapping or adjacent cis-acting sequences (NF1, AP-3, and NFκB) (40Courtois S.J. Lafontaine D.A. Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Rousseau G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Mercurio F. Karin M.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that AP-2 could also be regulating the access of CBF/AML factors to the CD11a gene promoter in certain cell types and thus regulating CD11a integrin expression. The CD11a/CD18 integrin plays a key role in the triggering of immune and inflammatory responses (1Corbı́ A.L. Leukocyte Integrins: Structure, Expression and Function. R. G. Landes Biomedical Publishers, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). However, under certain circumstances (e.g. lymphoma metastasis and ischemia-reperfusion injuries), the functional activity of CD11a/CD18 and related integrins becomes detrimental to the host, and in fact, anti-CD11a antibodies can inhibit these processes (8Roos E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1991; 10: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Vedder N.B. Winn R.K. Rice C.L. Chi E.Y. Arfors K.E. Harlan J.M. J. Clin.

The involvement of CBF/AML factors in the transcription of the CD11a gene implies that CD11a/CD18 expression might be deregulated (either positively or negatively) in leukemic cells with chromosomal translocations affecting eitherAML1 or CBFβ alleles (AML M2 and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia), thus contributing to altered adhesive and/or metastatic phenotypes. The identification of CBF/AML factors as key players in the transcription of the CD11a gene will allow the dissection of the signaling pathways that regulate CD11a/CD18 integrin expression and, subsequently, the development of strategies to modulate the adhesive and migratory capabilities of leukocytes and tumor cells."

Abbreviations and structures of GSLs are shown in Table II Various GSLs were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (condition I) or 16 h (condition II) with 0.1 milliunits of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 0.2% Triton X-100. GSLs and oligosaccharides were separated by TLC and visualized by spraying with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent and determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Glycosphingolipids (GSLs),1 amphipathic compounds consisting of oligosaccharides and ceramides, are characteristic components of plasma membrane. They are considered to be receptors for microorganisms and their toxins, as well as modulators of cell growth and differentiation (1Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Recently, GSLs were found to be enriched with other sphingolipids and cholesterol to form microdomains on the ectoplasmic membrane (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8151) Google Scholar). These lipid domains assemble receptors and signaling molecules coupled to Src family kinases and G-proteins on their inner surface and mediate membrane trafficking and signaling activities (3Hakomori S. Hanada K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xviiiCrossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Endoglycoceramidase (EGCase) is a GSL-specific enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage between oligosaccharides and ceramides of various GSLs (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was first discovered in a culture supernatant of the actinomycete, Rhodococcus sp. strain G-74-2 (5Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14278-14282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and later found in bacteria (6Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A similar enzyme, called ceramide glycanase (CGase), has been found in leeches (7Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), earthworms (8Li Y.-T. Ishikawa Y. Li S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of EGCase (EGCase I, II, and III), each differing in molecular weight, pI, and substrate specificity, were isolated from the culture supernatant ofRhodococcus sp. M-750, a mutant of the wild strain G-74-2 (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned and sequenced the gene encoding EGCase II ofRhodococcus sp. M-777 and showed that the deduced amino acid sequence contained the Asn-Glu-Pro (NEP) sequence, which is commonly conserved as part of the active site region of family A cellulases (endo-1,4-β-glucanase) (10Izu H. Izumi Y. Kurome Y. Sano M. Kondo A. Kato I. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19846-19850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The NEP sequence was also found in the deduced amino acid sequence of the newly cloned EGCase gene ofRhodococcus sp. C9 (11Sakaguchi K. Okino N. Izu H. Ito M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Replacement of the Glu residue in the NEP sequence with Gln or Asp by site-directed mutagenesis caused drastic loss of enzymatic activity in both M-777 and C9 EGCases, indicating that the Glu residue in the NEP sequence of EGCase plays an important role in its enzymatic activity (11Sakaguchi K. Okino N. Izu H. Ito M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of EGCase/CGase from eukaryotes has not yet been conducted. In this paper, we report a novel EGCase from the jellyfish,Cyanea nozakii, which is a glycoprotein withN-glycans and acts on GSLs most efficiently at pH 3.0. The substrate specificity of jellyfish EGCase is completely different from those of other EGCases and CGases reported so far; i.e. the jellyfish enzyme hydrolyzed gangliosides, especially b-series polysialogangliosides, much faster than neutral GSLs. This paper also reports the first molecular cloning of a eukaryotic EGCase and reveals that the NEP sequence is commonly conserved in the sequences of EGCases of not only prokaryotes but also eukaryotes. Jellyfish (C. nozakii) were collected at Nishinoura in Wakayama, Japan, and stored at −80 °C until use. GM1 was prepared from crude bovine brain ganglioside using sialidase-producing bacteria, Psedomonas sp. YF-2, by the method described in Ref. 12Fukano Y. Ito M. Appl. Environ.

GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GM3, asialo-GM1, lactosylceramide (LacCer), galactosylceramide, and glucosylceramide were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Synthetic lactoside, 2-N-dodecanoylamino-4-nitrophenyl-O-β-lactoside, was kindly donated from Dr. T. Yamagata (Japan Institute of Leather Research). Lyso-GM1 was prepared by digestion of GM1 with sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (13Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol.

A precoated Silica Gel 60 TLC plate was obtained from Merck. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. The reaction mixture contained 10 nmol of GM1 and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. Following incubation at 37 °C for the times indicated, the reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness, redissolved in 10 μl of 50% methanol, and applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (4/4/1, v/v/v). For determination of hydrolysis of polysialogangliosides, the TLC plates were developed with chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (2/3/1, v/v/v). GSLs and oligosaccharides were visualized by spraying the TLC plates with orcinol-H2SO4 reagent and scanning them with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm. The extent of hydrolysis was calculated as follows: hydrolysis (%) = (peak area for oligosaccharide released) × 100/(peak area for remaining substrate + peak area for oligosaccharide released). One unit of the EGCase was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 μmol of GM1/min under the conditions described above. The hydrolysis of 2-N-dodecanoylamino-4-nitrophenyl-O-β-lactoside was examined according to the method described by Miura et al. (15Miura Y. Arai T. Ohtake A. Ito M. Yamamoto K. Yamagata T. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Jellyfishes (2.5 kg) were homogenized in a Waring blender and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was 80% saturated with ammonium sulfate. After standing overnight, the precipitate was dissolved in 500 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2m NaCl and 0.2% Lubrol PX. After gentle stirring overnight, the supernatant solution (500 ml) was subjected to further purification procedures. The enzyme solution obtained above was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (75 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2m NaCl at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system (Yamazen Co., Osaka, Japan), and the effluent was fractionated into each 10-ml portion. After the column was washed with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, the enzyme was eluted from the column with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1% Lubrol PX. The active fractions from the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (300 ml) were subjected to chromatography using a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (55 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX, using BPLC-600FC HPLC system. After washing the column with the same buffer, the enzyme was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions each of 10 ml were collected, and those containing enzyme activity were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. The dialyzed enzyme solution (250 ml) was applied to a HiTrap Chelating column (chelated with Cu2+, 5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX at a flow rate of 5 ml/min using a P.S.L.C. system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 10-ml fractions were collected. After washing the column with the same buffer and subsequently with 0.5 m NaCl, the enzyme was eluted from the column with 1 m NH4Cl. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. The dialyzed enzyme solution (195 ml) was applied to a TSKgel CM-5PW column (5 × 50 mm; TOSOH Co., Tokyo, Japan) that had been equilibrated with 20 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using the BioCAD SPRINT system (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.). The column was washed with the same buffer and developed with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.1 m in the same buffer. The fractions containing the enzyme were concentrated, and the buffer was replaced with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, using a centrifugal concentrator (Centriprep-10, Amicon, Inc.). The concentrated enzyme (21 ml) was applied to a HiTrap Heparin column (1 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 20 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% Lubrol PX at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The enzyme was passed through the column, while contaminating proteins were adsorbed and eluted with 1 mNaCl in the same buffer. 100 μl of the purified enzyme was applied to a Superdex 200HR column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.3% Lubrol PX and 0.1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the BioCAD system, and fractions of 1.0 ml each were collected and subjected to the assay of EGCase. Measurement of protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207464) Google Scholar). The proteins on SDS-PAGE were visualized by a silver-staining solution (17Ohsawa K. Ebata N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and determined with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflection mode set at 540 nm. The purified EGCase was applied onto 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (NOVEX). A duplicate gel was cut into 3-mm slices. Each slice was crushed in 150 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, an aliquot (10 μl) of the supernatant of the extract was assayed for enzyme activity using GM1 as the substrate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The extent of hydrolysis was determined as described above. The purified enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl) for 1 h with gentle shaking. For specific detection of glycan moieties, the membranes were treated with 1 μg/ml of horseradish peroxidase-labeled lectins (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min, the membranes were incubated in ECL Plus solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and determined with a STORM (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The purified enzyme was denatured in boiling water bath for 3 min in 5 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 0.5% SDS and 0.75% β-mercaptoethanol. The denatured enzyme was then incubated at 37 °C for 18 h with 0.5 milliunits of glycopeptidase F (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan) in 20 μl of the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Exoglycosidases and proteases were assayed usingp-nitrophenyl glycoside (18Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 702-713Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and Azocoll (19Moore G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), respectively, as the substrates. Neuraminidase was assayed using 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acethylneuraminic acid as substrate. The activities of sphingomyelinase and ceramidase were measured using C12-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-sphingomyelin and C12-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-ceramide, respectively, by the method described in Refs. 14Nakagawa T. Tani M. Kita K. Ito M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 20Tani M. Kita K. Komori H. Nakagawa T. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. The purified enzyme was treated with glycopeptidase F and then concentrated using a Y-shaped gel (160 × 160 × 2 mm) modified form of a funnel-shaped one (21Dainese H.P. Quadroni M. Staudenmann W. James P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 264: 336-343Google Scholar). Two protein bands (45 and 46 kDa) were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and thus each band was cut out separately, reduced with dithiothreitol, and loaded again on a well of a normal SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, PE-Biosystems) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 45- and 46-kDa protein bands were cut out and treatedin situ with lysylendopeptidase AP-1 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Peptides released from the membrane were fractionated with a reversed-phase HPLC column of C8 (RP-300, 1.0 × 100 mm; PE-Biosystems) and sequenced with a pulse-liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise 492 cLc, PE-Biosystems). To obtain the partial cDNA sequence encoded the EGCase, we synthesized the first strand cDNA from the jellyfish. Total RNA and mRNA were obtained from 4 g of the tentacle portion of the jellyfish using Sepasol-RNA I (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen), respectively. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of mRNA using an AMV Reverse Transcriptase First-strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Life Sciences, Inc.). Based on the amino acid sequences of peptides derived from the purified EGCase, degenerate primers of both sense and antisense strands were designed. Sense oligonucleotide primer, NSout (5′-GTNAAYCCNGARACNCA-3′), was synthesized from the N-terminal peptide sequences, and for the second round nested PCR, NSin (5′-CCNGARACNCARCARYT-3′) was designed. Antisense primers, 559Aout (5′-ATHTAYAGNGGNCGYTT-3′) and 547Aout (5′-CCRAGYATYATYACYAT-3′), were synthesized based on the internal amino acid sequences of C-559 and C-547/562, respectively. For the second round nested PCR, 559Ain (5′-CGYTTNCCRAGYAAHTA-3′) and 547Ain (5′-ATNCGYAGNGGNGGNCC-3′) were used. The first round PCR was performed using two sets of the primers (NSout and 559Aout, NSout and 547Aout) with first strand cDNA as a template in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (PE-Biosystems) using AmpliTaq Gold (PE-Biosystems). The second round nested PCR was primed with each first round PCR product as a template using nested primers (NSin and 559Ain, NSin and 547Ain). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega), and their DNA sequences were determined. To obtain the 5′- and 3′-end, the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH) was used. 5′-RACE first strand cDNA was primed from 0.75 μg of mRNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a SMART II oligonucleotide and a 5′-RACE cDNA synthesis primer. The 5′-end of the cDNA was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primer 1 (5′-CTGCGGATTCAGGGGGTATTTGTCTTCA-3′) and a universal primer mix and 5′-RACE first strand cDNA as a template, using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (CLONTECH). The 3′-RACE first strand cDNA was primed using 3′-RACE cDNA synthesis primer. The 3′-end of the cDNA was obtained by PCR using a universal primer mix and gene-specific primer 2 (5′-CTTGGTATGATGCTGCCAGGCTATGTGC-3′) and 3′-RACE first strand cDNA as a template. The 5′- and 3′-RACE PCR products were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector, and their DNA sequences were determined. An upstream (EGC-N) and a downstream primer (EGC-C), each containing an EcoRI site, were designed from the N and C terminus of the open reading frame, respectively. A full-length cDNA was prepared by PCR using these primers and 5′- RACE first strand cDNA as a template with Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co., Japan). After digestion with EcoRI, a PCR product was cloned into a pBluescript II SK+ (STRATAGENE). 14 clones obtained were sequenced. The full-length PCR product was also directly sequenced to minimize potential PCR artifacts. Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a Bigdye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE-Biosystems) and a DNA Sequencer (model 377A, PE-Biosystems). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were evaluated using the DNASIS computer program developed by Hitachi Software Engineering. EGCase was purified from extracts of the jellyfish by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by sequential chromatography with phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF, SP-Sepharose FF, HiTrap Chelating, TSKgel CM-5PW, and HiTrap Heparin. As shown in TableI, the enzyme was purified 1,260-fold with 20.5% recovery. The final preparation showed a single, but broad, protein band after staining with silver solution under both reducing (Fig. 1 A) and nonreducing conditions (data not shown). The apparent molecular mass of the EGCase was estimated to be 51 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). The elution profile of EGCase activity on chromatography with a Superdex 200HR coincided exactly with that of the 51-kDa band on SDS-PAGE, and no other co-eluted bands were observed (Fig.2 A). The purified enzyme also showed a single protein band on the native PAGE that corresponded to the active fractions (Fig. 2 B). These results indicated that the 51-kDa protein identified on SDS-PAGE was definitely the EGCase. The protein was stained with horseradish peroxidase-labeled concanavalin A, but hardly with Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA I) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (Fig.3 A), and converted to 45- and 46-kDa bands on SDS-PAGE after exhaustive digestion with glycopeptidase F (Fig. 3 B). These results showed that the jellyfish EGCase was glycosylated with N-glycans, possibly possessing mannosyl or glucosyl residues.Table IPurification of EGCase from the jellyfish, C. nozakiiStepsTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmilliunitsmgmilliunits/mg%-fold80% (NH4)2SO41,5097382.0100.01.0Phenyl-Sepharose 6FF1,6502706.1109.33.0SP Sepharose FF82551.316.154.68.1HiTrap Chelating7144.5115847.379TSKgel CM-5PW3630.3361,08024.1540HiTrap Heparin3100.123 1-aEstimated by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2,52020.51,2601-a Estimated by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Figure 2Gel filtration chromatography (A) and native PAGE (B) of the purified EGCase of the jellyfish.

The EGCase required detergents for hydrolysis of GSLs. The optimal concentrations of Triton X-100 and Lubrol PX were 0.2 and 0.4%, respectively. Taurodeoxycholate strongly inhibited the enzyme activity (Fig. 4 C), and SDS completely inhibited the EGCase activity at a concentration of 0.1% (data not shown). Among the metal ions examined, Hg2+ completely inhibited the enzyme activity at 2 mm, whereas Cu2+ and Zn2+, which are potent inhibitors of microbial EGCases, had no effects on enzyme activity at the final concentration of 5 mm. Li+, K+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and EDTA had no significant effects on the activity at 5 mm. Fig. 4 D shows the Lineweaver-Burk plot and substrate saturation curve (inset). ApparentK m and V max values of this enzyme for GM1 were estimated to be 0.35 mm and 4.4 units/mg, respectively. Table IIsummarizes the extent of the hydrolysis of various GSLs by the jellyfish EGCase under conditions that may reflect the relative initial reaction velocity (condition I) and for determining the degree of hydrolysis after exhaustive digestion (condition II). Of all GSLs tested, gangliosides appeared to be good substrates under both conditions, GT1b being most favored by the enzyme, followed by GQ1b and GM1. Neutral GSLs, such as asialo-GM1 and LacCer, were hydrolyzed considerably more slowly than gangliosides. Gb4Cer was only slightly hydrolyzed. No hydrolysis was observed for cerebrosides, lyso-GM1, 2-N-dodecanoylamino-4-nitrophenyl-O-β-lactoside, sphingomyelin, and ceramide even under condition II. Fig.5 shows the time course for hydrolysis of GM1, GT1b, and LacCer by the jellyfish enzyme andRhodococcus EGCase II. It was found that the jellyfish enzyme hydrolyzed GT1b much more rapidly than did EGCase II (Fig.5 B), although the reaction velocity for GM1 by both enzymes was almost the same (Fig. 5 A). LacCer, by contrast, was hydrolyzed by the jellyfish enzyme considerably more slowly compared with the microbial enzyme (Fig. 5 C). The 45- and 46-kDa polypeptides generated after glycopeptidase F treatment were separately digested with lysylendopeptidase and subjected to amino acid microsequencing. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of both native polypeptides were also determined. Table III shows the partial amino acid sequences of the EGCase, in which C-549, C-547, and C-558 were obtained from the 45-kDa polypeptide, and C-552, C-562, and C-559 were obtained from the 46-kDa polypeptide. The N terminus as well as one of the internal amino acid sequences of both polypeptides were completely identical (TableIII). Furthermore, the peptide map of the 45-kDa polypeptide after digestion with lysylendopeptidase was almost identical to that of the 46-kDa one (data not shown). These results indicated that both polypeptides were derived from the same 51-kDa protein.Table IIIPeptide sequences of EGCase from the jellyfish, C. nozakiiPeptideSequenceN terminus C-549/C-552DDASLLISVNPETQQLXLysylendopeptidase digest C-547/C-562VPGGDAYRDRSVLSYHYYEP C-558PYHPSVEGYDDTSFXEV C-559SVIGYELINEPFAGDIYRDPXLPeptide sequences were determined by Edman sequencing. Open table in a new tab Peptide sequences were determined by Edman sequencing. PCR was performed using two sets of primers (NSout and 559Aout, NSout and 547Aout) and the first strand cDNA as the template. The first round PCR product was then used as a template for nested PCR amplification using nested primers (NSin and 559Ain, NSin and 547Ain). As a result, the 620- and 820-bp PCR products were specifically amplified. The former contained C-549/552, C-558, C-559, and the later contained C-549/552, C-558, C-559, and C-547/562 (Table III). To obtain the 5′- and 3′-terminal segments of the cDNA, 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed. The 650-bp PCR product was amplified from the 5′-RACE, and the 1,490-bp product was from the 3′-RACE. The sequences of the overlapping cDNA fragments contained an initiation codon in agreement with the Kozak rule (22Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3596) Google Scholar) and a termination codon. The full-length cDNA amplified by PCR was cloned into pBluescript II SK+ vector, and 14 independent clones were sequenced. As a result, the open reading frame of eight clones showed the identical nucleotide sequences as shown in Fig.6 A (J-EGCase; AB047321). However, other six clones showed minor variation, in which T at position 164, C at 311, T at 526, and C at 794 were replaced with C, T, C, and T, respectively, with the result that Leu172 could be replaced with Pro (J-EGCase P; AB047322). This variation was also confirmed by direct cycle sequencing of the full-length PCR product, suggesting that two variants of EGCase gene are present in the jellyfish. Fig.6 A shows the nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the jellyfish EGCase. The 1,509-bp open reading frame encodes 503 amino acid residues containing six potential N-glycosylation sites. A polyadenylation site was found in the 3′-untranslated region, indicating that the EGCase is not derived from symbiotical bacteria or actinomycetes. From the deduced amino acid sequence, the molecular mass and pI of the EGCase were calculated to be 54,641 and 5.61, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence contained all the sequences obtained from the purified enzyme after digestion withN-glycanase (Fig. 6 A), except for Asn72 and Asn307, which were determined as Asp from the peptide sequence (Table III), indicating thatN-glycans were precisely coupled to these Asn residues. A hydrophobic motif composed of 25 amino acid residues, a putative signal sequence, was found just before the N terminus of the enzyme. The presence of the hydrophobic motif near the N terminus was also clearly indicated by hydrophobicity plot analysis (Fig. 6 B). The open reading frame showed 21.9% identity to that ofRhodococcus EGCase II at the amino acid levels (Fig.7). Interestingly, the NEP sequence, which is part of the active site of Rhodococcus EGCase II, was completely conserved in the deduced amino acid sequence of the jellyfish enzyme (Fig. 7). We detected EGCase activity in the cell lysate of CHOP cells when the cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the jellyfish EGCase, while no EGCase activity was found in untransfected CHOP cells or mock transfectants (data not shown). Purified EGCase from the jellyfish, C. nozakii, showed several unique characteristics compared with other EGCases and CGases reported so far. Lectin blotting using concanavalin A as well as glycopeptidase F treatment of the purified jellyfish EGCase showed that the enzyme was glycosylated with N-glycans. The deduced amino acid sequence of the jellyfish EGCase indicated six potentialN-glycosylation sites. By contrast, there have been no reports of the presence of glycans in other EGCases/CGases (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Eur. J.

Second, the jellyfish EGCase shows a pH optimum at 3.0, while those of actinomycetes, leeches, earthworms, and clams have been reported to range from 4.0 to 5.5, indicating that the jellyfish enzyme is the most acidic EGCase (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the jellyfish enzyme could be located in lysosomes. Third, the activity of the jellyfish enzyme was not affected by Zn2+ and Cu2+ at a concentration of 5 mm, while other EGCases/CGases were strongly inhibited by these metal ions (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Tochikura T. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fourth, the hydrolysis of GM1 by the jellyfish enzyme was enhanced by Triton X-100 but strongly inhibited by taurodeoxycholate. In contrast, the activity of the leech enzyme was inhibited by Triton X-100, whereas taurodeoxycholate activated both the microbial and leech enzymes (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the jellyfish enzyme hydrolyzed gangliosides, especially b-series polysialogangliosides, such as GT1b and GQ1b, much more rapidly than neutral GSLs such as LacCer and asialo-GM1, while both the microbial and leech enzymes hydrolyzed neutral GSLs much more rapidly than these polysialogangliosides (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jellyfish EGCase did not hydrolyze lyso-GM1 under the experimental conditions we employed. On the other hand, the leech and Rhodococcus enzymes cleaved sphingosine glycans (4Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zhou B. Li S.-C. Laine R.A. Huang R.T.C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12272-12277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including lyso-GM1, suggesting that the whole ceramide structure is required for hydrolysis of substrates by the jellyfish EGCase but not by other enzymes. We previously reported that the NEP sequence, the active site of family A cellulases, was also the putative active site ofRhodococcus EGCase II (10Izu H. Izumi Y. Kurome Y. Sano M. Kondo A. Kato I. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19846-19850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The present study clearly shows that the NEP sequence was also completely conserved in the jellyfish EGCase. In addition, two regions at positions Leu131–Val137 and Tyr414–Gly420 of the deduced amino acid sequence of the jellyfish enzyme were also highly conserved inRhodococcus EGCase, suggesting that these portions are also important for the catalytic and/or substrate-binding functions of EGCase. It should be noted that EGCase activity was found in all species of jellyfish tested (Spirocodon saltator, Aequorea coerulescens, Aurelia aurita, Chrysaora melanaster, Rhopilema esculenta, and C. nozakii). In addition, the enzyme activity was also detected in a freshwater hydra, Hydra magnipapillata. Both jellyfish and hydra are members of the Cnidaria, a group of animals that arose very early in metazoan evolution. Some jellyfish including C. nozakii eat small fish that are digested in the gastro-vascular cavity by digestive enzymes such as proteases, lipases, and chitinases. Then digested particles are incorporated by phagocytosis and further degraded in phagosomes/lysosomes (25Paul L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 49: 311-339PubMed Google Scholar). EGCase seems to be localized in phagosomes/lysosomes, since the enzyme shows an extremely acidic pH optimum (pH 3.0) and is glycosylated with N-glycans. Furthermore, the putative lysosome-associated glycoprotein motif was found in the sequence of the jellyfish EGCase (Phe363–His387) (26Fukuda M. Viitala J. Matteson J. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18920-18928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Invertebrates generally do not express gangliosides, whereas polysialogangliosides are often found in fish brains (27Ishizuka I. Wiegandt H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the jellyfish EGCase could function to catabolize the diet-derived glycosphingolipids, possibly in phagosomes/lysosomes. Further study is necessary to confirm the precise location of EGCase in the jellyfish and hydra. This study is the first to isolate a full-length cDNA encoding a eukaryotic EGCase, which shows an extremely acidic pH optimum. The availability of the cDNA sequence of the EGCase should make it possible to isolate new EGCases/CGases from other invertebrates, and possibly vertebrates, and should help to define the physiological roles of EGCases/CGases in eukaryotes. The jellyfish EGCase efficiently hydrolyzed polysialogangliosides, which were somewhat resistant to hydrolysis by the EGCases and CGases reported previously, and will thus facilitate further research into polysialogangliosides.

In this report, we have generated SNAP-25 mutants and assayed their functions in SNARE complex formation and glutamate release from cultured rat cerebellar granule cells. In vitro binding studies show that a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal 181–206 amino acid sequence inhibits the formation of the SNARE core complex. Additional deletion of an N-terminal 1–31 amino acid sequence abolished this inhibitory activity. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is used to overexpress wild-type and mutant SNAP-25 in cerebellar granule cells. Neurons overexpressing the wild-type protein show slight reductions in glutamate release, ranging from 10 to 15% in both the developing and mature granule cells. A 30–35% inhibition is obtained with the C-terminal deletion mutant, and the inhibitory effect is abolished in the N- and C-terminal double deletion mutant. These results demonstrate that the SNARE core complex exists in a dynamic and reversible state, and the formation of the core complex is necessary for neurotransmitter release in neurons.

J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane binding domain of SNAP-25 contains four cysteine residues and mutation of two or more cysteines effectively abolishes membrane binding (12Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The syntaxin binding domain is located in the N terminus of SNAP-25 (6Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recently the crystal structure of the SNARE core complex was solved (13Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar).

By limited proteolysis andin vitro binding assay, it is proposed that the two α-helix domains act independently and contribute equally to form the SNARE complex with syntaxin and synaptobrevin (14Fasshauer D.

These results provide further understanding into how SNAP-25 may participate in the assembly of SNARE complex and vesicle fusion.Although the importance of SNAP-25 and the SNARE complex in neurosecretion is well documented, the molecular mechanism underlying their involvement in the membrane fusion process is less clear. Recent studies of yeast vacuole fusion and the cortical vesicle fusion in sea urchin eggs showed that membrane fusion can proceed in the absence of SNARE formation (17Ungermann C. Sato K. Wichner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 18Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), indicating that the SNARE complex may not directly participate in, and thus may not be required for actual membrane fusion. On the other hand, the formation of the SNARE complex was able to drive membrane fusion in reconstituted liposomes (19Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92 (722): 759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that inhibition of neurosecretion by botulinum toxin E can be rescued by a SNAP-25 C-terminal peptide, probably by initiating the formation of a fusion competent SNARE complex (20Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have used in vitro binding andin vivo functional assay in cultured rat cerebellar neurons to determine the roles of the membrane-binding, the N-terminal helix, and the C-terminal helix of SNAP-25 in SNARE core complex formation and glutamate release. Our results suggest that the C-terminal α-helical domain of SNAP-25 is required for the assembly of the SNARE core complex and for evoked neurotransmitter release in vivo.DISCUSSIONSeveral elegant studies using synaptosome preparations and permeabilized PC12 cells have suggested that SNAP-25 may act in the late post-docking steps of exocytosis (20Chen Y.A.

A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, there are many questions that can only be answered by directly investigating neurons in vivo, especially at their functional synaptic junctions. For instance, it has been shown that SNAP-25 is palmitoylated and that palmitoylation is required for its membrane association (11Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our current experiments demonstrate that although the Ala85,88,90 mutant still binds syntaxin and forms SNARE complex in vitro, it does not have any significant effect on glutamate release, indicating that the mutant likely fails to target to synaptic sites or it may not function properly at the synapses. Overexpression of the wild-type and N-terminal deletion mutant Δ1–31 slightly inhibited glutamate release from granule cell cultures (Figs.7 and 8 and Table I), which agrees with a previous study involving hippocampal neurons overexpressing SNAP-25 using Semliki Forest virus (31Owe-Larsson B. Berglund M. Kristensson K. Garoff H. Larhammar D. Brodin L. Low P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Perhaps the excess SNAP-25 interfered with the dynamics of the SNAREs by binding to its targets, e.g.syntaxin and/or synaptotagmin.The C-terminal deletion mutant was able to act as a more effective dominant negative mutant to inhibit glutamate release, and it was shown to act directly on the formation of the vesicle docking/fusion complex (Fig. 4). The inhibition of SNARE core complex assembly by Δ180–206 was unexpected because previous studies suggests that the C terminus of SNAP-25 is not essential for the formation of the ternary complex and that it is only required for the formation of SDS resistant complexes (4Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This is likely because the deletion mutant was significantly less effective in promoting the formation of the SNARE core complex, thus less ternary complexes were formed under the assay condition (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effect by Δ180–206 seemed to be dependent on the molar ratio between syntaxin and wild-type SNAP-25, with a maximal inhibition at a SNAP-25 to syntaxin ratio of 1–1.5:1. At a lower SNAP-25 to syntaxin ratio, the Δ180–206 mutant slightly enhanced SNARE core complex assembly (data not shown). These results are in agreement with the earlier finding, indicating that the C-terminal deletion mutant is able to form the ternary complex (4Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The current results, however, further demonstrate a difference in synaptobrevin binding affinity by the binary complexes between syntaxin·SNAP-25 and the syntaxin·Δ180–206 mutant. As a result, in the presence of optimal amounts of syntaxin and SNAP-25, the addition of Δ180–206 SNAP-25 can reduce the number of assembled SNARE core complexes (Fig. 4). This observation agrees with an earlier study that showed that botulinum toxin E treatment cleaved the C-terminal 180–206 sequence of SNAP-25 and destabilized the SNARE complexes in PC12 cells (32Banerjee A. Kowalchyk J.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20227-20230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is also possible, however, that the inhibition was caused by other factors present in the COS-7 cell lysate, even though the cell lysate alone did not seem to affect the SNARE complex assembly/disassembly (data not shown).The assembly of the synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 ternary structure can readily proceed in vitro, and the resulting complex is unusually stable, i.e. resistant to SDS treatment. Evidence also indicates that SNARE core complex formation drives membrane fusion (20Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and that the minimum synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 core complex is sufficient for membrane fusion (19Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92 (722): 759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Our current study shows that the wild-type SNAP-25 in preformed SNARE core complexes can be displaced by the Δ181–206 mutant (Fig. 5). This suggests that the core complex may exist in an intermediate and less stable state. However, the mechanism of this effect by Δ181–206 SNAP-25 remains to be determined.Currently, it is not clear if the synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 ternary structure is formed simultaneously or if an intermediate binary structure is formed first. Our binding data from N- and C-terminal deletion mutant of SNAP-25 support the previous proposal that an intermediate binary structure of syntaxin·SNAP-25 is formed initially, thus providing a high affinity binding site for synaptobrevin (4Hayashi T.

It should be interesting to address this question with studies that are capable of dissecting temporally and spatially the dynamics of synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 interactions.

These results are in agreement with the earlier finding, indicating that the C-terminal deletion mutant is able to form the ternary complex (4Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The current results, however, further demonstrate a difference in synaptobrevin binding affinity by the binary complexes between syntaxin·SNAP-25 and the syntaxin·Δ180–206 mutant. As a result, in the presence of optimal amounts of syntaxin and SNAP-25, the addition of Δ180–206 SNAP-25 can reduce the number of assembled SNARE core complexes (Fig. 4). This observation agrees with an earlier study that showed that botulinum toxin E treatment cleaved the C-terminal 180–206 sequence of SNAP-25 and destabilized the SNARE complexes in PC12 cells (32Banerjee A.

It is also possible, however, that the inhibition was caused by other factors present in the COS-7 cell lysate, even though the cell lysate alone did not seem to affect the SNARE complex assembly/disassembly (data not shown).The assembly of the synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 ternary structure can readily proceed in vitro, and the resulting complex is unusually stable, i.e. resistant to SDS treatment. Evidence also indicates that SNARE core complex formation drives membrane fusion (20Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and that the minimum synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 core complex is sufficient for membrane fusion (19Weber T.

Our current study shows that the wild-type SNAP-25 in preformed SNARE core complexes can be displaced by the Δ181–206 mutant (Fig. 5). This suggests that the core complex may exist in an intermediate and less stable state. However, the mechanism of this effect by Δ181–206 SNAP-25 remains to be determined.Currently, it is not clear if the synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 ternary structure is formed simultaneously or if an intermediate binary structure is formed first. Our binding data from N- and C-terminal deletion mutant of SNAP-25 support the previous proposal that an intermediate binary structure of syntaxin·SNAP-25 is formed initially, thus providing a high affinity binding site for synaptobrevin (4Hayashi T.

It should be interesting to address this question with studies that are capable of dissecting temporally and spatially the dynamics of synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25 interactions. Several elegant studies using synaptosome preparations and permeabilized PC12 cells have suggested that SNAP-25 may act in the late post-docking steps of exocytosis (20Chen Y.A. Scales S.J.

A. 1999; 96: 7256-7261Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, there are many questions that can only be answered by directly investigating neurons in vivo, especially at their functional synaptic junctions. For instance, it has been shown that SNAP-25 is palmitoylated and that palmitoylation is required for its membrane association (11Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lane S.R. Liu Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our current experiments demonstrate that although the Ala85,88,90 mutant still binds syntaxin and forms SNARE complex in vitro, it does not have any significant effect on glutamate release, indicating that the mutant likely fails to target to synaptic sites or it may not function properly at the synapses. Overexpression of the wild-type and N-terminal deletion mutant Δ1–31 slightly inhibited glutamate release from granule cell cultures (Figs.7 and 8 and Table I), which agrees with a previous study involving hippocampal neurons overexpressing SNAP-25 using Semliki Forest virus (31Owe-Larsson B. Berglund M. Kristensson K. Garoff H. Larhammar D. Brodin L. Low P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Perhaps the excess SNAP-25 interfered with the dynamics of the SNAREs by binding to its targets, e.g.syntaxin and/or synaptotagmin. The C-terminal deletion mutant was able to act as a more effective dominant negative mutant to inhibit glutamate release, and it was shown to act directly on the formation of the vesicle docking/fusion complex (Fig. 4). The inhibition of SNARE core complex assembly by Δ180–206 was unexpected because previous studies suggests that the C terminus of SNAP-25 is not essential for the formation of the ternary complex and that it is only required for the formation of SDS resistant complexes (4Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This is likely because the deletion mutant was significantly less effective in promoting the formation of the SNARE core complex, thus less ternary complexes were formed under the assay condition (Fig. 3). The inhibitory effect by Δ180–206 seemed to be dependent on the molar ratio between syntaxin and wild-type SNAP-25, with a maximal inhibition at a SNAP-25 to syntaxin ratio of 1–1.5:1. At a lower SNAP-25 to syntaxin ratio, the Δ180–206 mutant slightly enhanced SNARE core complex assembly (data not shown).

Transcriptional activators and repressors compete with general transcription factors at each step to influence the course of the assembly. To investigate this process, the TBP·TATA complex was titrated with HMG-1 and the interaction monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The titration produced a ternary HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex, which exhibits increased mobility relative to the TBP·TATA complex. The addition of increasing levels of TFIIB to this complex results in the formation of the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex. However, in the reverse titration, with very high mole ratios of HMG-1 present, TFIIB is not dissociated off and a complex is formed that contains all factors. The simultaneous addition of E1A to a mixture of TBP and TATA; or HMG-1, TBP, and TATA; or TFIIB, TBP, and TATA inhibits complex formation. On the other hand, E1A added to the pre-established complexes shows a significantly reduced capability to disrupt the complex.

The successful completion of the stepwise formation of PIC is prerequisite to the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription. The initial steps in assembly involve the binding of TFIID to the TATA element in the promoter, in which recognition and binding occurs through the sequence-specific subunit, the TATA-binding protein (TBP). This is followed by the binding of TFIIB to form the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex, which represents the molecular platform for the subsequent complexation with RNA polymerase II/TFIIF and other general transcription factors essential for basal level transcription. However, there are a multitude of regulatory proteins, activator and repressor proteins and cofactors, that may actively impinge on the assembly process, leading to either an enhancement or inhibition of the level of transcription (reviewed in Refs. 1Hampsey M.

HMG-1 has been reported to bind to the TBP·TATA complex, which inhibits subsequent TFIIB binding, resulting in incomplete PIC assembly and thereby inhibiting transcription.

In this work, we used a sensitive gel shift assay and provide direct evidence that HMG-1 forms a stable EMSA complex with TBP·TATA. The complex exhibits an increased mobility relative to the TBP·TATA complex, contrary to EMSA findings with other reported DNA·protein complexes. The TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex is stable in the presence of low levels of HMG-1, but conditions in which there are high excesses of HMG-1 produce a complex that contains both HMG-1 and TFIIB. Furthermore, adenovirus E1A inhibits the formation of the TBP·TATA, HMG-1·TBP·TATA, and TFIIB·TBP·TATA complexes, while the pre-established complexes resist dissociation by E1A. The addition of excess TBP re-establishes the complexes, indicating that TBP is the primary target for E1A action in all complexes. Calf thymus HMG-1 was purified in non-denaturing conditions using salt extraction, differential ammonium sulfate precipitation, and fractionation by HPLC using a MonoQ column as outlined previously (44Marmillot P.

Shenk) and was purified by binding to glutathione agarose, elution by glutathione, followed by dialysis into reaction buffer (47Taylor D.A. Kraus V.B. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Kraus W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4714-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins were greater than 80% pure as evidenced by Coomassie staining of gels run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides that make up the adenovirus major late promoter (Ad MLP; −40 to −1) were purchased from National Biosystems and 32P-end-labeled. The DNA (approximately 0.4 ng) was reacted with human TBP (approximately 1 nm unless indicated otherwise), with and without other transcription factors, in binding buffer (24 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm spermidine, 5 μg/ml poly(dG-dC), and 50 μg/ml BSA) for 30 min at 30 °C or 4 °C, as indicated. The reaction mixture was loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.35× TBE buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and the electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C. The gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) used in competition studies for TBP binding with the Ad MLP DNA contained either the wild-type or mutated TATA motif. Binding studies were carried out by either simultaneous addition of all components, or alternatively, the final transcription factor was added 30 min after the initial complex was established and reaction was continued for an additional 30 min. For supershift experiments, the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and then the antibody (polyclonal α-HMG-1 from R. Roeder or affinity-purified α-TFIIB from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was added at 4 °C for 10 min before loading the gel. HMG-1 was reported to bind to TBP both as a GST-TBP fusion protein and when TBP was complexed with the TATA element in the adenovirus major late promoter (Ad MLP) (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize this interaction, the titration of the TBP·TATA complex with HMG-1 was followed by EMSA. Preliminary experiments showed that the glutamate buffer system consistently produced an EMSA-stable TBP·TATA complex and provided an essential ”window“ to determine if competing factors affected the TBP·TATA interaction. Fig.1 A shows that the addition of HMG-1 produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the original band for the TBP·TATA complex, with the concomitant increase in a single band for an HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex. Interestingly, the new band exhibited an increased mobility relative to that for the TBP·TATA complex. Fig. 1 B shows that this complex required the presence of both TBP and HMG-1 and could be titrated away with cold oligonucleotide containing the TATA sequence, whereas it was unaffected by the addition of an oligonucleotide containing the GCTA sequence in lieu of TATA. Fig. 1 C confirms the presence of HMG-1 in the new complex, because the band was supershifted by anti-HMG-1, whereas the anti-TFIIB control produced no effect. These data indicate that the HMG-1 binding was dependent on both the TATA sequence and TBP and the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex exhibited an anomalous increased mobility. The unusual mobility is not unique to this electrophoretic buffer system, because the increased mobility of the complex was also observed using other buffers (data not shown). Therefore, this electrophoretic behavior is a characteristic of this complex under a variety of conditions. Fig. 2 compares the relative stability of the TBP·TATA and HMG-1·TBP·TATA complexes at a number of TBP levels. At equal levels of TBP, the band intensity for the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex was significantly greater than that for the corresponding TBP·TATA (and also in relation to the free DNA band intensity) at all levels of TBP examined. This indicates that HMG-1 binding enhanced complex formation, by at least 10-fold, leading to an increased population of the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex. In similar experiments in which individual structural domains of HMG-1 (the A-box and B-box domains; residues 1–89 and 86–165, respectively) were reacted with the TBP·TATA complex, the mobility and the band intensity of the TBP·TATA complex was unchanged, even at [HMG-1 box/TBP] mole ratios as high as 2000 (data not shown). The addition of the individual A- and B-boxes together also exhibited no changes (data not shown). The addition of TFIIB to the TBP·TATA complex forms the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex, which, like the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex, also exhibits a greater stability in gel shift experiments than does the TBP·TATA complex (48Burtowski S. Sopta M. Greenblatt J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7509-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 2W. Lu, R. Peterson, A. Dasgupta, and W. M. Scovell, unpublished data. However, unlike the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex, this ternary complex exhibits a reduced mobility relative to the TBP·TATA complex. It was of interest to determine if TFIIB and HMG-1 compete for overlapping sites on the TBP·TATA complex or whether these two factors bind simultaneously to TBP·TATA and form a stable complex. This electrophoretic buffer system provides a convenient means to resolve this question, because the two complexes exhibit opposite mobilities in the EMSA system. Fig.3 A shows that the addition of increasing amounts of TFIIB to the TBP, TATA, and limiting HMG-1 (sufficient for complex formation) mixture resulted in the formation of the TFIIB· TBP·TATA complex. At a [TFIIB/HMG-1] mole ratio of 0.2 (lane 3), there was a 50/50 mixture of the two complexes, whereas only the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex was detectable at or above a mole ratio 0.6 (lane 5). This indicates that TFIIB bound much more effectively than HMG-1 to the TBP·TATA complex. In the reverse titration (lanes 8–14), limiting amounts of TFIIB were used to permit TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex formation, with the addition of increasing levels of HMG-1. The addition of HMG-1, up to mole ratios of less than 0.4 (lane 10) had no effect on the complex, consistent with the data in lanes 1–7. However, as the levels of HMG-1 were increased enormously, with the [TFIIB/HMG-1] mole ratio in the range of 0.3–0.03 (lanes 12–14), a band of intermediate mobility was produced, indicating that a simple HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex was not formed. Fig. 3 B shows that the band in lane 7 in 3A was not supershifted by anti-HMG-1 (lane 2) but was supershifted by the addition of anti-TFIIB (lane 3), indicating that the complex contained TFIIB·TBP·TATA. Fig.3 C shows similar results that examined whether TFIIB remained in the complex after TFIIB·TBP·TATA was reacted with large excesses of HMG-1. Lane 2 shows that anti-TFIIB supershifted this complex (lane 1 is the same complex from lane 14 in Fig. 3 A). Under these conditions of limiting TFIIB and huge excesses of HMG-1, TFIIB remained in this complex, with the resultant formation of a TFIIB·HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex. The adenovirus E1A protein can either activate or repress transcription presumably by interacting with coactivators, the PIC, or components at different stages in the assembling preinitiation complex. Fig.4 shows the effect of the GST-E1A fusion protein on disrupting the TBP·TATA (Fig. 4 A), TFIIB·TBP·TATA (Fig. 4 B), and the HMG-1·TBP·TATA (Fig. 4 C) complexes. This experiment was carried out by either (a) the addition of GST-E1A after the complexes were established (lanes 1–6) or (b) by simultaneous addition of all proteins (lanes 7–12). Fig. 4 reveals that similar results were observed for all complexes examined. The presence of E1A was able to completely inhibit complex formation if E1A was added simultaneously with all components. On the other hand, E1A was unable to effect complete complex dissociation of the established complexes, but did partially disrupt them at the highest GST-E1A levels (approximately 80 ng). The control reaction in which GST was added alone exhibited no effect. To begin to understand the mechanism of E1A action and investigate the primary target of E1A, add-back experiments were carried out. In these experiments, sufficient E1A was added to just obviate the formation of the original three complexes, followed by addition of increasing amounts of TBP, HMG-1, or TFIIB to the respective complexes, in an attempt to compete with E1A and, as a result, re-establish the complexes. Fig. 5 (A,B, and D) shows that the addition of increasing levels of TBP to the mixture of E1A, DNA, and TBP (A); TFIIB and TBP (B); or HMG-1 and TBP (C) re-established each of the three complexes at about the same level. In each case, it requires an 8-fold increase of TBP. Of importance is that the [TBP/E1A] mole ratio at the point of the re-established complexes was about 0.3 in all cases. In the case in which increasing levels of TFIIB were added back to the TBP, TFIIB, E1A, oligonucleotide mixture (Fig.5 C), a [TFIIB/E1A] mole ratio of greater than 60 (last lane) had very little effect. In the case of adding increasing levels of HMG-1 back to the corresponding HMG-1, TBP, E1A, oligonucleotide mixture (Fig. 5 E), a [HMG-1/E1A] mole ratio of greater than 50 (last lane) was found to have no significant effect. These results indicate that the primary interaction of E1A was with TBP in all the complexes examined. The action of regulatory proteins on the formation of the transcriptional preinitiation complex determines the rate at which transcriptional initiation will ensue, and indeed, the fate of the committed complex. The regulation of PIC assembly itself, by a dynamic balance in the binding of general factors and activator and repressor proteins, is an important element in transcriptional control. We have examined the early stages of PIC assembly, with the focus on the ternary complexes containing TBP·TATA and either HMG-1 or TFIIB and the effect of E1A on the course of the assembly process. Reaction of TBP·TATA with increasing concentrations of HMG-1 produced a distinct EMSA complex, which is dependent on the presence of both TBP and a TATA-containing oligonucleotide, with the band being supershifted by anti-HMG-1. Identification of this complex as HMG-1·TBP·TATA is in accord with a previous report (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMG-1 occurs as a monomer in solution and, although the stoichiometry of the complex is not known, HMG-1 is presumed to bind as a monomer. Interestingly, the mobility of the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex is increased relative to that for TBP·TATA complex and differs from the mobility of the complex in the previous study (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As far as we know, the increased mobility observed, as a result of another protein complexing with TBP·TATA, has not been observed previously for any other EMSA complexes. This unexpected mobility may be influenced by the electrophoretic buffer but is fundamentally a result of either the large net negative charge on HMG-1 (−9), the ability of HMG-1 to alter the bend angle of DNA in the complex and/or shape of the complex (49Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), or contributions from both. Previous studies have shown that the sequence-specific binding affinity of a number of regulatory factors, including steroid receptor proteins (50Onate, S. A., Prendergast, P., Wagner, J.

Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), p53 (53Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and the Oct-POU domains of Oct-1, -2, and -6 (54Zwilling S. Konig H. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), was stimulated in the presence of HMG-1. In these cases, although the original EMSA band for the complex did increase in intensity, its position did not shift in the presence of HMG-1. The behavior of HMG-1 in these systems contrasts with our findings that indicate the formation of an EMSA-stable HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex. The stability of the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex is greater than that for the TBP·TATA complex as evidenced that, at equivalent amounts of TBP, there is significantly more HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex than TBP·TATA complex. This enhancement of complexation is similar to that observed for both TFIIB and/or TFIIA bound to the TBP·TATA complex. In addition, we find no evidence that the A- and B-boxes of HMG-1 bind with the TBP·TATA complex (data not shown), suggesting that the stable HMG-1 binding may involve multiple-site interactions between HMG-1 and the TBP·TATA complex. The requirement for multiple-site interactions is quite common in stable protein-protein interactions and has been proposed, for example, in the binding of E7 protein to TBP and for E1A protein binding to the retinoblastoma protein (55Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 56Dyson N. Guida P. McCall C. Harlow E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4606-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Added support for this proposal comes from competition experiments in which HMG-1 is not competed off the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex by high levels (600-fold excess) of A- and B-boxes, either individually or together (data not shown). These findings may also suggest that the C-terminal domain of HMG-1, which contains a highly acidic tail, may take part in the stable interaction with TBP. This possibility has been suggested previously (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that addition of increasing levels of TFIIB could not restore basal level transcription in an HMG-1-inhibited in vitro assay (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 3 A(lanes 1–7), increasing levels of TFIIB, in the context of limiting HMG-1, does effectively prevent HMG-1 binding in the complex, resulting in the formation of TFIIB·TBP·TATA. Fig. 3 Bshows that this band is supershifted by anti-TFIIB, but not by anti-HMG-1, indicating that the band corresponds to the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex. The reverse titration, done in conditions of limiting TFIIB, showed that low levels of HMG-1 had no effect on TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex formation (in agreement with the previous titration). The addition of very high levels of HMG-1, however, produced a band, intermediate in mobility to the TFIIB·TBP·TATA and the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complexes. The presence of TFIIB in this complex was confirmed, because the addition of anti-TFIIB produced a supershift of the band (Fig. 3 C). These data indicate that the band represents a complex that contains both TFIIB and HMG-1 and, under our conditions, this complex is observed only at high HMG-1 levels that were used in an attempt to compete off TFIIB. An EMSA complex assumed to be HMG-1·TFIIB·TBP·TATA was reported previously, but no evidence for the presence of TFIIB in the complex was presented (57Sutrias-Grau M. Bianchi M.E. Bernues J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1628-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that there are conditions in which an intermediate complex can be formed, which contains TBP·TATA, with the simultaneous and stable binding of both HMG-1 and TFIIB. It should be pointed out that the transcription factor, TFIIB, is conformationally pliable as indicated by both structural and biochemical studies. It has been shown that transcriptional activators, such as VP16 and Pho4 (58Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,59Wu W.-H. Hampsey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2764-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), induce a conformational change in TFIIB, and this behavior is consistent with what was observed in conditions of very different levels of HMG-1 in our experiments. The finding that TFIIB is very effective in competing limiting amounts of the transcriptional inhibitor, HMG-1, from the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex is consistent with both factors competing for the same or overlapping binding sites on the TBP· TATA complex. The crystal structure for the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex shows that TFIIB binds to residue 289 at the junction of S2′-S3′ in the second stirrup of TBP (26Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 70), suggesting this region as a potential target. In addition, TFIIB interaction also involves binding to DNA, both upstream and downstream of the TATA element (8Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 58Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 59Wu W.-H. Hampsey M. Proc.

Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), which HMG-1 binding may also include. Another aspect of this, which may not be mutually exclusive, is that HMG-1 binding to TBP may lead to an alteration of the bond angle of the DNA. The presence of the E1A protein is devastating to the assembly of all complexes investigated. It does not just inhibit HMG-1 or TFIIB from associating with TBP on the TATA element, it completely inhibits the formation of the TBP·TATA, HMG-1·TBP·TATA, and the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complexes (when all factors are added simultaneously). Because E1A is known to bind to TBP (17Lee D.K. Dejong J. Hashimoto S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Berk A.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6465-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), this is consistent with E1A·TBP complexation in solution, resulting in the inhibition of TBP binding to the TATA sequence. This may also suggest that TBP is a highly specific target for E1A, with binding to the other factors being less significant in this context. Consistent with this proposal, approximately the same level of E1A was effective in inhibiting formation of all three complexes. On the other hand, if these three complexes are established before E1A addition, E1A exhibits only a weakly disruptive effect. Although there is some reduction in the level of complex, a significant amount of complex remains even at the highest levels of E1A. These data indicate that E1A is significantly less effective in dissociating or disrupting the preformed complex than it is in inhibiting the assembly of the factors before complexation. HMG-1 shares some common features with the general transcriptional repressor, Dr1 (24Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D.

A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HMG-1 and Dr1 repressor proteins bind directly to TBP, both in solution and in the TBP·TATA complex, leading to a reduced transcriptional activity due to inhibition of PIC formation. However, although Dr1 inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the concentrations of TFIIA, RNA polymerase II, or the other general transcription factors (25Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), inhibition of transcription by HMG-1 can be reversed by increased levels of TFIIA, but not TFIIB (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Future studies must be done to reveal further the extent of similarity of these two repressors. To gain some initial insight into the mechanism of action and the primary targets for E1A in these complexes, add-back experiments were performed. The addition of increased levels of TBP to a solution with sufficient E1A to inhibit TBP·TATA formation (Fig. 5 A) led to the re-establishment of the TBP·TATA complex. The complex was completely re-established at about an 8-fold increase in TBP. This was consistent with previous findings that TBP is a target for E1A (24Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and that the addition of excess TBP in these experiments overcomes TBP·E1A complexation and permits productive TBP·TATA complex formation. This effect of TBP is a strong one in that it occurs at a low mole ratio (0.3) of [TBP/E1A]. TBP is likewise able to re-establish the TFIIB·TBP·TATA and the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complexes (Fig. 5, B and D) at approximately this same mole ratio of [TBP/E1A]. On the other hand, the addition of comparable mole ratios of TFIIB/E1A was ineffective in re-establishing the TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex (Fig. 5 C). In fact, a [TFIIB/E1A] mole ratio of greater than 60 produced no significant TFIIB·TBP·TATA complex formation. The same was true for attempts to re-establish the HMG-1·TBP·TATA complex (Fig. 5 E), in which a [HMG-1/E1A] mole ratio of greater than 50 had only a small effect. These collective findings indicate that E1A is specific for targeting TBP, with neither TFIIB nor HMG-1 being targets for E1A binding. In comparison with similar competition studies in which the 12S E1A product was used with Dr1, TBP, and a TATA-containing DNA, enormous excesses (microgram quantities) of E1A were required to inhibit assembly of the Dr1·TBP·TATA complex (26Kraus V.B.

Nonetheless, our results indicate that E1A has the capability of preventing the initial stages of PIC formation and, therefore, may lead to inhibition of transcription. We thank F. Pugh, D. Reinberg, and T. Shenk for the expression vectors for TBP, TFIIB, and GST-E1A, respectively, and to R. Roeder for polyclonal antibody to calf thymus HMG-1."

To characterize the binding of LPL to lipoproteins, we studied the binding of low density lipoproteins (LDL), apolipoprotein (apo) B17, and various apoB-FLAG (DYKDDDDK octapeptide) chimeras to purified LPL. LDL bound to LPL with high affinity (Kd values of 10−12m) similar to that observed for the binding of LDL to its receptors and 1D1, a monoclonal antibody to LDL, and was greater than its affinity for microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. LDL-LPL binding was sensitive to both salt and detergents, indicating the involvement of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. In contrast, the N-terminal 17% of apoB interacted with LPL mainly via ionic interactions. Binding of various apoB fusion peptides suggested that LPL bound to apoB at multiple sites within apoB17. Tetrahydrolipstatin, a potent enzyme activity inhibitor, had no effect on apoB-LPL binding, indicating that the enzyme activity was not required for apoB binding. LDL-LPL binding was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies that recognize amino acids 380–410 in the C-terminal region of LPL, a region also shown to interact with heparin and LDL receptor-related protein. The LDL-LPL binding was also inhibited by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs); heparin inhibited the interactions by ∼50% and removal of trace amounts of heparin from LPL preparations increased LDL binding. Thus, we conclude that the high affinity binding between LPL and lipoproteins involves multiple ionic and hydrophobic interactions, does not require enzyme activity and is modulated by GAGs. It is proposed that LPL contains a surface exposed positively charged amino acid cluster that may be important for various physiological interactions of LPL with different biologically important molecules. Moreover, we postulate that by binding to this cluster, GAGs modulate the association between LDL and LPL and the in vivo metabolism of LPL.

Moreover, we postulate that by binding to this cluster, GAGs modulate the association between LDL and LPL and the in vivo metabolism of LPL. lipoprotein lipase apolipoprotein bovine serum albumin enzyme linked immunoassay glycosaminoglycans low density lipoprotein(s) microsomal triglyceride transfer protein phosphate buffered saline Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1 is a dynamic molecule that performs several functions during the catabolism of triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. First, it is essential for the hydrolysis of triglycerides present in the core of these lipoproteins. The hydrolysis results in the delivery of free fatty acids to peripheral tissues. Defects in the enzyme activity leads to Type 1 hyperlipidemia characterized by accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, defective chylomicron removal, and the development of pancreatitis (1Brunzell J.D.

Second, LPL anchors lipoproteins to the cell surface and matrix proteoglycans and increases their retention by subendothelial matrix and uptake by cells. Third, it acts as a ligand and binds to various members of the LDL receptor family and may play a role in the cellular endocytosis of lipoproteins (3Goldberg I.J. J.

LPL performs these various functions by physically interacting with lipoproteins, proteoglycans, and receptors. LPL favors binding to apoB-containing lipoproteins compared with apoA-I-containing lipoproteins. The molecular and biochemical basis for the binding of LPL to apoB-containing lipoproteins are not completely understood.It has been shown that protein-protein interactions between LPL and LDL involve the N-terminal 17% of apoB (5Choi S.Y.
