https://openalex.org/W2092332261,An empirical model and an ab initio calculation of the bulk moduli for covalent solids are used to suggest possible new hard materials. The empirical model indicates that hypothetical covalent solids formed between carbon and nitrogen are good candidates for extreme hardness. A prototype system is chosen and a first principles pseudopotential total energy calculation on the system is performed. The results are consistent with the empirical model and show that materials like the prototype can have bulk moduli comparable to or greater than diamond. It may be possible to synthesize such materials in the laboratory.

This device is based on two-photon writing, reading, and erasing of the information in a photochromic material embedded in a polymer matrix. Absorption and emission data show that two-photon writing and reading of information is feasible. The advantages and properties of such a 3-D optical memory are discussed."

The experimental procedure and the degree of independence achieved in the resulting SAMs are illustrated by examination of monolayers obtained by adsorption of alkanethiols on gold and alkane carboxylic acids on alumina. This procedure provides a method for modifying the surface characteristics of microlithographically generated patterns and offers a versatile technique for controlling solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial properties in systems having patterns with dimensions of the order of 1 micrometer."

https://openalex.org/W2078948821,"Spatially resolved resistivity measurements of current transport across individual grain boundaries have been made on superconducting YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7). These experiments were done by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy with a resolution of 1 to 2 micrometers, and they show directly the limitation of the critical current density caused by grain boundaries in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7). Furthermore, complex spatial patterns of the current transport across grain boundaries were observed. These patterns reflect self-excited resonances of the grain boundaries and are closely correlated to the unexplained ""sub-gap structure"" in the current-voltage characteristics of polycrystalline YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7)."

New operational control and performance measurement systems are recognizing the importance of direct measurement of quality, manufacturing lead times, flexibility, and customer responsiveness, as well as more accurate measures of the actual costs of consumed resources. Activity-based cost systems can assign the costs of indirect and support resources to the specific products and activities that benefit from these resources. Both operational control and activity-based systems represent new opportunities for improved managerial information in complex, technologically advanced environments."
https://openalex.org/W1994984027,"Since 1962 the crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, has caused the devastation of living coral in large tracts of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Some authorities view this as a modern phenomenon, resulting from ecological disturbance caused by man. Evidence from skeletal remains in sediment suggests that large A. planci populations have been part of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem for at least 8000 years. Coral predation by A. planci is likely to have influenced the morphological fabric of the Great Barrier Reef in its post-glacial development and may also have influenced species richness of the reef biota."

https://openalex.org/W1971893866,"Several instances of multiple imaging of cosmologically distant sources by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters have been discovered over the past decade. These ""gravitational lenses"" have distinctive optical properties. Pointlike sources such as quasars generally produce two or four images when lensed, whereas extended sources such as galaxies produce spectacular arcs and rings. The salient features of most of the observations can be reproduced with the use of simple elliptical lens models that approximate the lenses made by ellipsoidal mass distributions such as are common in the universe. In addition to illustrating simple optics in operation on a cosmological scale, multiple images and arcs provide useful probes of the lensing galaxies and clusters. Also, gravitational lenses can make magnified images of cosmologically distant sources and may eventually furnish important cosmographic data such as the Hubble constant."
