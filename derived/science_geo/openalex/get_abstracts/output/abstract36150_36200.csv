https://openalex.org/W1593965037,"Activation of human platelets by complement proteins C5b-9 is accompanied by the release of small plasma membrane vesicles (microparticles) that are highly enriched in binding sites for coagulation factor Va and exhibit prothrombinase activity. We have now examined whether assembly of the prothrombinase enzyme complex (factors VaXa) is directly linked to the process of microparticle formation. Gel-filtered platelets were incubated without stirring with various agonists at 37 °C, and the functional expression of cell surface receptors on platelets and on shed microparticles was analyzed using specific monoclonal antibodies and fluorescence-gated flow cytometry. In addition to the C5b-9 proteins, thrombin, collagen, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were each found to induce formation of platelet microparticles that incorporated plasma membrane glycoproteins GP Ib, IIb, and IIIa. These microparticles were enriched in binding sites for factor Va, and their formation paralleled the expression of catalytic surface for the prothrombinase enzyme complex. Little or no microparticle release or prothrombinase activity were observed when platelets were stimulated with epinephrine and ADP, despite exposure of platelet fibrinogen receptors by these agonists. When platelets were exposed to thrombin plus collagen, the shed microparticles contained activated GP IIb-IIIa complexes that bound fibrinogen. By contrast, GP IIb-IIIa incorporated into C5b-9 induced microparticles did not express fibrinogen receptor function. Platelets from a patient with an isolated defect in inducible procoagulant activity (Scott syndrome) were found to be markedly impaired in their capacity to generate microparticles in response to all platelet activators, and this was accompanied by a comparable decrease in the number and function of inducible factor Va receptors. Taken together, these data indicate that the exposure of the platelet factor Va receptor is directly coupled to plasma membrane vesiculation and that this event can be dissociated from other activation-dependent platelet responses. Since a catalytic membrane surface is required for optimal thrombin generation, platelet microparticle formation may play a role in the normal hemostatic response to vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1971681144,"The 3'----5' exonuclease active site of E. coli DNA polymerase I is predicted to be conserved for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases based on amino acid sequence homology. Three amino acid regions containing the critical residues in the E. coli DNA polymerase I involved in metal binding, single-stranded DNA binding, and catalysis of the exonuclease reaction are located in the amino-terminal half and in the same linear arrangement in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases. Site-directed mutagenesis at the predicted exonuclease active site of the phi 29 DNA polymerase, a model enzyme for prokaryotic and eukaryotic alpha-like DNA polymerases, specifically inactivated the 3'----5' exonuclease activity of the enzyme. These results reflect a high evolutionary conservation of this catalytic domain. Based on structural and functional data, a modular organization of enzymatic activities in prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases is also proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1560104562,"Human neutrophils have been labeled in 1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine (alkyl-PC) with 32P by incubation with alkyl-[32P]lysoPC. Upon stimulation with the chemotactic peptide, formylMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP), these 32P-labeled cells produce 1-O-alkyl-[32P]phosphatidic acid (alkyl-[32P]PA) and, in the presence of ethanol, 1-O-alkyl-[32P]phosphatidylethanol (alkyl-[32P]PEt). Because the cellular ATP contains no 32P, alkyl-[32P]PA and alkyl-[32P]PEt must be formed from alkyl-[32P]PC by phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation, respectively. Analyses of the sn-1 bonds by selective hydrolysis and mass measurements reveal that the PA and PEt formed during stimulation contain both ester and ether bonds with distributions similar to that in the endogenous PC. Furthermore, in neutrophils labeled in alkyl-[32P]PC, the specific activities of the diradyl-PA and diradyl-PEt formed during stimulation are similar to that of diradyl-PC. These results demonstrate that the fMLP-induced PLD utilizes diradyl-PC as the major substrate. It is further concluded that, at early times (30 s), PA and PEt are both formed almost exclusively by PLD. Following stimulation with fMLP, neutrophils double-labeled in alkyl-PC by incubation with [3H]alkyl-lysoPC and alkyl-[32P]lysoPC generate [3H]alkyl-DG and [32P]orthophosphate [( 32P]PO4) with superimposable kinetics, indicating degradation of PA by a phosphohydrolase. Generation of [3H]alkyl-DG and [32P]PO4 lags behind PA formation and parallels the decline in PA accumulation. In addition, generation of both [3H]alkyl-PA and [3H]alkyl-DG requires extracellular Ca2+ and cytochalasin B. Furthermore, the phosphohydrolase inhibitor, propranolol, decreases both [3H]alkyl-DG and [32P]PO4 while increasing [3H]alkyl-PA and not altering [3H]alkyl-PEt. Moreover, the decreases in DG are accounted for by increases in PA. These results demonstrate that PLD-derived alkyl-PA is degraded by a phosphohydrolase to produce alkyl-DG. DG formed during stimulation contains both ester and ether-linked species and this DG formation is inhibited completely by propranolol. Upon stimulation, alkyl-[32P]PC-labeled neutrophils do not produce [32P]phosphocholine, suggesting that PC is not hydrolyzed by phospholipase C. In addition, PA is formed in amounts sufficient to account for all of the DG formed during stimulation. It is concluded that the DG formed during fMLP stimulation is derived almost exclusively from PC via the PLD/PA phosphohydrolase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1972960760,"We have located the distal boundary of the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGF receptor and have identified a distinct sequence in the C' terminus required for EGF-dependent receptor internalization, leading to receptor down-regulation and degradation. Within this receptor domain, an 18 amino acid highly negatively charged region of predicted helical structure is required both for endocytosis via a high-affinity, saturable pathway and for ligand-stimulated increases in cytosolic calcium. In contrast to kinase-inactive, internalization-competent receptors, kinase-active, internalization-defective receptors effectively signaled gene transcription, morphological transformation, and growth. These observations support the hypothesis that mitogenic responses to EGF are mediated by activation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the membrane-bound receptor, with ligand-induced internalization serving to terminate the signal."

By combining genetic and molecular approaches, we have isolated the melanoma oncogene. We show that its level of expression correlates with the degree of malignancy of the tumour.

https://openalex.org/W1538257577,"Abstract We present evidence that a foreign gene driven by natural mammalian regulatory elements can be targeted to hepatocytes and the resultant gene expression made to persist. This was accomplished using a soluble DNA carrier system consisting of two covalently linked components: 1) a polycation, poly-L-lysine, that can bind DNA in a strong but non-damaging interaction, and 2) an asialoglycoprotein which can be targeted specifically to hepatocytes by cell surface asialoglycoprotein receptors unique to this cell type. A plasmid, palb-CAT, containing the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) driven by mouse albumin regulatory sequences was complexed to the carrier system. Intravenous injection of palb-CAT DNA in the form of a complex resulted in the presence of CAT enzyme activity in liver homogenates 24 h after injection. The targeted gene expression, however, was transient, reaching a maximum of 10 units/g liver at 24 h but was not detectable by 96 h. However, partial hepatectomy 30 min after injection resulted in persistent high levels of hepatic CAT activity (11.3 units/g) through 11 weeks post-injection. Southern analysis of livers 11 weeks after partial hepatectomy demonstrated that some of the targeted DNA had been integrated into the host genome. We conclude that a foreign gene driven by natural mammalian regulatory elements can be delivered to hepatocytes by intravenous injection in vivo using a soluble DNA carrier system. Foreign gene expression targeted in this manner can be made to persist by stimulation of hepatocyte replication."
https://openalex.org/W1524146716,"During the process of endochondral bone formation, proliferating chondrocytes give rise to hypertrophic chondrocytes, which then deposit a mineralized matrix to form calcified cartilage. Chondrocyte hypertrophy and matrix mineralization are associated with expression of type X collagen and the induction of high levels of the bone/liver/kidney isozyme of alkaline phosphatase. To determine what role vitamin C plays in these processes, chondrocytes derived from the cephalic portion of 14-day chick embryo sternae were grown in the absence or presence of exogenous ascorbic acid. Control untreated cells displayed low levels of type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase activity throughout the culture period. However, cells grown in the presence of ascorbic acid produced increasing levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and type X collagen mRNA and protein. Both alkaline phosphatase activity and type X collagen mRNA levels began to increase within 24 h of ascorbate treatment; by 9 days, the levels of both alkaline phosphatase activity and type X collagen mRNA were 15–20-fold higher than in nonascorbate-treated cells. Ascorbate treatment also increased calcium deposition in the cell layer and decreased the levels of types II and IX collagen mRNAs; these effects lagged significantly behind the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and type X collagen. Addition of β-glycerophosphate to the medium increased calcium deposition in the presence of ascorbate but had no effect on levels of collagen mRNAs or alkaline phosphatase. The results suggest that vitamin C may play an important role in endochondral bone formation by modulating gene expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2048278170,"We describe a new role for fatty acylation. Conditions were established under which vesicular transport from the cis to the medial Golgi compartment in vitro depends strongly upon the addition of a fatty acyl-coenzyme A, e.g., palmitoyl-CoA. Using an inhibitor of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, we demonstrate that the fatty acid has to be activated by CoA to stimulate transport. A nonhydrolyzable analog of palmitoyl-CoA competitively inhibits transport. Electron microscopy and biochemical studies show that fatty acyl-CoA is required for budding of (non-clathrin-) coated transport vesicles from Golgi cisternae and that budding is inhibited by the nonhydrolyzable analog."
https://openalex.org/W1536942450,"Abstract It has been claimed that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium pool in liver and pancreatic acinar cells is located in specified organelles (calciosomes) which are characterized by their content of the calcium-binding protein calsequestrin (Volpe, P., Krause, K. H., Hashimoto, S., Zorzato, F., Pozzan, T., Meldolesi, J., and Lew, D. P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 1091-1095). We show here that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive compartment of rat liver does not contain calsequestrin-like material. Instead four non-membraneous calcium-binding glycoproteins with approximate molecular masses of 59, 60, 80, and 90 kDa were found. The 59-, 80-, and 90-kDa proteins were of the high mannose-rich type, the carbohydrate moiety of the 60-kDa protein was of the complex hybrid type with terminal galactoses. All four proteins had high affinity binding sites for calcium (KD between 1 and 5 microM) and from 1 to 5 binding sites/molecule. The 80- and the 90-kDa proteins had also low affinity binding sites (KD 400 and 600 microM, respectively, with 13 and 15 binding sites/molecule, respectively). A comparison of the NH2-terminal sequences revealed that the 60-kDa calcium-binding protein represents the rat liver calregulin, whereas the 90-kDa calcium-binding protein represents grp94. The sequences did not reveal any relationship of the 80-kDa protein with grp78, or of the 59-kDa protein with protein disulfide isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W2046790624,"For the IIIB isolate of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the immunodominant determinant of the envelope protein gp160 for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) of H-2d mice is in a region of high sequence variability among HIV-1 isolates. The general requirements for CTL recognition of peptide antigens and the relation of recognition requirements to the natural variation in sequence of the HIV were investigated. For this purpose, a CTL line specific for the homologous segment of the envelope from the MN isolate of HIV-1 and restricted by the same class I major histocompatibility (MHC) molecule (Dd) as the IIIB-specific CTLs was raised from mice immunized with MN-env-recombinant vaccinia virus. The IIIB-specific and MN-specific CTLs were completely non-cross-reactive. Reciprocal exchange of a single amino acid between the two peptide sequences, which differed in 6 of 15 residues, led to a complete reversal of the specificity of the peptides in sensitizing targets, such that the IIIB-specific CTLs lysed targets exposed to the singly substituted MN peptide and vice versa. These data indicate the importance of single residues in defining peptide epitopic specificity and have implications for both the effect of immune pressure on selection of viral mutants and the design of effective vaccines."

https://openalex.org/W1987043992,"Autocrine growth due to dysregulated growth factor production may have a role in the development of neoplasia. Whether autocrine growth is stimulated by growth factor secretion in an autocrine loop or by intracellular binding of the growth factor to a receptor has been unclear. The carboxyl-terminus coding sequence for murine interleukin-3 (IL-3) was extended with an oligonucleotide encoding a four-amino acid endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cells became growth factor-independent when the modified IL-3 gene was introduced by retroviral gene transfer, despite lack of secretion of the modified IL-3. Hence autocrine growth can occur as a result of the intracellular action of a growth factor and this mechanism may be important in neoplastic and normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562772426,"Cadmium-sulfide crystallites form in the yeast Candida glabrata cultured in the presence of cadmium salts. The particles function to sequester and detoxify intracellular cadmium ions. The crystallites are peptide-coated, but the coating peptide varies with the nutrient conditions of the growth medium. When cultured in rich nutrient broth the yeast forms intracellular CdS particles coated with a mixture of glutathione and the γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptide. In contrast, cultures in synthetic minimal medium yield particles coated with polymerized γEC peptides of general structure (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly. Glutathione/γ-glutamylcysteine particles exhibit properties analogous to quantum, semiconductor-type crystallites. The optical properties are dependent on particle size, and irradiation results in photoluminescence and photoreduction not observed in bulk CdS mineral. Aerobic irradiation leads to particle decomposition presumably via oxidation of the sulfide ions within the crystallite."
https://openalex.org/W2142957866,"Methods for studying pre-mRNA splicing in Xenopus oocytes have been improved to allow simultaneous analysis of the splicing reaction and the formation of splicing complexes in vivo. The number, order of appearance, and dependence on intact U1 and U2 snRNPs of complexes formed in vivo on a pre-mRNA substrate are similar but not identical to those observed in vitro. The migration on native gels of the complexes formed in vivo and in vitro is, however, dissimilar. RNAase H-mediated inhibition of splicing caused by oligonucleotide microinjection can be overcome by coinjection of a gene encoding the U snRNA that is targeted for cleavage. Transcripts from the injected gene complement the defect in splicing by assembling into functionally active U snRNPs. Using this assay, mutant U2 snRNAs have been tested for their ability to function in splicing and in splicing complex formation. The results indicate that much of the U2 snRNA, including regions essential for detectable binding of the U2-specific proteins A' and B"", is dispensable for splicing."

https://openalex.org/W1562217417,"The role of Manduca sexta lipid transfer particle (LTP) in the transport of lipid from fat body to lipophorin was investigated in vitro. Fat body that contained radiolabeled lipid was incubated with either high density lipophorin or low density lipophorin, and it was shown that lipid was transferred from fat body to lipophorins. The transfer of diacylglycerol was blocked by preincubating fat body with LTP antibody. Furthermore, transfer was restored by the addition of LTP, indicating that LTP promotes the transfer of lipid from fat body to lipophorins. Using lipophorins radiolabeled in their lipid moiety, transfer of lipid from lipophorin to fat body was demonstrated. This transfer was not mediated by LTP. The adipokinetic hormone-induced diacylglycerol mobilization from the fat body and the concomitant interconversion of high density lipophorin to low density lipophorin were performed in vitro and were shown to require the presence of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1499128958,"A phenomenological theory of gel electrophoresis is elaborated for protein-DNA complexes involving one, two, or three binding sites on the DNA molecule. The computed electrophoretic patterns simulate experimental patterns shown by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. The mechanism whereby the electrophoretic protein-DNA ladder is generated upon titration of the operator with repressor is embodied in theory of mass transport coupled to reversible interactions under chemical kinetic control. In contrast to strong interactions (association constant greater than 10(12) M-1), patterns observed with weak complexes (K less than 10(10) M-1) could be simulated only by applying the cage effect, a model of which is formulated. Theoretical underpinning is provided for the electrophoretic estimation of equilibrium association constants, and requisite chemical kinetic conditions are elucidated for direct estimation of the rate constant for dissociation of the protein-DNA complex from gel patterns. The theory thus affords an experimenter with a means for determining the conditions required to render the gel retardation method a valid procedure for evaluating equilibrium constants and/or kinetic parameters for the particular protein-nucleic acid system under investigation. These several considerations apply not only to interactions of proteins with nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) but also to a wide range of macromolecular interactions involving peptides, drugs, and other ligands as well as large assemblies such as multienzyme complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1574371706,"The β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyItransferase represents a member of a family of sialyltransferases which catalyze the terminal addition of sialic acid to maturing carbohydrate chains. We surveyed rat tissues using cDNA probes complementary to coding and noncoding domains of the rat liver α-2,6-sialyltransferase. In addition to the expected differences in the level of sialyltransferase mRNA among the tissues, there were dramatic qualitative differences as well. Hepatic sialyltransferase probes hybridize to mRNAs of varying size on Northern blots. A tissue-dependent pattern of expression of these transcripts is documented. Evidence is presented that the multiple transcripts are generated from a common gene sequence. At least one instance of alternate splicing in the generation of the kidney sialytransferase transcripts is predicted by S1 nuclease analysis. We report the isolation of a rat kidney cDNA clone, RKA, that substantiates this tissuespecific alternate splicing event. The RKA insert, although less than full-length, apparently encodes a polypeptide divergent from the reported hepatic α-2,6-sialyltransferase (1). RNA blot analysis indicates that the RKA-type transcripts represent a significant proportion of sialyltransferase RNA in rat kidney. Another class of kidney cDNA clones, RKE, is colinear with the hepatic sialyltransferase sequence. RNA blots probed for the divergent and common regions suggest that complex processing pathways are operative in the tissue-specific expression of sialyltransferase mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1537961455,"Abstract A new connective tissue protein of 36 kDa has been purified from porcine aorta. The biochemical and immunological properties of the protein are distinct from those of microfibril-associated proteins reported previously such as lysyl oxidase, 31-kDa microfibril-associated glycoprotein, and fibrillin. It could bind to concanavalin A-Sepharose and gelatin-Sepharose. The protein contained the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ala in the amino-terminal region, which is the site for the association with cell and extracellular matrix. Using specific antibody raised to the protein, we demonstrated its restricted localization in aorta adventitia. Immunoelectron microscopy specified its location to a class of extracellular structural elements described as elastin-microfibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1493451689,"We report new spectroscopic properties for a range of silver-metallothionein species. The binding reactions that take place following addition of Ag+ to rabbit liver apoMT 2, and the apo alpha and -beta fragments have been studied using the techniques of circular dichroism (CD) and emission spectroscopy. Titrations carried out at 20 degrees C and 55 degrees C reveal for the first time the formation of a sequence of clusters (Ag6-MT, Ag12-MT and, finally, Ag18-MT) as Ag+ is added to rabbit apoMT 2. (The division of mammalian metallothioneins into two major subforms, MT 1 and MT 2, is based on differences in molecular charge, which results from differences in the sequence of amino acids that do not involve the cysteines.) It is proposed that the novel Ag18-MT complex forms with a structure that involves a well defined three-dimensional structure, in the same manner as that recently reported for the Hg18-MT complex (Cai, W. and Stillman, M. J., (1988) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110, 7872-7873). Addition of silver in excess of 20 mol equivalents leads to the collapse of this structure. At the elevated temperatures, it is suggested that the protein can exert cooperativity so that completely filled domains are formed rather than mixtures of complexes. This contrasts with the kinetic product in which metals are bound across the peptide chain forming more random cross-linked regions in place of the cluster structure. CD spectra were recorded as Ag+ was added to the alpha and beta fragments formed from rabbit liver MT 1. The silver-containing fragments are less stable than the Ag-MT. The alpha and beta fragments exhibit CD spectral patterns indicative of stoichiometrically defined species. The presence of Ag3- alpha MT 1 and Ag6- alpha MT 1 is suggested by the spectral data obtained at 20 and 55 degrees C. Formation of Ag3- beta MT 1 is suggested by the spectral data recorded at 20 degrees C for the beta fragment. We also report that silver-containing metallothioneins are luminescent. Both the position of the band maximum in the 460-600 nm region and the emission intensity are strongly dependent on the stoichiometry of silver to protein. In the range of molar ratios for silver:MT of 1-12, bands at 465 and 520 nm intensify to a maximum for Ag10-MT 2. A band at 575 nm reaches a maximum for Ag16-MT 2. Analysis of the emission data suggests that Ag+ binds in a domain specific mechanism to apoMT 2."
https://openalex.org/W1579051060,"Abstract The similarity or identity of O-glycosylation in glycoproteins from natural sources or produced in heterologous cell lines, a central problem for the development of many biotechnologically relevant production processes, was examined using interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a model. Human interleukin-2 was constitutively expressed in several mammalian cell lines in high amounts. The recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity and their carbohydrate structures were analyzed. Only the NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3[NeuAc alpha 2-6]GalNAc oligosaccharide structure or the NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc were found in all IL-2 preparations secreted from recombinant Ltk-, Chinese hamster ovary, and baby hamster kidney cell lines. The O-linked chains were exclusively linked to Thr in position 3 of the polypeptide chain which is the carbohydrate attachment site in natural human IL-2. The proportions of O-glycosylated versus nonglycosylated forms of the protein secreted by each recombinant cell line were independent of productivity or of cell culture conditions. Our results show that O-glycosylated human IL-2 can be produced by applying recombinant DNA technology in heterologous cell lines with the same type of post-translational modification that is observed for the protein secreted from natural T lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1486190320,"Abstract The structures of cell-associated heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and their interaction with the plasma membrane was studied using rat ovarian granulosa cell culture. HS proteoglycans were either metabolically labeled by incubating cell cultures with [3H] leucine and [35S]sulfate or labeled in plasma membrane preparations with a photoactivatable reagent, 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine (TID), a compound which has been shown to selectively label the hydrophobic membrane-binding domains of several proteins. After purification of HS proteoglycans from the labeled cell cultures or from the labeled membrane preparations by repeated Q-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography in 8 M urea, they were analyzed by Superose 6 gel filtration and octyl-Sepharose chromatography both in 4 M guanidine HCl. The results indicated that the HS proteoglycans were labeled with 125I and therefore have an intramembranous domain. Phospholipase C (Bacillus thuringiensis), which specifically cleaves phosphatidylinositol membrane anchors, released approximately 25% of the 35S-labeled HS proteoglycans from the cell surface as well as 20-30% of the 125I-label from the 125I-TID-labeled HS proteoglycans. These data indicate that a subpopulation of HS proteoglycans are intercalated into the plasma membrane through a linkage structure involving phosphatidylinositol. Phospholipase C-resistant, 125I-labeled HS proteoglycans represent those species inserted into membrane through an intercalated peptide sequence. Core protein size of phosphatidylinositol-anchored species estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after heparitinase digestion was approximately 80 kDa, and it was significantly larger than that of the directly intercalated species (approximately 70 kDa)."

https://openalex.org/W1558039549,"Alkylation of DNA by xenobiotic agents, or their electrophilic metabolites, is believed to be the major initiating process that may result ultimately in carcinogenesis. The study of hemoglobin alkylated in vivo by chemical carcinogens has previously been proposed as an indicator for DNA alkylation. Xenobiotically modified proteins, however, are not readily amenable to conventional methods for amino acid sequencing. Tandem mass spectrometry allows unambiguous structural elucidation of chemically modified proteins. Styrene is a widely used chemical in the plastics industry and its major metabolite, styrene 7,8-oxide, is both mutagenic and carcinogenic in rodents. Human hemoglobin was modified in vitro with styrene 7,8-oxide and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides from unmodified hemoglobin were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography, and their molecular weights were determined by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. This allowed confirmation of the known sequence of the protein and provided a reference for the identification of modified peptides. High performance tandem mass spectrometry of modified peptides allowed unambiguous assignment of specific residues modified. The externally accessible histidines were found to be the dominant sites for alkylation at high modification levels of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1571648854,"Abstract Micromolar concentrations of oleate were found to inhibit reversibly the binding of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to the human fibroblast LDL receptor. The decrease in LDL binding caused a parallel reduction of both 125I-LDL uptake and degradation at 37 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, oleate was also found to displace 125I-LDL already bound to the LDL receptor. The effect of oleate was rapid, reaching 70-80% of maximum displacement with 5-10 min of incubation, and was closely correlated to oleate-albumin molar ratios. Partition analysis of unesterified fatty acids between cells and LDL showed that the inhibitory effect of oleate resulted mainly from an interaction of unesterified fatty acids with the cell surface rather than with the LDL particles. Using different unesterified fatty acids and fatty acid analogs, we found that the inhibitory effect was modulated by both the length and the conformation of the monomeric carbon chain and was directly dependent on the presence of a negative charge on the carboxylic group. At 4 degrees C, the inhibitory effect of oleate never exceeded half of maximum binding capacity. This limitation was associated with the ability of oleate to interact only with part of the population of LDL receptors which spontaneously recycles in the absence of ligand, as demonstrated by the fact that oleate did not induce any reduction of LDL binding after cell treatment with monensin in the absence of LDL. Our results indicate that unesterified fatty acids could participate in the control of LDL catabolism in vivo by direct modulation of the ability of LDL receptor to bind LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1543949549,"An enzymatic activity responsible for the hydroxylation of CMP-NeuAc into CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuGc) was found in the cytosolic fraction after cellular fractionation of the mucosa of rat small intestine. It was maximum in the presence of NADPH or NADH, but it was reduced by 50% by addition of 1 mM EDTA. The Km value for CMP-NeuAc was 0.6 microM. The CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity paralleled the expression of the GM3 (NeuGc) phenotype in the epithelium of the small intestine and was not measurable in the mutant rats BN and SHR that only expressed GM3 (NeuAc). Furthermore, the only form of CMP-sialic acid present in the intestinal mucosa of the mutants was CMP-NeuAc, whereas in the other strains CMP-NeuGc accounted for 70-85% of the native CMP-sialic acids. Wild-type and CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase-deficient inbred rats were mated. Individuals of F1 and backcross generations were typed for the phenotypes GM3(NeuGc)/GM3(NeuAc) and the activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase in the small intestine. It was found that the expression of NeuGc in GM3 depends on a single autosomal dominant gene and correlates with the activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase. Two tissues other than small intestine, kidney and spleen, which expressed GM3(NeuGc) in BN and SHR, also expressed the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase activity, as in the other strains. It was concluded that the key enzyme responsible for the presence of NeuGc in GM3 is a CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and that mutant rats carry a defect that is specific to intestine. The comparative analysis of the respective contribution of NeuGc and NeuAc to the glycoprotein sialic acids of the small intestine showed that CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is also responsible for part of the NeuGc present in the glycoproteins. However, the occurrence of 20-30% of NeuGc in the intestinal glycoproteins of the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase-deficient rats indicated that there is another enzyme providing intestinal glycoproteins with NeuGc and operating under a different genetic control."
https://openalex.org/W1637548848,"Abstract Immobilized metal ions have been used to characterize and locate metal ion-specific binding domains on the surface of the DNA-binding form of the estrogen receptor protein. Soluble estrogen receptors in calf uterine cytosol were labeled with [3H]estradiol and transformed to the DNA-binding configuration by brief exposure (30 min) to 3 M urea at 0-4 degrees C. The transformed receptors were purified in the presence of 3 M urea using single-stranded calf thymus DNA-agarose and characterized by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (Stokes radius of 7.0-7.5 nm) and sucrose density gradient centrifugation (4.25 S) as dimers of 130,000 Da. Such receptor preparations subsequently labeled with [3H]desmethylnafoxidine aziridine by ligand exchange revealed one major peak of radioactivity (67 kDa) by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. When analyzed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on iminodiacetate (IDA)-agarose loaded with Cu(II), Ni(II), or Zn(II) ions, the receptor was bound with various degrees of affinity and metal interaction heterogeneity even in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl to neutralize electrostatic interactions. The intact DNA-binding receptor dimers were most tightly bound to IDA-Cu(II) and IDA-Ni(II), but were eluted with 100-200 nM imidazole. The receptors were bound less tightly to IDA-Zn(II), and four separate peaks of receptor activity were resolved by elution with 10, 15, 30, and 100 mM imidazole (n = 27). Limited trypsin digestion of the DNA-binding receptor forms resulted in the generation of a 2.8-nm fragment with both the DNA-binding and metal-binding domains removed or destroyed. These results demonstrate that DNA-binding estrogen receptor dimers have high affinity metal ion-binding sites which are located at the DNA-binding domain. We have found (Zn(II) interaction chromatography to be unique thus far in its ability to resolve separate DNA-binding receptor forms."
https://openalex.org/W1584877249,"Abstract Endogenous interferons (IFNs) with antiviral activity have been detected in human fetal annexes, without any apparent induction. Some are of unusually high molecular weight and antigenic properties (Duc-Goiran P., Robert-Galliot, B., Lopez, J., and Chany, C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 5010-5014). We study here the expression of IFN genes from the three antigenically distinct groups, in placental tissues taken during third-trimester pregnancies. We show by Northern blot analysis with RNA probes that IFN-alpha-like transcripts correlate with the presence of functionally active protein, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. We fractionate on a formamide sucrose gradient, identify, and characterize a large 4.3-kb IFN-alpha-like transcript, which may be specifically expressed during fetal development. Despite the absence of IFN-beta transcript, a protein with an antiviral activity which was neutralized with a polyclonal anti-IFN-beta serum was detected in the placenta and could be related to a beta-like IFN. Besides IFNs, various growth factors and cytokines can be found in the placenta. We report here the presence of interleukin-6 expressed at high levels in fetal annexes. The coexpression of Interleukin-6 and endogenous IFNs suggests that they play an important role during development."
https://openalex.org/W1608298331,"In this report we examine the primary sequence of a variant glycophorin obtained from erythrocytes of an individual who exhibits an unusual MNSs blood group phenotype. We show that this protein is a hybrid molecule constructed from sequences of α- and α-glycophorins (glycophorins A and B) in a α-δ arrangement. Serological typing revealed that the donor's phenotype was M+N+S+s+U+; yet his erythrocytes reacted with some but not all examples of anti-S antisera. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a variant glycophorin band, and immunoblotting and reaction with N-glycanase suggested that its amino terminus resembled that of M-α-glycophorin but that its carboxyl terminus did not. A preparation highly enriched in the variant was obtained and used to generate peptide fragments for sequencing. The sequence revealed that the variant was a hybrid molecule whose amino terminus corresponded to M-α-glycophorin and whose carboxyl terminus corresponded to S-δ-glycophorin. CNBr cleavage of the variant glycophorin yielded four peptides. The sequence of the amino-terminal CNBr peptide (residues 1–8) was identical to the amino-terminal octapeptide of M-α-glycophorin. The proceeding peptide (residues 9–61) contained a segment identical to residues 9–58 of α glycophorin, but its carboxyl-terminal sequence had the Gly-Glu-Met sequence from S-δ-glycophorin (residues 27–29). The other two peptides, insoluble in aqueous solutions, contained highly hydrophobic sequences, identical to residues 30–52 and 53–68 of δ-glycophorin. Sequences of overlapping peptides generated by trypsin and V8 protease confirmed the hybrid nature of the variant glycophorin: residues 1–58 were identical to residues 1–58 of M-α-glycophorin, and residues 59–100 were entirely identical to residues 27–68 of S-δ-glycophorin. The variant glycophorin is expected to have 4 additional residues at its carboxyl terminus that correspond to the carboxyl-terminal residues 69–72 of δ-glycophorin. The amino acid sequence arrangement of the variant α-δ-glycophorin is an exact reciprocal of that found in another hybrid glycophorin, Sta, that is a δ-α hybrid. We propose that the two hybrid glycophorins represent the two possible products resulting from a reciprocal recombination event."
https://openalex.org/W1533600344,"Abstract Incubation of iodosylbenzene and [125I]iodobenzene with cytochrome P-450 (P-450) leads to the formation of [125I]iodosylbenzene (Burka, L.T., Thorsen, A., and Guengerich, F.P. (1980) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 7615-7616), but to date it has not been possible to observe directly the oxidation of organic halides in NADPH-supported P-450 reactions because of the intrinsic instability of haloso compounds. 4-tert-Butyl-2,5-bis[1-hydroxy-1-(trifluoromethyl)- 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl]iodobenzene (RI) and the corresponding bromine analog (RBr) were utilized as model compounds because their oxidized derivatives (iodinane and brominane) are relatively stable. Several model metalloporphyrins efficiently oxidized RI to the iodinane in the presence of iodosylbenzene. Rates of reduction of Mn(V) = O tetraphenylporphin chloride by RI were considerably faster than for several other organic halides. NADPH-fortified rat liver microsomes oxidized RI to the iodinane, identified by its chromatographic retention time and characteristic UV spectrum. Purified P-450 enzymes also catalyzed the oxidation of RI to the iodinane; more selectivity among individual proteins was seen when the reaction was supported by NADPH and NADPH-P-450 reductase than by iodosylbenzene. Free thiol groups in P-450 and NADPH-P-450 reductase could be oxidized by iodosylbenzene, the iodinane or brominane, or by incubation with NADPH and RI or other organic halides. These results provide evidence that P-450 can oxidize organic halogen atoms. Iodo compounds are definitely oxidized, even though the apparent oxidation-reduction potential differences seem unfavorable. The halogen order seen for the reaction is a function of the oxidation potential. Organic bromine compounds are probably also oxidized by P-450, although the rates are much slower. Chloroperoxidase did not oxidize RI to the iodinane but horseradish peroxidase did so at a lower rate; in this case the iodinane is postulated to form via electron abstraction without oxygen transfer."

https://openalex.org/W1532845922,"RecA protein promotes two distinct types of synaptic structures between circular single strands and duplex DNA; paranemic joints, where true intertwining of paired strands is prohibited and the classically intertwined plectonemic form of heteroduplex DNA. Paranemic joints are less stable than plectonemic joints and are believed to be the precursors for the formation of plectonemic joints. We present evidence that under strand exchange conditions the binding of HU protein, from Escherichia coli, to duplex DNA differentially affects homologous pairing in vitro. This conclusion is based on the observation that the formation of paranemic joint molecules was not affected, whereas the formation of plectonemic joint molecules was inhibited from the start of the reaction. Furthermore, introduction of HU protein into an ongoing reaction stalls further increase in the rate of the reaction. By contrast, binding of HU protein to circular single strands has neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effect. Since the formation of paranemic joint molecules is believed to generate positive supercoiling in the duplex DNA, we have examined the ability of positive superhelical DNA to serve as a template in the formation of paranemic joint molecules. The inert positively supercoiled DNA could be converted into an active substrate, in situ, by the action of wheat germ topoisomerase I. Taken collectively, these results indicate that the structural features of the bacterial chromosome which include DNA supercoiling and organization of DNA into nucleosome-like structures by HU protein modulate homologous pairing promoted by the nucleoprotein filaments of recA protein single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1534907125,"The nucleotide sequences of four chloroplast tRNAs (methionine elongator, lysine, glycine, and arginine) from the siphonaceous green alga Codium fragile have been determined. These tRNAs have an unusually high A-U content compared to other chloroplast tRNAs and show varied, but in general only limited, sequence homology to the corresponding tRNAs of other chloroplasts. The locations of the genes for these four tRNAs have been determined and they show no similarity to the location of the corresponding tRNA genes in other chloroplasts. The Codium chloroplast glycine tRNA has an unmodified uridine in the wobble position of the anticodon, a characteristic rarely found in tRNA but present in mitochondrial tRNAs which read the genetic code by extended wobble."

https://openalex.org/W1606788349,"Oxalyl thiolesters (OTEs) are a newly discovered class of mammalian metabolites that are believed to function in controlling animal metabolism and possibly serve as intracellular mediators for some hormones. Previous correlations had suggested that the concentrations of OTEs might be decreased when cells are stimulated to proliferate, and in our research that was found to be the case. Thus, when bovine lymph node lymphocytes are stimulated either with concanavalin A (Con A) or with a combination of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the concentration of OTEs in the lymphocytes decreases within 3 h by a factor of approximately two. With either PHA or TPA alone, the decrease in OTE concentration is considerably smaller. With Con A as stimulant, the OTE levels decrease within 1 h and remain low for at least 24 h. It was also noted that the concentration of OTEs in unstimulated isolated lymphocytes is significantly lower in lymphocytes obtained from 2-year-old animals than in lymphocytes obtained from older animals. The results of the current investigation, when considered in conjunction with other recent results, suggest that OTEs may be natural cell proliferation inhibitors.—Skorczynski, S. S.; Mastro, A. M.; Hamilton, G. A. Oxalyl thiolester concentrations decreased in lectin and phorbol ester-stimulated lymphocytes. FASEB J. 3: 2415-2419; 1989."
