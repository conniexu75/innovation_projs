https://openalex.org/W1580814522,"Receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been studied in confluent cultured intact human fibroblast monolayers. 125-I-EGF binds specifically to fibroblast monolayers. Half-maximal binding is observed at 4 times 10 minus 10 M EGF; at saturation of binding approximately 4 times 10-4 molecules of EGF are bound per cell. 125-I-Insulin is also bound specifically by intact monolayers with half-maximal binding observed at 10 minus 9 M insulin; about 4 times 10-3 molecules of insulin are bound per cell at saturation. Both insulin and EGF stimulate thymidine incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake. A half-maximal effect for insulin is observed at about 10 minus 9 M, both for the stimulation of thymidine incorporation and for the stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake; for EGF, half-maximal stimulation of both thymidine incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake is observed at 10 minus 10 M EGF. EGF causes an apparent greater stimulation of thymidine incorporation than does insulin, whereas the stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake is the same for both insulin and EGF. The degree of stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake by either insulin or EGF varied (1.2- to 2-fold) from one batch of cells to another, as did the measured values of the apparent K-m (average value 1 mM, range 0.6 to 2 mM) and V-max (average, 0.82, range 0.78 to 0.87 nmol/100 mug of protein per min) for alpha-aminoisobutyrate. Nonetheless, the apparent K-m of each peptide for stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake was independent of the degree of increase in alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake, and was constant from one batch of cells to another. The peptide-mediated stimulation of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake can be attributed to a decrease in the apparent K-m for alpha-aminoisobutyrate (e.g. for insulin) from 0.70 to 0.57 mM; for EGF from 0.87 to 0.66 mM) and a concomitant increase in the apparent V-max for alpha-aminoisobutyrate (e.g. for insulin from 0.78 to 0.87 and for EGF from 0.80 to 0.84 nmol/min/100 mug of cell protein). The stimulation requires a 40- to 60-min period of preincubation with either peptide and is blocked by pretreating cells with cycloheximide. In the presence of ouabain, both peptides inhibit rather than stimulate alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake; ouabain lowers the basal rate of alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake. The uptake of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose is not affected by either EGF or insulin under conditions where insulin stimulates fat cell transport. These observations indicate that cultured human fibroblasts possess specific binding sites for insulin and EGF, which sites can be related to two actions of the peptides: stimulation of thymidine incorporation and alpha-aminoisobutyrate uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1875092895,"Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme synthase which comprise the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-generating system(s) for hepatic cholesterogenesis and ketogenesis exhibit dual mitochondrial and cytoplasmic localization. Twenty to forty per cent of the thiolase and synthase of avian and rat liver are localized in the cytoplasmic compartment, the remainder residing in the mitochondria. In contrast, 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, an enzyme unique to the of ketogenesis, appears to be localized in the mitochondrion. The small proportion, 4 to 8 percent, of this enzyme found in the cytoplasmic fraction appears to arise via leakage from the mitochondria during cell fractionation in that its properties, pI and stability, are identical to those of the mitochondrial lyase. These results are consistent with the view that ketogenesis which involves all three enzymes, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, occurs exclusively in the mitochondrion, whereas cholesterogenesis, a pathway which involves only the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthesizing enzymes, is restricted to the cytoplasm. Further fractionation of isolated mitochondria from chicken and rat liver showed that all three of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA cycle enzymes are soluble and are localized within the matrix compartment of the mitochondrion. Likewise, cytoplasmic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase are soluble cytosolic enzymes, no thiolase or synthase activity being detectable in the microsomal fraction. Chicken liver mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-CoA synthase activity consists of a single enzymic species with a pI of 7.2, whereas the cytoplasmic activity is composed of at least two species with pI values of 4.8 and 6.7. Thus it is evident that the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic species are molecularly distinct as has been shown to be the case for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases from avian liver (Clinkenbeard, K. D., Sugiyama, T., Moss, J., Reed, W. D., and Lane, M. D. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 2275). Substantial mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase activity is present in all tissues surveyed, while only liver and kidney possess significant mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase activity. Therefore, it is proposed that tissues other than liver and kidney are unable to generate acetoacetate because they lack the mitochondrial synthase."

The sequence can be drawn in a cloverleaf structure typical of tRNAs with an anticodon for tryptophan. Aminoacylation of the molecule confirms that it is tRNA-Trp. The same sequence and aminoacylation results are obtained regardless of whether the RNA is isolated from virions or from cells of chickens, the natural host for this virus. It is the only species of tRNA-Trp that is dectected in chicked cell tRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1567592723,"1. Isolated rat fat cells were incubated at 37 degrees with [U-14C]-glucose 0.55 mM and 125I-labeled insulin. The amount of receptor-bound 125I-labeled insulin and the rate of insulin-induced 14C-lipid synthesis were assessed during association and dissociation of 125I-labeled insulin. 2. The rate of 14C-lipid synthesis was constant from zero time in the absence of insulin and in the presence of insulin in a high concentration (0.7 muM). With insulin in a low concentration (56 pM) the insulin-induced rate of 14C-lipid synthesis was proportional to the receptor occupancy; the receptor binding reached equilibrium and the rate of 14C-lipid synthesis reached a constant value after 30 to 45 min. With insulin in a concentration of 0.7 nM the rate of 14C-lipid synthesis reached a steady state before equilibrium of the receptor binding was obtained. 3. Ater preincubation with 56 pM 125I-labeled insulin followed by removal of extracellular insulin the decrease in the rate of insulin induced 14C-lipid synthesis followed the decrease in receptor occupancy with a half-time of about 10 min. After preincubation with insulin in concentrations of 0.28, 0.56, and 1.4 nM a maximum rate of 14C-lipid synthesis was maintained for about 8, 15, and 30 min, respectively. 4. The following model is suggested. Binding of insulin to the previously described receptors with a dissociation constant of about 3 nM (Gammeltoft, S., and Gliemann, J. (1973) Biochim. Biophys Acta 320, 16-32) represents the first step in the action of insulin on lipid synthesis from glucose. The receptor occupancy is rate-determining at low concentrations of insulin, i.e. when the occupancy is small (about 2 percent or less). At higher insulin concentrations some other step becomes rate-determining and the higher occupancy at equilibrium therefore causes no further increase in the steady state lipogenesis. However, a high receptor occupancy causes a prolonged maintenance of a maximal (or near-maximal) effect after removal of insulin from the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1582860378,"Cytoplasmic progesterone receptors of chick oviduct have been purified in 8% yield by steroid affinity and ion exchange chromatography. The affinity resin, deoxycorticosterone-bovine serum albumin-Sepharose, binds progesterone receptors with high affinity (KD equals 8 times 10-minus 10 M) and its use resulted in a greater than 2000-fold purification over the starting material in a single step. DEAE-Sephadex A-50 chromatography was then used to achieve final purification. NA dodecyl-SO4 gel electrophoresis and DEAE-cellulose chromatography showed that the purified receptors contained both of the previously described 4 S progesterone binding components in near equal amounts. Na dodocyl-SO4 gel electrophoresis also showed that these components consisted of single polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 110, 000 (A component) and 117, 000 (B component). There was no evidence for subunits of lower molecular weight. The purified materials have identical hormone-binding kinetics and steroid specificity to crude cytosol receptors. The isolated receptors retain the three biologically important properties exhibited by progesterone binding components present in cruder preparations: they bind specifically to (a) nuclei (KD equals 1.1 times 10-minus 9 M, 10, 000 sites per nucleus); (b) chromatin (KD equals 3 times 10-minus 9 M, 2000 sites per pg of DNA-);and (C) DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1650499862,"Two synthetic analogues of bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH) with NH2-terminal modifications, PTH-(3-34) and [desamino-Ala-1]PTH-(1-34), were found to lack agonist activity but to demonstrate antagonist properties when tested in the rat renal cortical adenylyl cyclase assay in vitro against the native hormone or against PTH-(1-34), the active synthetic NH2-terminal tetratriacontapeptide. The inhibition exhibited by these analogues was proportional in degree to the dose of inhibitor, abolished by oxidation of the analogue, reversible by addition of an excess of active hormone, and specific for parathyroid hormone-stimulated renal adenylyl cyclase. No inhibition of basal or sodium fluoride-stimulated renal adenylyl cyclase could be demonstrated. Two other synthetic bovine analogues, PTH-(13-34) and PTH-(1-26), were devoid of agonist and antagonist properties. The over-all results suggest that the requirements for receptor binding of parathyroid hormone are rather broad. Conformational factors or binding interactions involving specific residues, or both seem to require the entire sequence from residue 3 to residue 27 for receptor binding to occur. A dichotomy between receptor binding and adenylyl cyclase activation was demonstrated only by alterations or deletions involving the first 2 NH2-terminal residues of the hormone and emphasizes the importance of these residues in eliciting the biological activity of parathyroid hormone. The two antagonists, [desamino-Ala-1]PTH-(1-34) and PTH-(3-34), should be useful in further analysis of the initial steps in hormone action."

https://openalex.org/W1542342471,"NADH nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) from Chlorella vulgaris has been purified 640-fold with an over-all yield of 26% by a combination of protamine sulfate fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel chromatography, density gradient centrifugation, and DEAE-chromatography. The purified enzyme is stable for more than 2 months when stored at minus 20 degrees in phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 40% (v/v) glycerol. After the initial steps of the purification, a constant ratio of NADH:nitrate reductase activity to NADH:cytochrome c reductase and reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase activities was observed. One band of protein was detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme. This band also gave a positive stain for heme, NADH dehydrogenase, and reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase. One band, corresponding to a molecular weight of 100, 000, was detected after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme contains FAD, heme, and molybdenum in a 1:1:0.8 ratio. One cyanide binding site per molybdenum was found. No non-heme-iron or labile sulfide was detected. From a dry weight determination of the purified enzyme, a minimal molecular weight of 152, 000 per molecule of heme or FAD was calculated. An s20, w of 9.7 S for nitrate reductase was found by the use of sucrose density gradient centrifugation and a Stokes radius of 89 A was estimated by gel filtration techniques. From these values, and the assumption that the partial specific volume is 0.725 cc/g, a molecular weight of 356, 000 was estimated for the native enzyme. These data suggest that the native enzyme contains a minimum of 2 molecules each of FAD, heme, and molybdenum and is composed of at least three subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1530749462,"A mixture containing glucagon and thyroid hormone was previously devised that enhances markedly nuclear DNA replication and mitosis in the parenchymal liver cells of the unoperated rat. It is now shown that the glucagon of the stimulatory solution can be completely replaced by a mixture of a butyryl derivative of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and theophylline. Cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate and its butyryl derivatives and insulin and high levels of glucose are inactive. The inactivity of N2-monobutyryl cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate cannot be ascribed to rapid breakdown in the animal or to the impenetrability of the liver cell since the coumpound elevates the rate of hepatic amino acid transport and the activity of ornithine decarboxylase. The observation of others (MacManus, J.P., Franks, D.J., Youdale, T. & Braceland, B.M. (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 49, 1201-1207) that the level of cylcic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate is raised during most of the prereplicative period after 70% hepatectomy is confirmed. The evidence supports a positive role for adenosine 3':5-monophosphate in regulating DNA synthesis in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1517739504,"Production of superoxide radical during oxidation of dihydroorotate in rat liver mitochondria was not affected by antimycin A, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, or added ubiquinone but was inhibited by orotate, a product inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. It appears likely that superoxide is generated at the primary dehydrogenase. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase differs from succinate dehydrogenase both in its utilization of ubiquinone and in the mechanism of cytochrome b reduction. Thenoyltrifluoroacetone completely inhibits fumarate synthesis and reduction of cytochrome b by succinate. Formation of orotate is only partially inhibited by thenolytrifluoroacetone and the inhibitor does not prevent reduction of cytochrome b by dihydroorotate. It is proposed that several pathways exist for linkage of the primary dihydrorotate dehydrogenase with the electron transport chain. One route involves electron transfer from ubiquinone to cytochrome c and is inhibited by thenoyltrifluoroacetone. A second route bypasses ubiquinone and is inhibited by antimycin A. A third pathway utilizes both ubiquinone and cytochrome b and is partiayly inhibited by either thenoyltrifluoroacetone or antimycin A."
https://openalex.org/W1677760409,"Adenylate cyclase in particulate fractions from rat adrenal glands is subject to regulation by purine nucleotides, particularly guanine nucleotides. While GTP activates the enzyme, this effect is not evident in all particulate fractions. Following dialysis of the refractory fractions activation by GTP is observed, an indication that endogenous nucleotides may obscure the effects of added GTP. The analog, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p gives considerable more activity than does GTP. GDP, on the other hand, is inhibitory, an effect revealed only in the absence of a nucleotide-regenerating solution. GDP blocks the action of both GTP and Gpp(NH)p. These results show that the gamma-phosphate of the nucleotide is required for but need not be metabolized in the activation process. At low substrate concentration (0.1 mM ATP or adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate) stimulation of the enzyme by ACTH occurs only in the presence of added guanine nucleotide (GTP or Gpp(NH)p); the hormone and nucleotide act synergistically. While both GTP and Gpp(NH)p inhibit fluoride-stimulated activity, the level of fluoride required to demonstrate such inhibition appears not to be related to the level of fluoride required for activation of the enzyme. In the presence of GTP, or GTP plus ACTH, the enzyme exhibits normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to substrate utilization (K-m equal to 0.16 mM). In the activated state, produced with ACTH plus GTP, the enzyme is less susceptible to inhibition by a species of ATP uncomplexed with Mg2+, but is more susceptible to inhibition by Mg2+. These results demonstrate that fundamental differences exist between different states of the adenylate cyclase. The difficulties in describing kinetically the regulation of adenylate cyclase systems in view of the multiple actions of nucleotides and magnesium are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517482287,"The rate of the 4 to 5 S estrogen-binding protein (EBP) in vitro transformation was measured by sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis. The temperature-activated 4 to 5 S EBP transformation is found to be highly reproducible without loss of [3H]estradiol-binding activity in a buffer containing an excess of [3H]estradiol, 40 mM Tris, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 M urea at pH 7.4. The presence of [3H]estradiol is necessary for the 4 to 5 EBP transformation. A kinetic analysis of the 4 to 5 EBP transformation shows that it is a bimolecular reaction, the dimerization of the 4 S EBP with a second (similar or dissimilar) monomer or subunit. In buffers containing 0.4 M KCl the apparent second order rate constant is 2.3 plus or minus 0-2 times 10-7 M minus 1 min minus 1 at 28 degrees. The reaction is independent of the initial receptor concentration, suggesting that the 4 S EBP is dissociated into monomeric units in buffers of high ionic strength. In buffers without KCl or with 0.1 M KCl the apparent second order rate constant of receptor transformation increases with decreasing receptor concentration. This suggests that the 4 S EBP is associated weakly with another macromolecule (or macromolecules) in buffers of low ionic strength. The rate of 4 to 5 S EBP transformation shows a 200-fold increase between 0 and 35 degrees. The Arrhenius energy of activation is 21.3 kcal mol minus 1 in buffer without KCl and 19.1 kcal mol minus 1 in buffer with 0.4 M KCl. Following the temperature-activated dimerization, the avidity of binding between the 4 S EBP and its complementary subunit is increased, 0.4 M KCl can no longer cause dissociation, and the 5 S EBP dimer appears. This kinetic analysis indicates that the avidity of binding between the subunits of the estrogen receptor is modulated by estradiol, temperature, and ionic strength. We propose that these interactions of the estrogen receptor's subunits reflect conformational changes involved in receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1507719177,"The relationship between the cellular uptake of glucocorticoid hormones, the binding of these hormones to specific in vitro receptors, and the induction of mouse mammary tumor viruses in an established mouse mammary tumor cell line was highly correlated. These results suggest that the induction of mouse mammary tumor virus by glucocorticoid hormones is a physiological process acting through a mechanism of high affinity, saturable steroid-receptors. A temperature-sensitive or salt-dependent step following glucocorticoid-receptor interaction was required for nuclear uptake of the steroid. Induction studies with different adrenocorticoids indicate that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (1,4-pregnadiene-9-fluor-16alpha-methyl-11beta,17alpha,21-triol-3,20-dione), is the most potent inducer of mouse mammary tumor viruses and all steroids which caused significant induction were glucocorticoids. Other glucocorticoids appear to stimulate murine mammary tumor virus production by a mechanism similar to that of dexamethasone; for example, corticosterone competes with dexamethasone for binding to the glucocorticoid receptor and blocks the uptake of dexamethasone into cells. Progesterone also blocks the cellular uptake of dexamethasone and can bind to the glucocorticoid receptor at low concentrations (10-7 to 10-8 M) but progesterone does not consistently induce virus at hormone concentrations even as high as 10-4 M. Thus, in this system, binding to a cytoplasmic receptor is necessary but not sufficient for induction by glucocorticoids. Estrogens and androgens interfere with receptor binding and cellular uptake of dexamethasone but only at much higher concentration (10-4 M) than progesterone, and do not induce mammary tumor virus production. Although there was a positive correlation between steroid structure, binding, and biologic induction, other factors clearly affect the physiological manifestations of steroid actions. Mouse cells with comparable cytoplasmic receptor levels and comparable nuclear uptake differed absolutely in their degree of murine mammary tumor virus induction following hormone treatment. Although all mouse cells examined contain comparable levels of murine mammary tumor virus DNA, only cells producing constitutive levels of murine mammary tumor virus RNA could be induced to higher levels by a variety of glucocorticoids."

https://openalex.org/W2117831972,"Rat glioma cells grown in culture secrete cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) into the culture medium following stimulation by beta-agonistic catecholamines. Agents which reduced cellular ATP levels such as valinomycin, oligomycin, and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, inhibited cyclic AMP efflux. Secretion of cyclic AMP was also prevented by prostaglandin A-1 and pharmacological agents including probenecid and papaverine. Of the latter agents, only papaverine reduced ATP levels. These results suggest that the transport of cyclic AMP across animal cell membranes is energy-dependent and subject to regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1979274479,"REPORTS have indicated that thyrotrophin releasing factor (TRF) is stored in extrahypothalamic as well as hypothalamic brain regions of many vertebrates from the primitive larval lamprey to the more advanced mammals1–4. Although TRF is found in the brain of many poikilotherms, administration of synthetic TRF (pGlu-His-ProNH2) to these animals does not activate thyroid gland function5–7. Thus, it has been proposed that, in these animals, TRF modulates synaptic transmission rather than releasing thyrotrophin (thyroid stimulating hormone)1. Furthermore, the administration of TRF to hypophysectomised rodents potentiates the effect of the L-dopa on behaviour8, thus supporting the hypothesis that TRF modulates monoaminergic transmission in higher vertebrates as well. Further support for a role of TRF in synaptic transmission is the finding that administration of the synthetic tripeptide leads to an increase in noradrenaline turnover in rat brain9–11. Because these reports imply first, that TRF may influence monoaminergic transmission and second, that, in lower vertebrates, this role of TRF may be more important than that of regulating TSH release, we have investigated whether TRF is present in invertebrates which do not produce thyroid hormones but exhibit monoaminergic neurotransmission. We found immunoreactive TRF in the circumoesophageal ganglia of various gastropods. Species studied were the landsnail Mesodon roemeri (Connecticut Valley Biological Supply Co., Massachusetts), Planorbis corneus (Mogul Ed Corp., Wisconsin), Helesoma trivolbis and Viviparus malleatus (Ann Arbor Biological Center, Michigan)."
https://openalex.org/W1558315503,"The nucleotide sequences were determined for the 5'-oligonucleotides obtained by complete pancreatic RNase digestion (P25) and complete T1 RNase digestion (T27) of U-2 RNA. Complete digestion of oligonucleotide P25 with snake venom phosphodiesterase produced pm3 2,2,7G, pAm, pUm, and pCp in approximately equimolar ratios. Partial digestion of these oligonucleotides with snake venom phosphodiesterase produced -Um-C-Gp and pAm-Um, indicating the sequence of the 3'-terminal portion of the 5'-oligonucleotide is pAm-Um-C-Gp. The 5'-terminal oligonucleotide did not contain a 5'-phosphate and no free nucleoside was released from the 5' end by venom phosphodiesterase digestion. Since free pm3 2,2,7G was released by digestion with nucleotide pyrophosphatase and limited digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase, this nucleotide is apparently linked to pAm in a pyrophosphate linkage. Mass spectrometry and thin layer chromatography in borate systems showed the ribose of m3 2, 2, 7G contains no 2'O-methyl residue. Moreover, the finding that the ribose of m3 2, 2, 7G was oxidized by NaIO4 and reduced by KB3H4 in intact U-2 RNA rules out other linkages involving the 2' and 3' positions. Accordingly, it is concluded that the structure of the 5'-terminal pentanucleotide of U-2 RNA is(see article)."

Fractionation of the lysate into nuclear and cytoplasmic components blocked 99% of the synthesis of SV40(I) DNA in the purified nuclei. The reconstituted system, made by adding back the cytoplasmic fraction before incubation at 30 degrees, completely restored the in vitro level of SV40(I) DNA synthesis. Preliminary characterization of the activity found in the cytoplasmic fraction suggested it was a soluble, heat-labile protein (or proteins) with a minimum molecular weight of about 30,000 and an active sulfhydryl group. The activity was present in both infected and uninfected monkey cells, and at a lower level in mouse, hamster, and human cell lines. Neither serum starvation nor cycloheximide treatment of cells diminished the activity in the cytoplasmic fraction. Purified cytoplasmic DNA polymerase from KB cells did not substitute for the cytoplasmic fraction which was required for elongation of newly synthesized DNA strands.

https://openalex.org/W1519150778,"An in vivo human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-receptor complex was solubilized from the subcellular fraction of ovarian and testicular tissues of rats that had been injected with 125-I-labeled hCG. The soluble hCG-receptor complex was partially characterized by Sepharose 6B chromatography in the presence of the nonionic detergent, Emulphogene, and was shown to have a molecular size of about 65 A. By this method it was also shown that the in vivo uptake of radioactivity by rat gonadal tissues represents 125-I-hCG and not the dissociated subunits or degradation products of the hormone. A soluble hCG-receptor complex isolated in vitro in approximately the same yield from both rat testicular and ovarian homogenates was shown to be the same size. The hCG-receptor appears to be specifically located in gonadal tissue; a corresponding hCG-receptor complex was not obtained from liver or kidney that incorporated significant levels of 125-I-hCG administered in vivo. Furthermore, a desialyzed hCG-receptor complex was obtained from rat testis but not liver; desialyzed hCG, like other desialyzed glycoproteins, is nonspecifically bound by rat liver homogenates. The binding of hCG and luteinizing hormone (LH) by rat testis receptor exhibits a high degree of specificity. Other glycoprotein hormones without LH activity, such as follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and glycoproteins such as fetuin or alpha1-acid glycoprotein do not bind to the hCG/LH receptors. Desialyzed hCG was 2 times more effective in competing for binding to rat testis receptors than native hCG, indicating that caution must be exercised when the radioligand receptor assay is utilized to assay hCG preparations varying in sialic acid content."

Although the equilibrium of the pyruvate kinase reaction by itself strongly favors pyruvate production, the over-all equilibrium of this coupled system favors the depletion of pyruvate, thus greatly reducing the problem of back reaction during the assay. In addition, the oxidation of NADH by malate dehydrogenase makes it possible to monitor the system with a spectrophotometer. The Michaelis constant of pyruvate kinase was found to be 0.9 mM for ATP and 7 mM for pyruvate, values that agree reasonably well with earlier studies using direct assays. However, the maximum velocity is about 6 mumol of pyruvate phosphorylated/min/mg of enzyme, which is very much faster than that indicated by earlier studies. These results suggest that the metabolic significance of the reverse reaction of muscle pyruvate kinase may have been underestimated. In particular, the data given here suggest that its rate in vivo is probably comparable to the observed rate of glycogen synthesis from lactate, making possible glyconeogenesis in muscle by pyruvate kinase reversal without the need for an enzymatic bypass of the kind employed by liver and kidney."

https://openalex.org/W1494097251,"Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase is an example of a protein in which the K-m for substrate is substantially decreased by the presence of glycerol. The polyol has the effect at pH 8.0 or above of decreasing K-m and K-s for substrate and of altering both the protein's intrinsic fluorescence and ultraviolet absorption difference spectrum. The relationship between each of thse parameters and glycerol concentration displays a transition at a glycerol concentration of 20%. Circular dichroism values for the enzyme are not affected by glycerol over a large range of concentration and temperature. Treatment of the enzyme with glutaraldehyde results in the formation of cross-linked tetramers, the K-m of which are not altered by the presence of the solvent. The data are interpreted as reflecting a change in the conformation of the protein induced by glycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1545949159,"The stimulation or inhibition of ribulose diphosphate oxygenase by a variety of compounds is compared with the reported effects on these compounds on the ribulose diphosphate carboxylase activity. A possible transition state analog of ribulose diphosphate, 2-carboxyribitol 1, 5-diphosphate, at a molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme of 10 to 1, irreversibly inactivates the oxygenase and carboxylase activities. This is consistent with the hypothesis that there may be a single active site for both the carboxylase and oxygenase activities. Several compounds of the reductive pentose photosynthetic carbon cycle act as effectors of the ribulose diphosphate oxygenase in a manner complementary to their reported effect upon the carboxylase. Ribose 5-phosphate inhibits the oxygenase with an apparent Ki of 1.8 mM, but it is reported to activate the carboxylase; fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate act similarly but are less effective than ribose 5-phosphate. Fructose 1. 6-diphosphate stimulates the oxygenase at low magnesium ion concentrations. The stimulatory effect of 6-phosphogluconate on the oxygenase is associated with a 3-fold reduction of the Km (Mg2+). ATP inhibits the oxygenase but has been reported to stimulate the carboxylase; pyrophosphate acts in an opposite manner. From these results it appears that the ratio of carboxylase to oxygenase activity may be a variable factor with predictable subsequent alteration in the ratio between photosynthetic CO2 fixation and photorespiration."
https://openalex.org/W1562758981,"The activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) in Reuber H-35 cells was decreased after the removal of 6-N,2-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) from the medium. The decrease in activity was shown immunochemically to be the result of a rapid cessation in specific enzyme synthesis, occurring with a half-time of 40 min. The removal of dexamethasone, a less potent inducer of the enzyme in these cells, did not effect the activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase or its rate of synthesis. Insulin added to either dibutyryl cyclic AMP or dexamethasone-treated cells produced a decline in specific enzyme synthesis which was not as rapid as that observed upon removal of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. This effect of insulin did not require the presence of glucose in the culture medium. Estimates of the half-life of the mRNA for P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase using actinomycin D and cordycepin suggested that after the inhibition of transcription of mRNA, enzyme synthesis continued for periods considerably longer than that observed after deinduction caused by removal of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. In addition, the synthesis of the enzyme could be restimulated by dibutyryl cyclic AMP in the absence of RNA synthesis. It was proposed that the deinduction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in these cells is being regulated at the post-transcriptional or translational level."

https://openalex.org/W1482641134,"The results presented in this paper confirm and extend previous observations which indicate that fluorescent dansylgalactsodes bind to the beta-galactoside carrier protein but do not penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane. The conclusion is supported by the following observations. (a) Although 2'-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside and 2'-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside are competitive inhibitors of lactose transport in intact cells of Escherichia coli and induce the in vitro synthesis of beta-galactosidase, they do not induce beta-galactosidase in vivo. (b) p-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate does not cause efflux of lactose from the intravesicular pool, but causes rapid reversal of D-lactate-induced dansylgalactoside fluorescence. (c) Dansylgalactosides inhibit dilution-induced, carrier-mediated lactose efflux."

https://openalex.org/W1484897429,"The synthesis of cytochromes aa3, b, and c has been investigated during synchronous growth in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These cytochromes increase in concentration continuously throughout each cell cycle, with an approximate doubling in rate during successive cycles. The rates of cytochrome formation are considerably higher in galactose-grown cultures than in cells grown in glucose. Although cytochrome aa3 increases at a continuous rate, its functional counterpart, cytochrome c oxidase, increases in stepwise fashion, with the increments occurring at the beginning of each new cell cycle. Chloramphenicol, a specific inhibitor of intramitochondrial protein synthesis, inhibits the formation of cytochrome aa3 at all stages of the cell cycle, but does not inhibit cytochrome c. Chloramphenicol exhibits a somewhat intermediate effect on cytochrome b synthesis, with transient inhibition occurring only when the drug is added prior to or during the initial part of the first cell cycle. After this time, chloramphenicol had no effect on the rate of cytochrome b synthesis. The data indicate that under our conditions of cell synchrony mitochondrial membrane formation as reflected by increments in mitochondrial cytochromes occurs by continuous accretion of new material throughout the cell cycle. Intramitochondrially synthesized polypeptide products, responsible for the formation of new cytochrome aa3, appear to be synthesized throughout the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1525179799,"A20668 A, B, and C are polypeptide antibiotics that inhibit phosphorylation of ADP, Mg2t-ATPase, and the ATP-driven transhydrogenase of rat liver submitochondrial particles, but not the purified F1 ATPase. In intact mitochondria, 120668 inhibits uncoupler-induced ATPase, State 3 respiration, and phosphorylation; the A and B forms are approximately equipotent with rutamycin, whereas A20668 C is less effective. Concentrations of A20668 slightly greater than required for complete inhibition of phosphoryl transfer stimulate rapid, uncoupled respiration by mitochondria under State 3 of 4 conditions. A20668 A and B are more effective uncouplers than A20668 C. In the presence of venturicidin or ossamycin, concentrations of A20668, which alone do not uncouple, stimulate oxygen consumption of mitochondria incubated under either State 3 of 4 conditions. A20668 uncoupling is not potentiated by prior inhibition of phosphoryl transfer by venturicidin X, rutamycin, aurovertin, or efrapeptin. A20668 increases mitochondrial permeability to protons in passive swelling experiments where facilitation of proton conductance correlates well with potency to uncouple. A20668 apparently binds initially at a unique locus to inhibit mitochondrial phosphoryl transfer reactions. When this site is saturated, additional antibiotic may uncouple by increasing proton conductance of mitochondria. Binding of venturicidin or ossamycin appears to interfere with the binding of A20668 to its adjacent inhibitory site, thus effectively increasing the concentration of A20668 available to uncouple."
https://openalex.org/W1601973844,"Spermine and related polyamines have been reported to substitute for Mg2+ in the aminoacylation of tRNA catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, but not in the ATP-PP-i exchange reaction. Such observations have led some workers to propose that these reactions proceed via a concerted mechanism rather than the usual two-step mechanism involving an aminoacyladenylate intermediate. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of the spermine effect on acylation and exchange, both reactions were re-examined using isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli. In the absence of added Mg2+ untreated tRNA was acylated in the presence of spermine, but tRNA from which Mg2+ had been scrupulously removed was not. ATP-PP-i exchange was not observed when spermine was used in place of Mg2+; however, if tRNA possessing sequestered Mg2+ was added, the exchange reaction was observed. These data suggest that a primary effect of spermine is to displace bound Mg2+ from tRNA in quantities sufficient to promote both the ATP-PP-i exchange and esterification of tRNA. The previously reported stimulatory effects of polyamines on these reactions are believed to be artifacts due to Mg2+ contamination of tRNA. Providing trace levels of Mg2+ are present, spermine exerts a secondary stimulation of the rate of aminoacylation, the mechanism of which is unknown. The results presented refute arguments that these enzymes proceed by a concerted mechansim and support the intermediacy of aminoacyladenylates."

Hexane and octane bind to these sites with association constants of 6.8 times 10-2 and 1.8 times 10-4 liters/mol, respectively, and compete with the anionic detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate (C12OSO3-minus), at low detergent ligand binding ratios (i.e. smaller than or equal to 1.0 mol of C12OSO3-minus per mol of protein). At higher detergent binding ratios (larger than 2 mol of C12OSO3-minus per mol of protein) the polypeptide cooperatively binds alkanes and a conformational change is induced."
https://openalex.org/W1614235377,"The synthesis of proteins with affinity for DNA has been studied in clones of a Syrian hamster cell line (NIL) and subclones of this line transformed by polyoma virus (NIL-Py) or hamster sarcoma virus (NIL-HSV). The results show that the synthesis of DNA-binding proteins in NIL and in its virus-transformed derivatives NIL-Py and NIL-HSV is very similar in exponentially growing cells, but in dense culture there is a very significant difference in the level of a protein (P8), which is much higher in the transformed lines than in untransformed NIL. The high levels of P8 in dense transformed cells have been observed in all the clones of transformed cells examined, indicating that this behavior of P8 is related to transformation and not simply due to a fortuitous clonal selection from the NIL. Experiments with synchronized cells indicate that the time of maximal P8 synthesis relative to cellular DNA synthesis in NIL-HSV precedes that observed in NIL cells. P8 has a molecular weight of 30,000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and is present in large amounts in the transformed cells in dense culture, where it makes up 0.5 to 1% of the total soluble protein."
https://openalex.org/W1605536913,"The question whether aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases act in a stepwise or in a concerted mechanism has been investigated kinetically with the valine enzyme of Escherichia coli, which had been used in previous studies by others who concluded that the physiological mechanism is concerted. An exchange between aminoacyl-tRNA and tRNA, dependent upon AMP, was studied. PP-i inhibits this exchange completely in the presence of Mg2+ and AMP but in the absence of added Mg2+ or with dAMP as the nucleotide the inhibition by PP-i is only partial; this is compatible with a stepwise, not a concerted, reaction. Exchange of isotopically labeled substrates in a system at chemical equilibrium also shows effects of substrate concentrations on rates in agreement with the predictions of a stepwise mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1505138859,"Bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease liberates p-nitrophenol from the 3'-group of deoxythymidine 3', 5'-di-p-nitrophenyl phosphate. A similar hydrolysis occurs with deoxythymidine 3'-p-nitrophenyl phosphate 5'-phsophate, but the rate is less than 2% of that with the di-p-nitrophenyl ester. The rate of formation of the p-nitrophenol, measured spectrophotometrically at 400 nm, varies linearly with DNase concentration. The binding of the substrate is not strong (K-m(app) in the 10 mM range), but the hydrolysis is rapid; 1 mug of DNase (free from other phosphodiesterases) can be assayed in 3 min after addition to a 10 mM substrate solution at pH 7.2, 10mM in MnCl2, and 1mM in CaCl2. All four bovine pancreatic DNases (A,B,C, and D) show the same relative activities toward DNA and toward the di-p-nitrophenyl ester; both activities are lost when DNase is inactivated by iodoacetate or by trypsin. The specificity of DNase toward the di-p-nitrophenyl substrate is different from that which has been established for the enzyme's predominant action on DNA or synthetic oligonucleotides, where a monoesterified phosphate group is formed at the 5'-position."
https://openalex.org/W1525314026,"A mixture of chemicals was previously devised (3, 3', 5'-triiodo-L-thyronine, amino acids, a butyryl derivative of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, theophylline, and heparin) that induces nuclear DNA replication in the liver of the unoperated rat (Short, J., Tsukada, K., Rudert, W.A. 7 Lieberman, I. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3602-3606). The stimulation of DNA synthesis with the complete solution is greater than the sum of the responses to the thyroid hormone alone and to a mixture of the remaining components of the inductive solution alone. The effects of the complete mixture and of parts of it on three parameters involving the hepatocyte nucleolus have now been examined in intact animals. The complete solution increases the level of RNA polymerase I (measured with isolated nuclei), the rate of ribosome synthesis, and the total volume of nucleoli per nucleus. Nucleolar hypertrophy is unique among the three changes in showing a requirement, just as for DNA synthesis, for all or almost all of the components of the complete mixture, including the thyroid hormone, for a maximal effect. Enlargement of nucleoli is detectable as early as 2 hours after the start of treatment with the complete mixture and a large proportion of the total hepatocyte population is involved. Hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in nucleolar RNA content. N2-Monobutyryl cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate is not able to substitute for the cyclic adenine nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1561730685,Human serum lipoproteins and egg yolk lecithin liposomes are able to solubilize large amounts of n-hexane and n-octane. At the maximum water solubility of n-octane the mole ratio of alkane to lipoprotein was 65 for high density lipoprotein (holo-HDL) and 900 for low density lipoprotein (holo-LDL). Alkane binding to lipid-free apo-HDL is negligible compared to alkane solubility in holo-HDL. Alkane solubility in the lipoproteins and liposomes is thermodynamically consistent with the simple soution of hydrocarbon in the hydrophobic regions of these particles. The unitary free energies of alkane transfer are similar to values previously observed for detergent micelles but are less favorable by 0.8 kcal/mol from the free energy of transfer to liquid hydrocarbon. It is concluded that the thermodynamics of alkane transfer to the lipoproteins resembles that found for detergent micelles or liposomes rather than that anticipated for an oil drop (i.e. liquid hydrocarbon).
