https://openalex.org/W2793311937,"Efficient resource management in data centers is of central importance to content service providers as 90 percent of the network traffic is expected to go through them in the coming years. In this context we propose the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to forecast short-term changes in the amount of traffic crossing a data center network. This value is an indicator of virtual machine activity and can be utilized to shape the data center infrastructure accordingly. The behaviour of network traffic at the seconds scale is highly chaotic and therefore traditional time-series-analysis approaches such as ARIMA fail to obtain accurate forecasts. We show that our convolutional neural network approach can exploit the non-linear regularities of network traffic, providing significant improvements with respect to the mean absolute and standard deviation of the data, and outperforming ARIMA by an increasingly significant margin as the forecasting granularity is above the 16-second resolution. In order to increase the accuracy of the forecasting model, we exploit the architecture of the CNNs using multiresolution input distributed among separate channels of the first convolutional layer. We validate our approach with an extensive set of experiments using a data set collected at the core network of an Internet Service Provider over a period of 5 months, totalling 70 days of traffic at the one-second resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2792838758,"The inverse association between socioeconomic status and smoking is well established, yet the mechanisms that drive this relationship are unclear. We developed and tested four theoretical models of the pathways that link socioeconomic status to current smoking prevalence using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Using data from the 2013 National Health Interview Survey, we selected four indicator variables (poverty ratio, personal earnings, educational attainment, and employment status) that we hypothesize underlie a latent variable, socioeconomic status. We measured direct, indirect, and total effects of socioeconomic status on smoking on four pathways through four latent variables representing social cohesion, financial strain, sleep disturbance, and psychological distress. Results of the model indicated that the probability of being a smoker decreased by 26% of a standard deviation for every one standard deviation increase in socioeconomic status. The direct effects of socioeconomic status on smoking accounted for the majority of the total effects, but the overall model also included significant indirect effects. Of the four mediators, sleep disturbance and psychological distress had the largest total effects on current smoking. We explored the use of structural equation modeling in epidemiology to quantify effects of socioeconomic status on smoking through four social and psychological factors to identify potential targets for interventions. A better understanding of the complex relationship between socioeconomic status and smoking is critical as we continue to reduce the burden of tobacco and eliminate health disparities related to smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2786683772,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D), a C-type lectin and pattern-recognition soluble factor, plays an important role in immune surveillance to detect and eliminate human pulmonary pathogens. SP-D has been shown to protect against infections with the most ubiquitous airborne fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, but the fungal surface component(s) interacting with SP-D is unknown. Here, we show that SP-D binds to melanin pigment on the surface of A. fumigatus dormant spores (conidia). SP-D also exhibited an affinity to two cell-wall polysaccharides of A. fumigatus, galactomannan (GM) and galactosaminogalactan (GAG). The immunolabeling pattern of SP-D was punctate on the conidial surface and was uniform on germinating conidia, in accordance with the localization of melanin, GM, and GAG. We also found that the collagen-like domain of SP-D is involved in its interaction with melanin, whereas its carbohydrate-recognition domain recognized GM and GAG. Unlike un-opsonized conidia, SP-D–opsonized conidia were phagocytosed more efficiently and stimulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, SP-D−/− mice challenged intranasally with wildtype conidia or melanin ghosts (i.e. hollow melanin spheres) displayed significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokines in the lung compared with wildtype mice. In summary, SP-D binds to melanin present on the dormant A. fumigatus conidial surface, facilitates conidial phagocytosis, and stimulates the host immune response.

Their affinities toward different microbes vary depending on their degree of oligomerization as well as the density of ligands available on the microbial surface (5Lee R.T. Ichikawa Y. Fay M.

Being C-type lectins, collectins primarily recognize carbohydrate moieties on the microbial surfaces as pattern recognition molecules; however, they also bind to charge-moieties on the microbial surface, leading to microbial opsonization and thus enhancing their phagocytosis (1Hickling T.P. Clark H. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Collectins and their role in lung immunity.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75 (12972515): 27-3310.1189/jlb.0703304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Kingma P.S.

Pulmonary hydrophilic surfactant proteins (SP), SP-A and SP-D, which also belong to the family of collectins, are produced by alveolar epithelial type II cells and Clara cells; their surfactant property prevents collapsing of the alveoli at the end of expiration (1Hickling T.P. Clark H. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Collectins and their role in lung immunity.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75 (12972515): 27-3310.1189/jlb.0703304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Kingma P.S.

Recent findings show that SP-D is integral to innate immune response by facilitating microbial phagocytosis through opsonization and modulating cellular immune response by alveolar macrophages (10Sano H. Kuroki Y. The lung collectins, SP-A and SP-D, modulate pulmonary innate immunity.Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42 (15589315): 279-28710.1016/j.molimm.2004.07.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). SP-D induces signaling for proinflammatory mediator production in alveolar macrophages by interacting with calreticulin/CD91 (11Gardai S.J. Xiao Y.Q. Dickinson M. Nick J.A. Voelker D.R. Greene K.E.

SP-D binding to damaged/apoptotic cells is also shown to enhance their uptake and clearance by alveolar macrophages in a murine model (12Vandivier R.W. Ogden C.A. Fadok V.A. Hoffmann P.R. Brown K.K. Botto M. Walport M.J. Fisher J.H. Henson P.M. Greene K.E.

Airborne fungal spores constitute major pulmonary pathogens in the immunocompromised individuals. Fungal cells are endowed with a cell wall composed of different polysaccharides, the composition of which varies depending on the fungal species (13Gow N.A. Latge J.P. Munro C.A.

Based on the inhibition assays, SP-D is suggested to interact with carbohydrate moieties (pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)) on fungal pathogen surfaces through its CRD (1Hickling T.P. Clark H. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Collectins and their role in lung immunity.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75 (12972515): 27-3310.1189/jlb.0703304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Brummer E.

Various polysaccharides have been proposed for SP-D binding, as their monomeric units, such as mannose, maltose, or glucose, could inhibit SP-D binding to different fungal species (1Hickling T.P.

Aspergillus fumigatus is the most ubiquitous airborne human fungal pathogen, which causes aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompetent individuals, and life-threatening invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals (20Latgé J.P. Aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillosis.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12 (10194462): 310-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D has been shown to bind to A. fumigatus conidia (14Madan T. Eggleton P. Kishore U. Strong P. Aggrawal S.S. Sarma P.U. Reid K.B. Binding of pulmonary surfactant proteins A and D to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia enhances phagocytosis and killing by human neutrophils and alveolar macrophages.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65 (9234771): 3171-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar); however, the interacting fungal components are unknown. Here, we show that SP-D binds to A. fumigatus dormant conidial surface melanin pigment through its collagen-like domain and two other cell-wall polysaccharides of A. fumigatus, galactomannan (GM) and galactosaminogalactan (GAG), via its CRD. Opsonization by SP-D facilitated conidial phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived macrophages and stimulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. SP-D knockout mice showed a significant down-regulation of the proinflammatory cytokines when challenged with conidia or melanin extracted from the dormant conidia, compared with wildtype mice, suggesting immunomodulatory potential of SP-D against inhaled conidia. Previous study employing flow cytometry showed that SP-D binds to A. fumigatus conidia (14Madan T. Eggleton P. Kishore U. Strong P. Aggrawal S.S. Sarma P.U. Reid K.B.

In accordance, our data showed that SP-D binds to the conidial surface in a saturable manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Although there was binding in all the pH values tested (pH 4.0–8.0; mean fluorescence intensity values: pH 4.0, 1944 ± 147.08; pH 6.0, 2822 ± 83.44; pH 7.4, 2162.5 ± 71.42; and pH 8.0, 2100.5 ± 130.81), the optimum binding was observed around pH 6.0. We were, however, interested in examining the binding pattern of SP-D, for which we used an immunolabeling technique. SP-D bound to dormant conidia in a punctate manner, whereas binding was uniform on germinating conidia (Fig. 1C). This suggested that SP-D ligands are present on both dormant and germinating A. fumigatus conidial surfaces. Lectins are carbohydrate-specific proteins (22Lis H. Sharon N.

The lipid moieties of glycolipids are also shown to bind SP-D through CRD (3Crouch E.C. Surfactant protein-D and pulmonary host defense.Respir.

However, in our assay, preincubation of SP-D with glucose, maltose, mannose and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not inhibit the binding of SP-D to A. fumigatus dormant conidia (Fig. 2), suggesting that the interaction between SP-D and dormant conidia is possibly mediated through non-glyco-/lipomoieties. To identify the A. fumigatus surface/cell-wall component(s) interacting with SP-D, both conidial and mycelial cell-wall components were tested for SP-D binding by ELISA. SP-D displayed affinity toward melanin, GM, and GAG (Fig. 3A) with concentration dependence (Fig. S1). We also tested SP-A and MBL, the other two C-type lectins belonging to the collectin family, found in the lung environment (1Hickling T.P. Clark H. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Collectins and their role in lung immunity.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 75 (12972515): 27-3310.1189/jlb.0703304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). SP-A did not show binding with any of the A. fumigatus cell-wall components, whereas MBL showed very weak interaction with GM and GAG (Fig. S2), suggesting that selectivity of SP-D toward melanin, GM, and GAG is exclusive. Pulldown and inhibition assays further confirmed specific SP-D binding to melanin, GM, and GAG (Fig. S3). SP-D binding to GM/GAG was calcium-dependent, whereas its binding to melanin was calcium-independent (Fig. 3B) and was not inhibited by either EDTA or EGTA (Fig. 3C), suggesting the involvement of different domains of SP-D during the interaction with melanin and GM/GAG. The truncated SP-D (SP-D that only contains the CRD) showed binding only to GM and GAG (Fig. 3D) but not to melanin, suggesting that CRD of SP-D is involved in the binding to the fungal cell wall polysaccharides GM/GAG. A truncated rhSP-D, containing only eight Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats of collagen-like domain along with the neck region and CRD but lacking the N-terminal cysteine-rich region and 51 Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats of collagen-like domain, also showed melanin binding, suggesting that a fragment of collagen-like domain is sufficient for melanin binding. We confirmed rhSP-D binding to A. fumigatus conidial surface by flow cytometry and immunolabeling and binding to the melanin by ELISA (Fig. S3). When analyzed by flow cytometry, a decrease in the rhSP-D binding with dormant conidia upon preincubation with melanin in a dose-dependent manner further confirmed melanin to be the SP-D ligand (Fig. 3E). GAG is synthesized during germination and is not present in the dormant A. fumigatus conidial cell wall (27Fontaine T. Delangle A. Simenel C. Coddeville B. van Vliet S.J. van Kooyk Y. Bozza S. Moretti S. Schwarz F. Trichot C. Aebi M. Delepierre M. Elbim C. Romani L. Latgé J.P.

GM is found in the cell wall of all the morphotypes of A. fumigatus but is masked by the surface rodlet and melanin layers in the dormant conidia (28Aimanianda V. Bayry J. Bozza S. Kniemeyer O.

Therefore, we focused our study on melanin, as it is present on the surface of the dormant conidia, the major infective morphotype of A. fumigatus. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) phagocytosed significantly higher numbers of conidia opsonized with SP-D compared with un-opsonized conidia (Fig. 4A). Preincubation of SP-D with melanin followed by conidial opsonization resulted in a significant decrease in the conidial phagocytosis. MTT assay was also carried out to evaluate the number of rhSP-D–opsonized conidia phagocytosed by MDMs. Similar to SP-D, rhSP-D also opsonized conidia and facilitated their phagocytosis, as confirmed by flow-cytometric analysis and immunolabeling assay (Fig. S4). Meanwhile, conidial opsonization by rhSP-D, which was preincubated with melanin, resulted in a similar degree of phagocytosis as the un-opsonized conidia (Fig. 4B). A. fumigatus conidial melanin has been shown to quench ROS, one of the defensive mechanisms of the human immune system (30Haase G. Brakhage A.A. Domer J.E. Kobayashi G.S. Domer J.D. Kobayashi G.S. The Mycota. Springer, Berlin, Germany2004: 67-88Google Scholar, 31Jahn B. Boukhallouk F. Lotz J. Langfelder K. Wanner G. Brakhage A.A. Interaction of human phagocytes with pigmentless Aspergillus conidia.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68 (10816538): 3736-373910.1128/IAI.68.6.3736-3739.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We evaluated the ROS quenching property of melanin. Un-opsonized melanin ghost reduced ROS production by MDMs (Fig. 4C), whereas SP-D–opsonized melanin ghosts resulted in an increase in the ROS production by MDMs. Similarly, SP-D–opsonized conidia caused an increase in the ROS production by MDMs compared with control MDMs (Fig. 4D). Un-opsonized conidia also resulted in an increase in the ROS produced compared with control MDMs. It should be noted that we used metabolically active conidia unlike melanin ghost preparation. However, the ROS production by SP-D–opsonized conidia was significantly higher than the ROS produced by MDMs interacting with un-opsonized conidia, suggesting that SP-D opsonization reduces ROS quenching capacity of melanin. The cytokines in the co-culture supernatants of MDMs and SP-D–opsonized conidia were assessed at early and late interaction time points. In this assay, we used paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed conidia and incomplete RPMI 1640 medium (without 10% serum) to avoid any influence due to conidial germination and serum. We analyzed the mRNA level of cytokines by qPCR after 2h (early interaction) of incubation of MDMs with conidia or melanin ghosts. Upon opsonization, A. fumigatus conidia or extracted melanin ghost induced significantly higher transcripts of proinflammatory (tnf-α, il-6, il-8, il-1β, and il-12a) and anti-inflammatory (il-10) cytokines (Fig. 5A). At late interaction time (20 h), MDMs cultured with SP-D–opsonized conidia produced significantly higher TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 than unstimulated MDMs and those co-cultured with un-opsonized conidia (Fig. 5B). We confirmed that proinflammatory cytokine induction was due only to the interaction of SP-D with A. fumigatus conidia/melanin ghosts as opsonin and not endotoxin contamination of SP-D. The amount of endotoxin was estimated to be 4.3 pg/μg rhSP-D, whereas in the commercial SP-D samples used, there were no detectable amounts of endotoxin. The highest amount of rhSP-D used in our study was 200 ng, which contained 0.86 pg of endotoxin. Therefore, we added MDMs with 10 pg of LPS (10-fold higher than could be present in 200 ng/ml rhSP-D); but it failed to stimulate any cytokine secretion (Fig. S5A). Next, we compared cytokine secretion from the MDMs from three donors before and after the treatment of SP-D with polymyxin, and no difference was observed (Fig. S5B; representative cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, are shown). Also, we cultured MDMs with SP-D alone, in the absence of conidia, that did not produce any proinflammatory immune response, suggesting that the observed immune response is due only to the conidial or melanin ghost-opsonizing capacity of SP-D. Wildtype (WT) or SP-D knockout (SP-D−/−) mice were intranasally challenged with A. fumigatus conidia or melanin ghost, and SP-D−/− mice showed significantly reduced cytokine transcripts in the lung homogenates during the early infection (6 h) compared with the WT mice (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, the melanin ghost was less immunostimulatory in both WT and SP-D−/− mice compared with conidia in WT mice (Fig. 6, B and A, respectively). Upon challenging WT mice with melanin ghost opsonized with rhSP-D, the immunostimulation was significantly higher than the corresponding counterpart challenged with un-opsonized melanin ghost (Fig. 6B). The cytokine levels in lung homogenates showed a pattern (Fig. 6C) similar to that observed with the transcripts (Fig. 6B). Together, our results show that SP-D acts as an immunomodulator, overcoming the immunological inertness of conidial melanin. SP-D has been shown to bind various fungal pathogens through its CRD, as fungi are endowed with a cell wall rich in different carbohydrate moieties (6Brummer E. Stevens D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2794181775,"The mechanosensitivity of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) is an interesting issue as regards understanding neuronal development and designing compliant materials as neural interfaces between neurons and external devices for treating CNS injuries and disorders. Although neurite initiation from a cell body is known to be the first step towards forming a functional nervous network during development or regeneration, less is known about how the mechanical properties of the extracellular microenvironment affect neuritogenesis. Here, we investigated the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeletal structures of neurons, which are a key factor in neuritogenesis, on gel substrates with a stiffness-controlled substrate, to reveal the relationship between substrate stiffness and neuritogenesis. We found that neuritogenesis was significantly suppressed on a gel substrate with an elastic modulus higher than the stiffness of in vivo brain. Fluorescent images of the F-actin cytoskeletal structures showed that the F-actin organization depended on the substrate stiffness. Circumferential actin meshworks and arcs were formed at the edge of the cell body on the stiff gel substrates unlike with soft substrates. The suppression of F-actin cytoskeleton formation improved neuritogenesis. The results indicate that the organization of neuronal F-actin cytoskeletons is strongly regulated by the mechanical properties of the surrounding environment, and the mechanically-induced F-actin cytoskeletons regulate neuritogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2794039199,"Metal exposure is one of the commonest anthropogenic pollutants mosquito larvae are exposed to, both in agricultural and urban settings. As members of the Anopheles gambiae complex, which contains several major malaria vector species including An. arabiensis, are increasingly adapting to polluted environments, this study examined the effects of larval metal exposure on various life history traits of epidemiological importance. Two laboratory strains of An. arabiensis, SENN (insecticide susceptible) and SENN DDT (insecticide resistant), were reared in maximum acceptable toxicity concentrations, (MATC—the highest legally accepted concentration) of cadmium chloride, lead nitrate and copper nitrate. Following these exposures, time to pupation, adult size and longevity were determined. Larvae reared in double the MATC were assessed for changes in malathion and deltamethrin tolerance, measured by lethal time bottle bioassay, as well as changes in detoxification enzyme activity. As defence against oxidative stress has previously been demonstrated to affect the expression of insecticide resistance, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity was assessed. The relative metal toxicity to metal naïve larvae was also assessed. SENN DDT larvae were more tolerant of metal pollution than SENN larvae. Pupation in SENN larvae was significantly reduced by metal exposure, while adult longevity was not affected. SENN DDT showed decreased adult size after larval metal exposure. Adult insecticide tolerance was increased after larval metal exposure, and this effect appeared to be mediated by increased β-esterase, cytochrome P450 and superoxide dismutase activity. These data suggest an enzyme-mediated positive link between tolerance to metal pollutants and insecticide resistance in adult mosquitoes. Furthermore, exposure of larvae to metal pollutants may have operational consequences under an insecticide-based vector control scenario by increasing the expression of insecticide resistance in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2792713866,"Despite improved retention and reduced complication rates paving the way for the current expansion of applications and surge in prevalence for the Boston type I Keratoprosthesis (KPro), the most frequent indication for its implantation today remains prior graft failure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of primary KPro and compare to secondary implantation in a matched cohort study. This study included patients who underwent KPro implantation in a single center by two surgeons between July 2008 and October 2014. All eyes with KPro implantation as the primary procedure with a minimum follow up of 12 months were matched with eyes with same preoperative diagnoses that underwent secondary KPro implantation. Main outcomes included visual acuity and device retention. A total of 56 eyes were included with 28 eyes in each group. Mean follow up was 5.0 years for both groups. Twenty-nine percent (8) of the eyes in the primary group had a diagnosis of chemical or thermal injuries, 25% (7) aniridia, 18% (5) autoimmune disease, 4% (1) infectious keratitis/neurotrophic cornea, 7% (2) gelatinous corneal dystrophy, 7% (2) ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia/limbal stem cell deficiency, and 11% (3) uveitis/hypotony. Sixty-one percent (17) of the eyes in the primary group and 39% (11) in the secondary group maintained a final best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or better at a mean follow up of 5.0 years; the probability of maintaining best-corrected vision is 0.83 and 0.49 for primary and secondary groups at 5.0 years (p = 0.02). There is no statistically significant difference between groups in device retention (p = 0.22) or postoperative complication rates (p >0.05). This study demonstrates that Boston KPro implantation may be successful as a primary procedure in patients at high risk of failure with traditional penetrating keratoplasty. The device has a good long-term retention rate and visual outcomes are promising however a larger study is needed for more definitive results."
https://openalex.org/W2788478896,"S-Adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcy hydrolase; Sah1 in yeast/AHCY in mammals) degrades AdoHcy, a by-product and strong product inhibitor of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methylation reactions, to adenosine and homocysteine (Hcy). This reaction is reversible, so any elevation of Hcy levels, such as in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), drives the formation of AdoHcy, with detrimental consequences for cellular methylation reactions. HHcy, a pathological condition linked to cardiovascular and neurological disorders, as well as fatty liver among others, is associated with a deregulation of lipid metabolism. Here, we developed a yeast model of HHcy to identify mechanisms that dysregulate lipid metabolism. Hcy supplementation to wildtype cells up-regulated cellular fatty acid and triacylglycerol content and induced a shift in fatty acid composition, similar to changes observed in mutants lacking Sah1. Expression of the irreversible bacterial pathway for AdoHcy degradation in yeast allowed us to dissect the impact of AdoHcy accumulation on lipid metabolism from the impact of elevated Hcy. Expression of this pathway fully suppressed the growth deficit of sah1 mutants as well as the deregulation of lipid metabolism in both the sah1 mutant and Hcy-exposed wildtype, showing that AdoHcy accumulation mediates the deregulation of lipid metabolism in response to elevated Hcy in yeast. Furthermore, Hcy supplementation in yeast led to increased resistance to cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase, as well as to a concomitant decline of condensing enzymes involved in very long-chain fatty acid synthesis, in line with the observed shift in fatty acid content and composition."
https://openalex.org/W2787285175,"The increased worldwide commercial cultivation of transgenic crops during the past 20 years is accompanied with potential effects on the soil microbial communities, because many rhizosphere and endosphere bacteria play important roles in promoting plant health and growth. Previous studies reported that transgenic plants exert differential effects on soil microbial communities, especially rhizobacteria. Thus, this study compared the soybean root-associated bacterial communities between a 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase -transgenic soybean line (ZUTS31 or simply Z31) and its recipient cultivar (Huachun3 or simply HC3) at the vegetative, flowering, and seed-filling stages. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA) V4 hypervariable region amplicons via Illumina MiSeq and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed. Our results revealed no significant differences in the overall alpha diversity of root-associated bacterial communities at the three developmental stages and in the beta diversity of root-associated bacterial communities at the flowering stage between Z31 and HC3 under field growth. However, significant differences in the beta diversity of rhizosphere bacterial communities were found at the vegetative and seed-filling stages between the two groups. Furthermore, the results of next generation sequencing and qPCR showed that the relative abundances of root-associated main nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera, especially Bradyrhizobium in the roots, evidently changed from the flowering stage to the seed-filling stage. In conclusion, Z31 exerts transitory effects on the taxonomic diversity of rhizosphere bacterial communities at the vegetative and seed-filling stages compared to the control under field conditions. In addition, soybean developmental change evidently influences the main symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera in the roots from the flowering stage to the seed-filling stage."
https://openalex.org/W2789633053,"Painful neuropathy (PN) is a prevalent condition in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the pathogenic mechanisms of metabolic syndrome-associated painful neuropathy (MetSPN) remain unclear. In the current study, high-fat-fed mice (HF mice) were used to study MetSPN. HF mice developed MetS phenotypes, including increased body weight, elevated plasma cholesterol levels, and insulin resistance in comparison with control-fat-fed (CF) mice. Subsequently, HF mice developed mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in hind paws after 8 wk of diet treatment. These pain behaviors coincided with increased densities of nociceptive epidermal nerve fibers and inflammatory cells such as Langerhans cells and macrophages in hind paw skin. To study the effect of MetS on profiles of cytokine expression in HF mice, we used a multiplex cytokine assay to study the protein expression of 12 pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in dorsal root ganglion and serum samples. This method detected the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β as well as reduced anti-inflammatory IL-10 in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (LDRG) of HF mice. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-10 reduced the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alleviated pain behaviors in HF mice without affecting MetS phenotypes. Our findings suggested targeting HF-induced cytokine dysregulation could be an effective strategy for treating MetSPN."

To support the social participation of students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) it is essential to understand their emotional life in the context of ethnic and school cultures. We are particularly interested in how anxiety and loneliness are experienced in developing and maintaining friendships in the daily encounters of adolescents with ASD in the specific context of Japanese schools, because these emotions could serve either as facilitators or barriers to social interaction, depending on how individuals manage them. The present qualitative study investigated perceptions of emotions related to friendship in the everyday school life of 11 adolescents with ASD in Japan. Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews, which revealed a wide range of motivations for socialization, limited future prospects to deepen friendships, robust self-awareness of one's own social challenges, and conscious efforts to cope with these challenges. An inductive approach to data analysis resulted in four themes: social motivation, loneliness, anxiety, and distress. To our knowledge this is the first study to uncover the rich emotional life of adolescents with ASD in the context of their friendships in an Asian culture."
https://openalex.org/W2785543274,"The long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue liraglutide has proven efficiency in the management of type 2 diabetes and also has beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases. Liraglutide's protracted action highly depends on its capacity to bind to albumin via its palmitic acid part. However, in diabetes, albumin can undergo glycation, resulting in impaired drug binding. Our objective in this study was to assess the impact of human serum albumin (HSA) glycation on liraglutide affinity. Using fluorine labeling of the drug and 19F NMR, we determined HSA affinity for liraglutide in two glycated albumin models. We either glycated HSA in vitro by incubation with glucose (G25- or G100-HSA) or methylglyoxal (MGO-HSA) or purified in vivo glycated HSA from the plasma of diabetic patients with poor glycemic control. Nonglycated commercial HSA (G0-HSA) and HSA purified from plasma of healthy individuals served as controls. We found that glycation decreases affinity for liraglutide by 7-fold for G100-HSA and by 5-fold for MGO-HSA compared with G0-HSA. A similarly reduced affinity was observed for HSA purified from diabetic individuals compared with HSA from healthy individuals. Our results reveal that glycation significantly impairs HSA affinity to liraglutide and confirm that glycation contributes to liraglutide's variable therapeutic efficiency, depending on diabetes stage. Because diabetes is a progressive disease, the effect of glycated albumin on liraglutide affinity found here is important to consider when diabetes is managed with this drug."
https://openalex.org/W2792213851,"Objective To investigate the association between livestock ownership and dietary diversity, animal-source food consumption, height-for-age z-score, and stunting among children living in wildlife “buffer zones” of Zambia’s Luangwa Valley using a novel livestock typology approach. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of 838 children aged 6–36 months. Households were categorized into typologies based on the types and numbers of animals owned, ranging from no livestock to large numbers of mixed livestock. We used multilevel mixed-effects linear and logistic regression to examine the association between livestock typologies and four nutrition-related outcomes of interest. Results were compared with analyses using more common binary and count measures of livestock ownership. Results No measure of livestock ownership was significantly associated with children’s odds of animal-source food consumption, child height-for-age z-score, or stunting odds. Livestock ownership Type 2 (having a small number of poultry) was surprisingly associated with decreased child dietary diversity (β = -0.477; p<0.01) relative to owning no livestock. Similarly, in comparison models, chicken ownership was negatively associated with dietary diversity (β = -0.320; p<0.01), but increasing numbers of chickens were positively associated with dietary diversity (β = 0.022; p<0.01). Notably, neither child dietary diversity nor animal-source food consumption was significantly associated with height, perhaps due to unusually high prevalences of morbidities. Conclusions Our novel typologies methodology allowed for an efficient and a more in-depth examination of the differential impact of livestock ownership patterns compared to typical binary or count measures of livestock ownership. We found that these patterns were not positively associated with child nutrition outcomes in this context. Development and conservation programs focusing on livestock must carefully consider the complex, context-specific relationship between livestock ownership and nutrition outcomes–including how livestock are utilized by the target population–when attempting to use livestock as a means of improving child nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2789561200,"Constitutive activation of interferon signaling pathways has been reported in colorectal cancer (CRC), leading to a strong CD8+ T cell response through stimulation of NLRC5 expression. Primed CD8+ T cell expansion, however, may be negatively regulated by PD-L1 expression. Additionally, aberrant PD-L1 expression enables cancer cells to escape the immune attack. Our study aimed to select potential regulatory variants in the NLRC5 and PD-L1 genes by using several online in silico tools, such as UCSC browser, HaploReg, Regulome DB, Gtex Portal, microRNA and transcription factor binding site prediction tools and to investigate their influence on CRC risk in a Czech cohort of 1424 CRC patients and 1114 healthy controls. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender reported a moderate association between rectal cancer risk and two NLRC5 SNPs, rs1684575 T>G (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.13–2.27, recessive model) and rs3751710 (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.96, dominant model). Given that a combination of genetic variants, rather than a single polymorphism, may explain better the genetic etiology of CRC, we studied the interplay between the variants within NLRC5, PD-L1 and the previously genotyped IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 variants, to evaluate their involvement in the risk of CRC development. Overall we obtained 18 pair-wise interactions within and between the NLRC5 ad PD-L1 genes and 6 more when IFNGR variants were added. Thirteen out of the 24 interactions were below the threshold for the FDR calculated and controlled at an arbitrary level q*<0.10. Furthermore, the interaction IFNGR2 rs1059293 C>T—NLRC5 rs289747 G>A (P<0.0001) remained statistically significant even after Bonferroni correction. Our data suggest that not only a single genetic variant but also an interaction between two or more variants within genes involved in immune regulation may play important roles in the onset of CRC, providing therefore novel biological information, which could eventually improve CRC risk management but also PD-1-based immunotherapy in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2790057521,"Rationale The lifecycle perspective reminds us that the roots of adult ill-health may start in-utero or in early childhood. Nutritional and infectious disease insults in early life, the critical first 1000 days, are associated with stunting in childhood, and subsequent short adult stature. There is limited or no opportunity for stunted children above 2 years of age to experience catch-up growth. Some previous research has shown short maternal height to lead to adverse birth outcomes. In this paper, we document the association between maternal height and caesarean section, and between maternal height and neonatal mortality in 34 sub-Saharan African countries. We also explore the appropriate height cut-offs to use. Our paper contributes arguments to support a focus on preventing non-communicable risk factors, namely early childhood under-nutrition, as part of the fight to reduce caesarean section rates and other adverse maternal and newborn health outcomes, particularly neonatal mortality. We focus on the Sub-Saharan Africa region because it carries the highest burden of maternal and neonatal ill-health. Methods We used the most recent Demographic and Health Survey for 34 sub-Saharan African countries. The distribution of heights of women who had given birth in the 5 years before the survey was explored. We adopted the following cut-offs: Very Short (<145.0cm), Short (145.0–149.9cm), Short-average (150.0–154.9cm), Average (155.0–159.9cm), Average-tall (160.0–169.9cm) and Tall (≥170.0cm). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the contribution of maternal stature to the odds ratio of caesarean section delivery, adjusting for other exposures, such as age at index birth, residence, maternal BMI, maternal education, wealth index quintile, previous caesarean section, multiple birth, birth order and country of survey. We also look at its contribution to neonatal mortality adjusting for age at index birth, residence, maternal BMI, maternal education, wealth index quintile, multiple birth, birth order and country of survey. Results There was a gradual increase in the rate of caesarean section with decreasing maternal height. Compared to women of Average height (155.0–159.9cm), taller women were protected. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for Tall women was 0.67 (95% CI:0.52–0.87) and for Average-tall women was 0.78 (95% CI:0.69–0.89). Compared to women of Average height, shorter women were at increased risk. The aOR for Short-average women was 1.19 (95% CI:1.03–1.37), for Short women was 2.06 (95% CI:1.71–2.48), and for Very Short women was 2.50 (95% CI:1.85–3.38). There was evidence that compared to Average height women, Very Short and Short women had increased odds of experiencing a neonatal death aOR = 1.95 (95% CI 1.17–3.25) and aOR = 1.66 (95% CI 1.20–2.28) respectively. When we focused on the period of highest risk, the day of delivery and first postnatal day, these aORs increased to 2.36 (95% CI 1.57–3.55) and 2.34 (95% CI 1.19–4.60) respectively. The aORs for the first week of life (early neonatal mortality) were 1.90 (95% CI 1.07–3.36) and 1.83 (95% CI 1.30–2.59) respectively. Conclusions Short stature is associated with an increased prevalence of caesarean section and neonatal mortality, particularly on the newborn’s first days. These results are even more striking because we know that caesarean section rates tend to be higher among wealthier and more educated women, who are often taller and that the same patterns may hold for neonatal survival; in such cases, adjusting for wealth, education and urban residence would attenuate these associations. Caesarean sections can be lifesaving operations; however, they cost the health system and families more, and are associated with worse health outcomes. We suggest that our findings be used to argue for policies targeting stunting in infant girls and potential catch-up growth in adolescence and early adulthood, aiming to increase their adult height and thus decrease their subsequent risk of experiencing caesarean section and adverse birth outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2793442024,"Background and purpose Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a global health problem, which can lead to several pathophysiological consequences including cardiovascular diseases. Its impact on the cerebrovascular system is not well understood. The goal of the present work was to examine the effects of VDD on the morphological, biomechanical and functional properties of cerebral arterioles. Methods Four-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 11 per group) were either fed with vitamin D deficient diet or received conventional rat chow with per os vitamin D supplementation. Cardiovascular parameters and hormone levels (testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D) were measured during the study. After 8 weeks of treatment anterior cerebral artery segments were prepared and their morphological, biomechanical and functional properties were examined using pressure microangiometry. Resorcin-fuchsin and smooth muscle actin staining were used to detect elastic fiber density and smooth muscle cell counts in the vessel wall, respectively. Sections were immunostained for eNOS and COX-2 as well. Results VDD markedly increased the wall thickness, the wall-to-lumen ratio and the wall cross-sectional area of arterioles as well as the number of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media. As a consequence, tangential wall stress was significantly lower in the VDD group. In addition, VDD increased the myogenic as well as the uridine 5’-triphosphate-induced tone and impaired bradykinin-induced relaxation. Decreased eNOS and increased COX-2 expression were also observed in the endothelium of VDD animals. Conclusions VDD causes inward hypertrophic remodeling due to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and enhances the vessel tone probably because of increased vasoconstrictor prostanoid levels in young adult rats. In addition, the decreased eNOS expression results in endothelial dysfunction. These morphological and functional alterations can potentially compromise the cerebral circulation and lead to cerebrovascular disorders in VDD."
https://openalex.org/W2792674893,"Brooke is a non-government organisation with working equine welfare programmes across Africa, Asia and Latin America. In 2014, staff from ten country programmes were asked to identify 'no-win' situations (subsequently reframed as 'hard-wins')-where improving equine welfare is proving difficult, expensive and/or marginal-in order to inform strategic decisions on how to approach, manage and mitigate for such situations.The Delphi-type consultation process had three phases. Round 1 posed five questions in the form of a workshop, survey and semi-structured interviews. Round 2 re-presented key themes and sense-checked initial conclusions. Round 3 reviewed the nature and prevalence of hard-win situations at an international meeting of all participants.Reasons given for hard-win situations included: no economic or social benefit from caring for working animals; poor resource availability; lack of empathy for working equids or their owners among wider stakeholders; deep-seated social issues, such as addiction or illegal working; areas with a high animal turnover or migratory human population; lack of community cooperation or cohesion; unsafe areas where welfare interventions cannot be adequately supported. Participants estimated the prevalence of hard-win situations as 40-70% of their work. They suggested some current ways of working that may be contributing to the problem, and opportunities to tackle hard-wins more effectively.Respondents agreed that if equine welfare improvements are to span generations of animals, interventions cannot rely on relatively simple, technical knowledge-transfer strategies and quick-wins alone. Programmes need to be more flexible and iterative and less risk-averse in their approaches to embedding good equine welfare practices in all relevant actors. Consultation recommendations informed development of Brooke's new global strategy, a revised organisational structure and redefinition of roles and responsibilities to streamline ways to approach hard-wins in the complex environments and socio-economic contexts in which working equids are found."

Hypertension (28.8%), dyslipidemia (18.9%), and chronic liver disease/cirrhosis/hepatitis (18.1%) were the top three comorbidities in patients with psoriasis. LCA identified four distinct comorbidity classes among these patients, including 9.9% of patients in the “multi-comorbidity” class, 17.9% in the “metabolic syndrome” class, 11.3% in the “hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)” class, and 60.9% in the “relatively healthy” class. Psoriatic arthritis was evenly distributed among each class. Relative to membership in the “relative healthy” class, an increase of one year of age had a higher probability of membership in the “multi-comorbidity” (odds ratio [OR], 1.25), “metabolic syndrome” (OR, 1.11), or “hypertension and COPD” (OR, 1.34) classes. Relative to membership in the “relative healthy” class, compared to women, men had a higher probability of membership in the “multi-comorbidity” (OR, 1.39), “metabolic syndrome” (OR, 1.77), or “hypertension and COPD” (OR, 1.22) classes. Conclusion We observed four distinct classes of psoriasis comorbidities, including the “multi-comorbidity”, “metabolic syndrome”, “hypertension and COPD”, and “relatively healthy” classes, as well as the clustering of liver diseases with metabolic syndrome and clustering of COPD with hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2792191434,"Introduction Attrition from antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes is a critical challenge among children receiving care in resource-limited settings. Our objective was to determine the rates and predictors of attrition among children on ART in Ethiopia. Methods Between December 2014 and September 2016, we conducted a prospective cohort study in eight health facilities in Ethiopia. Eligibility criteria included age 3 months–14 years; being on ART for not more than a month. Outcome was attrition due to death and/or loss to follow-up. Predictor variables were child clinical and socio-demographic characteristics, and caregiver socio-demographic characteristics. We used Cox Regression analyses to examine the association between predictors and outcome. Results Of 309 children, 304 were included, 52% were male. Their median age was 9 years (Inter-quartile range, IQR, 6–12). At ART initiation, their median CD4 was 362 cells/mm3 (IQR 231–499); and 74.3% had WHO stage 1 or 2 disease. During 287.7 person-years of observation (PYO), 24 attritions were recorded, yielding an attrition rate of 8.3 per 100 PYO (95% CI 5.4–12.1). Of these, six children were reported dead, leading to a mortality rate of 2.1 per 100 PYO (95% CI 0.8–4.3). Eighteen were lost to follow-up (LTFU) leading to LTFU rate of 6.26 per 100 PYO (95% CI: 3.83–9.70). The majority, 14 (58%) of attrition occurred during the first six months of treatment. Age below three years [aHR] = 5.14 (95% CI: 2.07–12.96), rural residence (aHR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.34–11.78) and baseline Hgb in g/dl < 10 g/dl [aHR] = 5.68 (95% CI: 2.03–6.23) predicted higher risk of attrition. Baseline Hgb < 10 g/dl (aHR = 16.63, 95% CI: 1.64–168.4) and WHO stage III or IV (aHR = 12.25, 95% CI: 1.26–119.05) predicted the death of the child. Higher attrition was documented among children of both biological parents alive and biologically related close family caregivers. Conclusion Younger children, those from rural areas, and children with anaemia were at higher risk of attrition, especially during the early months of treatment, and therefore should be prioritized during treatment follow-up. Further studies should examine underlying reasons for higher attrition."

Here we tested if splenic macrophages (MΦs) were necessary for control of WNV infection. We selectively depleted splenic MΦs, but not draining lymph node MΦs, by injecting mice intravenously with clodronate liposomes several days prior to infecting them with WNV. Mice missing splenic MΦs succumbed to WNV infection after an increased and accelerated spread of virus to the spleen and the brain. WNV-specific Ab and CTL responses were normal in splenic MΦ-depleted mice; however, numbers of NK cells and CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly increased in the brains of infected mice. Splenic MΦ deficiency led to increased WNV in other splenic innate immune cells including CD11b- DCs, newly formed MΦs and monocytes. Unlike other splenic myeloid subsets, splenic MΦs express high levels of mRNAs encoding the complement protein C1q, the apoptotic cell clearance protein Mertk, the IL-18 cytokine and the FcγR1 receptor. Splenic MΦ-deficient mice may be highly susceptible to WNV infection in part to a deficiency in C1q, Mertk, IL-18 or Caspase 12 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2793627180,"Serological methods are relatively convenient and simple for the detection of pathogens for front-line workers. On-site visualization of the test results plays a pivotal role in the process. However, an efficient, universal labeling agent for antibodies is needed for the development of efficient serological detection tools. In this study, a Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV)-based viral vector was employed to express recombinant proteins, collectively designated GfED, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus Protein A domain ED (SpaED) fused to either the N- or C-terminal of an improved green florescent protein (GFP) with or without the coat protein (CP) of BaMV, efficiently in Chenopodium quinoa. The GfED in crude leaf extracts could specifically attach to IgG molecules of rabbits and mice, effectively labeling IgG with GFP, emitting green light at 506 nm when excited at 450 nm using simple, handheld equipment. To demonstrate the applicability of GfED in serological assays, we have developed a fluorescent dot blot assay for the rapid detection of Acidovorax citrulli (Ac), a bacterial pathogen of cucurbits, and BaMV, a viral pathogen of bamboos. By using the crude extracts of inoculated C. quinoa leaves expressing GfED as an IgG-labeling agent, the pathogens were easily and quickly detected through uncomplicated operations using simple equipment, with results observable by the naked eye. Examination using fluorescent microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the GfED subunits may assemble into virus-like particles, which were further involved in the formation of aggregates of GfED-antibody-antigen complexes with the potential for fluorescence signal enhancement. The results suggested that plant-expressed GfED may serve as a promising alternative of IgG-labeling agent for current serological assays."
https://openalex.org/W2790998329,"We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 μg (both added to basal insulin) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Sweden.The Swedish Institute for Health Economics cohort model for T2D was used to compare liraglutide and lixisenatide (both added to basal insulin), with a societal perspective and with comparative treatment effects derived by indirect treatment comparison (ITC). Drug prices were 2016 values, and all other costs 2015 values. The cost-effectiveness of IDegLira (fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide) versus lixisenatide plus basal insulin was also assessed, under different sets of assumptions.From the ITC, decreases in HbA1c were -1.32% and -0.43% with liraglutide and lixisenatide, respectively; decreases in BMI were -1.29 and -0.65 kg/m2, respectively. An estimated 2348 cases of retinopathy, 265 of neuropathy and 991 of nephropathy would be avoided with liraglutide compared with lixisenatide in a cohort of 10,000 patients aged over 40 years. In the base-case analysis, total direct costs were higher with liraglutide than lixisenatide, but costs associated with complications were lower. The cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for liraglutide added to basal insulin was SEK30,802. Base-case findings were robust in sensitivity analyses, except when glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) differences for liraglutide added to basal insulin were abolished, suggesting these benefits were driving the cost/QALY. With liraglutide 1.2 mg instead of liraglutide 1.8 mg (adjusted for efficacy and cost), liraglutide added to basal insulin was dominant over lixisenatide 20μg.IDegLira was dominant versus lixisenatide plus basal insulin when a defined daily dose was used in the model.The costs/QALY for liraglutide, 1.8 or 1.2 mg, added to basal insulin, and for IDegLira (all compared with lixisenatide 20 μg added to basal insulin) were below the threshold considered low by Swedish authorities. In some scenarios, liraglutide and IDegLira were cost-saving."
https://openalex.org/W2786635653,"Climate change research is advancing to more complex and more comprehensive studies that include long-term experiments, multiple life-history stages, multi-population, and multi-trait approaches. We used a population of the barnacle Balanus improvisus known to be sensitive to short-term acidification to determine its potential for long-term acclimation to acidification. We reared laboratory-bred individuals (as singles or pairs), and field-collected assemblages of barnacles, at pH 8.1 and 7.5 (≈ 400 and 1600 μatm pCO2 respectively) for up to 16 months. Acidification caused strong mortality and reduced growth rates. Acidification suppressed respiration rates and induced a higher feeding activity of barnacles after 6 months, but this suppression of respiration rate was absent after 15 months. Laboratory-bred barnacles developed mature gonads only when they were held in pairs, but nonetheless failed to produce fertilized embryos. Field-collected barnacles reared in the laboratory for 8 months at the same pH's developed mature gonads, but only those in pH 8.1 produced viable embryos and larvae. Because survivors of long-term acidification were not capable of reproducing, this demonstrates that B. improvisus can only partially acclimate to long-term acidification. This represents a clear and significant bottleneck in the ontogeny of this barnacle population that may limit its potential to persist in a future ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2788541832,"The presence of large densities of the piston-pumping polychaete Lanice conchilega can have important consequences for the functioning of marine sediments. It is considered both an allogenic and an autogenic ecosystem engineer, affecting spatial and temporal biogeochemical gradients (oxygen concentrations, oxygen penetration depth and nutrient concentrations) and physical properties (grain size) of marine sediments, which could affect functional properties of sediment-inhabiting microbial communities. Here we investigated whether density-dependent effects of L. conchilega affected horizontal (m-scale) and vertical (cm-scale) patterns in the distribution, diversity and composition of the typical nosZ gene in the active denitrifying organisms. This gene plays a major role in N2O reduction in coastal ecosystems as the last step completing the denitrification pathway. We showed that both vertical and horizontal composition and richness of nosZ gene were indeed significantly affected when large densities of the bio-irrigator were present. This could be directly related to allogenic ecosystem engineering effects on the environment, reflected in increased oxygen penetration depth and oxygen concentrations in the upper cm of the sediment in high densities of L. conchilega. A higher diversity (Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson) of nosZ observed in patches with high L. conchilega densities (3,185–3,440 ind. m-2) at deeper sediment layers could suggest a downward transport of NO3− to deeper layers resulting from bio-irrigation as well. Hence, our results show the effect of L. conchilega bio-irrigation activity on denitrifying organisms in L. conchilega reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2791995265,"Substantial evidence supports the view that inflammatory processes contribute to brain alterations in HIV infection. Mechanisms recently proposed to underlie neuropathology in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) include elevations in peripheral cytokines that sensitize the brain to the damaging effects of alcohol. This study included 4 groups: healthy controls, individuals with AUD (abstinent from alcohol at examination), those infected with HIV, and those comorbid for HIV and AUD. The aim was to determine whether inflammatory cytokines are elevated in AUD as they are in HIV infection. Cytokines showing group differences included interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Follow-up t-tests revealed that TNFα and IP-10 were higher in AUD than controls but only in AUD patients who were seropositive for Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Specificity of TNFα and IP-10 elevations to HCV infection status was provided by correlations between cytokine levels and HCV viral load and indices of liver integrity including albumin/globulin ratio, fibrosis scores, and AST/platelet count ratio. Because TNFα levels were mediated by HCV infection, this study provides no evidence for elevations in peripheral cytokines in ""uncomplicated"", abstinent alcoholics, independent of liver disease or HCV infection. Nonetheless, these results corroborate evidence for elevations in IP-10 and TNFα in HIV and for IP-10 levels in HIV+HCV co-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2963681012,"Soft and pliable conductive polymer composites hold promise for application as bioelectronic interfaces such as for electroencephalography (EEG). In clinical, laboratory, and real-world EEG there is a desire for dry, soft, and comfortable interfaces to the scalp that are capable of relaying the μV-level scalp potentials to signal processing electronics. A key challenge is that most material approaches are sensitive to deformation-induced shifts in electrical impedance associated with decreased signal-to-noise ratio. This is a particular concern in real-world environments where human motion is present. The entire set of brain information outside of tightly controlled laboratory or clinical settings are currently unobtainable due to this challenge. Here we explore the performance of an elastomeric material solution purposefully designed for dry, soft, comfortable scalp contact electrodes for EEG that is specifically targeted to have flat electrical impedance response to deformation to enable utilization in real world environments. A conductive carbon nanofiber filled polydimethylsiloxane (CNF-PDMS) elastomer was evaluated at three fill ratios (3, 4 and 7 volume percent). Electromechanical testing data is presented showing the influence of large compressive deformations on electrical impedance as well as the impact of filler loading on the elastomer stiffness. To evaluate usability for EEG, pre-recorded human EEG signals were replayed through the contact electrodes subjected to quasi-static compressive strains between zero and 35%. These tests show that conductive filler ratios well above the electrical percolation threshold are desirable in order to maximize signal-to-noise ratio and signal correlation with an ideal baseline. Increasing fill ratios yield increasingly flat electrical impedance response to large applied compressive deformations with a trade in increased material stiffness, and with nominal electrical impedance tunable over greater than 4 orders of magnitude. EEG performance was independent of filler loading above 4 vol % CNF (< 103 ohms)."
https://openalex.org/W2789845410,"Cardiac metabolism is highly adaptive in response to changes in substrate availability, as occur during fasting. This metabolic flexibility is essential to the maintenance of contractile function and is under the control of a group of select transcriptional regulators, notably the nuclear receptor family of factors member PPARα. However, the diversity of physiologic and pathologic states through which the heart must sustain function suggests the possible existence of additional transcriptional regulators that play a role in matching cardiac metabolism to energetic demand. Here we show that cardiac KLF15 is required for the normal cardiac response to fasting. Specifically, we find that cardiac function is impaired upon fasting in systemic and cardiac specific Klf15-null mice. Further, cardiac specific Klf15-null mice display a fasting-dependent accumulation of long chain acylcarnitine species along with a decrease in expression of the carnitine translocase Slc25a20. Treatment with a diet high in short chain fatty acids relieves the KLF15-dependent long chain acylcarnitine accumulation and impaired cardiac function in response to fasting. Our observations establish KLF15 as a critical mediator of the cardiac adaptive response to fasting through its regulation of myocardial lipid utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2792819707,"Explosion of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki corresponds to the only historical moment when atomic bombs were used against civilians. This event triggered countless investigations into the effects and dosimetry of ionizing radiation. However, none of the investigations has used the victims' bones as dosimeter. Here, we assess samples of bones obtained from fatal victims of the explosion by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). In 1973, one of the authors of the present study (SM) traveled to Japan and conducted a preliminary experiment on the victims' bone samples. The idea was to use the paramagnetism induced in bone after irradiation to measure the radiation dose. Technological advances involved in the construction of spectrometers, better knowledge of the paramagnetic center, and improvement in signal processing techniques have allowed us to resume the investigation. We obtained a reconstructed dose of 9.46 ± 3.4 Gy from the jawbone, which was compatible with the dose distribution in different locations as measured in non-biological materials such as wall bricks and roof tiles."
https://openalex.org/W2794182395,"To explore the pathogenesis of Rhizoctonia solani and its phytotoxin phenylacetic acid (PAA) on maize leaves and sheaths, treated leaf and sheath tissues were analyzed and interpreted by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with chemometrics. The PAA treatment had similar effects to those of R. solani on maize leaves regarding the metabolism of traumatin, phytosphingosine, vitexin 2'' O-beta-D-glucoside, rutin and DIBOA-glucoside, which were up-regulated, while the synthesis of OPC-8:0 and 12-OPDA, precursors for the synthesis of jasmonic acid, a plant defense signaling molecule, was down-regulated under both treatments. However, there were also discrepancies in the influences exhibited by R. solani and PAA as the metabolic concentration of zeaxanthin diglucoside in the R. solani infected leaf group decreased. Conversely, in the PAA-treated leaf group, the synthesis of zeaxanthin diglucoside was enhanced. Moreover, although the synthesis of 12 metabolites were suppressed in both the R. solani- and PAA-treated leaf tissues, the inhibitory effect of R. solani was stronger than that of PAA. An increased expression of quercitrin and quercetin 3-O-glucoside was observed in maize sheaths treated by R. solani, while their concentrations were not changed significantly in the PAA-treated sheaths. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the concentration of L-Glutamate, which plays important roles in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens, only occurred in the R. solani-treated sheath tissues. The differentiated metabolite levels may be the partial reason of why maize sheaths were more susceptible to R. solani than leaves and may explain the underlying mechanisms of R. solani pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2789660508,"Epigenetic predisposition is thought to critically contribute to adult-onset disorders, such as retinal neurodegeneration. The histone methyltransferase, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), is transiently expressed in the perinatal retina, particularly enriched in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We previously showed that embryonic deletion of Ezh2 from retinal progenitors led to progressive photoreceptor degeneration throughout life, demonstrating a role for embryonic predisposition of Ezh2-mediated repressive mark in maintaining the survival and function of photoreceptors in the adult. Enrichment of Ezh2 in RGCs leads to the question if Ezh2 also mediates gene expression and function in postnatal RGCs, and if its deficiency changes RGC susceptibility to cell death under injury or disease in the adult. To test this, we generated mice carrying targeted deletion of Ezh2 from RGC progenitors driven by Math5-Cre (mKO). mKO mice showed no detectable defect in RGC development, survival, or cell homeostasis as determined by physiological analysis, live imaging, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, RGCs of Ezh2 deficient mice revealed similar susceptibility against glaucomatous and acute optic nerve trauma-induced neurodegeneration compared to littermate floxed or wild-type control mice. In agreement with the above findings, analysis of RNA sequencing of RGCs purified from Ezh2 deficient mice revealed few gene changes that were related to RGC development, survival and function. These results, together with our previous report, support a cell lineage-specific mechanism of Ezh2-mediated gene repression, especially those critically involved in cellular function and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2790039327,"Background ""Evolution Canyon"" (ECI) at Lower Nahal Oren, Mount Carmel, Israel, is an optimal natural microscale model for unraveling evolution-in-action, highlighting the evolutionary processes of biodiversity evolution, adaptation, and incipient sympatric speciation. A major model organism in ECI is the tetraploid wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides (TD), the progenitor of cultivated emmer and durum wheat. TD displays dramatic interslope adaptive evolutionary divergence on the tropical, savannoid-hot and dry south-facing, ""African"" slope (AS), and on the temperate, forested, cool and humid, north-facing, ""European"" slope (ES), separated on average by 250 m. From the perspective of chemical evolution and metabolomics, it is important to unravel interslope divergence in biologically relevant secondary metabolites between the abutting slope populations. Here, in TD we examined hydroxamic acid (Hx), which is a family of secondary cereal metabolites, and plays a major role in defending the plant against fungi, insects and weeds. Results Our examination revealed that higher concentrations of DIBOA and DIMBOA were found in seedlings growing in the same greenhouse from seeds collected from the cool and humid forested ES, whereas the seedlings of seeds collected from the savannoid AS (both in root and shoot tissues), showed no DIMBOA. Remarkably, only DIBOA appears in both shoots and roots of the AS seedlings. It rises to a peak and then decreases in both organs and in seedlings from both slopes. The DIMBOA, which appears only in the ES seedlings, rises to a peak and decreases in the shoot, but increased and remained in a plateau in the root, till the end of the experiment. Conculsions/Significance The results suggest stronger genetic resistance of defense compounds DIBOA and DIMBOA against biotic stresses (fungi and other pathogens) by ES seedlings. However, AS seedlings responded earlier but were to the same biotic stresses. The genetic difference found in AS seedlings was caused by the main adaptive selection in AS, which was against climatic, abiotic stresses, and was weaker, or not at all, against biotic stresses. The distinct genetic interslope differences appear important and is very significant and are elaborated in the discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2790332288,"ALC1 (amplified in liver cancer 1), an SNF2 superfamily chromatin-remodeling factor also known as CHD1L (chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA binding protein 1-like), is implicated in base-excision repair, where PARP (Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) mediated Poly(ADP-ribose) signaling facilitates the recruitment of this protein to damage sites. We here demonstrate the critical role played by ALC1 in the regulation of replication-fork progression in cleaved template strands. To analyze the role played by ALC1 as well as its functional relationship with PARP1, we generated ALC1-/-, PARP1-/-, and ALC1-/-/PARP1-/- cells from chicken DT40 cells. We then exposed these cells to camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I poison that generates single-strand breaks and causes the collapse of replication forks. The ALC1-/- and PARP1-/- cells exhibited both higher sensitivity to CPT and an increased number of chromosome aberrations, compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, phenotypes were very similar across all three mutants, indicating that the role played by ALC1 in CPT tolerance is dependent upon the PARP pathway. Remarkably, inactivation of ALC1 resulted in a failure to slow replication-fork progression after CPT exposure, indicating that ALC1 regulates replication-fork progression at DNA-damage sites. We disrupted ATPase activity by inserting the E165Q mutation into the ALC1 gene, and found that the resulting ALC1-/E165Q cells displayed a CPT sensitivity indistinguishable from that of the null-mutant cells. This observation suggests that ALC1 contributes to cellular tolerance to CPT, possibly as a chromatin remodeler. This idea is supported by the fact that CPT exposure induced chromatin relaxation in the vicinity of newly synthesized DNA in wild-type but not in ALC1-/- cells. This implies a previously unappreciated role for ALC1 in DNA replication, in which ALC1 may regulate replication-fork slowing at CPT-induced DNA-damage sites."
https://openalex.org/W2794214008,"Considering the high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the antioxidant defense of chick embryo tissues is vital during the oxidative stress experienced at hatching. In order to better understand the mechanisms of the defense system during chicken embryo development, we detected the activity of antioxidant enzymes during the incubation of chicken embryo. Results showed that the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and (GSH-PX) in livers were higher than those in hearts. Based on these results, liver tissues were used as the follow-up study materials, which were obtained from chicken embryo at day 16 and day 20. Thus, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis to identify the transcriptome from 6 liver tissues. In total, we obtained 45,552,777–45,462,856 uniquely mapped reads and 18,837 mRNA transcripts, across the 6 liver samples. Among these, 1,154 differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, foldchange≥1) were identified between the high and low groups, and 1,069 GO terms were significantly enriched (p<0.05). Of these, 10 GO terms were related to active oxygen defense and antioxidant enzyme activity. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that GSTA2, GSTA4, MGST1, GPX3, and HAO2 participated in glutathione metabolism, and were considered as the most promising candidate genes affecting the antioxidant enzyme activity of chicken embryo at day 16 and day 20. Using RNA-Seq and differential gene expression, our study here investigated the complexity of the liver transcriptome in chick embryos and analyzed the key genes associated with the antioxidant enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2794272734,"Our aim was to verify the tracking of body adiposity indicators from childhood to adolescence and analyze the mediation effects of BMI on the stability of body adiposity. Our sample was composed by 375 children (197 boys). The children were followed-up over 3 years. Body mass and stature were measured as anthropometric indicators. Body adiposity was estimated through the subcutaneous skinfold method, with measures of triceps (TRSF) and subscapular skinfolds (SSSF). Skinfolds were analyzed singly and agglutinated through the sum of skinfolds (∑SF). The sample was categorized into tertiles, and thereafter, the kappa coefficient and McNemar test were adopted to verify stability. For continuous measures, the Intra-Class Correlation coefficient (ICC) was used. Moreover, mediation analyzes were used according to Baron and Kenny with the Sobel test to verify mediation effects. The significance level adopted was 5%. Adiposity indicators increased during the 3 years of follow-up in both sexes (p<0.05). ICCs in all indicators of adiposity were between 0.84 and 0.94 for boys and 0.86 and 0.94 for girls, indicating high tracking. Moreover, 70% of subjects remained in the highest tertile of body adiposity. However, no differences were observed in tertile changes (p>0.05). BMI at the age of adiposity rebound partially mediated all indicators of adiposity from childhood (baseline) to adolescence (3 years later) in both sexes (p<0.001). Thus, moderate to high tracking of body adiposity indicators between childhood and adolescence was verified. Moreover, BMI at the age of adiposity rebound partially mediated the relationship between adiposity in childhood (baseline) and in adolescence (3 years of follow-up)."
https://openalex.org/W2794337646,"Commensal bacteria and their pathogenic components in the gastrointestinal tract and oral cavity may play pathological roles in autoimmune diseases. To study the possible involvement of bacterial pathogens in autoimmune diseases, IgG and IgA antibodies against pathogenic components produced by three strains of commensal bacteria, Escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (E. coli-LPS), Porphyromonas gingivalis-LPS (Pg-LPS) and peptidoglycan polysaccharide (PG-PS) from Streptococcus pyogenes, were determined by an improved ELISA system for sera from two groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who met rapid radiographic progression (RRP) criteria and non-RRP, and compared to normal (NL) controls. Antibody responses to these bacterial pathogens are unique and consistent in individuals, and no fundamental difference was observed between RA and NL controls. Despite the similar antibody responses to pathogens, lower IgG or higher IgA and consequent higher IgA/IgG antibody ratio among the patients with RA related to disease marker levels and disease activity. Peculiarly, the IgA/IgG anti-Pg-LPS antibody ratio resulted from lower IgG and higher IgA antibody responses to Pg-LPS strongly correlated not only with rheumatoid factor (RF), but also correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and disease activity score of 28 joints with ESR (DAS28-ESR) in the RRP group. In contrast, the IgA/IgG anti-E. coli-LPS and anti-PG-PS antibody ratio correlated or tended to correlate with RF, ESR, CRP, and DAS28-ESR in the non-RRP group, whereas either the IgG or IgA anti-Pg-LPS antibody levels and consequent IgA/IgG anti-Pg-LPS antibody ratio did not correlate with any clinical marker levels in this group. Notably, anti-circular-citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody levels, which did not correlate with either IgG or IgA antibody levels to any pathogens, did not correlate with severity of arthritis in both RRP and non-RRP. Taken together, we propose that multiple environmental pathogens, which overwhelm the host antibody defense function, contribute independently or concomitantly to evoking disease makers and aggravating disease activity, and affect disease outcomes.UMIN CTR UMIN000012200."

As a continuation of this report using the HBV positive sera from the same study participants, the current study further analyzed the HBV basal core promoter (BCP)/precore (PC) genes variability in patients with HBV drug resistance (at tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) reverse transcriptase (RT) motifs) and HIV co-infection in comparison with HBV mono-infected counterparts with no HBV drug resistant gene variants.A total of 143 participants of HBV-HIV co-infected (n = 48), HBV mono-infected blood donors (n = 43) and chronic liver disease (CLD) patients (n = 52) were included in the study. The BCP/PC genome regions responsible for HBeAg expression from the EcoRI site (nucleotides 1653-1959) were sequenced and analyzed for the BCP/PC mutant variants.Among the major mutant variants detected, double BCP mutations (A1762T/G1764A) (25.9%), Kozak sequences mutations (nt1809-1812) (51.7%) and the classical PC mutations such as A1814C/C1816T (15.4%), G1896A (25.2%) and G1862T (44.8%) were predominant mutant variants. The prevalence of the double BCP mutations was significantly lower in HIV co-infected patients (8.3%) compared with HBV mono-infected blood donors (32.6%) and CLD patients (36.5%). However, the Kozak sequences BCP mutations and the majority of PC mutations showed no significant differences among the study groups. Moreover, except for the overall BCP/PC mutant variants, co-prevalence rates of each major BCP/PC mutations and YMDDRT motif associated lamivudine (3TC)/entecavir (ETV) resistance mutations showed no significant differences when compared with the rates of BCP/PC mutations without YMDD RT motif drug resistance gene mutations. Unlike HIV co-infected group, no similar comparison made among HBV mono-infected blood donors and CLD patients since none of them developed the YMDD RT motif associated 3TC/ETV resistance mutations. However, HBV mono-infected blood donors and CLD patients who had no any drug resistance gene variants developed comparable G1862T (60.6% vs. 65.1%) and G1896A (24.2% vs. 11.6%) PC gene mutations.No correlation observed between the BCP/PC genome variability and the YMDD RT motif associated HBV drug resistance gene variants during HIV co-infection. Nevertheless, irrespective of HIV co-infection status, the higher records of the BCP/PC gene variability in this study setting indicate a high risk of potential HBeAg negative chronic HBV infection in Northwest Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2792420533,"The aim of this study was to define a method for evaluating a player’s decisions during a game based on the success probability of his actions and for analyzing the player strategy inferred from game actions. There were developed formal definitions of i) the stochastic process of player decisions in game situations and ii) the inference process of player strategy based on his game decisions. The method was applied to the context of soccer goalkeepers. A model of goalkeeper positioning, with geometric parameters and solutions to optimize his position based on the ball position and trajectory, was developed. The model was tested with a sample of 65 professional goalkeepers (28.8 ± 4.1 years old) playing for their national teams in 2010 and 2014 World Cups. The goalkeeper’s decisions were compared to decisions from a large dataset of other goalkeepers, defining the probability of success in each game circumstance. There were assessed i) performance in a defined set of classes of game plays; ii) entropy of goalkeepers’ decisions; and iii) the effect of goalkeepers’ positioning updates on the outcome (save or goal). Goalkeepers’ decisions were similar to the ones with the lowest probability of goal on the dataset. Goalkeepers’ entropy varied between 24% and 71% of the maximum possible entropy. Positioning dynamics in the instants that preceded the shot indicated that, in goals and saves, goalkeepers optimized their position before the shot in 21.87% and 83.33% of the situations, respectively. These results validate a method to discriminate successful performance. In conclusion, this method enables a more precise assessment of a player’s decision-making ability by consulting a representative dataset of equivalent actions to define the probability of his success. Therefore, it supports the evaluation of the player’s decision separately from his technical skill execution, which overcomes the scientific challenge of discriminating the evaluation of a player’s decision performance from the action result."
https://openalex.org/W2787483474,This paper reports the dynamical analysis of the business cycles of 12 (developed and developing) countries over the last 56 years by applying computational techniques used for tackling complex systems. They reveal long-term convergence and country-level interconnections because of close contagion effects caused by bilateral networking exposure. Interconnectivity determines the magnitude of cross-border impacts. Local features and shock propagation complexity also may be true engines for local configuration of cycles. The algorithmic modeling proves to represent a solid approach to study the complex dynamics involved in the world economies.
https://openalex.org/W2790311049,"In this study we analysed the effects of prophylactic biolistic DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding the encephalitogenic protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) on the severity of a subsequently MOGp35-55-induced EAE and on the underlying immune response. We compared the outcome of vaccination with MOG-encoding plasmids alone or in combination with vectors encoding the regulatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-ß1, respectively. MOG expression was restricted to skin dendritic cells (DCs) by the use of the DC-specific promoter of the fascin1 gene (pFscn-MOG). For comparison, the strong and ubiquitously active CMV promoter was employed (pCMV-MOG), which allows MOG expression in all transfected cells. Expression of IL-10 and TGF-ß1 was controlled by the CMV promoter to yield maximal synthesis (pCMV-IL10, pCMV-TGFß). Co-application of pFscn-MOG and pCMV-IL10 significantly ameliorated EAE pathology, while vaccination with pCMV-MOG plus pCMV-IL10 did not affect EAE outcome. In contrast, vaccination with either of the two MOG-encoding plasmids in combination with pCMV-TGFß significantly attenuated the clinical EAE symptoms. Mechanistically, we observed diminished infiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells as well as macrophages/DCs into the CNS, which correlated with decreased MOGp35-55-specific production of IL-17 and IFN-ϫ by spleen cells and reduced peptide-specific T cell proliferation. Our findings suggest deletion of or anergy induction in MOG-specific CD4+ T cells by the suppressive vaccination platform employed. MOG expression driven by the DC-specific fascin1 promoter yielded similar inhibitory effects on EAE progression as the ubiquitously active viral CMV promoter, when coapplying pCMV-TGFß. Our finding that pCMV-IL10 promoted tolerogenic effects only, when coapplied with pFscn-MOG, but not pCMV-MOG suggests that IL-10 affected only directly transfected DCs (pFscn-MOG), but not neighbouring DCs that engulfed MOG-containing vesicles derived from transfected keratinocytes (pCMV-MOG). Thus, due to its DC-restricted expression, the fascin1 promoter might be an interesting alternative to ubiquitously expressed promoters for vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2787134611,"The enzyme AICAR-transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC) catalyzes the last two steps of purine de novo synthesis. It metabolizes 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), which is an AMP analogue, leading to activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). We investigated whether the AICAR–ATIC pathway plays a role in the high glucose (HG)–mediated DNA damage response and AICAR-mediated AMPK activation, explaining the detrimental effects of glucose on neuronal damage and shortening of the lifespan. HG up-regulated the expression and activity of the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of ATIC, C55F2.1 (atic-1), and increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation end products. Overexpression of atic-1 decreased the lifespan and head motility and increased neuronal damage under both standard and HG conditions. Inhibition of atic-1 expression, by RNAi, under HG was associated with increased lifespan and head motility and reduced neuronal damage, reactive oxygen species, and methylglyoxal-derived advanced glycation end product accumulation. This effect was independent of an effect on DNA damage or antioxidant defense pathways, such as superoxide dismutase (sod-3) or glyoxalase-1 (glod-4), but was dependent on AMPK and accumulation of AICAR. Through AMPK, AICAR treatment also reduced the negative effects of HG. The mitochondrial inhibitor rotenone abolished the AICAR/AMPK-induced amelioration of HG effects, pointing to mitochondria as a prime target of the glucotoxic effects in C. elegans. We conclude that atic-1 is involved in glucotoxic effects under HG conditions, either by blocked atic-1 expression or via AICAR and AMPK induction."

Bioinformatic identification of NADase family members putatively secreted by the bacteriolytic type VII secretion system (T7SS) of Gram-positive bacteria further points to NADases as a diverse and important class of effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2789794065,"Transtibial pullout suture (TPS) repair of posterior medial meniscus root (PMMR) tears was shown to achieve good clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare biomechanically, a novel technique designed to repair PMMR tears using tendon graft (TG) and conventional TPS repair. Twelve porcine tibiae (n = 6 each) TG group: flexor digitorum profundus tendon was passed through an incision in the root area, created 5 mm postero-medially along the edge of the attachment area. TPS group: a modified Mason-Allen suture was created using no. 2 FiberWire. The tendon grafts and sutures were threaded through the bone tunnel and then fixed to the anterolateral cortex of the tibia. The two groups underwent cyclic loading followed by a load-to-failure test. Displacements of the constructs after 100, 500, and 1000 loading cycles, and the maximum load, stiffness, and elongation at failure were recorded. The TG technique had significantly lower elongation and higher stiffness compared with the TPS. The maximum load of the TG group was significantly lower than that of the TPS group. Failure modes for all specimens were caused by the suture or graft cutting through the meniscus. Lesser elongation and higher stiffness of the constructs in TG technique over those in the standard TPS technique might be beneficial for postoperative biological healing between the meniscus and tibial plateau. However, a slower rehabilitation program might be necessary due to its relatively lower maximum failure load."
https://openalex.org/W2790991868,"As NOx emissions legislation for Diesel-engines is becoming more stringent than ever before, an aftertreatment system has been widely used in many countries. Specifically, to reduce the NOx emissions, a selective catalytic reduction(SCR) system has become one of the most promising techniques for Diesel-engine vehicle applications. In the SCR system, input ammonia concentration and ammonia coverage ratio are regarded as essential states in the control-oriental model. Currently, an ammonia sensor placed before the SCR Can is a good strategy for the input ammonia concentration value. However, physical sensor would increase the SCR system cost and the ammonia coverage ratio information cannot be directly measured by physical sensor. Aiming to tackle this problem, an observer based on particle filter(PF) is investigated to estimate the input ammonia concentration and ammonia coverage ratio. Simulation results through the experimentally-validated full vehicle simulator cX-Emission show that the performance of observer based on PF is outstanding, and the estimation error is very small."
https://openalex.org/W2790057164,"This study determined the reliability of post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) and vagal-related HR variability (HRV) after repeated-sprints (RSs), and contrasted it with the smallest worthwhile change (SWC) of these indices. Fourteen healthy male participants performed on four occasions, separated by 7 days, five 30-m sprints interspersed by 25-s of recovery. Post-exercise HR during 10 min of seated rest was measured. HRR during the first 60-s of recovery was computed (HRR60s). HRV indices were calculated in time and frequency domains during the last 5-min of the recovery. Absolute and relative reliability were assessed by typical error of measurement expressed as coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), respectively. Sensitivity was assessed comparing SWC to the typical error of measurement. CV ranged from 3.6% to 13.5% and from 6.3% to 109.2% for the HRR and HRV indices, respectively. ICCs were from 0.78 to 0.96 and from 0.76 to 0.92, respectively. HRR and HRV indices showed large discrepancies reliability. HRR60s and the square root of the mean sum of the squared differences between R-R intervals presented the highest levels of both absolute and relative reliability. However, SWC was lower than the typical error of measurement, indicating insufficient sensitivity to confidently detect small, but meaningful, changes in HRR and HRV indices."
https://openalex.org/W2792470216,"Introduction Globally, persons with HIV infection, depression and substance use disorders have a higher smoking prevalence and smoke more heavily than other populations. These associations have not been explored among Russian smokers with HIV infection and substance use disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the presence of depressive symptoms and smoking outcomes in an HIV-positive cohort of Russian smokers with a history of substance use disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders). Methods We performed a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of a cohort of HIV-positive regular smokers with a history of substance use disorders recruited in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2012–2015. The primary outcome was heavy smoking, defined as smoking > 20 cigarettes per day. Nicotine dependence (moderate-very high) was a secondary outcome. The main independent variable was a high level of depressive symptoms in the past 7 days (defined as CES-D > = 24). We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between depressive symptoms and the outcomes, controlling for age, sex, education, income, running out of money for housing/food, injection drug use, and alcohol use measured by the AUDIT. Results Among 309 regular smokers, 79 participants (25.6%) had high levels of depressive symptoms, and 65 participants (21.0%) were heavy smokers. High levels of depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with heavy smoking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.50, 95% CI 0.78–2.89) or with moderate-very high levels of nicotine dependence (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 0.75–2.41). Conclusions This study did not detect an association between depressive symptoms and smoking outcomes among HIV-positive regular smokers in Russia."
https://openalex.org/W2794026369,"Late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of children caused by mutations resulting in loss of activity of the lysosomal protease, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). While Tpp1-targeted mouse models of LINCL exist, the goal of this study was to create a transgenic mouse with inducible TPP1 to benchmark treatment approaches, evaluate efficacy of treatment at different stages of disease, and to provide insights into the pathobiology of disease. A construct containing a loxP-flanked stop cassette inserted between the chicken-actin promoter and a sequence encoding murine TPP1 (TgLSL-TPP1) was integrated into the ROSA26 locus in mice by homologous recombination. Tested in both transfected CHO cells and in transgenic mice, the TgLSL-TPP1 did not express TPP1 until cre-mediated removal of the LSL cassette, which resulted in supraphysiological levels of TPP1 activity. We tested four cre/ERT2 transgenes to allow tamoxifen-inducible removal of the LSL cassette and subsequent TPP1 expression at any stage of disease. However, two of the cre/ERT2 driver transgenes had significant cre activity in the absence of tamoxifen, while cre-mediated recombination could not be induced by tamoxifen by two others. These results highlight potential problems with the use of cre/ERT2 transgenes in applications that are sensitive to low levels of basal cre expression. However, the germline-recombined mouse transgenic that constitutively overexpresses TPP1 will allow long-term evaluation of overexposure to the enzyme and in cell culture, the inducible transgene may be a useful tool in biomarker discovery projects."
https://openalex.org/W2736281202,"In this paper, I introduce a Sequence-based Multiscale Model (SeqMM) for the biomolecular data analysis. With the combination of spectral graph method, I reveal the essential difference between the global scale models and local scale ones in structure clustering, i.e., different optimization on Euclidean (or spatial) distances and sequential (or genomic) distances. More specifically, clusters from global scale models optimize Euclidean distance relations. Local scale models, on the other hand, result in clusters that optimize the genomic distance relations. For a biomolecular data, Euclidean distances and sequential distances are two independent variables, which can never be optimized simultaneously in data clustering. However, sequence scale in my SeqMM can work as a tuning parameter that balances these two variables and deliver different clusterings based on my purposes. Further, my SeqMM is used to explore the hierarchical structures of chromosomes. I find that in global scale, the Fiedler vector from my SeqMM bears a great similarity with the principal vector from principal component analysis, and can be used to study genomic compartments. In TAD analysis, I find that TADs evaluated from different scales are not consistent and vary a lot. Particularly when the sequence scale is small, the calculated TAD boundaries are dramatically different. Even for regions with high contact frequencies, TAD regions show no obvious consistence. However, when the scale value increases further, although TADs are still quite different, TAD boundaries in these high contact frequency regions become more and more consistent. Finally, I find that for a fixed local scale, my method can deliver very robust TAD boundaries in different cluster numbers."

https://openalex.org/W2785574484,"Laboratory studies of alcohol-inexperienced adolescents show that aggression can be primed by alcohol-related stimuli, suggesting that alcohol-related aggression is partly socially learned. Script theory proposes that alcohol-related aggression 'scripts' for social behaviors are culturally-available and learned by individuals. The purpose of the study was to understand the content and origins of alcohol-related aggression scripts learned by adolescents. This qualitative focus group study of 40 adolescents (ages 14-16 years) examined alcohol-related aggression scripts. Participants believed aggression and severe injury to be pervasive when young people drink. Viewed through a biological lens, participants described aggression as an 'instinctive' and 'hard-wired' male trait facilitated by intoxication. As such, alcohol-related aggression was not seen as intended or personally controllable and participants did not see it in moral terms. Females were largely viewed as either bystanders of inter-male aggression or potential victims of male sexual aggression. Participants attributed their views on the frequency and nature of alcohol-related aggression to current affairs and reality television, which they felt portrayed a reality of which they had little experience. The origins of the explicitly biological frameworks that participants used seemed to lie in pre-existing beliefs about the nature of gender differences. Perceptions of the pervasiveness of male alcohol-related aggression, and the consequent failure to view alcohol-related aggression in moral terms, could dispose some young people to alcohol-related aggression. Interventions could target (1) the beliefs that alcohol-related aggression is pervasive and uncontrollable in males, and (2) participants' dysfunctional views of masculinity that underpin those beliefs."
