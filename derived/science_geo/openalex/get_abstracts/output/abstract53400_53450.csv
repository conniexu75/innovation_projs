https://openalex.org/W1505281105,"Abstract 1. An ATP-dependent oxidation of cytochrome b was observed in submitochondrial particles from beef heart in the presence of succinate, malonate, sulfide, and antimycin A. The reaction was inhibited by rotenone, rutamycin, and uncoupling agents. Under the same conditions an ATP-dependent H2O2 production took place. 2. Spectrophotometric measurements also revealed an ATP-dependent reduction of flavin. In contrast to the oxidation of cytochrome b, the reduction of flavin required addition of catalytic amounts of NAD to the depleted submitochondrial particles. 3. An ATP-dependent, rotenone-sensitive, reduction of ferricyanide by succinate was observed which did not require the addition of NAD. 4. It was concluded that in beef heart submitochondrial particles the reversed electron transfer from cytochrome b driven by ATP takes place via a slowly autoxidizable electron carrier. In the absence of NAD, ferricyanide or oxygen can accept electrons from this carrier, and in the presence of NAD, the electrons can be channeled to a flavoprotein and to NAD. 5. These findings strongly suggest that in the reversal of electron transfer the energy coupling site is located between cytochrome b and the flavin of NADH dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1599183696,"Chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reduction of DPN+ by various purines and aldehydes, was purified to near homogeneity. It exhibits a molecular weight of about 300,000, a molar complement, flavin to molybdenum to iron to labile sulfide, of 2:2:8:8, and an absorption spectrum resembling those of milk xanthine oxidase and rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase. The enzyme catalyzes DPNH diaphorase activity with several electron acceptors. Xanthine and DPNH react with the enzyme at independent sites. Spectrophotometric evidence indicates binding of DPN+ to enzyme flavin; DPN+ and DPNH share a common binding site. The enzyme is progressively inactivated, with respect to xanthine oxidation, by methanol during the course of reduction of artificial electron acceptors, while developing enhanced DPNH diaphorase activity. Arsenite also produces contrasting effects on these two activities. Cyanide inactivates the xanthine dehydrogenase activity while reducing DPNH diaphorase activity by about 70%; this residual diaphorase activity is unaffected by subsequent treatment with arsenite. The enhanced DPNH diaphorase activity of methanol-inactivated and arsenite-treated preparations is resistant to cyanide. Two moles of 14C-cyanide were bound per mole of native enzyme but only one-half as much to arsenite-treated, methanol-inactivated, and DPNH-reduced preparations. The structure of the internal electron transport system of this enzyme is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1542276924,"Molecular oxygen and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide are required for the hydroxylation of octane, yielding n-octanol, in a soluble enzyme system from Pseudomonas oleovorans previously shown to hydroxylate fatty acids at the ω carbon atom. Hexane and decane are also oxidized, but at lower rates. Procedures are described for the separation and partial purification of the three bacterial protein components required for fatty acid and hydrocarbon hydroxylation: rubredoxin (a red, nonheme iron protein containing no labile sulfide), a reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide-rubredoxin reductase, and the ω-hydroxylase. Electron transfer occurs from reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide to rubredoxin, catalyzed by the reductase, and from reduced rubredoxin to cytochrome c. Evidence is presented that rubredoxin and the reductase function in a similar manner as electron carriers during substrate hydroxylation in the presence of the ω-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1488708001,"Abstract Evidence has been presented to show that the DPNH-cytochrome c reductase, but not the TPNH-cytochrome c reductase, activity of microsomes requires phospholipids. Two different phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine, when solubilized together, completely restore the DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity to acetone-extracted microsomes. Micelles containing 40 to 70% (by weight) of phosphatidylcholine, when added to acetone-extracted microsomes, stimulate the DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity to levels 4 times higher than that of the original microsomes. Micelles formed from the synthetic phospholipid, γ-oleyl-β-butyrylphosphatidylcholine, are also able to restore the DPNH-cytochrome c reductase activity to acetone-extracted microsomes, presumably because this phospholipid forms micelles having physicochemical characteristics the same as, or closely related to, those produced by mixtures of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine. When ferricyanide was used as the electron acceptor, no such lipid requirement could be demonstrated, indicating that lipids may be required for the transfer of electrons in the region beyond the flavoprotein of the DPNH-cytochrome c reductase system of intact microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1601568825,"Abstract The general model for ligand binding to proteins composed of subunits which assumes a change in subunit conformation (Biochemistry, 5, 365 (1966)) is extended to two ligand interactions, and its consequences are examined to explain activation, inhibition, and cooperative phenomena. To illustrate the kinetic consequences of the model, a specific case involving a tetrameric protein in the square geometry in which all steps prior to the rate-determining formation of product are assumed to be rapid and reversible is examined in detail. Tables for changes in the three experimental parameters maximum velocity (Vmax), midpoint of the saturation curve (S0.5) and the extent of cooperative binding (Rs, or Hill coefficient) are compiled for different modes of binding in this specific case and applied illustratively to experimental data for dCMP hydrolase and isocitric dehydrogenase. The results indicate: (a) the sequential model is capable of explaining a wide variety of kinetic data involving activators, inhibitors, and cooperative effects; (b) the experimental parameters Vmax, S0.5, and Rs can be used to give a large measure of discrimination between mechanisms and hence are useful for diagnostic tests between mechanisms; (c) because of the assumptions involved in devising the tables for any specific case, a mechanism consistent with the data must be considered a working hypothesis only, to be verified by further experiments; (d) the quantitative conclusions apply to the special case for which the equations are derived, but many of the qualitative conclusions and approach to the data analysis are general; and (e) the sequential model is more general but more complex than the symmetry model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (J. Mol. Biol., 12, 88 (1965))."

https://openalex.org/W1490482172,"Abstract A new phosphodiesterase forming nucleoside 5'-monophosphate from oligonucleotide has been purified 200-fold from a rat liver homogenate. This phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl esters of nucleoside 5'-monophosphate and various oligonucleotides at approximately the same rapid rates, whereas it hydrolyzes DNA and RNA very slowly. The degradation products are all nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, showing no base specificity. Evidence is given that the initial site of attack is at the 3'-hydroxyl end of the oligonucleotide. The phosphodiesterase also hydrolyzes NAD and a new polymer synthesized from NAD (27–30) by isolated rat liver nuclei. The phosphodiesterase has an optimum pH at around 10. It is heat-labile and sensitive to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2163748868,"Isoenzymes of alcohol dehydrogenase extracted from Drosophila melanogaster are interconvertible and can be distinguished by electrophoretic mobility. When adsorbed on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, the faster-moving forms are converted to the slowest-moving form; the latter is converted to the former in the presence of 0.05 molar nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide, and the conversion is accompanied by the binding of 3.5 moles of the dinucleotide per mole of enzyme. A change in heat stability accompanies the conversion of the slowest form of alcohol dehydrogenase to the fastest form; the latter becomes stable at 45 degrees C. The increased heat stability may indicate that a conformational change in the alcohol dehydrogenase occurs along with the binding of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W2025667663,"Stocks of inurine sarcoma virus show titration patterns ranging from one-to two-hit kinetics. The comparison of various titrations of this virus, both with and without added helper virus, to theoretical model systems composed of defined constituents, suggests the existence of a sarcoma virus that does not need coinfectinig murine leukemia virus to be manifested as a focus-forming unit. The behavior of such nondefective particles is compatible with a postulated leukemia-sarcoma virus hybrid."
https://openalex.org/W1587575031,"Abstract A number of nucleotides that inhibit enzymatic activity of staphylococcal nuclease and bind in a 1:1 molar ratio to its active site produce specific shifts in the absorption spectrum toward higher wave lengths when interacting with the enzyme. The difference spectrum, which results from the binding of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate to nuclease at neutral pH, has tyrosyl peaks at 280 and 287 mµ, and a broad hypochromic phase at 240 to 270 mµ. The latter change results from perturbations of the nucleotide chromophore. Binding of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate to nuclease facilitates ionization of the nucleotide, which probably accounts for the change in nucleotide absorption. No changes of tryptophyl absorption accompany binding of nucleotides to nuclease. The magnitudes of the spectral differences, measured at 287 or 247 mµ, vary with the concentration of Ca++ and the nature of the nucleotide in parallel with changes in catalytic activity. The dependence of nucleotide binding on pH suggests that a residue with a pK of 6 to 7 is involved in the binding process. Binding is almost maximal at pH 7, where catalytic activity is virtually absent. Spectrophotometric titrations with nucleotide indicate a stoichiometry of 1 mole of nucleotide per mole of enzyme. The dissociation constants for the nucleotide-nuclease complexes derived from spectral titration data are similar to those obtained from studies of inhibition of enzyme activity, gel filtration, and fluorescence properties of the protein. The spectral changes are dependent on an intact tertiary structure, as suggested by studies on the effects of urea, or of chemical modifications of the nuclease. The spectrophotometric titration curve, in the region of phenolic hydroxyl ionization, is shifted to considerably higher pH values when the titration is carried out on the nuclease nucleotide complex. Solvent perturbation studies reveal that four to five of the seven tyrosyl groups of native nuclease are exposed to the aqueous solvent. In the presence of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate, however, only one to two groups are similarly exposed. These experiments suggest that the process of binding nucleotides to the active site of nuclease involves burying of 3 to 4 tyrosyl residues. It cannot be determined from these studies whether this occurs by direct interaction of the nucleotide with tyrosyl groups or whether a conformational change is induced which, secondarily, affects these residues."
https://openalex.org/W1597899204,"Abstract Polynucleotide ligase, isolated from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T4, catalyzes (a) the repair of an interrupted strand in a DNA duplex by the formation of phosphodiester bonds, with a concomitant cleavage of ATP to AMP and PPi, and (b) an ATP-PPi exchange reaction which is not dependent on the presence of DNA. The two activities elute together from diethylaminoethyl cellulose and phosphocellulose. An enzyme-adenylate complex has been isolated and is found to mediate both the formation of phosphodiester bonds in the absence of ATP and the formation of ATP from PPi. These findings suggest that as the first step of the ligase reaction, ATP and enzyme react to form an enzyme-adenylate intermediate accompanied by the release of PPi."
https://openalex.org/W1515291884,"Abstract The effects of palmityl coenzyme A on both hydrolytic and inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activities of glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) of rat liver microsomes have been investigated. It was found that the acyl coenzyme A compound may either stimulate or inhibit, in a pH- and concentration-dependent, activity-discriminating manner. Marked activation of the phosphotransferase activity (to a maximum of 350% of control levels in one instance) was observed under a wide variety of conditions, while the glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity was at best but modestly elevated (to a maximum of 120% of control levels) and was significantly inhibited by palmityl coenzyme A under most conditions tested. A concomitant extensive activation of phosphotransferase and inhibition of phosphohydrolase activity was observed with certain levels of the acyl coenzyme A compound. Effective concentrations of palmityl coenzyme A coincided with established levels of hepatic long chain fatty acyl coenzyme A derivatives. Coenzyme A, palmitate, and acetyl coenzyme A were without effect on enzymic activities. Maximal phosphotransferase activity was observed at pH 4.3 with untreated microsomal preparations. This maximum was shifted to pH 6 when assays were carried out in the presence of 4.1 x 10-5 m palmityl coenzyme A, and a significant amount of activity was observed at pH 7.0 under these conditions. It is suggested that changes, in vivo, of functional levels of the hydrolytic and synthetic activities of this enzyme in animals in various altered hormonal states, for example, diabetes, possibly may be mediated in part through these activity-discriminating effects of long chain acyl coenzyme A compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2111727865,"Abstract The formation of disulfide bonds between thionucleotides of transfer RNA has been postulated to occur during oxidation with iodine. In this paper, the actual isolation of 4-thiouridylate disulfide from oxidized transfer RNA is described. The 5'-terminal phosphate is removed from the transfer RNA, oxidation with iodine is carried out, and the resulting product is exhaustively digested with pancreatic ribonuclease and spleen phosphodiesterase. Separation of the larger 4-thiouridylate disulfide fragment from the mononucleotides is carried out with the use of gel filtration followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Reduction of the isolated disulfide product produces only 4-thiouridylate; no evidence is seen of any other nucleotides, sulfur-containing or not, having been involved in the linkage Chemically synthesized 4-thiouridine disulfide, when digested under conditions used for RNA hydrolysis, is shown to yield an unidentified intermediate which is reducible to 4-thiouridine. Alkaline digestion of 35S-labeled disulfide transfer RNA results in the appearance of the corresponding mononucleotide of this intermediate without any accompanying formation of 4-thiouridylate. Some of the properties of this new intermediate are described."

Experiments employing gel filtration indicate that the B1 protein is capable of binding certain nucleoside triphosphates known to act as allosteric effectors on ribonucleotide reduction. These data indicate that the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase of E. coli is composed of nonidentical protein subunits, of which one (B1) may serve a regulatory function through an ability to bind allosteric effectors."

The time course of the fluorescence was the same using six combinations of exciting and observing wave lengths, and could be accounted for by the scheme E + R ⇌ ER where E is the free enzyme and R is DPNH. The value of the combination velocity constant was 5 x 106 m-1 sec-1 at 3°. There was no evidence for the formation of more than one enzyme-DPNH complex."
https://openalex.org/W1540690449,"Treatment of the extracellular nuclease of Staphylococcus aureus, strain V8, with cyanogen bromide was previously shown to produce five polypeptides which could be arranged in a linear order. Trypsin digestion of these yielded sets of peptides, in each of which the carboxyl-terminal fragment could be identified by the absence of lysine or arginine, or by the presence of homoserine. The amino acid sequence of each tryptic peptide has been determined. These results, together with the isolation and characterization of peptides produced by chymotrypsin digestion of the intact nuclease, account closely for the amino acid composition of the cyanogen bromide fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1680014281,"Acetate-1-14C incorporation into long chain fatty acids by rabbit heart mitochondria was increased up to 20-fold by citrate, isocitrate, malate, or succinate in the presence of rotenone and ATP. Rotenone blocked NADH oxidation and enabled the maintenance of a high NADH:NAD+ ratio. The rate of fatty acid synthesis was linearly related to the resulting endogenous mitochondrial NADH:NAD+ ratio. By inhibiting reversed electron flow, rotenone inhibited the early high rate of acetate incorporation observed with succinate oxidation. In this situation, succinate supplied reducing equivalents for fatty acid synthesis via malate dehydrogenase. Rotenone also blocked the ADP- or dinitrophenol-induced cleavage of newly incorporated acetate-1-14C from mitochondrial fatty acids by preventing a decrease in the NADH:NAD+ ratio. The NAD oxidation-reduction state is concluded to be the regulator of the rate and direction of the heart mitochondrial fatty acid synthetic-oxidation system."

During the relatively slow process of recombination, several protein species have been detected by spectral and fluorescence measurements of nucleotide binding, by protein fluorescence changes, and by alterations in the number of reactive sulfhydryl groups. Mercuribenzoate and mersalyl were used to prepare stable derivatives of several forms of the aporeductase that appear during recombination. This series of reactions, and in particular the stable mercurial derivatives, thus provide an ideal system for examining the dependence of the tertiary structure of a monomeric flavoprotein upon its primary structure and chemical environment."

https://openalex.org/W1563603901,"Abstract The effect of semicarbazide on the oxidation of choline by rat liver mitochondria was studied. Semicarbazide was used to prevent both further oxidation of betainealdehyde and product inhibition of choline dehydrogenase by the aldehyde. NAD did not stimulate choline-based respiration when semicarbazide was present to prevent the oxidation of enzymatically formed betainealdehyde. In contrast, NAD did stimulate respiration when the semicarbazide was omitted. NAD stimulation of choline-supported respiration appears to be entirely due to its effect on the oxidation of betainealdehyde. In both the presence and the absence of semicarbazide, rotenone inhibited the oxidation of choline. It was concluded that the rate of choline oxidation to betainealdehyde is decreased by rotenone and that this inhibition is not due to product inhibition by betainealdehyde. Choline oxidation by submitochondrial particles was insensitive to rotenone. Inhibition of respiration by rotenone was found to be competitive with respect to choline. Acetate ion eliminated the rotenone sensitivity of choline oxidation. These results suggest that rotenone may inhibit choline oxidation by reducing the rate of entry of choline into intact mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2049750136,"IT was recently proposed1 that the action of strychnine at spinal inhibitory synapses may be explained by an antagonism between strychnine and acetylcholine, an interaction between acetylcholine and presynaptically located receptors which are sensitive to strychnine being an essential requirement for the release of the inhibitory transmitter. This proposal, which would “eliminate blockade by strychnine as an essential qualification for the identification of a putative inhibitory transmitter” in the mammalian spinal cord, is based on the finding that strychnine, in concentrations of the order of 3–300 × 10−6 molar, reduces the release of acetylcholine by impulses in the preganglionic terminals of the perfused feline superior cervical ganglion."

https://openalex.org/W2092938748,"THE mechanism of the toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen has long been a subject of discussion and Haugaard1 has summarized the evidence in favour of the view that the toxicity is due to oxidation of sulphydryl groups. More recently, however, Chance et al.2 observed that 11–17 atm. of oxygen selectively inhibit the energy-linked reduction by succinate of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Because this inhibition occurs much more rapidly than oxidation of sulphydryl groups, Chance et al. suggested the energy-linked reduction of NAD by succinate as the site of the toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen. The oxygen pressures used by Chance, however, were much greater than those customarily used therapeutically3—that is 3 atm. Because toxicity is also observed at these pressures, it seemed desirable to examine the effects of oxygen at 3 atm. on the energy-linked reduction of NAD by succinate."
