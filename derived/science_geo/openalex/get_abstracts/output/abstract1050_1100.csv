One controls T cell recognition of antigen and T cell mediators of cell cooperation, and the other controls the B cell response to T cell mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1980009209,"An autoradiographic study of the subcortical projections of the rat hippocampal formation shows that the efferent fibers of the hippocampus proper (fields CA1-4 OF Ammon's horn) do not project to the hypothalamus but are confined to the precommissural fornix, ending primarily in the septum. The fibers that are distributed by way of the fornix system to the hypothalamus (principally the arcuate-ventromedial region and the mammillary nuclei) and the anterior thalamus arise from the subicular region of the cerebral cortex (that is, the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum)."
https://openalex.org/W1975939184,"The neurotoxin tetanospasmin causes tetanus when it reaches the central nervous system. In this autoradiographic study, 125I-labeled tetanospasmin was injected into the leg muscles of rodents, and the nerves supplying these muscles were crushed. The labeled toxin accumulated within axons on the distal side of the crush. This study provides direct evidence for retrograde axonal transport of a macromolecular toxin that acts at synapses in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2042864237,"Reiterated gene sequences related to the RNA of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are detected in all tissues of domestic cats and their close Felis relatives but not in more distantly related Felis species. Partially homologous viral gene sequences are found in rodent, and particularly rat, DNA. Together with the immunologic relationships observed between FeLV and endogenous rodent type C viruses, the results lead to the conclusion that FeLV-related genes were transmitted from a rodent to cat ancestor and have been perpetuated in the germ line of cats."
https://openalex.org/W1506978970,"The energetics of the Na+-dependent transport of D-glucose into osmotically active membrane vesicles, derived from the brush borders of the rabbit renal proximal tubule, was studied by determining how alterations in the electrochemical potential of the membrane induced by anions, ionophores, and a proton conductor affect the uptake of the sugar. The imposition of a large NaCl gradient (medium is greater than vesicle) resulted in the transient uptake of D-glucose into brush border membranes against its concentration gradient. In the presence of Na+ salts of isethionate or sulfate, both relatively impermeable anions, there was no accumulation of D-glucose above the equilibrium value. With Na+ salts of two highly permeable lipophilic anions, NO3- and SCN-, the transient overshoot was enhanced relative to that with Cl-. With Na+ salts whose mode of membrane translocation is electroneutral, i.e. acetate, bicarbonate, and phosphate, no overshoot was found. These findings suggest that only anions which penetrate the brush border membrane and generate an electrochemical potential, negative on the inside, permit the uphill Na+-dependent transport of D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1594373951,"Tryptic peptides obtained from normal prothrombin have been compared with those obtained from prothrombin synthesized by cattle given the vitamin K antagonist dicumarol. Two peptides were found which contain vitamin K-dependent structures. These peptides contain residues 4 through 10 and residues 12 through 44, respectively. One of these (residues 4 through 10) has previously been shown to contain gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. Digestion of this peptide with aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase B yielded a tetrapeptide (residues 6 through 9). Mass spectra of this peptide showed that it has the structure Leu-Glu(CO2)-Glu(CO2)-Val. The structure of the peptide containing residues 12 through 44 was determined by automated degradation in a peptide sequenator. The modified glutamic acid residues were identified by mass spectrometric comparison with the thiohydantoin derivatives of synthetic gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. This approach unequivocally demonstrated that all of the first 10 glutamic acid residues in prothrombin are carboxylated to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. Evidence is also presented that indicates that these gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues constitute the entire vitamin K-dependent modification of prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1592475523,"The properties of the duplex block polymer d(C15A15) - d(T15G15) were examined by thermal denaturation and nuclease susceptibility studies in the absence and presence of drugs (actinomycin and netropsin) which bind specifically to only one end of the block polymer. The nucleotide composition of one region of this synthetic double-helical DNA affected the properties of a contiguous but remote region. Furthermore, the binding of actinomycin influenced the properties of both the binding and nonbinding regions. These findings suggest a mechanism for gene regulation at a distance."
https://openalex.org/W1963526553,"THE protein of the organic matrix of bone consists mainly of collagen in association with a small proportion of non-collagenous proteins. When bone is decalcified, much of the non-collagenous protein can be solubilised in conditions of neutral pH but the collagen remains insoluble. Extracts of decalcified bone prepared in this manner contain small amounts of plasma proteins which derive in part from the presence of blood vessels within the tissue1,2. There is evidence, however, that some plasma proteins, including albumin, form an integral part of the calcified matrix3. When 14C-glucosamine or 14C-glucosamine-labelled rabbit total plasma protein is injected into a rabbit, some activity is incorporated into the bone4. Using the procedure of Herring5 to separate the EDTA-soluble proteins of the bone matrix, most of the activity was shown to be present in the less acidic glycoprotein fraction, much of this in one glycoprotein which was also present as a minor component of blood4. This G2B glycoprotein had the electrophoretic mobility of an α globulin and a molecular weight by SDS gel electrophoresis6 of about 50,000. Studies by Ashton et al. (private communication) support the view that the G2B glycoprotein they have investigated in rabbit4 and bovine bone6 is the analogue of human α2HS glycoprotein."

The varions have properties of known type C RNA tumor viruses and share antigenic determinants with the major interspecies-specific antigen (p30) of simian sarcoma virus. Antiserum to reverse transcriptase of gibbon ape leukemia virus inhibits the reverse transcriptase of the putative human virions and that of simian sarcoma virus, but has no effect on the corresponding enzymes of avian or murine RNA tumor viruses."

Thermal denaturation studies on these DNAs in the absence and presence of actinomycin, which binds only to the GC portions of these molecules, have confirmed and extended our previous observation that the properties of one region of a DNA can be influenced (telestabilized) by a remote region. In addition, the large scale synthesis of d(C15A15) - d(T15G15) is described."
https://openalex.org/W1555208444,"Two guinea pig myelin basic protein preparations which differed markedly in their contents of high pH electrophoretic or chromatographic forms were studied in an attempt to elucidate the causes of their microheterogeneity. Both total preparations and components isolated therefrom were examined for their amino acid compositions, NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal residues, total phosphorus contents, amd contents of phosphamino acids. The results showed that the five components differed sequentially by a single charge and that the microgeterogeneity arose as a result of secondary modifications of a single secies (Component 1) Of basic protein. Two modifications were demonstrated; viz. phosphorylation of serine and threonine and loss of COOH-terminal arginine. These two modifications were insufficient to account completely for the observed microheterogeneity; an additional cause, deamidation, was postulated. From the relationship between the number of components present in the total basic protein, the phosphorus and phosphoamino acid contents of the components, and the changes in relative electrophoretic mobility of the components which accompanied their phosphorylation and dephosphorylation we conclude that in the native basic protein no more than two sites in any polypeptide chain are phosphorylated."

https://openalex.org/W2061274561,"In Rana pipiens embryos, eye anlagen were moved to the evacuated ear position, where they continued to differentiate and sent their optic nerve fibers into the hindbrain. Upon entering the medulla, the optic fibers turned caudally, penetrated the spinal cord, and traversed the dorsolateral white matter to the caudal end. We found this pattern of growth in every animal; the optic fibers did not enter the tecta. These results suggest the existence within the neural tube of a three-dimensional gradient system to which embryonic optic fibers are responsive and which may guide the normal development of the visual pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1603706070,"One- and two-diminsional tryptic and chymotryptic peptide maps of 125-I-labeled alpha and alphabeta avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase demonstrate that the alpha polypeptide of the one and two subunit enzymes are structurally similar, if not identical. Furthermore, the beta subunit contains the same major 125I-labeled peptides as alpha, plus several additional peptides. These relationships and the fact that aging of purified alphabeta avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase increases the proportion of alpha DNA polymerase that can be isolated from the alphabeta enzyme by phosphocellulose chromatography, suggests that alpha is derived from beta by proteolytic cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W1490877375,"The antigenic determinants of bovine myelin encephalitogenic protein were investigated by quantitative complement fixation and hapten inhibition using rabbit anti-monkey protein and anti-bovine protein and purified and characterized fragments of bovine protein. The two regions of bovine encephalitogenic protein containing determinants were sequences 1 to 43 and 90 to 170. One rabbit antiserum recognized a determinant(s) probably in residues 15 to 40 while for another rabbit antiserum the determinant of 1 to 43 resided in 1 to 20. The determinant(s) of residues 90 to 170 involved the region around the tryptophan at position 116. Fragment 44-89, which contains the major encephalitogenic determinant for the rabbit, was virtually devoid of any reactivity with the rabbit anti-encephalitogenic protein. It appears that portions of the protein other than the encephalitogenic site are responsible for stimulation of bone marrow-derived cells and antibody production. In demonstrating selected regions of the protein as sites for antigenic determinants, the present immunochemical studies also suggest that the protein might have a more folded conformational alignment than previously suspected."

https://openalex.org/W1998207617,"MICE generate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) which are able to lyse virus infected target cells in vitro after infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and pox-viruses1–3. CTL kill syngeneic and semiallogenic infected cells but not allogenic infected targets. Target cell lysis in these systems seems to be restricted by H-2 antigens, especially by the K or D end of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In experiments where virus specific sensitised lymphocytes kill virus infected allogenic target cells4 the effector lymphocytes have not been characterised exactly. Recent investigations suggest that the active cell in this assay, at least in the measles infection, is a non-thymus derived cell (H. Kreth, personal communication). An H-2 restriction of cell mediated cytolysis (CMC) to trinitrophenol (TNP)-modified lymphocytes has also been described5. Zinkernagel and Doherty6 postulated that the CTL is directed against syngeneic H-2 antigens and viral antigens and they suggested an alteration of H-2 induced by the LCMV infection. Earlier7 we found a close topological relationship between H-2 antigens and the target antigen(s) responsible for CMC in the vaccinia system. Here we report experiments which were carried out to prove alteration of H-2 after infection of L-929 fibroblasts with vaccinia virus."
https://openalex.org/W2065417675,"Sensitization of Lewis rats with whole central nervous system tissue or with purified myelin induced both experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and a serum factor which inhibited myelin formation in vitro. Sensitization with the encephalitogenic factor, myelin basic protein, induced EAE, but not the myelination inhibition factor. Sensitization with cerebroside induced neither EAE nor myelination inhibition factor. The serums from control animals without EAE as well as from animals sensitized with all of the above antigens blocked evoked electrical responses in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2123931362,"Hybrids between mouse hepatoma cells (which secrete several serum proteins) and mouse or rat fibroblasts (which do not secrete these proteins) produce transferrin and the third component of complement (C3) like the parental hepatoma cells, while they do not secrete either albumin or α-fetoprotein (AFP). This lack of albumin and AFP secretion is probably due to a lack of synthesis, rather than to a simple detect in secretion. The cessation of albumin and AFP production is not dependent upon the parental fibroblast nor upon the selection conditions; it is best explained by a shut-off of synthesis and could thus reflect the existence of a regulatory mechanism. This would imply a difference between the control of albumin and AFP synthesis and that of transferrin and C3 synthesis. On the other hand, in agreement with Peterson and Weiss, 1972 Peterson J.A. Weiss M.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 69. 1972: 571 Google Scholar , hybrids between rat hepatoma cells and mouse fibroblasts continue to produce rat albumin. This suggests that the mouse hepatoma cells differ from the rat hepatoma cells in the way they control albumin production."
https://openalex.org/W1573892098,"Abstract Biologically active preparations of 125I-thyrotropin, [3H]thyrotropin, and the [3H]exophthalmogenic factor derived from thyrotropin by partial pepsin digestion have been used to study the binding properties of the thyrotropin receptor on guinea pig retro-orbital tissue plasma membranes. In regard to the optimal conditions of binding, pH, buffer, salt concentrations, and temperature, these properties are the same as those described in any accompanying report concerning thyrotropin binding to bovine thyroid plasma membranes (Tate, R.L., Schwartz, H.I., Holmes, J.M., Kohn, L.D., and Winand, R.J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6509-6515). In addition, thyrotropin receptors on the retro-orbital tissue plasma membranes are similar to thyrotropin receptors on bovine thyroid plasma membranes in their apparent negative cooperativity and in their relative affinities for luteinizing hormone, the beta subunit of thyrotropin, and the alpha subunit of thyrotropin. In contrast, gamma-globulin from patients with malignant exophthalmos enhances binding when added to incubation mixtures containing the retro-orbital tissue plasma membranes but not when added to those containing thyroid plasma membranes. Normal gamma-globulin and gamma-globulin from Graves' disease patients without exophthalmos do not have this property. The gamma-globulin itself does not bind to the membrane except in the presence of thyrotropin or its exophthalmogenic factor derivative. Tryptic digestion of the retro-orbital tissue membranes releases specific thyrotropin and exophthalmogenic factor binding activity into the supernatant phase. Chromatography on Sephadex G-100 indicates that this trypsin-released receptor activity has a molecular weight of 75,000 or greater, rather than 15,000 to 30,000 for the trypsin-released receptor activity from bovine thyroid membranes (Tate, R.L., Schwartz, H.I., Holmes, J.M., Kohn, L.D., and Winand, R.J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6509-6515)."

https://openalex.org/W2025485388,"Two forms of DNA polymerase are present in RD-114-infected human, dog, and mink cells, but are not detectable in uninfected cells. The two enzymes are indistinguishable catalytically and immunologically, but differ with respect to molecular weight and elution position from (dT)12–18-cellulose and phosphocellulose. The large enzyme (∼ 95,000 daltons) is found in the infected cells, but not the virions produced by these cells. The virions contain only the smaller enzyme (∼ 70,000 daltons). The larger form may represent a mammalian viral equivalent to the β subunit of avian RNA tumor virus DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2022260222,"Human chromosome preparations were treated with a group of anthracycline antibiotics. Well-defined, orange-red fluorescent bands were observed on chromosomes after the slide was stained with daunomycin and adriamycin but not with nogalamycin. The characteristic differential bands appeared to be similar to the banding patterns obtained by the quinacrine techniques. Interaction of these antibiotics with DNA could provide information on the general mechanism of fluorescent banding. Further, these bands (D-bands) appeared to be more stable than the Q-bands and may have some usefulness for routine clinical cytogenetic analysis."

https://openalex.org/W2163168540,"Retro-orbital tissue membranes have been shown to have adenylate cyclase activity which can be stimulated by thyrotropin and by an exophthalmogenic factor derived from the thyrotropin molecule by partial pepsin digestion. This stimulable activity is maximal after 15 min and is optimal in the presence of 3 mM magnesium and 1.5 mM ATP. Calcium salts are exquisitely inhibitory to the hormonal stimulation; sodium, lithium, and ammonium salts are significantly less inhibitory. Thyrotropin and the exophthalmogenic factor induce similar maximal levels of stimulation but a 4- to 5-fold higher concentration of exophthalmogenic factor is required to achieve this level. Fluoride stimulates adenylate cyclase activity 2- to 3-fold higher than either thyrotropin or the exophthalmogenic factor; thyrotropin, luteinizing hormone, the beta subunit of thyrotropin, and the alpha subunit of thyrotropin have relative activities for stimulation of cyclase activity of 100:2:2 less than 0.5. Several other polypeptide and glycoprotein hormones have no effect. The gamma-globulin from patients with malignant exophthalmos has no significant effect on cyclase activity either alone or in the presence of maximal levels of thyrotropin or the exophthalmogenic factor; this gamma-globulin does, however, stimulate cyclase activity at submaximal hormone levels. Trypsin not only destroys the hormone-stimulable adenylate cyclase activity on retro-orbital tissue plasma membranes, but also destroys it on the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor fragment released from the membranes by the tryptic action."

https://openalex.org/W1510420091,"Dialyzed rabbit liver cytosol was specifically freed of endogenous fructose-1,6-diphosphatase by immunoadsorption on a column of Sepharose-immobilized anti-fructose-1,6-diphosphatase. This material increased the specific activity of homogeneous enzyme to the maximal rate observed with EDTA and shifted the pH optimum from 8.4 to 7.4. With oleate or other fatty acids as activators, the hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-diphosphatase by enzyme, at neutral pH, showed nonlinear initial rates dropping to lower linear rates. Cytosol activator acted synergistically with oleate both to increase neutral enzyme activity and to maintain the high initial catalytic rates. After sucrose density centrifugation or gel filtration, the cytosol had no effect by itself, but still potentiated oleate activation. The factor was destroyed by treatment with subtilisin or trypsin, but all attempts to identify a unique protein component in cytosol were unsuccessful. The presence of Na dodecyl-SOJ, deoxycholate, or urea did not improve the resolution of the factor, but these compounds did lower the K50 for activation by cytosol. Since fatty acids are the only unique compounds which have been isolated from cytosol which activated fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, it appears that soluble proteins can act as natural carriers for the fatty acids. This was supported by the fact that both dialyzed rabbit alpha-globulins and muscle phosphofructokinase also acted synergistically with oleate in a manner similar to cytosol. Phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine activated fructose-1,6-diphosphatase, and their action was synergistic with oleate. Glutathione (1 mM) activated the enzyme 5-fold at pH 7.3 and its effects were additive with oleate and cytosol or alpha-globulins."
