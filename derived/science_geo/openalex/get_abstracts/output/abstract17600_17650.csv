https://openalex.org/W2054975255,"As a first step in a program to use genetically altered mice in the study of memory mechanisms, mutant mice were produced that do not express the α-calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (α-CaMKII). The α-CaMKII is highly enriched in postsynaptic densities of hippocampus and neocortex and may be involved in the regulation of long-term potentiation (LTP). Such mutant mice exhibited mostly normal behaviors and presented no obvious neuroanatomical defects. Whole cell recordings reveal that postsynaptic mechanisms, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function, are intact. Despite normal postsynaptic mechanisms, these mice are deficient in their ability to produce LTP and are therefore a suitable model for studying the relation between LTP and learning processes."
https://openalex.org/W1503258737,"Advanced glycosylation end products of proteins (AGEs) are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. A approximately 35-kDa polypeptide with a unique NH2-terminal sequence has been isolated from bovine lung and found to be present on the surface of endothelial cells where it mediates the binding of AGEs (receptor for advanced glycosylation end product or RAGE). Using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal sequence of RAGE, an apparently full-length cDNA of 1.5 kilobases was isolated from a bovine lung cDNA library. This cDNA encoded a 394 amino acid mature protein comprised of the following putative domains: an extracellular domain of 332 amino acids, a single hydrophobic membrane spanning domain of 19 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal domain of 43 amino acids. A partial clone encoding the human counterpart of RAGE, isolated from a human lung library, was found to be approximately 90% homologous to the bovine molecule. Based on computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of RAGE and comparison with databases, RAGE is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and shares significant homology with MUC 18, NCAM, and the cytoplasmic domain of CD20. Expression of the RAGE cDNA in 293 cells allowed them to bind 125I-AGE-albumin in a saturable and dose-dependent manner (Kd approximately 100 nM), blocked by antibody to RAGE. Western blots of 293 cells transfected with RAGE cDNA probed with anti-RAGE IgG demonstrated expression of immunoreactive protein compared to its absence in mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that RAGE functions as a cell surface receptor for AGEs, which could potentially mediate cellular effects of this class of glycosylated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1979521526,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a cytotoxic agent of macrophages, a messenger molecule of neurons, and a vasodilator produced by endothelial cells. NO synthase, the synthetic enzyme for NO, was localized to rat penile neurons innervating the corpora cavernosa and to neuronal plexuses in the adventitial layer of penile arteries. Small doses of NO synthase inhibitors abolished electrophysiologically induced penile erections. These results establish NO as a physiologic mediator of erectile function."
https://openalex.org/W2063135487,"Immature T cells and some T cell hybridomas undergo apoptotic cell death when activated through the T cell receptor complex, a phenomenon that is probably related to antigen induced negative selection of developing T cells. This activation-induced apoptosis depends on active protein and RNA synthesis in the dying cells, although none of the genes required for this process have previously been identified. Antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to c-myc block the constitutive expression of c-Myc protein in T cell hybridomas and interfere with all aspects of activation-induced apoptosis without affecting lymphokine production in these cells. These data indicate that c-myc expression is a necessary component of activation-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1583346750,"Complexes between 125I-labeled urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) bound to purified alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) receptor (alpha 2MR)/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). No binding was observed when using uPA. The magnitude of uPA.PAI-1 binding was comparable with that of the alpha 2MR-associated protein (alpha 2MRAP). Binding of uPA.PAI-1 was blocked by natural and recombinant alpha 2MRAP, and about 80% inhibited by complexes between tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and PAI-1, and by a monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibody. In human monocytes, uPA.PAI-1, like uPA and its amino-terminal fragment, bound to the urokinase receptor (uPAR). Degradation of uPAR-bound 125I-uPA.PAI-1 was 3-4-fold enhanced as compared with uncomplexed uPAR-bound uPA. The inhibitor-enhanced uPA degradation was blocked by r alpha 2MRAP and inhibited by polyclonal anti-alpha 2MR/LRP antibodies. This is taken as evidence for mediation of internalization and degradation of uPAR-bound uPA.PAI-1 by alpha 2MR/LRP."
https://openalex.org/W1522999898,"E-selectin (ELAM-1) and P-selectin (GMP-140, PADGEM, CD62) have both been described as human endothelial cell adhesion molecules for neutrophils and monocytes. Cell surface appearance of these two proteins on human umbilical vein endothelial cells can be regulated by different mechanisms: E-selectin is transcriptionally induced, within hours, by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) while P-selectin is transported from storage granules to the plasma membrane within minutes upon induction by various stimulating agents. We have obtained cDNA clones covering the full-length coding sequence of the homologous mouse proteins for both endothelial selectins. We show that synthesis of mouse P-selectin, like that of E-selectin, is transiently induced by TNF-alpha in several endothelioma cell lines derived from different mouse tissues. This induction was monitored on both the RNA as well as the protein level. The TNF induced, newly synthesized P-selectin protein was detected on the cell surface. Protein expression of P-selectin increased with a slightly lower rate than expression of E-selectin. In organ cultures of lung tissue from TNF-injected mice, the synthesis of P-selectin was clearly elevated compared to control mice. The bovine P-selectin homolog recognized by cross-reaction with anti-mouse P-selectin antibodies was also TNF-inducible in primary capillary endothelial cells from adrenal cortex and in aorta-derived endothelial cells. Thus, P-selectin can be regulated on two different levels. While the transport of stored P-selectin to the cell surface is controlled by regulated secretion of storage granules, the synthesis and surface expression can be induced by TNF-alpha similarly to that of E-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W1573108780,"The adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) catalyzes the exchange of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial internal membrane. Its three isoforms, ANT1, ANT2, and ANT3 are coded by differentially regulated nuclear genes. The patterns of expression of these genes in human, bovine, and mouse tissue are similar. ANT1 is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and is induced during myoblast differentiation. It is coordinately regulated with the nuclear gene for the mitochondrial ATP synthase beta subunit, with which it shares the positive muscle cis element, the OXBOX. ANT2 is either absent or weakly expressed in all tissues. ANT3 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, and its transcript level is proportional to the level of oxidative metabolism. The tissue-specific expression of the ANT gene family thus provides insight into the molecular basis of the differential reliance of mammalian tissues on oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1607493519,"N-Heparan sulfate sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to the nitrogen of glucosamine in heparan sulfate. The enzyme has been previously purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver (Brandan, E., and Hirschberg, C. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2417-2422). We have now cloned the rat liver enzyme using the following strategy: (a) the amino acid sequence was obtained from tryptic peptides of the purified protein, (b) mixed oligonucleotides were generated based on the sequence of the tryptic peptides, (c) a polymerase chain reaction fragment was obtained using mixed oligonucleotide interprimer amplification of cDNA, and (d) this fragment was used to screen rat liver lambda gt 10 and lambda ZAP libraries. Three clones were obtained, one of which seems to contain the complete coding sequence of the N-heparan sulfate sulfotransferase (N-HSST). Evidence that the cDNA clone corresponds to the previously purified and characterized N-HSST was the following: (a) the predicted sequence of the N-HSST contains all of the 11 tryptic peptides obtained from the purified protein, (b) when a cDNA containing the sequence coding for the N-HSST was introduced in a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected in COS-1 cells, the enzyme activity was expressed 9-fold over controls, and (c) the characteristic of the predicted protein fits with the purified protein in terms of molecular weight, membrane localization, and its being an N-linked glycoprotein. The size of the longest cDNA isolated is 4.1 kilobases, which is in close agreement with the 4.2-kilobase size of one of the mRNA observed in Northern analyses. In addition, messages of 7.0 and 8.5 kilobases were also observed, suggesting that a large portion is untranslated. The latter messages were the major mRNA species detected."
https://openalex.org/W1531051035,"In this report we have characterized further the myelin basic protein (MBP) gene thyroid hormone response element (TRE) by functional and binding analysis. Mutation and deletion experiments revealed that this TRE, confined to the sequences -184 to -167 of the MBP promoter, is able to function as a classical regulatory element in the context of the native and a heterologous promoter. It is comprised of two regions, containing a motif that is highly conserved among other TREs: AGGACA, arranged as an inverted palindrome. Any mutation within the footprinted region impaired receptor binding and function. Moreover, the deletion of sequences outside of the receptor footprinted region (MBP-TRE-18) resulted in a higher triiodothyronine responsiveness and a concomitant increase in receptor-dependent, hormone-independent repression. Results of transfection assays showed that both receptors alpha and beta elicit indistinguishable triiodothyronine responses when the MBP-TRE functions as a regulator of a heterologous promoter activity. However, a preferential beta receptor transactivation was observed when the MBP-TRE was placed in the context of its native promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2164830848,"Seventeen kinetoplast minicircle-encoded and nine maxicircle-encoded gRNA genes have been identified. Six overlapping minicircle-encoded gRNAs mediate editing for the 5'-pan-edited MURF4 gene and two for the 5'-edited COIII gene. The pan-edited RPS12 mRNA is edited by seven minicircle-encoded gRNAs and one maxicircle-encoded gRNA. The 3'-most gRNA in each domain forms an anchor with unedited mRNA, whereas upstream gRNAs form anchors only with edited mRNA, thereby explaining the observed 3' to 5' polarity of editing within an editing domain. We suggest that a role of G-U base pairs is to allow breathing of the edited mRNA-gRNA hybrid and formation of the upstream anchor hybrid."
https://openalex.org/W1525632749,"A new type of chloride channel has been identified by functional expression of phospholemman, a 72-amino acid cardiac sarcolemmal protein with a single transmembrane domain. Xenopus oocytes injected with phospholemman RNA developed a chloride-selective current, which was activated by hyperpolarizing pulses. The current activated very slowly with a pronounced sigmoidal delay, did not inactivate, and increased in amplitude with trains of pulses, depolarized holding potentials, and low extracellular pH. Point mutations within the single transmembrane region abolished the sigmoidal delay of expressed currents. Phospholemman appears to be the smallest plasma membrane channel protein yet known. The structure is dissimilar to any chloride channel described thus far."
https://openalex.org/W1988866031,"In normal humans the fetal stage-specific gamma-globin genes are silenced after birth and not expressed in the adult. Exceptions are seen in cases of hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin (HPFH). These are clinically important because the elevated levels of gamma-globin can alleviate beta-thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia. One class of mutations is associated with point mutations in the promoter of the gamma-globin genes (non-deletion HPFH), whereas others seem to be caused by large deletions 3' to the gamma-globin genes. To test whether the point mutation found in the Greek non-deletion HPFH (guanine to adenine at nucleotide position -117) is the cause of the raised gamma-globin levels in the adult stage and is not just a linked polymorphism, we engineered this mutation into a gamma-globin gene. When this gene was introduced into mice, the presence of the -117 mutation results in persistence of gamma-globin expression at a high level and a concomitant decrease in beta-globin expression in fetal and adult mice. We show that these changes correlate with the loss of binding of the transcription factor GATA1 to the gamma-globin promoter, suggesting that it may act as a negative regulator of the gamma-globin gene in adults."
https://openalex.org/W1548933760,"The protooncogene c-kit encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for the stem cell factor (SCF). Mutants of c-kit were shown to confer a pleiotropic defective phenotype and often display negative dominance in heterozygous mice. To explore the involvement of receptor dimerization in this genetic phenomenon, we employed both a human ligand, which does not recognize the murine receptor, and a rodent SCF, which binds to the human receptor with 100-fold reduced affinity as compared with human SCF. SCF binding to living cells was found to induce rapid and complete receptor dimerization that involved activation of the catalytic tyrosine kinase function. Although receptor dimerization can be attributed to the dimeric nature of the ligand, no dissociation of Kit dimers occurred at high excess of SCF, suggesting that receptor-receptor interactions are also involved in dimer stabilization. This was supported by in vitro formation of heterodimers between the human and murine Kit proteins through monovalent binding of species-specific human SCF. By coexpression of human and mouse Kit in murine fibroblasts, we found that receptor heterodimerization in living cells involved an increase in the affinity of human Kit for rat SCF and also an accelerated rate of receptor down-regulation. When a human Kit mutant lacking the kinase insert domain was coexpressed with the murine wild-type receptor, we observed a significant decrease in both the activation of the intact tyrosine kinase and its coupling to an effector protein, namely phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase. Our results favor a receptor activation model that assumes an initial step of monovalent ligand binding, followed by an intermediate receptor dimer bound by one arm of the ligand molecule. This model predicts the existence of an intrinsic receptor dimerization site and provides a structural basis for genetic dominance of mutant SCF receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1528920733,"Homogeneous Fpg protein of Escherichia coli has DNA glycosylase activity which excises some purine bases with damaged imidazole rings, and an activity excising deoxyribose (dR) from DNA at abasic (AP) sites leaving a gap bordered by 5'- and 3'-phosphoryl groups. In addition to these two reported activities, we show that the Fpg protein also catalyzes the excision of 5'-terminal deoxyribose phosphate (dRp) from DNA, which is the principal product formed by the incision of AP endonucleases at abasic sites. Moreover, the rate of the Fpg protein catalysis for the 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase activity is slower than the activities excising dR from abasic sites and dRp from abasic sites preincised by endonucleases. The product released by the Fpg protein in the excision of 5'-terminal dRp from an abasic site preincised by an AP endonuclease is a single base-free unsaturated dRp, suggesting that the excision results from beta-elimination. The release of 5'-terminal dRp by crude extracts of E. coli from wild type and fpg-mutant strains shows that the Fpg protein is one of the major EDTA-resistant activities catalyzing this reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1586361638,"Abstract A series of biochemical investigations to compare the DNA polymerase and RNase H functions of the reverse transcriptases (RTs) corresponding to azidothymidine (AZT)-sensitive and -resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains are described. Steady-state kinetic studies with purified recombinant enzymes utilizing several templates and three inhibitors, 3' azido-3' deoxythymidine triphosphate (AZTTP), 3-amino-thymidine 5'-triphosphate, and 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate, found consistent 2-4-fold differences between the enzymes from the two strains over a wide pH range. A strong pH dependence for all three inhibitors was found at pH values below 7.4 and suggested an ionizable group on the enzyme with a pK of about 7. The sensitivities of the RNase H activities of the two enzymes to AZTTP and AZTMP were also compared and found to be similar. The nucleotide incorporation fidelities of recombinant RTs corresponding to AZT-sensitive and -resistant clinical isolates were compared and the error specificities determined. No significant differences were found. Both enzymes were equally able to incorporate AZTTP into an elongating M13 DNA strand with concomitant chain termination. Purified wild-type and mutant virions from cell-culture supernatants were compared in endogenous DNA synthesis reactions, and the sensitivities of this activity to AZTTP were found to be similar. The contrast between the small differences found in this study and the high level of viral resistance in tissue culture presumably reflects an incomplete understanding of AZT inhibition of HIV in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1592694746,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which lead to defective Cl- conductance in epithelial cells. While the CFTR gene product has been detected in the plasma membrane, its presence and functional role in the membranes of intracellular compartments remain to be established. The purpose of the present experiments was to functionally localize CFTR in the endosomal membrane and to test the role of the associated Cl- conductance in the regulation of endosomal pH (pH(en)). When using conductive protonophores, the net H+ flux across the endosomal membrane of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is limited by the movement of counterions. Thus, ionic permeability could be estimated indirectly, from the changes in pH(en) determined fluorimetrically. Measurements in situ and in a cell-free microsomal preparation indicate the presence of a protein kinase A (PKA)-activated anion conductance in endosomes from CHO cells transfected with CFTR, but not in endosomes from wild-type or mock-transfected cells. In endosomes isolated from CFTR-expressing cells, the stimulatory effect of PKA was diminished by a specific peptide inhibitor of PKA, by alkaline phosphatase treatment or by a monoclonal antibody against the second nucleotide binding fold of CFTR. Increasing counterion permeability by phosphorylation of CFTR or by addition of valinomycin failed to alter the rate or extent of endosomal acidification in situ. Our observations indicate that functional CFTR, susceptible to activation by PKA, is present in endosomes of transfected CHO cells. More importantly, the data suggest that factors other than counterion permeability are the major determinants of pH(en)."
https://openalex.org/W1483755648,"The P68 protein kinase is a serine/threonine kinase induced by interferon treatment and activated by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Once activated, the kinase phosphorylates its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) leading to potential limitations in functional eIF-2 and decreases in protein synthesis initiation. We have recently purified from influenza virus-infected cells a P68 kinase inhibitor, found to be a 58-kDa cellular protein. We have now investigated the mechanisms by which the 58-kDa inhibitor regulates P68 kinase activity and how the inhibitor itself is controlled. The 58-kDa inhibitor did not function by degrading or sequestering the dsRNA activator of P68 but could repress phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha by an already activated protein kinase. Utilizing antibody prepared against a 58-kDa-specific peptide, we showed that the 58-kDa proteins from infected and uninfected cells were present in equivalent amounts. Although kinase inhibitory activity could not be detected in crude uninfected cell extracts, ammonium sulfate treatment unmasked this activity and allowed purification of the cellular inhibitor with identical chromatographic properties as that from influenza virus-infected cells. Finally, we have identified and partially purified a specific inhibitor of the 58-kDa protein which we refer to as an anti-inhibitor. Based on these data, we present a model depicting the complex regulation of the interferon-induced protein kinase in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1501611496,"Regulation of transcription elongation is an important mechanism in controlling eukaryotic gene expression. SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro (Reines, D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). Here we show that SII-dependent in vitro transcription through an arrest site in a human gene is preceded by nascent transcript cleavage. RNA cleavage appeared to be an obligatory step in the SII activation process. Recombinant SII activated cleavage while a truncated derivative lacking polymerase binding activity did not. Cleavage was not restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. These data support a model whereby SII stimulates elongation via a ribonuclease activity of the elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1940021039,"During suspension-induced terminal differentiation of human epidermal keratinocytes, the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin is down-regulated in two stages: first, the ability of the receptor to bind fibronectin is reduced; later, the receptor is lost from the cell surface, and the level of the subunit mRNAs declines. We have begun to examine the mechanisms that regulate these events. Pulse-chase experiments showed that when keratinocytes were placed in suspension to induce terminal differentiation maturation of the beta 1 subunit and its associated alpha subunits was prevented. The inhibition of maturation was at the stage of N-linked glycosylation in the Golgi, because the immature integrin subunits were sensitive to endoglycosidase H digestion and the inhibition could be mimicked in adherent cells by treatment with 1-deoxymannojirimycin. In 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated adherent keratinocytes, immature integrin subunits reached the cell surface; however, in keratinocytes induced to differentiate in suspension, no beta 1-integrin precursors were detected on the cell surface. Thus commitment to terminal differentiation results in a block both in integrin glycosylation and transport to the cell surface; down-regulation of receptor function must therefore involve modulation of pre-existing receptor on the cell surface. Although fibronectin or rabbit antiserum to alpha 5 beta 1 can inhibit suspension-induced terminal differentiation they did not overcome the inhibition of glycosylation. Nuclear run-on assays showed that transcription of the alpha 5 and beta 1 genes was switched off during suspension-induced terminal differentiation, and treatment of adherent keratinocytes with actinomycin D suggested that the half-lives of the alpha 5 and beta 1 mRNAs were similar in adherent and suspended cells. Thus, loss of alpha 5 beta 1 from the cell surface reflects both inhibition of transcription of the subunit genes and inhibition of maturation and intracellular transport of newly synthesized subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1538897888,"Aspartyl (asparaginyl) beta-hydroxylase which specifically hydroxylates 1 Asp or Asn residue in certain epidermal growth factor-like domains of a number of proteins, has been previously purified to apparent homogeneity from detergent-solubilized bovine liver microsomes (Wang, Q., VanDusen, W. J., Petroski, C. J., Garsky, V. M., Stern, A. M., and Friedman, P. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14004-14010). Three oligonucleotides, corresponding to three amino acid sequences of the purified hydroxylase, were used to screen bovine cDNA libraries. Several overlapping positive cDNA clones containing a full length open reading frame of 754 amino acids encoding a 85-kDa protein were isolated, and a cDNA, containing the full length open reading frame, was constructed from two of these clones. The resulting clone was then transcribed and translated in vitro to produce recombinant protein which possessed Asp beta-hydroxylase activity. These results constitute proof that the protein purified from bovine liver is an Asp beta-hydroxylase. Comparisons of deduced amino acid sequences of two other alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, prolyl-4-hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, with that of Asp beta-hydroxylase showed no significant homologies. Indeed, Asp beta-hydroxylase appears to be unique as no striking homology was found with known protein sequences. Furthermore, structural predictions derived from the deduced amino acid sequence are in accord with earlier Stokes' radius and sedimentation coefficient determinations of the enzyme, suggesting that the enzyme contains a relatively compact carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and an extended amino terminus. This amino-terminal region has a potential transmembrane type II signal-anchor domain that could direct the catalytic domain into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1574139946,"Modulation of beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3AR) expression by dexamethasone was investigated in the murine 3T3-F442A adipocytic cell line. In untreated cells, a major population of binding sites (62,000-114,000 sites/cell) of low affinity for (-)-[3H] CGP12177 and (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (corresponding to the beta 3AR subtype) was present along with a minor population (6,500-8,000 sites/cell) of sites of high affinity for the radioligands (corresponding to a mixture of the beta 1 and beta 2AR subtypes). Long-term exposure of the cells to 250 nM dexamethasone led to a sharp decrease in beta 3AR density (less than 5,000 sites/cell) which paralleled a diminished potency of the beta 3AR-selective agonists BRL37344 and CGP12177 to stimulate the production of intracellular cAMP. Analysis of RNA by polymerase chain reaction and nuclear run-on assays indicated that dexamethasone inhibited the synthesis of beta 3AR mRNA, resulting in 4-8-fold decrease in the steady-state levels of this mRNA. The down-regulation of beta 3AR protein and cellular mRNA appeared to be mediated by the receptor for glucocorticoids as assessed by the antagonistic action of the anti-glucocorticoid RU38486."
https://openalex.org/W1490074841,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised that specifically recognize the NH2-terminal neoepitope sequence present in link protein cleavage products derived from stromelysin-degraded proteoglycan aggregate. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using synthetic peptides as inhibitors, showed that one of these antibodies (CH-3) required, for antibody recognition, the free NH2-terminal amino acid isoleucine (residue 17 of the intact protein) in the sequence NH2-IQAENG at the stromelysin cleavage site of link protein 3. Human proteoglycan aggregate was digested with recombinant human stromelysin, bovine chymotrypsin, bovine trypsin, and porcine elastase, and their respective link protein degradation products were tested for immunoreactivity with antibody CH-3. Only stromelysin- and chymotrypsin-generated link protein 3 were recognized by antibody CH-3. Both of these enzymes generate link protein NH2 termini with the sequence 17IQAENG. . .; hence these studies indicated that monoclonal antibody CH-3 recognized this neoepitope sequence in only specific proteolytically modified link protein molecules. Since the occurrence of link protein 3 increases with aging, the incidence of CH-3 epitope in proteoglycans isolated from human knee articular cartilage of individuals of different ages was investigated. The prevalence of CH-3 epitope was found to be highest in newborn and adolescent articular cartilage samples. However, little CH-3 epitope was detected in older adult cartilage, although considerably more link protein 3 was present in these samples. These results suggest that additional proteolytic agents are responsible for the increased occurrence of link protein degradation products with aging."
https://openalex.org/W2154142754,"We have analyzed the generation of unexpected patterns of RNA editing, i.e., those not following a strict 3' to 5' progression, which occur in junction regions between fully edited and preedited sequences. Evidence is presented that these patterns are generated by misediting due to specific events of misguiding. Misediting can occur through the interaction of inappropriate gRNAs with mRNAs or appropriate gRNAs in an incorrect fashion. Four possible mechanisms for the generation of misedited sequences are presented. Chimeric molecules have been detected in steady-state mitochondrial RNAs that are composed of misguiding gRNAs covalently linked to mRNAs at misediting sites by the 3' oligo(U) tail. We propose that misediting within junction regions can be corrected by appropriately acting gRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1591201449,"We have examined the specificity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H in removing the tRNA(Lys3) (-)-strand primer in vitro using a model substrate. This substrate represents an intermediate in the reverse transcription process where the tRNA(Lys3) primer has not yet been removed after (+)-strand strong stop DNA synthesis. The substrate consists of an RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 3'-terminal 17 nucleotides of the tRNA(Lys3) linked to U5 DNA and annealed to single-stranded DNA containing the U5 and the primer-binding site. Upon incubation with HIV-1 reverse transcriptase p66/p51 heterodimer, the minus-strand DNA product resulting from RNase H cleavage retained the 3'-rA from the model tRNA primer. Changing the 3'-terminal AMP of the model tRNA primer from rA to dA did not alter the RNase H cleavage site. Further, the retention of AMP was not dependent on recognition of adjacent U5 sequences or the CCA terminus of the model tRNA(Lys3). The synthetic RNA primer was released as an intact species by a single endonucleolytic cleavage 5' of the rA. The cleavage patterns of Moloney murine leukemia virus and avian myoblastosis virus RNase H activities on the HIV-1 model substrate were more heterogeneous compared to HIV-1 RNase H. This specificity of HIV-1 RNase H would result in linear DNA molecules with a single rA at the U5 terminus and would provide two bases adjacent to the conserved CA dinucleotide to be cleaved away during the integration process."

https://openalex.org/W1535633114,"The factors influencing iron binding and release by lactoferrin have been addressed by comparison of the native full length molecule (Lf) with the N-terminal half of human lactoferrin (LfN) produced from the cloned cDNA expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. The coding sequences for LfN were inserted into the expression vector pNUT between the metallothionein promoter and the human growth hormone transcription termination sequences. Transformed BHK cells were grown in roller bottles where concentrations of LfN as high as 35 mg/liter were obtained. The pure protein, produced by the transformed BHK cells, was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein blotting and immunodetection, N-terminal sequence analysis, UV-visible spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and measurements of metal binding and release. By these criteria LfN was found to be correctly processed, glycosylated, and able to bind iron reversibly. Both UV-visible and electron spin resonance spectra of the half molecule were very similar to those of native lactoferrin and the full length lactoferrin produced in BHK cells, but there were marked differences in the pH at which iron release occurred. Iron release from LfN occurs in the pH range 6.0-4.0, compared with 4.0-2.5 for native lactoferrin and 6.2-4.0 for transferrin. These results suggest that the more facile release of iron from LfN compared with native lactoferrin results from the absence of stabilizing contacts between the N- and C-terminal halves and that the characteristic difference in pH stability between lactoferrins and transferrins is due primarily to differences in these interactions."

This conclusion is based on the following observations: 1) mRNA isolated from mucosa of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, but not from colon, induces sodium-independent uptake of L-leucine, L-cystine, and L-arginine. 2) In Northern blot analysis, mRNA isolated from mucosa of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, but not from colon, hybridizes to an rBAT cDNA probe, with signals of 2.2-2.3 kilobases and 3.7-3.9 kilobases. 3) mRNA isolated from mucosa of jejunum induces sodium-independent uptake of L-leucine and L-cysteine which shows an inhibition pattern corresponding to system b0,+; the inhibition pattern of mRNA-induced uptake of L-arginine is compatible with the contribution of system b0,+ and y+. 4) Hybrid depletion with an rBAT antisense oligonucleotide greatly prevents the mRNA-dependent induction of uptake of L-cystine (greater than 90%) and of L-leucine (approximately 75%); it reduces to about 50% the induction of L-arginine uptake. 5) After separation of mRNA on a sucrose density gradient, the fractions resulting in expression of b0,+ transport activity were also those hybridizing with rBAT cDNA; induction of transport activity from these fractions was also sensitive to hybrid depletion. 6) The mRNA-induced component of L-arginine uptake which is resistant to rBAT hybrid depletion is inhibited by L-homoserine, only in the presence of sodium; thus, it is related to a system y(+)-like activity."
https://openalex.org/W1563717135,"Deletion and truncation mutants of the human erythrocyte Ca2+ pump (hPMCA4b) were expressed in COS-1 cells. The reactivity patterns of these mutants with seven monoclonal antibodies were examined. Of the seven, six (JA9, JA3, 1G4, 4A4, 3E10 and 5F10) react from the cytoplasmic side. JA9 and JA3 reacted near the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus of the molecule, respectively. 5F10 and 3E10 recognized portions of the large hydrophilic region in the middle of the protein. The epitopes of 1G4 and 4A4 were discontinuous and included residues from the long hydrophilic domain and residues between the proposed transmembrane domains M2 and M3. Antibody 1B10, which reacts from the extracellular side, recognized the COOH-terminal half of the molecule. These results show that the NH2 terminus, the COOH terminus, the region between M2 and M3, and the large hydrophilic region are all on the cytoplasmic side. This means that there are an even number of membrane crossings in both the NH2-terminal and the COOH-terminal halves. Between residues 75 and 300 there must be at least two membrane crossings, and there are at least two membrane crossings in the COOH-terminal half of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1539223281,"We have examined the regulation of expression of 80K/MARCKS, a major and specific protein kinase C (PKC) substrate of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Addition of bombesin (10 nM) to confluent quiescent cultures of these cells induced a dramatic and sustained down-regulation of 80-kDa mRNA and protein levels to a minimum of 5% of control within 8 and 48 h, respectively, without depletion of PKC activity. In contrast, the effect of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate on 80K/MARCKS mRNA levels was transient, and recovery of these transcripts correlated with the loss of PKC activity. The ability of bombesin to down-regulate 80K/MARCKS mRNA levels was dose-dependent (ED50 0.5 nM) and was abolished by both the specific bombesin antagonist [Leu13 psi (CH2NH),Leu14]bombesin and by prior depletion of PKC. Of a range of agents tested, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), but not insulin or Ca2+ ionophore, also down-regulated 80K/MARCKS mRNA to 24% of control within 5 h. Prior down-regulation of PKC abolished the effect of PDGF at a concentration of 7 ng/ml. Surprisingly, at higher doses (25 ng/ml), PDGF induced the down-regulation of 80K/MARCKS mRNA in a PKC-independent manner. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP, either through receptor-mediated mechanisms (e.g. prostaglandin E1) or by direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase (e.g. forskolin), also caused a marked dose-dependent depletion of 80K/MARCKS mRNA levels, which were further reduced by co-administration with cAMP-phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The rate of transcription of the 80K/MARCKS gene was unaltered by treatment of cells with either bombesin, PDGF, or forskolin/1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. These results indicate a role for both PKC-dependent and -independent pathways in growth factor-induced down-regulation of 80K/MARCKS expression, through a post-transcriptional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1489446940,"Naturally occurring IgG autoantibody against Band 3 glycoprotein of human erythrocyte membrane (anti-Band 3) recognizes the erythrocytes modified with oxidizing or SH-blocking agents as well as senescent erythrocytes. Location of the antigenic determinants of Band 3 this autoantibody recognizes was investigated by competitive inhibition studies of the antibody binding to the modified cells. Autologous IgG binds to the modified erythrocytes, and purified Band 3 totally inhibits the binding. This inhibitory activity of Band 3 was not affected by digestion of Band 3 with various proteases. Treatment of Band 3 with endo-beta-galactosidase that destroys the poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl sugar chain of Band 3 or with neuraminidase resulted in loss of the inhibitory activity. Oligosaccharides released from Band 3 by hydrazinolysis effectively inhibited the binding of autologous IgG and 125I-labeled purified anti-Band 3 to the modified cells, whereas the oligosaccharides depleted of acidic components did not. Endo-beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase destroyed the activity of the oligosaccharides, but alpha-L-fucosidase did not. Furthermore, human lactoferrin that contains sialylated two N-acetyllactosaminyl units also exhibited potent inhibitory activity, and the activity was destroyed by endo-beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase. These results indicate that the antigenic determinants of Band 3 are located in sialylated poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl sugar chains. Based on this finding, mechanism of appearance of the antigen on senescent erythrocytes recognized by anti-Band 3 (senescent antigen) was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1528168849,"The transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in heart muscle that direct cardiac development and allow for a flexible, adaptive response to physiologic stress are not well understood. We demonstrate that a negative regulator of gene transcription termed Id that has been described predominantly in proliferating cell lines and in undifferentiated tissue during growth, is expressed in freshly isolated terminally differentiated adult rat ventricular myocytes, in contrast to most other tissues in the adult rat. Id mRNA expression is regulated in ventricular myocytes during post-natal development, peaking at the transition from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth at day 17 in the rat, declining subsequently to lower, stable levels in adult myocytes. Although Id mRNA becomes undetectable in adult ventricular myocytes 48 h following isolation in the absence of serum, it can be rapidly reinduced by an alpha-adrenergic agonist, accompanied by increased protein synthesis and the reexpression, in defined media, of the neonatal genes prepro-ANP and skeletal muscle alpha-actin. Thus, the differential regulation of Id during cardiac development, the presence of Id mRNA in normal cardiac myocytes, and its increased expression following a hypertrophic stimulus all suggest a role for this transcriptional regulator in the control of cardiac muscle cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1577623248,"Transport and metabolic turnover of methotrexate (MTX) polyglutamates were examined in lysosomes derived from S180 cells. These studies extend prior work from this laboratory (Barrueco, J. R., and Sirotnak, F. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem 266, 11732-11737) which described basic properties of a facilitative transport system in lysosomes capable of mediating intralysosomal accumulation of MTX polyglutamates. In the present report, we show that the rate of turnover of MTX polyglutamates in lysosomes, which releases MTX in the extralysosomal space, is limited by the extent of mediated intralysosomal accumulation of the polyglutamate and reduced sulfhydryls that activate the enzyme folylpolyglutamate hydrolase. Evidence is presented that cysteine functions as the naturally occurring reduced sulfhydryl compound in lysosomes being equipotent to 2-mercaptoethanol as an activator of folylpolyglutamate hydrolase. Folylpolyglutamate hydrolase in permeabilized lysosomes from S180 cells exhibited a low pH optimum characteristic of a lysosomal enzyme, was activated at concentrations of reduced sulfhydryl at 0.1 mM and above, and exhibited Km values in the range of 0.2-3 microM that decreased with increase in polyglutamate chain length. Values for Km for MTX polyglutamates of folylpolyglutamate hydrolase activity were 100-200-fold lower than values for Km or Ki for facilitated intralysosomal transport, whereas capacities for both processes were similar. This relationship between the kinetic properties of each process ensures efficient hydrolysis of MTX polyglutamates within the lysosome."
https://openalex.org/W1631505587,"Regulatory elements of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene were identified physically by footprinting and gel mobility shift assays and functionally by transfecting glial cell lines with PLP-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase chimeric genes. In both human and rat glial cells, only several hundred base pairs of upstream sequence were sufficient for high level activity of the human PLP promoter. This region contains five sites that contact nuclear proteins in vitro. More distal recognition sites may exist, as regions upstream of -524 displayed silencing activity indicative of a negative regulatory element. A series of site directed mutations revealed one essential positive element (ATGGA at -118) which is found in other genes encoding myelin proteins. Our combined biochemical and functional analyses indicate that the key cis sites for maximal tissue-specific expression of PLP in cultured glial cells are clustered near the promoter. Within this cluster are several conserved motifs that may coordinate the regulation of myelin-specific genes."
https://openalex.org/W2113962691,"Abstract In addition to being regulated by a complex array of cis- and trans-acting factors, c-myc protooncogene expression may be modulated by antisense RNA transcripts. Our previous studies have determined that depletion of intracellular polyamines by alpha-difluoromethylornithine results in a marked decrease in the transcription of the human c-myc gene. Because of reports that antisense transcription occurs in the 5' and 3' regions of this gene, we used a genomic clone of the human c-myc gene to ascertain whether polyamine depletion might induce an antisense RNA transcript. These studies demonstrate that polyamine depletion of the human colon cancer cell line COLO 320 results in induction of an endogenous RNA transcript with high homology to the antisense strand of the second intervening sequence (PvuII-RsaI) of the c-myc gene. Furthermore, during such depletion, steady state levels of this transcript vary inversely to the sense direction c-myc RNA. RNase protection studies suggest that the antisense transcript may arise from a different gene locus than the c-myc gene. To further identify the origins of this RNA, a cDNA library was generated from size-selected RNA and screened with c-myc sequences. A 438-base pair cDNA was isolated with approximately 85% homology, to a 285-base region in the second intron of the c-myc gene. Computer homology analysis further reveals that a 120-base region within this cDNA also has approximately 85% homology to the antisense strands of a number of genes, including the growth-related genes, N-myc, p53, and thymidine kinase. These studies provide the initial characterization of an endogenous antisense RNA transcript which could influence cell growth by modulating the expression of c-myc and other genes."

https://openalex.org/W1584664639,"The interaction of several forms (p51, p66, and p66/p51) of recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) with a synthetic derivative of its cognate replication primer, tRNA(Lys-3), has been determined by gel-mobility shift analysis. While p66/p51 RT is proficient in tRNA binding, preparations of p66 and p51 display only weak binding at elevated protein:tRNA ratios, despite the former containing both RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity. Gel permeation analysis of purified p66 RT indicate this to be predominantly monomeric, suggesting that dimerization may be a prerequisite for efficient tRNA binding. Prolonged incubation of a mixture of the 66- and 51-kDa polypeptides results in heterodimer reconstitution, restoration of tRNA binding, and recovery of appreciable levels of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Under the same conditions, both the tRNA binding and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities of the 66- and 51-kDa polypeptides are unaffected, suggesting that they remain in the monomeric conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1555467303,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is one of the main targets in approaches to the chemotherapy of AIDS. A detailed knowledge of structure-function relationships of this enzyme is a prerequisite for rational drug design. We have used monoclonal antibodies as tools to identify functionally important regions of the protein. The preparation of 23 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and their different effects on the enzyme are described. The interaction of purified mAbs with HIV-1 RT was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blots, and high performance liquid chromatography size exclusion chromatography. One of the antibodies also recognized recombinant HIV-2 RT. Antibody binding epitopes on HIV-1 RT were analyzed by immunoblotting using cyanogen bromide fragmented RT, C-terminally truncated mutants, and a peptide ELISA employing 15-mer synthetic overlapping peptides spanning nearly the complete polypeptide chain. The epitopes were mapped within three domains corresponding to amino acids 200-230, 300-428, and 528-560. Two mAbs show neutralizing properties on enzymatic functions of RT. One affects the polymerase activity and to a certain degree the RNase H activity of the enzyme, whereas the other inhibits the latter activity exclusively. mAb 28, which blocks the polymerase activity, interferes with the nucleotide binding region of RT, as shown by fluorescence spectroscopy using a labeled template/primer complex. By investigating the antibody effects on dimer formation of the heterodimeric enzyme, three domains corresponding to amino acids 230-300, 350-428, and residues around amino acid 540 involved in protein-protein interactions were localized."
https://openalex.org/W1513534063,"An expression cDNA library prepared from mRNA from the venom gland of a parasitic wasp, Chelonus sp. near curvimaculatus, was screened with polyclonal antibodies against a 33-kDa venom protein from this wasp. Immunoreactive clones were sequenced, yielding a complete inferred sequence for a protein with an NH2 terminus identical with that of the 33-kDa protein. The structure of the cDNA showed an apparent encoded signal peptide, which was unusual in possessing 2 glutamic acid residues juxtapositioned next to, or replacing, the conventional basic residues. The bulk of the mature protein sequence which follows the NH2-terminal, 5000-kDa hydrophobic domain is composed of a dozen tandem repeats of a highly charged, approximately 14-residue sequence, except for the truncated eighth repeat which terminates in the only proline in this large domain. The primary structure is not closely related to any sequence in the GenBank data bank. Secondary structure analysis identified a turn occurring at or near each of 12 invariantly conserved serine residues. Further, the codon used for this serine was invariant, whereas other serines in the protein (including a nearly invariant serine 2 residues away) used various codons. Results of epitope mapping experiments supported a proposed tertiary structure in which the NH2-terminal 5-kDa forms a hydrophobic core, overlain with the charged repeats. Northern analysis of poly(A) RNA from the venom gland of young adult female wasps showed expression of a single 1-kilobase transcript, for which there is no corresponding message in normal or parasitized host larvae. The remarkable structure of this protein and structural data on other wasp venom proteins suggest an evolutionary pattern in which some proteins critical for venom function evolve by internal tandem duplication, and which are secreted after biosynthesis by a different mechanism from that used for proteins with classical signal peptides containing basic residues."
https://openalex.org/W1656670617,"msDNA-Ec67 is produced in a clinical strain of Escherichia coli and composed of a 67-base single-stranded DNA, which is linked to the 2'-OH group of the 15th rG residue of a 58-base RNA molecule by a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage (Lampson, B. C., Sun, J., Hsu, M.-Y., Vallejo-Ramirez, J., Inouye, S., and Inouye, M. (1989) Science 243, 1033-1038). The production of msDNA-Ec67 is dependent upon retron-Ec67, which consists of the msr-msd region and the gene for reverse transcriptase (RT). These two elements were separately cloned into plasmids; p67-BHO.6 contained the msr-msd region and pRT-67 contained the RT gene under the lpp-lac promoter-operator. msDNA-Ec67 was produced only when cells were transformed with both plasmids. In addition, msDNA-Ec67 was synthesized in a cell-free system using total RNA prepared from cells harboring plasmid p67-BHO.6 and purified Ec67-RT. Using this cell-free system, the priming reaction, during initiation of DNA synthesis, was demonstrated to be a specific template-directed event; only dTTP was incorporated into a 132-base precursor RNA yielding a 133-base compound. This specific dT addition could be altered to dA or dC by simply substituting the 118th A residue of the putative msr-msd transcript with a T or G residue. The priming reaction was blocked when A was substituted for G at the 15th residue of the precursor RNA transcript, which corresponds to the branched rG residue in msDNA. DNA chain elongation could be terminated by adding ddNTP in the cell-free system, forming a sequence ladder. The DNA sequence determined from this ladder completely agreed with the msDNA sequence. The RT extension reaction was completely blocked when the RNA preparation was treated with RNase A but not when the preparation was treated with DNase. This clearly demonstrates that RNA but not DNA is responsible for the msDNA production. A part of the fully extended cell-free product contained a 13-base RNA strand resistant to RNase A, which is consistent with the previously proposed model. In this model, the 5'-end sequence of the msr-msd transcript (a2; bases 1-13) forms a duplex with the 3'-end sequence (a1) of the same transcript, thus serving as a primer, as well as a template for msDNA synthesis by RT. Our results are inconsistent with a model recently proposed by Lease and Yee (Lease, R. A., and Yee, T. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 14497-14503)."
https://openalex.org/W1513001030,"Vascular smooth muscle cell is a major cell component involved in the process of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB dimer on the expression of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from human umbilical artery. On Northern blot analysis of total RNAs isolated from smooth muscle cells, with human cDNA for M-CSF, a marked dose-dependent reduction of mRNA level was found in PDGF-BB-treated smooth muscle cells. Cellular production of M-CSF was estimated by immunoblot analysis of cell lysate with specific polyclonal antibody against recombinant human M-CSF. A concentration of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB significantly reduced M-CSF mass in smooth muscle cells compared with that in the absence of PDGF-BB. These results suggest that PDGF-BB plays an important role in the cellular metabolism of vascular wall by regulating the rate of M-CSF production in vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1956070756,"Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a glycoprotein that transports thyroid hormones in blood. Of two naturally occurring variants in man that harbor single proline substitutions (TBG-CD5 and TBG-Montreal), only TBG-CD5 manifests as complete TBG deficiency. In order to determine the pathophysiology of these TBG disorders, we expressed TBG-CD5 and TBG-Montreal (TBG-M), as well as the common type TBG (TBG-C) in reticulocyte lysate and Xenopus oocytes. Vectors encoding the three TBG types were constructed, transcribed in vitro, and their products of cell-free translation and processing by canine microsomal membranes were analyzed. TBG-C and TBG-M had identical mobility on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but could be distinguished by differences in thyroxine (T4) binding. TBG-CD5 had altered electrophoretic mobility and did not bind T4. TBG-C and TBG-M expressed in microinjected Xenopus oocytes showed properties similar to their respective serum forms, whereas TBG-CD5 was found in small amounts only intracellularly. Our results confirm that the previously described alanine 113 to proline substitution is responsible for the altered properties of TBG-M. The substitution of leucine 227 by proline in TBG-CD5 appears to impair its cotranslational processing and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1480076949,"Vertebrate U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) loci exemplify a novel class of polymerase III-transcribed genes that lack an intragenic control region (ICR). Instead important transcriptional control elements are located in the 5‘-flanking region and resemble those found in promoters and enhancers of polymerase II-transcribed genes. These include a proximal sequence element (PSE), a TATA element, and a distal region containing, at least, an octamer motif. We have used Sarkosyl to characterize steps in U6 promoter transcription in vitro in an unfractionated S100 extract and find very similar properties to those of the adenovirus VA1 gene that contains an ICR. Preformed preinitiation complexes are stable to 0.015% Sarkosyl and can undergo multiple rounds of initiation upon addition of nucleoside triphosphates. A higher concentration (0.075%) prevents reinitiation. In addition, we have investigated the formation of transcription complexes on this promoter in a S100 extract using a template competition assay. No stable complexes are detected with plasmid templates that contain clustered point mutations in the PSE nor with DNAs lacking the U6 5‘-flanking region. A plasmid template containing mutations in the TATA element is partially deficient in competitive ability. Furthermore, the distal region upstream of position–148 is necessary for efficient stable complex formation. Within this region, the consensus octamer motif is one component needed to form complexes that withstand competition by a wild-type U6 promoter. The human U2 gene enhancer ligated to the U6 proximal region supports formation of a complex that competes at an intermediate level."

The ES-242s inhibited the binding of [3H]TCP and [3H]CGS19755 to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex. They had no effect on the binding of the specific ligands for the non-NMDA receptor. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of ES-242-1 were fully examined since it is the most potent of the five compounds. ES-242-1 is highly specific for the NMDA receptor; it has no effect on other receptors. Kinetic analyses indicated that ES-242-1 inhibited the binding of [3H]TCP and [3H]CGS19755 in a competitive manner, respectively, suggesting that ES-242-1 interacts with both the transmitter recognition site and the channel domain. ES-242-1 selectively inhibited NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. ES-242-1 also specifically blocked the increase in cyclic GMP accumulation induced by NMDA or L-glutamate in rat cerebellar slices. In a concentration range of 0.1-1.0 microM, ES-242-1 was as potent as MK-801 in preventing glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. These results show that ES-242-1 is a potent and specific antagonist for the NMDA receptor. The antagonistic properties of the ES-242s appear to be due to a novel mechanism of action at the NMDA receptor."

We introduced the human H-ras oncogene, EJ-ras, into the model secretory cell line AtT20 to determine the effects of ras oncogene expression on neuropeptide synthesis and release. We report here that both of these processes are changed in ras-transfected AtT20 cells. Stimulated release of the pituitary hormone corticotropin is reduced, and transcription of the gene encoding its precursor, proopiomelanocortin, is down-regulated. At the same time, expression of other genes, both housekeeping and neural-specific, remain relatively unchanged. The alteration of proopiomelanocortin expression in AtT20 cells following ras oncogene transformation supports the hypothesis that ras may play a role in the determination of the differentiated phenotype of neurosecretory cells."
