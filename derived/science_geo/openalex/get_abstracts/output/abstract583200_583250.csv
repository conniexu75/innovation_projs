https://openalex.org/W2599153295,"In the United States, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease and associated with higher mortality according to data from earlier National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994. Our goal was to determine the NAFLD prevalence in the recent 1999-2012 NHANES, risk factors for advanced fibrosis (stage 3-4) and mortality. NAFLD was defined as having a United States Fatty Liver Index (USFLI) > 30 in the absence of heavy alcohol use and other known liver diseases. The probability of low/high risk of having advanced fibrosis was determined by the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). In total, 6000 persons were included; of which, 30.0% had NAFLD and 10.3% of these had advanced fibrosis. Five and eight-year overall mortality in NAFLD subjects with advanced fibrosis was significantly higher than subjects without NAFLD ((18% and 35% vs. 2.6% and 5.5%, respectively) but not NAFLD subjects without advanced fibrosis (1.1% and 2.8%, respectively). NAFLD with advanced fibrosis (but not those without) is an independent predictor for mortality on multivariate analysis (HR = 3.13, 95% CI 1.93-5.08, p<0.001). In conclusion, in this most recent NHANES, NAFLD prevalence remains at 30% with 10.3% of these having advanced fibrosis. NAFLD per se was not a risk factor for increased mortality, but NAFLD with advanced fibrosis was. Mexican American ethnicity was a significant risk factor for NAFLD but not for advanced fibrosis or increased mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2603397605,"Recent observations have revealed massive galactic molecular outflows that may have physical conditions (high gas densities) required to form stars. Indeed, several recent models predict that such massive galactic outflows may ignite star formation within the outflow itself. This star-formation mode, in which stars form with high radial velocities, could contribute to the morphological evolution of galaxies, to the evolution in size and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component of galaxies, and would contribute to the population of high-velocity stars, which could even escape the galaxy. Such star formation could provide in-situ chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (through supernova explosions of young stars on large orbits), and some models also predict that it may contribute substantially to the global star formation rate observed in distant galaxies. Although there exists observational evidence for star formation triggered by outflows or jets into their host galaxy, as a consequence of gas compression, evidence for star formation occurring within galactic outflows is still missing. Here we report new spectroscopic observations that unambiguously reveal star formation occurring in a galactic outflow at a redshift of 0.0448. The inferred star formation rate in the outflow is larger than 15 Msun/yr. Star formation may also be occurring in other galactic outflows, but may have been missed by previous observations owing to the lack of adequate diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2598798124,"Oxetanocin A (OXT-A) is a potent antitumour, antiviral and antibacterial compound. Biosynthesis of OXT-A has been linked to a plasmid-borne Bacillus megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of OXT-A. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXT-A is derived from a 2'-deoxyadenosine phosphate in an OxsB-catalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from C2'. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically characterized non-methylating Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. X-ray analysis of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members. Overall, this work provides a framework for understanding the interplay of AdoMet and Cbl cofactors and expands the catalytic repertoire of Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2601932379,"Objective To conduct a randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of a family-based intervention delivered to Burmese migrant families displaced in Thailand on parenting and family functioning. Participants and procedures Participants included 479 Burmese migrant families from 20 communities in Thailand. Families, including 513 caregivers and 479 children aged 7 to 15 years, were randomized to treatment and waitlist control groups. The treatment group received a 12-session family-based intervention delivered to groups of families by lay facilitators. Adapted standardized and locally derived measures were administered before and after the intervention to assess parent-child relationship quality, discipline practices, and family functioning. Results Compared with controls, intervention families demonstrated improved quality of parent-child interactions on scales of parental warmth and affection (Effect size (ES) = 0.25 caregivers; 0.26 children, both p < 0.05) and negative relationship quality (ES = -0.37, p < 0.001 caregivers; -0.22 children, p < 0.05). Both children and caregivers also reported an effect on relationship quality based on a locally derived measure (ES = 0.40 caregivers, p < .001; 0.43 children, p < .05). Family functioning was improved, including family cohesion (ES = 0.46 caregivers; 0.36 children; both p < 0.001) and decreased negative interactions (ES = -0.30 caregivers, p < 0.01; -0.24 children, p < 0.05). Family communication also improved according to children only (ES = 0.29, p < 0.01). Caregivers, but not children, reported decreased harsh discipline (ES = -0.39, p < 0.001), and no effects were observed on use of positive discipline strategies. Treatment attendance was high, with participants attending a mean of 9.7 out of 12 sessions. Conclusion The intervention increased protective aspects of family well-being for migrant children and caregivers in a middle-income country. The strongest effects were on parent-child relationship quality and family functioning, while results were mixed on changes in discipline practices. Results suggest that a behavioral family-based approach implemented by lay providers in community settings is a promising intervention approach for strengthening families in highly stressed contexts.

https://openalex.org/W2598714515,"Chlamydia is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection among men who have sex with men. Repeat infection following treatment with 1g azithromycin is common and treatment failure of up to 22% has been reported. This study measured the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in rectal tissue in men following a single 1g dose to assess whether azithromycin reaches the rectal site in adequate concentrations to kill chlamydia. Ten healthy men took a single oral dose of 1g azithromycin and provided nine self-collected swabs and one blood sample over 14 days. Participant demographics, medications, sexual behaviour, treatment side effects, lubricant use and douching practices were recorded with each swab. Drug concentration over time was determined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and total exposure (AUC0-∞) was estimated from the concentration-time profiles. Following 1g of azithromycin, rectal concentrations peaked after a median of 24 hours (median 133mcg/g) and remained above the minimum inhibitory concentration for chlamydia (0.125mcg/mL) for at least 14 days in all men. AUC0-∞ was the highest ever reported in human tissue (13103((mcg/g).hr)). Tissue concentrations were not associated with weight (mg/kg), but data suggest that increased gastric pH could increase azithromycin levels and diarrhoea or use of water-based lubricants could decrease concentrations. High and sustained concentrations of azithromycin were found in rectal tissue following a single 1g dose suggesting that inadequate concentrations are unlikely to cause treatment failure. Factors effecting absorption (pH and diarrhoea) or drug depletion (douching and water-based lubricants) may be more important determinants of concentrations in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2600661415,"Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to increase the synthesis of macromolecules for rapid proliferation. Compared to fatty acids, much less is known about the synthesis of phospholipids, which is essential for membrane biogenesis in cancer cells. We found that LPIN1, which encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) controlling the rate-limiting step in the phospholipid synthesis pathway, is highly up-regulated in basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Moreover, high LPIN1 expression correlates with the poor prognosis of these patients. Knockdown of LPIN1 increases apoptosis in basal-like TNBC cell lines, whereas it has minimal or less effect on normal human mammary gland epithelial cells (HMECs) and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines. Fatty acid incorporation and lipidomics analyses showed that LPIN1 knockdown blocks phospholipid synthesis and changes membrane lipid compositions that ultimately induce the activation of 1 of the 3 branches of unfolded protein responses, the inositol-requiring enzyme-1α pathway. We also show for the first time, to our knowledge, that lipin-1 knockdown significantly inhibits tumor growth in vivo using an orthotopic xenograft breast mouse model. Our results suggest that lipin-1 is a potential target for cancer therapy.-He, J., Zhang, F., Tay, L. W. R., Boroda, S., Nian, W., Levental, K. R., Levental, I., Harris, T. E., Chang, J. T., Du, G.

https://openalex.org/W2600965896,"Urate hydroperoxide is a product of the oxidation of uric acid by inflammatory heme peroxidases. The formation of urate hydroperoxide might be a key event in vascular inflammation, where there is large amount of uric acid and inflammatory peroxidases. Urate hydroperoxide oxidizes glutathione and sulfur-containing amino acids and is expected to react fast toward reactive thiols from peroxiredoxins (Prxs). The kinetics for the oxidation of the cytosolic 2-Cys Prx1 and Prx2 revealed that urate hydroperoxide oxidizes these enzymes at rates comparable with hydrogen peroxide. The second-order rate constants of these reactions were 4.9 × 105 and 2.3 × 106 m−1 s−1 for Prx1 and Prx2, respectively. Kinetic and simulation data suggest that the oxidation of Prx2 by urate hydroperoxide occurs by a three-step mechanism, where the peroxide reversibly associates with the enzyme; then it oxidizes the peroxidatic cysteine, and finally, the rate-limiting disulfide bond is formed. Of relevance, the disulfide bond formation was much slower in Prx2 (k3 = 0.31 s−1) than Prx1 (k3 = 14.9 s−1). In addition, Prx2 was more sensitive than Prx1 to hyperoxidation caused by both urate hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Urate hydroperoxide oxidized Prx2 from intact erythrocytes to the same extent as hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, Prx1 and Prx2 are likely targets of urate hydroperoxide in cells. Oxidation of Prxs by urate hydroperoxide might affect cell function and be partially responsible for the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects of uric acid.

Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans. Urate, the anionic form of uric acid (pKa 5.4), accumulates in plasma in concentrations ranging from 50 to 420 μm in healthy individuals. The gene silencing of the enzyme uricase has been suggested to be an evolutionary advantage because urate is a facile electron donor (one-electron reduction potential = 0.59 V, pH 7.0, HU-·, H+/UH2−) and therefore a powerful antioxidant (1Simic M.G.

Despite its antioxidant ability, uric acid is associated with endothelial and renal dysfunction, hypertension, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease (6Johnson R.J.

In fact, urate itself has been reported to increase oxidative damage and to inactivate enzymes sensitive to oxidative stress (12Santos C.X. Anjos E.I. Augusto O.

In this sense, the capability of urate to be an anti- or pro-oxidant is still a paradox (16Sautin Y.Y. Johnson R.J.

The observed high rate constants indicate that these proteins might be preferential targets of urate hydroperoxide in cells. Hyperoxidation of Prxs only occurred at high concentrations of urate hydroperoxide and may not be relevant in vivo. Urate hydroperoxide oxidized Prx2 in intact erythrocytes to the same extent as hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, this study contributes to the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of 2-Cys Prxs in the reduction of an organic peroxide formed during inflammatory processes. Initially, we sought to identify whether Prx1 and Prx2 would be oxidized by urate hydroperoxide. The enzymes were incubated with different concentrations of urate hydroperoxide, and the oxidation of Prxs was evaluated by the appearance of disulfide bond dimers (∼42 kDa) in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. An equimolar concentration of urate hydroperoxide and Prx was enough to convert almost all monomers into dimers (Fig. 1). Next, we investigated the rate of Prx oxidation by urate hydroperoxide taking advantage of fluorescence changes during Prx oxidation (28Trujillo M. Clippe A. Manta B. Ferrer-Sueta G. Smeets A.

Initially, the first rapid decay was fitted by a single exponential equation (Figs. 2B and 3A). The observed rate constants for the first rapid phase were linearly dependent on urate hydroperoxide concentration, and the determined second-order rate constants were k1 = 2.26 ± 0.13 × 106 m−1 s−1 for Prx2 (Fig. 2C) and k1 = 4.90 ± 0.47 × 105 m−1 s−1 for Prx1 (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Kinetics of the oxidation of WTPrx1 and Prx1C83S/C173S by urate hydroperoxide.

V, voltage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The linear fitting from kobs versus urate hydroperoxide concentration showed a clear non-zero y-intercept for Prx2, indicating that the first phase is reversible. The value of the y-intercept (k−1) was 99.0 ± 3.0 s−1 (Fig. 2C). The first fast decrease in Prx2 fluorescence (Fig. 2B) was followed by a slow linear decrease (Fig. 2B, inset). The rate of this linear decrease was independent of urate hydroperoxide concentration and could be the actual oxidation of the peroxidatic thiol to sulfenic acid. In contrast, this slow linear decrease in fluorescence was not observed for Prx1. In addition, when the kobs of the first rapid fluorescence decrease of Prx1 was plotted against urate hydroperoxide concentrations, the linear fitting presented a close to zero y-intercept, 1.47 ± 2.12 s−1 (Fig. 3B). Unlike the first phase, the kobs of the second phase levels off with increasing concentrations of urate hydroperoxide (Figs. 2E and 3D). The plot of kobs versus substrate concentration was well fitted to a non-linear hyperbolic equation. The limiting rate constants (k3) were 0.31 ± 0.01 s−1 for Prx2 (Fig. 2, D and E) and 14.9 ± 1.01 s−1 for Prx1 (Fig. 3, C and D). No changes in Prx fluorescence were observed in the absence of oxidants or when thiols from Prxs were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (supplemental Fig. S1). Kinetics of His-tagged Prx2 or His-tagged free Prx2 were very similar: 2.26 ± 0.13 × 106 and 1.80 ± 0.12 × 106 m−1s−1 for the first phase; the y-intercept (k−1) was 99.0 ± 3.0 and 43.0 ± 1.2 s−1 and k3 = 0.31 ± 0.01 and 0.38 ± 0.03 s−1, respectively (data not shown). According to a three-step model reported for the oxidation of AhpC by hydrogen peroxide (43Lee T.H. Kim S.U. Yu S.L. Kim S.H. Park D.S. Moon H.B. Dho S.H. Kwon K.S. Kwon H.J. Han Y.H. Jeong S. Kang S.W. Shin H.S. Lee K.K. Rhee S.G. Yu D.Y. Peroxiredoxin II is essential for sustaining life span of erythrocytes in mice.Blood. 2003; 101: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the first rapid decay of fluorescence would correspond to the binding of the enzyme to the peroxide substrate and the oxidation of CP. Thus, k1 represents the enzyme-substrate complex formation and k−1 the complex dissociation. The slow fluorescence increase would represent the disulfide bond formation. To confirm that the fluorescence increase was due to the disulfide formation also in human Prxs, we used a double mutant Prx1 where the resolving (Cys-173) and the non-catalytic (Cys-83) cysteine were replaced by serine (Prx1C83S/C173S). As expected, upon oxidation by urate hydroperoxide, the intrinsic fluorescence of this mutant exhibited a rapid decay but lacked the second slow phase (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the rise in fluorescence observed in WTPrx1 was due to the disulfide bond formation. The fluorescence decay for Prx1C83S/C173S presented a similar feature as for WTPrx1, and the kobs increased linearly with increasing concentrations of urate hydroperoxide (Fig. 3E). However, the second-order rate constant (k1) for this reaction was 1 order of magnitude lower for Prx1C83S/C173S (4.50 ± 0.18 × 104 m−1 s−1, Fig. 3F) than for WTPrx1 and the k−1 was 0.44 ± 0.04 s−1. The second-order rate constant of the reaction of Prx2 with urate hydroperoxide was only 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that with hydrogen peroxide 0.2–1.3 × 108 m−1 s−1 (25Cox A.G. Peskin A.V.

There are no rate constants reported for the reaction of Prx1 and hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, we carried out fluorescence experiments to determine it. The reaction of Prx1 with hydrogen peroxide was faster than with urate hydroperoxide, so we had to use sub-stoichiometric concentrations of substrate and employ an initial rate approach. By plotting the initial rates versus hydrogen peroxide concentration, the second-order rate constant was 3.80 ± 0.15 × 107 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 4A). The linear plot intercepted the y axis at 4.42 ± 1.85 μm−1 s−1. The increase in fluorescence after mixing Prx1 with hydrogen peroxide followed first-order kinetics and was independent of hydrogen peroxide concentration. The kobs of this step was 9.0 ± 0.2 s−1 (Fig. 4B), which is very similar to that calculated when the substrate was urate hydroperoxide (14.9 ± 1.01 s−1, Fig. 3D). The independency of the nature of peroxide in this rate constant is additional evidence that the return in fluorescence is due to a disulfide bond formation with the resolving cysteine rather than hyperoxidation.

Efficient sampling of virus-loaded aerosol in combination with a low limit of detection of the collected virus could enable rapid and early detection of airborne influenza virus at the point-of-care setting. Here, we demonstrate a successful sampling and detection of airborne influenza virus using a system specifically developed for such applications. Our system consists of a custom-made electrostatic precipitation (ESP)-based bioaerosol sampler that is coupled with downstream quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Aerosolized viruses are sampled directly into a miniaturized collector with liquid volume of 150 μL, which constitutes a simple and direct interface with subsequent biological assays. This approach reduces sample dilution by at least one order of magnitude when compared to other liquid-based aerosol bio-samplers. Performance of our ESP-based sampler was evaluated using influenza virus-loaded sub-micron aerosols generated from both cultured and clinical samples. Despite the miniaturized collection volume, we demonstrate a collection efficiency of at least 10% and sensitive detection of a minimum of 3721 RNA copies. Furthermore, we show that an improved extraction protocol can allow viral recovery of down to 303 RNA copies and a maximum sampler collection efficiency of 47%. A device with such a performance would reduce sampling times dramatically, from a few hours with current sampling methods down to a couple of minutes with our ESP-based bioaerosol sampler."

Although several steps in MPO biosynthesis and processing have been elucidated, many questions remained, such as the structure-function relationship of monomeric unprocessed proMPO versus the mature dimeric MPO and the functional role of the propeptide. Here we have presented the first and high resolution (at 1.25 Å) crystal structure of proMPO and its solution structure obtained by small-angle X-ray scattering. Promyeloperoxidase hosts five occupied glycosylation sites and six intrachain cystine bridges with Cys-158 of the very flexible N-terminal propeptide being covalently linked to Cys-319 and thereby hindering homodimerization. Furthermore, the structure revealed (i) the binding site of proMPO-processing proconvertase, (ii) the structural motif for subsequent cleavage to the heavy and light chains of mature MPO protomers, and (iii) three covalent bonds between heme and the protein. Studies of the mutants C158A, C319A, and C158A/C319A demonstrated significant differences from the wild-type protein, including diminished enzymatic activity and prevention of export to the Golgi due to prolonged association with the chaperone calnexin. These structural and functional findings provide novel insights into MPO biosynthesis and processing."

The objective of this study is to provide insight in antibiotics prescriptions for patients suffering from cough, acute bronchitis or community acquired pneumonia in primary care. Methods Data from 2009 to 2013 of electronic health records of 12,880 patients in Germany were obtained from a research database. The prescription of antibiotics for acute lower respiratory tract infections was compared to the national S3 guideline cough from the German Society of General Practitioners and Family Medicine. Results Antibiotics were prescribed in 41% of consultations. General practitioners’ decision of whether or not to prescribe an antibiotic was congruent with the guideline in 52% of consultations and the antibiotic choice congruence was 51% of antibiotic prescriptions. Hence, a congruent prescribing decision and a prescription of recommendation was found in only 25% of antibiotic prescriptions. Split by diagnosis we found that around three quarters of antibiotics prescribed for cough (73%) and acute bronchitis (78%) were not congruent to the guidelines. In contrast to that around one quarter of antibiotics prescribed for community acquired pneumonia (28%) were not congruent to the guidelines. Conclusions Our results show that there is a big gap between guideline recommendation and actual prescribing, in the decision to prescribe and the choice of antibiotic agent. This gap could be closed by periodic quality circles on antibiotic prescribing for GPs."

It is the largest natural lake in South-East Asia and constitutes one of the largest fisheries over the world, supporting the livelihood of million peoples. Nonetheless, the Mekong River Basin is changing rapidly due to accelerating water infrastructure development (hydropower, irrigation, flood control, and water supply) and climate change, bringing considerable modifications to the annual flood-pulse of the TSL. Such modifications are expected to have strong impacts on fish biodiversity and abundance. This paper aims to characterize the spatio-temporal variations of fish taxonomic composition and to highlights the underlying determinants of these variations. For this purpose, we used data collected from a community catch monitoring program conducted at six sites during 141 weeks, covering two full hydrological cycles. For each week, we estimated beta diversity as the total variance of the site-by-species community matrix and partitioned it into Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) and Species Contribution to Beta Diversity (SCBD). We then performed multiple linear regressions to determine whether species richness, species abundances and water level explained the temporal variation in the contribution of site and species to beta diversity. Our results indicate strong temporal variation of beta diversity due to differential contributions of sites and species to the spatial variation of fish taxonomic composition. We further found that the direction, the shape and the relative effect of species richness, abundances and water level on temporal variation in LCBD and SCBD values greatly varied among sites, thus suggesting spatial variation in the processes leading to temporal variation in community composition. Overall, our results suggest that fish taxonomic composition is not homogeneously distributed over space and time and is likely to be impacted in the future if the flood-pulse dynamic of the system is altered by human activities."

We calculated the ratio of the observed to expected (O/E) prevalence for the 16 different combinations and the prevalence odds ratios (POR) of four lifestyle risk factors. The four lifestyle risk factors tended to cluster in specific multiple combinations. Smoking and heavy drinking was clustered (POR: 1.86 for male, 4.46 for female), heavy drinking and poor diet were clustered (POR: 1.38 for male, 1.74 for female), and smoking and physical inactivity were also clustered (POR: 1.48 for male). Those who were male, younger, low-educated and living alone were much more likely to have a higher number of lifestyle risk factors. Some helpful implications can be drawn from the knowledge on clustering pattern of lifestyle risk factors for more effective intervention program targeting metabolic syndrome."

Two other examples of such internal thioester bonds occur in certain anti-proteases and in the immune complement system, both of which react with the ligand only after the thioester bond is exposed by a proteolytic cleavage. We hypothesized that mechanical forces in bacterial adhesion could regulate thioester reactivity to ligand analogously to such proteolytic gating. Studying the pilus tip adhesin Spy0125 of Streptococcus pyogenes, we developed a single molecule assay to unambiguously resolve the state of the thioester bond. We found that when Spy0125 was in a folded state, its thioester bond could be cleaved with the small-molecule nucleophiles methylamine and histamine, but when Spy0125 was mechanically unfolded and subjected to forces of 50–350 piconewtons, thioester cleavage was no longer observed. For folded Spy0125 without mechanical force exposure, thioester cleavage was in equilibrium with spontaneous thioester reformation, which occurred with a half-life of several minutes. Functionally, this equilibrium reactivity allows thioester-containing adhesins to sample potential substrates without irreversible cleavage and inactivation.

https://openalex.org/W2603851256,"Introduction Supply problems of drugs are an increasing and worldwide problem, also in Belgium. Hospital pharmacists try to manage drug supply problems to minimize the impact on patient care. This study aims to quantify in a detailed manner how much time employees of 17 Belgian hospital pharmacies spend on drug supply problems. Methods During six months, employees of Belgian hospital pharmacies filled in the daily time spent on drug supply problems using a template containing all steps which can be executed to manage drug supply problems. Additionally, Belgian hospital pharmacists were asked to report the drugs which experienced drug supply problems together with the solution for this problem. Results Hospital pharmacists spent a median of 109 minutes a week on drug supply problems, with a minimum of 40 minutes per week and a maximum of 216 minutes per week. Fifty-nine percent of the total time spent on drug supply problems was executed by hospital pharmacists, 27% by pharmacy technicians; the rest was performed by logistic or administrative personnel. About one third of the total time spent was invested in gathering information on the supply problem. About two third of the supply disruptions caused drug shortages, meaning there was a need to switch to another (generic) therapeutic alternative. For most drug shortages, a Belgian generic medicine could be found. However in some cases, the alternative had to be ordered abroad or for some drug shortages, no alternative was available. Conclusion These exploratory results on time spent by hospital pharmacists on drug supply problems in Belgium highlight the economic impact of drug supply problems for hospital pharmacies. A fully reliable, daily updated list on the federal agencies websites would be a major help to hospital pharmacists."
https://openalex.org/W2601629510,"Targeted mutant models are common in mechanistic toxicology experiments investigating the absorption, metabolism, distribution, or elimination (ADME) of chemicals from individuals. Key models include those for xenosensing transcription factors and cytochrome P450s (CYP). Here we investigated changes in transcript levels, protein expression, and steroid hydroxylation of several xenobiotic detoxifying CYPs in constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)-null and two CYP-null mouse models that have subfamily members regulated by CAR; the Cyp3a-null and a newly described Cyp2b9/10/13-null mouse model. Compensatory changes in CYP expression that occur in these models may also occur in polymorphic humans, or may complicate interpretation of ADME studies performed using these models. The loss of CAR causes significant changes in several CYPs probably due to loss of CAR-mediated constitutive regulation of these CYPs. Expression and activity changes include significant repression of Cyp2a and Cyp2b members with corresponding drops in 6α- and 16β-testosterone hydroxylase activity. Further, the ratio of 6α-/15α-hydroxylase activity, a biomarker of sexual dimorphism in the liver, indicates masculinization of female CAR-null mice, suggesting a role for CAR in the regulation of sexually dimorphic liver CYP profiles. The loss of Cyp3a causes fewer changes than CAR. Nevertheless, there are compensatory changes including gender-specific increases in Cyp2a and Cyp2b. Cyp2a and Cyp2b were down-regulated in CAR-null mice, suggesting activation of CAR and potentially PXR following loss of the Cyp3a members. However, the loss of Cyp2b causes few changes in hepatic CYP transcript levels and almost no significant compensatory changes in protein expression or activity with the possible exception of 6α-hydroxylase activity. This lack of a compensatory response in the Cyp2b9/10/13-null mice is probably due to low CYP2B hepatic expression, especially in male mice. Overall, compensatory and regulatory CYP changes followed the order CAR-null > Cyp3a-null > Cyp2b-null mice."
https://openalex.org/W2598583594,"Syndecan-1 (Sdc1) is an important member of the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan family, highly expressed by epithelial cells in adult organisms. Sdc1 is involved in the regulation of cell migration, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, growth-factor, chemokine and integrin activity, and implicated in inflammatory responses and tumorigenesis. Gastrointestinal tract represents an important anatomic site where loss of Sdc1 expression was reported both in inflammation and malignancy. However, the biological significance of Sdc1 in chronic colitis-associated tumorigenesis has not been elucidated. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to test the effects of Sdc1 loss on colorectal tumor development in inflammation-driven colon tumorigenesis. Utilizing a mouse model of colitis-related colon carcinoma induced by the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM), followed by the inflammatory agent dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), we found that Sdc1 deficiency results in increased susceptibility to colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Importantly, colitis-associated tumors developed in Sdc1-defficient mice were characterized by increased local production of IL-6, activation of STAT3, as well as induction of several STAT3 target genes that act as important effectors of colonic tumorigenesis. Altogether, our results highlight a previously unknown effect of Sdc1 loss in progression of inflammation-associated cancer and suggest that decreased levels of Sdc1 may serve as an indicator of colon carcinoma progression in the setting of chronic inflammation."

Thus, expression of p21 has to be tightly controlled, which is achieved by numerous mechanisms at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational level. Performing immunoprecipitation of bromouridine-labeled p21 mRNAs that had been incubated before with cytoplasmic extracts of untreated HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, we identified the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX41 as a novel regulator of p21 expression. DDX41 specifically precipitates with the 3′UTR, but not with the 5′UTR, of p21 mRNA. Knockdown of DDX41 increases basal and γ irradiation-induced p21 protein levels without affecting p21 mRNA expression. Conversely, overexpression of DDX41 strongly inhibits expression of a FLAG-p21 and a luciferase construct, but only in the presence of the p21 3′UTR. Together, these data suggest that this helicase regulates p21 expression at the translational level independent of the transcriptional activity of p53. However, knockdown of DDX41 completely fails to increase p21 protein levels in p53-deficient HCT116 cells. Moreover, posttranslational up-regulation of p21 achieved in both p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells in response to pharmaceutical inhibition of the proteasome (by MG-132) or p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (by BI-D1870) is further increased by knockdown of DDX41 only in p53-proficient but not in p53-deficient cells. Although our data demonstrate that DDX41 suppresses p21 translation without disturbing the function of p53 to directly induce p21 mRNA expression, this process indirectly requires p53, perhaps in the form of another p53 target gene or as a still undefined posttranscriptional function of p53.

Moreover, posttranslational up-regulation of p21 achieved in both p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells in response to pharmaceutical inhibition of the proteasome (by MG-132) or p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (by BI-D1870) is further increased by knockdown of DDX41 only in p53-proficient but not in p53-deficient cells. Although our data demonstrate that DDX41 suppresses p21 translation without disturbing the function of p53 to directly induce p21 mRNA expression, this process indirectly requires p53, perhaps in the form of another p53 target gene or as a still undefined posttranscriptional function of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2597565869,"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is a complex multi-organ disease resulting from total body exposure to high doses of radiation. Individuals can be exposed to total body irradiation (TBI) in a number of ways, including terrorist radiological weapons or nuclear accidents. In order to determine whether an individual has been exposed to high doses of radiation and needs countermeasure treatment, robust biomarkers are needed to estimate radiation exposure from biospecimens such as blood or urine. In order to identity such candidate biomarkers of radiation exposure, high-resolution proteomics was used to analyze plasma from non-human primates following whole body irradiation (Co-60 at 6.7 Gy and 7.4 Gy) with a twelve day observation period. A total of 663 proteins were evaluated from the plasma proteome analysis. A panel of plasma proteins with characteristic time- and dose-dependent changes was identified. In addition to the plasma proteomics study reported here, we recently identified candidate biomarkers using urine from these same non-human primates. From the proteomic analysis of both plasma and urine, we identified ten overlapping proteins that significantly differentiate both time and dose variables. These shared plasma and urine proteins represent optimal candidate biomarkers of radiation exposure."

Since 2001 it has become mandatory in selected high-risk professional sports. Its impact on the rates of sports-related sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unknown.We aimed to study the incidence, causes and time trends of sports-related SCD in comparison to SCD unrelated to exercise in Switzerland.We reviewed all forensic reports of SCDs of the German-speaking region of Switzerland in the age group of 10 to 39 years, occurring between 1999 and 2010. Cases were classified into three categories based on whether or not deaths were associated with sports: no sports (NONE), recreational sports (REC), and competitive sports (COMP).Over the 12-year study period, 349 SCD cases were recorded (mean age 30±7 years, 76.5% male); 297 cases were categorized as NONE, 31 as REC, and 21 as COMP. Incidences of SCD per 100,000 person-years [mean (95% CI)] were the lowest in REC [0.43 (0.35-0.56)], followed by COMP [1.19 (0.89-1.60)] and NONE [2.46 (2.27-2.66)]. In all three categories, coronary artery disease (CAD) with or without acute myocardial infarction (MI) was the most common cause of SCD. Three professional athletes were identified in COMP category which all had SCD due to acute MI. There were no time trends, neither in overall, nor in cause-specific incidences of SCD.The incidence of SCD in young individuals in Switzerland is low, both related and unrelated to sports. In regions, like Switzerland, where CAD is the leading cause of SCD associated with competitions, screening for cardiovascular risk factors in addition to the current PPS recommendations might be indicated to improve detection of silent CAD and further decrease the incidence of SCD."
https://openalex.org/W2602581896,"Background Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease, and abdominal pain is one of the main symptoms. The aim of this study was to explore the effects and mechanisms of auricular electro-acupuncture (AEA) on gastric hypersensitivity in a rodent model of FD. Methods Ten-day-old pups were gavaged with 0.2 ml of 0.1% iodoacetamide daily for 6 days. AEA at the “stomach” point with different parameters or sham-EA was performed on 8-week-old animals. Gastric sensitivity to gastric distention was measured under different conditions. Autonomic functions were assessed from the spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) derived from the electrocardiogram. Naloxone was injected intraperitoneally before AEA to explore the opioid mechanism. Gastric emptying was measured at the end of the study. Results 1) Gastric sensitivity to gastric distention was higher in the FD rats. AEA with parameters of 0.1s on, 0.4s off, 100Hz, 0.3ms and 0.4–0.5mA, but not other parameters or sham-EA, decreased gastric hypersensitivity in the FD rats. Naloxone did not block the effect of AEA. 2) Lower vagal activity and higher sympathovagal ratio were noted in the FD rats, compared with the controls. AEA increased vagal activity and improved sympathovagal imbalance. Conclusions AEA ameliorates gastric hypersensitivity in FD rats and this effect may be attributed to the improvement of sympathovagal balance."

To avoid undergoing carcinogenesis in response to oxidative stress, cells trigger a succession of checkpoint responses, including premature senescence and apoptosis. Increasing evidence indicates that H2O2, an important cause of oxidative stress, functions as an important physiological regulator of intracellular signaling pathways that participate in regulation of cell premature senescence and apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this process remain to be studied extensively. In this study, we describe the importance of Pim-1 kinase in this checkpoint response to oxidative stress. Pim-1 binds to and phosphorylates the transcription factor high mobility group box transcription factor 1 (HBP1), activating it. H2O2 enhances the interaction between Pim-1 and HBP1 and promotes HBP1 accumulation. In turn, HBP1 rapidly and selectively up-regulates Pim-1 expression in H2O2-stimulated cells, thereby creating a Pim-1-HBP1 positive feedback loop that regulates H2O2-induced premature senescence and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Pim-1-HBP1 positive feedback loop exerts its effect by regulating the senescence markers DNMT1 and p16 and the apoptosis marker Bax.

Oxidative stress has long been recognized as the major mechanism by which cells are damaged. It affects a variety of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, apoptosis, senescence, and survival (1Schieber M. Chandel N.S.

The role of reactive oxygen species in cellular damage and death is well documented with effects on a broad range of degenerative alterations, including carcinogenesis, aging, and other oxidative stress-related conditions. H2O2 is widely used as an activator for establishing cellular models of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and premature senescence (5Lombard D.B. Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Franco S. Gostissa M.

H2O2 controls cell signaling and stimulates proliferation at low levels, whereas in high concentrations it initiates premature senescence and apoptosis. Although it has historically been regarded as purely harmful, recently a growing body of evidence suggests that H2O2 also functions as an important physiological regulator of intracellular signaling pathways (9Nogueira V.

However, the mechanisms underlying the physiological functions of H2O2 have not been extensively studied. Pim-1 is a proto-oncogene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell proliferation and growth.

In this study, we investigated the effect of Pim-1 kinase on phosphorylation of the transcription factor HBP1 and found an intricate posttranslational modification mechanism involved in regulating premature cellular senescence and apoptosis. A previous publication has shown that p38, a kinase activated by H2O2, phosphorylates HBP1 and increases its stability (42Xiu M. Kim J. Sampson E. Huang C.Y. Davis R.J. Paulson K.E. Yee A.S. The transcriptional repressor HBP1 is a target of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in cell cycle regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8890-8901Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the pathway by which HBP1 regulates H2O2-activated premature cellular senescence and apoptosis is not well understood. Here, we found that Pim-1 interacts physically with HBP1 to promote HBP1 phosphorylation and enhance HBP1 protein stability and transcriptional activity. The interaction of Pim-1 and HBP1 is enhanced in H2O2-induced prematurely senescent and apoptotic cells and is followed by HBP1 activation. Furthermore, the Pim-1 gene itself is a target for positive transcriptional regulation by HBP1. Thus, the Pim-1-HBP1 axis constitutes a novel positive feedback pathway that causes premature senescence and apoptosis and is critical for maintenance of proper cellular metabolism following oxidative stress. Mao and co-workers (16Jin B. Wang Y. Wu C.L. Liu K.Y. Chen H. Mao Z.B.

Our data show that HBP1 expression was up-regulated in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress, suggesting a syntropic relationship. Intriguingly, we observed a statistically significant positive correlation between Pim-1 and HBP1 expression in cervical cancer and pancreatic cancer based on data from public databases (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), suggesting that the positive correlation between Pim-1 and HBP1 expression may be involved in some specific carcinogenesis. Thus, we hypothesized that HBP1 is a target of Pim-1. We planned to examine the relative expression of Pim-1 and HBP1 in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress in three different cell lines: 2BS (human diploid fibroblasts), HeLa (cervical cancer), and U2OS (osteosarcoma). First, we tested a complete profile of senescence and apoptosis markers for all three cell lines. The apoptosis markers (cell apoptosis rate and Bax protein expression) were tested by FACS and Western blotting, respectively. The results show that the apoptosis markers remained almost unchanged in H2O2-induced 2BS cells but increased in H2O2-induced HeLa or U2OS cells (Fig. 1, A, B, and D). Meanwhile, the senescence markers (senescence-associated (SA) β-gal staining of cells and p16 and DNMT1 protein expression) were tested by SA-β-gal staining and Western blotting, respectively. The results show that the senescence markers also remained unchanged in H2O2-induced HeLa or U2OS cells but significantly changed in H2O2-induced 2BS cells (Fig. 1, B–D). We also measured p53 status of the cell lines with Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, B and D, the levels of p53 protein increased in the three cell lines treated with H2O2. Altogether, the data indicate that H2O2 induces apoptosis in U2OS or HeLa cells and premature senescence in 2BS cells. We speculate that H2O2 activates p53 and p16 signal pathways in normal cells; thus the synergistic roles of the two signal pathways cause senescence in normal cells, whereas H2O2 only activates the p53 signal pathway, thereby causing apoptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, Pim-1 and HBP1 protein levels increased in the three cell lines in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 1, B and D). Our data indicate that expression of both Pim-1 and HBP1 is up-regulated in H2O2-induced prematurely senescent and apoptotic cells. Next, we investigated whether Pim-1 kinase has a causative role in regulating HBP1. Exogenous Pim-1 increased HBP1 protein levels but had no effect on HBP1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). Moreover, Pim-1 knockdown decreased HBP1 protein levels but had no effect on HBP1 mRNA (Fig. 2B). Thus, Pim-1 regulated HBP1 expression at the posttranscriptional level. We next investigated whether the Pim-1-induced increase in HBP1 protein levels by was due to enhanced protein stability. Overexpression of Pim-1 caused a dramatic increase in HBP1 stability, whereas Pim-1 knockdown by shRNA reduced HBP1 stability (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Pim-1 kinase promotes HBP1 expression by enhancing the stability of HBP1 protein. We next sought to elucidate the potential mechanism by which Pim-1 enhances HBP1 protein stability. We hypothesized that there may be physical interaction between Pim-1 and HBP1 proteins and that HBP1 may be a target of Pim-1. First, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation with HeLa cells. Endogenous Pim-1 interacted with endogenous HBP1, and H2O2 enhanced this interaction (Fig. 3A). Next, we cotransfected FLAG-tagged Pim-1 and HA-tagged HBP1 into HeLa and HEK293T cells. Similarly to the endogenous proteins, exogenous Pim-1 interacted with exogenous HBP1 in HeLa and HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the interaction between Pim-1 and HBP1 is direct, we next performed a GST pulldown assay. GST-HBP1, but not GST alone, pulled down Pim-1 in vitro. A reciprocal GST pulldown assay further demonstrated an interaction between Pim-1 and HBP1 in vitro. In summary, Pim-1 directly interacts with HBP1 in vivo and in vitro. To further determine the specific domain required for this interaction, we constructed a set of HBP1 and Pim-1 deletion mutants in the pGEX-4T-1 vector and used these in GST pulldown assays. These assays indicated that the repression domain of HBP1 (designated as Repression) did not interact with Pim-1, whereas HBP1 lacking repression domain (designated as ΔRepression) interacted with Pim-1. The weaker binding of ΔRepression to Pim-1 compared with the other mutants might be due to the conformational changes caused by repression domain deletion (Fig. 3C). A subsequent reciprocal GST pulldown assay showed that the catalytic domain of Pim-1 did not bind HBP1, whereas a Pim-1 mutant lacking the catalytic domain (ΔCatalytic) bound HBP1 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the interaction between HBP1 and Pim-1 is mediated by diverse domains of the two proteins but not by the repression domain of HBP1 or the catalytic domain of Pim-1. To determine whether HBP1 is phosphorylated by Pim-1, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with HBP1 expression vector with or without Pim-1 expression vector. Subsequently, anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were used to detect phospho-HBP1 in the Pim-1-expressing cells. Immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA antibody followed by probing with anti-phosphoserine or anti-phosphothreonine antibodies confirmed the presence of exogenous phospho-HBP1 in the Pim-1-expressing cells and demonstrated that the HBP1 phosphorylation occurred specifically at serine (Fig. 4A, left). Then endogenous HBP1 phosphorylation in HeLa cells was confirmed (Fig. 4A, right). We also investigated HBP1 phosphorylation in vitro. Purified His-tagged HBP1 protein was incubated with or without His-Pim-1 in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-His, anti-phosphoserine, or anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. The result further demonstrated that HBP1 was phosphorylated by Pim-1 at serine in vitro (Fig. 4B). We next performed mass spectrometry to identify the exact amino acids that were phosphorylated by Pim-1. Ser-372 and Ser-380 of HBP1 were phosphorylated in the presence of Pim-1 (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). To confirm this result, we designed three phosphorylation-deficient mutants: S372A, S380A, and S372A/S380A (Fig. 4C). Wild-type HBP1 was phosphorylated by Pim-1, consistent with the previous data. The HBP1 single-residue mutants (S372A and S380A) were partially phosphorylated by Pim-1, whereas for the double-residue mutant, S372A/S380A, the phospho-HBP1 level was close to the control level, suggesting that Pim-1-mediated HBP1 phosphorylation had been abolished (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, an in vitro kinase assay confirmed that HBP1 is phosphorylated at Ser-372/Ser-380 by Pim-1 (Fig. 4E). Because Pim-1 increases HBP1 protein levels, we next explored whether HBP1 phosphorylation at Ser-372/Ser-380 is required for Pim-1 induction of HBP1. Pim-1 increased wild-type HBP1 protein levels but had no effect on levels of the double-residue mutant S372A/S380A, suggesting that Pim-1 increases HBP1 protein levels by phosphorylating HBP1 at Ser-372/Ser-380 (Fig. 4F). Our data suggest that HBP1 protein is a target of Pim-1 kinase and can be phosphorylated at Ser-372/Ser-380 to enhance its stability. We next investigated whether HBP1 participates in Pim-1-induced apoptosis or premature senescence in tumor cells or normal cells and the potential role of HBP1 phosphorylation by Pim-1 in this process. FACS analysis demonstrated that Pim-1 induced apoptosis in U2OS and HeLa cells (Fig. 5A). Pim-1 or HBP1 overexpression increased levels of the apoptosis-associated protein Bax, whereas Pim-1 or HBP1 knockdown decreased Bax protein levels (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, HBP1 knockdown attenuated induction of Bax by Pim-1 (Fig. 5C), diminished Pim-1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5D), and abolished Pim-1-induced growth arrest (Fig. 5E) in U2OS and HeLa cells. These results indicate that HBP1 participates in Pim-1-induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, Pim-1 overexpression increased levels of the senescence-associated protein p16 and decreased levels of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which is known to negatively correlate with senescence (32Pan K. Chen Y. Roth M. Wang W. Wang S. Yee A.S. Zhang X. HBP1-mediated transcriptional regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 and its impact on cell senescence.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5F). Conversely, HBP1 knockdown attenuated the effect of Pim-1 on the expression of these two genes. HBP1 knockdown also attenuated Pim-1-induced senescence as indicated by SA-β-gal staining (Fig. 5G) and growth arrest in 2BS cells (Fig. 5E), suggesting that HBP1 also participates in Pim-1-induced premature senescence in normal cells. We next investigated the role of HBP1 phosphorylation by Pim-1 in HBP1-induced apoptosis and premature senescence. Expression of wild-type HBP1 decreased DNMT1 protein levels but increased p16 protein levels, whereas expression of the S372A/S380A mutant reduced this HBP1-mediated decrease in DNMT1 and increase in p16 to nearly control levels. Expression of the two single-residue mutants (S372A and S380A) resulted in partial HBP1-mediated reduction in DNMT1 levels and an increase in p16 levels (Fig. 6A). To explore the mechanisms underlying this effect, we conducted a reporter gene assay. Expression of wild-type HBP1 repressed the DNMT1 promoter and activated the p16 promoter, but the repression of the DNMT1 gene and activation of p16 gene were defective in cells expressing S372A/S380A. Cells expressing the single-residue mutants S372A and S380A partially retained the effects of HBP1 on the DNMT1 and p16 promoters (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, Pim-1 enhanced binding of HBP1 to the DNMT1 and p16 promoters (Fig. 6C) and thus promoted the transcript"

Both methods indicated serotonin binding on the hexamer surface (site III) as well. MD, but not PC, indicated that dopamine was also a good site III ligand. Some of the PC studies also included arginine, which may be abundant in insulin granules upon processing of pro-insulin, and stable T3R3 hexamers loaded with both serotonin and arginine were obtained. The MD and PC results were supported further by in solution spectroscopic studies with R-state-specific chromophore.

Insulin is produced from a single chain pro-insulin and stored in pancreatic β-cells in storage granules (termed large dense core vesicles (LDCVs)) from which it is released into the bloodstream in response to elevated blood glucose levels. The first 3D crystal structure of insulin was described by Hodgkin and coworkers in 1969 (12Adams M.J. Blundell T.L. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Vijayan M. Baker E.N. Harding M.M. Hodgkin D.C. Rimmer B. Sheat S. Structure of rhombohedral 2 zinc insulin crystals.Nature. 1969; 224: 491-495Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar) in the form of its hexameric assembly (with three and two-fold rotational symmetry (i.e. trimer of dimers), obtained in the presence of Zn2+ ions. Two Zn2+ ions were identified in the hexamer on its 3-fold axis, being coordinated by 3 imidazole side chains of HisB10. This and subsequent similar findings resulted in a generally accepted paradigm that the hexamer is the storage form of insulin in LDCVs in pancreatic β-cells, whereas upon its release into the bloodstream it dissociates to monomers, which represent the active form of the enzyme (13Dodson G. Steiner D. The role of assembly in insulin's biosynthesis.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The pioneering work of D. C. Hodgkin was followed by 3D descriptions of hundreds of in vitro studied insulin hexamers, dimers, and monomers (for reviews, see for example Refs. 14Mayer J.P. Zhang F. DiMarchi R.D.

However, the actual in vivo storage form of insulin in pancreatic β-cells LDCVs is still not known, and it is extrapolated from its in vitro structures. Surprisingly, there are more advances into the very elusive nature of insulin/IR interactions (17Menting J.G. Whittaker J. Margetts M.B. Whittaker L.J. Kong G.K. Smith B.J. Watson C.J. Záková L.

The in vitro data showed that insulin hexamers can be grouped into three structurally distinct states/families: T6, T3Rf3, and R6 (15Ward C.W. Lawrence M.C. Landmarks in insulin research.Front.

Elsevier Academic Press, Inc., San Diego CA2009: 33-49Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which differ by the conformation of the B1-B6 N termini of the hormone B-chain (see Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). In the T6 hexamers, the initial B1-B6 segments of the B chains are fully extended followed by B7-B10 type II′ β-turns that go into invariant B9-B19 α-helices. In contrast, the B1-B6 segments acquire an α-helical conformation in the R-state, extending the B9-B19 α-helix (19Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Reynolds C.D. Smith G.D. Sparks C. Swenson D. Phenol stabilizes more helix in a new symmetrical zinc insulin hexamer.Nature. 1989; 338: 594-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The insulin Rf3 state is similar to the α-helical R6 state; however, the long R-state B-chain helix is shortened to the B3-B19 segment, whereas the B1-B3 residues depart (“fray”) from the α-helical fold (20Bentley G.

The TRf transition can be induced by an increase of, for example, the concentration of Zn2+, SCN−, and Cl− ions (22Brzović P.S. Choi W.E. Borchardt D. Kaarsholm N.C. Dunn M.F.

The RfR (or full TR) transition can be accomplished by a further increase of the concentration of phenolic ligands (19Derewenda U. Derewenda Z. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Reynolds C.D. Smith G.D.

The octahedral Zn2+ coordination is also a signature of the T-state (assured by three HisB10 imidazoles and three water molecules), whereas the Zn2+ tetrahedral coordination (three HisB10 and, for example, a Cl− ion) is typical for the Rf/R-states (e.g. Ref. 26Dunn M.F. Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer: a review.Biometals. 2005; 18: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This coordination switch results from a smaller space above the Zn2+ ion in the R-state that is obstructed there by a longer B1-B8 helical part of the B9-B19-helix and a newly formed binding pocket for cyclic alcohols on the dimer interface, formed by the side chains of A6–7, A9–11, A16, B7, B11, and B5–7 (the so-called site I, or phenol main-binding site) However, variations of the Zn2+ coordination spheres are also observed frequently (27Ciszak E. Smith G.D. Crystallographic evidence for dual coordination around zinc in the T3R3 human insulin hexamer.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1512-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although site I is the main binding cavity for all phenol-like ligands, they have also been identified in other regions of the hexamers; e.g. site II, formed by side chains B9, B12, B16, B17, B9, B10, B13; site I/II formed by B10, B14, B16, B17, and B9 (28Smith G.D. The phenolic binding site in T3R3f insulin.J. Mol. Struct. 1998; 470: 71-80Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Hexamer surface-exposed (between insulin dimers) phenolic site III (A14, A17) has been observed as well (29Whittingham J.L. Edwards D.J. Antson A.A. Clarkson J.M. Dodson G.G. Interactions of phenol and m-cresol in the insulin hexamer, and their effect on the association properties of B28 Pro → Asp insulin analogues.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11516-11523Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The serendipitous character of the discovery of the phenol-stabilized R-state resulted from the bactericide-like applications of phenol in clinical formulations of insulin. Nevertheless, the R-like states of the hormone have clinical importance, as the Rf/R-trimers/hexamers are more stable (30Rahuel-Clermont S. French C.A. Kaarsholm N.C. Dunn M.F. Chou C.I. Mechanisms of stabilization of the insulin hexamer through allosteric ligand interactions.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5837-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is mostly due to the slower Zn2+-solvent exchange, which results in a higher hexamer-monomer dissociation constant. However, the physiological relevance of T/Rf/R states for an effective insulin/IR binding and for the storage form of the hormone (e.g. protection against proteolysis) is still unknown. Here, we attempt to shed light on a possible conformation of the in vivo storage form of insulin in insulin-containing granules in pancreatic β-cells. Although the exact chemical composition of LDCVs still awaits full characterization, they contain Zn2+ ions and phenolic neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which are involved in regulation of exocytosis of the granules and insulin release (31Falck B. Hellman B. Evidence for presence of biogenic amines in pancreatic islets.Experientia. 1963; 19: 139-140Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Lundquist I. Ekholm R. Ericson L.E.

Therefore, we hypothesize that both neurotransmitters can bind to, and affect the structure of insulin hexamers, assembled in the presence of zinc cations. We probe these effects in parallel via molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and protein X-ray crystallography. These were further supplemented by spectroscopic studies with the use of a sensitive chromophore, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzoic acid (4H3N), which specifically binds to R-state insulin as indicated by a red shift of its absorption spectrum. Moreover, as arginine can accumulate in LDCVs upon processing of pro-insulin at its two Arg-rich sites (34Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J.

Structural characterization of insulin NPH formulations.Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2007; 30: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we also probe the structural effect of this amino acid on insulin oligomeric assembly. Both the MD and X-ray serotonin-related studies point to a stable insulin hexamer-serotonin-site I complex and its dynamic association with site III. Both methodologies excluded dopamine binding in site I. MD simulations also indicate preferential dopamine over serotonin binding to site III, whereas solid-state X-ray analyses yields only serotonin-site III complexes. In addition, crystal structures of serotonin-insulin hexamers loaded with arginine have been obtained that underline a possible more complex, physiological role of insulin-arginine interactions. Results concerning site I complexes are corroborated by 4H3N spectroscopic experiments, which provide apparent binding constants for interaction of insulin hexamers with phenolic ligands and arginine. Our findings thus provide a novel insight into the storage mechanism of insulin in pancreatic β-cells, also relevant for novel insulin formulations for clinical applications. Here, we address the question of whether two neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, can substitute phenol in its insulin R6 hexamer binding site I. MD simulations were performed for the R6 insulin hexamer, where site I-bound phenol was systematically replaced with neurotransmitters (each ligand in two steric-clash-free orientations; see Fig. 2). As expected, the MD simulations yielded the benchmark phenol-bound insulin R6-state hexamer (InsPheR6) with a low root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of ∼1.6–1.8 Å from the reference InsPheR6 structure, indicating that the system does not deviate significantly from the NMR structure during the simulation (Fig. 3).Figure 3r.m.s.d. of the protein backbone (heavy atoms) from the insulin R6 hexamer NMR structure with different phenolic ligands (phenol, dopamine, or serotonin). Labels 1 and 2 correspond to the two starting orientations of the neurotransmitter molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both serotonin (InsSerR6) and dopamine (InsDopR6) complexes with ligands orientation (1) behaved similarly to InsPheR6, with the backbone r.m.s.d. just above 2 Å. However, the starting orientation (2) of the ligands led to higher r.m.s.d. of ∼2.8 Å (Fig. 2) indicating somewhat larger structural changes. A more direct insight into the behavior of the ligand in site I can be obtained from a direct comparison of their r.m.s.d. (Fig. 4). The MD simulations confirm that phenol molecules are essentially fixed in site I with a minimal dynamic behavior. Two of the six phenols transiently break HBs (both with CysA6 and CysA11); however, they remain in site I, eventually reestablishing the original geometry of binding. Similarly, all but one of the serotonin molecules in the starting conformation (1) stay in site I (only one serotonin ligand temporarily leaves this cavity). However, serotonin in starting geometry (2) as well as dopamine in both starting orientations, break most of the crucial hydrogen bonds. Serotonin, but not dopamine, thus essentially mimics phenol interactions observed in InsPheR6 with its charged aminoethyl-group-forming HB with backbone carbonyl CO of CysA11, fitting well into the binding site I. The strength of binding (i.e. the binding free energy and the corresponding dissociation constant) of phenol and the two neurotransmitters was calculated using the thermodynamic integration method (see Table 1). The free energy calculations confirmed and quantified the pattern observed in direct MD simulations, indicating a similarly strong binding of phenol and serotonin to site I (Kd of 5.4 × 10−4 m and 8.1 × 10−4 m, respectively) as well as demonstrating a lack of any stable conformation of dopamine in this cavity (reflected in a positive binding free energy).Table 1Standard free energies of binding of phenol, dopamine, and serotonin, molecules to the binding site I (phenolic pocket) together with the corresponding dissociation constantsLigandΔGb°Kdkcal/mol[M]Phenol−4.49 ± 1.555.4 × 10−4Dopamine1.10 ± 1.736.3Serotonin−4.24 ± 1.878.1 × 10−4 Open table in a new tab Initial simulations of the R6 insulin hexamer with six dopamine molecules located in the phenolic pockets indicated that dopamine does not bind strongly to the phenolic pocket. At the same time, several dopamine molecules left the phenolic pocket to bind to the hitherto unexplored site III at the surface of the insulin hexamer. Therefore, an additional set of calculations was performed to characterize the binding of neurotransmitters to the surface of the insulin R6 hexamer (for simulation details, see the supplemental information). These simulations showed that dopamine binds at three equivalent binding sites in between the symmetry-related dimers (Fig. 5, top), which correspond to the previously sporadically observed site III. Analogous MD simulations for serotonin showed a similar mode of binding in site III but with a spatially looser neurotransmitter distribution, which reflects its weaker binding to this site compared with dopamine (Fig. 5, bottom). Finally, the binding of neurotransmitters at the surface sites has only a minor effect on the structure of the hexamer. Both dopamine and serotonin bind in site III in a pocket between GluA17 and Tyr14 from neighboring dimers (Fig. 6). The stronger binding of dopamine over serotonin shown by free energy calculations (see below) results from its interactions with TyrA14, a hydrogen bond of the phenolic OH to GluA17, and a salt bridge between the aminoethyl group and the carboxylic group of GluA17. Similar interactions are present for serotonin; however, the steric fit is not as good as for dopamine. Dopamine, serotonin, and phenol binding in site III were quantified by evaluation of the binding free energies and the corresponding dissociation constants (Fig. 7 and Table 2) using the umbrella sampling method, with symmetry and volume entropy corrections. In contrast to site I, dopamine is the strongest binder to site III (Kd 4.38 × 10−3 m), with serotonin and phenol showing a much weaker affinity for this surface site (Kd of 2.13 × 10−1 m and 2.59 × 10−1 m, respectively).Figure 7Free energy profiles of phenolic ligands entering the surface binding site III.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table 2Standard free energies of binding of phenol, dopamine, and serotonin molecules to the binding site III and the corresponding dissociation constantsLigand in the binding site IIIW0〈ΔGsymm〉ΔGvolΔGb°Kdkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molmPhenol−1.83 ± 0.28−0.361.38 ± 0.22−0.81 ± 0.362.59 × 10−1Dopamine−6.23 ± 0.67−0.363.2 ± 0.2−3.24 ± 0.704.38 × 10−3Serotonin−2.65 ± 0.55−0.362.0 ± 0.1−0.92 ± 0.562.13 × 10−1 Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of insulin grown in the presence of serotonin and Zn2+ revealed a T3R3 hexamer (referred to here as InsSerT3R3), with six neurotransmitters and two Zn2+ ions per hexamer (Fig. 8). The minimum serotonin concentration that still yielded complex crystals was within the 35–40 mm range. The asymmetric unit of this crystal contains 14 molecules of insulin, hence providing reliable, independent multicopy structural evidence. The hexamer quaternary structure is indeed T3R3 as the B1-B3 N termini acquire here a more R-like (fully α-helical) fold rather than an Rf, “frayed,” conformation observed in T3Rf3 oligomers. Coordination of both Zn2+ ions is tetrahedral regardless of the R or T protein environment with axial Cl− ligands. The overall fold of InsSerT3R3 is very similar to other T3Rf3 hexamers.

Serotonin occupies six sites in InsSerT3R3: three phenol “main” sites I and three hexamer surface sites III. It is tethered (Fig. 9) into site I via (typical for phenolic ligands) HBs of its OH group to -CO of CysA6 (range of 2.41–2.43 Å) and to -NH of CysA11 (2.93–3.17 Å); a weaker HB -OH contact to -CO of SerA9 (3.38–3.41 Å) further stabilizes this phenolic anchor. A significant HisB5-Nε2·π pyrrole HB (3.46–3.56 Å) contributes to the immobilization of the serotonin indole ring, which is assisted further by more subtle van der Waals (hydrophobic) interactions, especially with LeuB17 (3.45–3.59 Å). The aminoethyl side chain of serotonin points toward the surface of the hexamer, i.e. into the space/gap between two 3-fold related dimers. The -NζH amino group of this side chain is hydrogen-bonded to Oε1 of GluB21 (2.55–2.75 Å) and -CO of CysA11 (2.72–2.79 Å). In contrast to site I, the serotonin-binding mode to site III is rather dynamic, indicating its mobility on the InsSerT3R3 surface. Although serotonin is pincered there in a hydrophobic clamp of TyrA14 (π·π interactions ∼3.5 Å) and the side chain of LeuA13 (from a symmetry related dimer), the ligands’ electron density is generally less well defined there. The serotonin phenolic OH group makes hydrogen bond to the Oε atoms of GluA17 (2.96–3.44 Å), and it can be stabilized by water-mediated HB to the hydroxyl of TyrA14. The HBs of the GluA17 carboxylic side chain to the guanidinium group of ArgB22 (2.75–2.82 Å) contributes further to the structural stability of the serotonin-OH environment. However, it is evident that the aromatic moieties of Tyr14 and serotonin can slide parallel to each other, indicating further adaptability of this mode of binding. Relative flexibility of site III is also seen in different modes of the HB network to the -Nζ group of the serotonin aminoethyl side chain. It is engaged primarily by HBs to the carboxyl side chain of GluA17 (2.65–2."

In this study, we measured cytokine concentration in aqueous humor before and after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR). The aim was to determine changes in cytokine concentration and their effects on DME reduction. Methods Twelve patients (13 eyes) with DME received two IVR (0.5 mg) with a 1 month interval, and a total of 26 aqueous humor samples were obtained. Macular thickness was measured with an optical coherence tomography (OCT) using thickness-map mode with an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) 9-zone grid that was divided into two zones: a central circle with a diameter of 1 mm (zone1); and an outer circle with a diameter of 6 mm (zone2). Results The concentration of eotaxin-1 in aqueous humor samples decreased significantly after IVR. Baseline cytokine concentration was associated with IVR-induced DME reduction. In zone1, higher baseline concentration of interferon-induced protein (IP)-10, and in zone 2, higher baseline concentration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IP-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α; and lower baseline concentration of eotaxin-1, interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-8 were associated with improved DME. Cytokine changes were associated with IVR-induced DME reduction. In zone1, lower concentration of IP-10 compared to baseline or higher concentration of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) -α, and in zone 2, lower concentration of IL-5 compared to baseline, IL-8, and IP-10 or higher concentration of eotaxin-1 and MIP-1β were associated with improved DME. Conclusions These findings suggest that ranibizumab affects the concentration of cytokines in aqueous humor. Various cytokines contribute to a decrease in retinal thickness, both in the center of the macula and in a larger area of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2602716264,"At a time when the antibiotic drug discovery pipeline has stalled, antibiotic resistance is accelerating with catastrophic implications for our ability to treat bacterial infections. Globally we face the prospect of a future when common infections can once again kill. Anti-virulence approaches that target the capacity of the bacterium to cause disease rather than the growth or survival of the bacterium itself offer a tantalizing prospect of novel antimicrobials. They may also reduce the propensity to induce resistance by removing the strong selection pressure imparted by bactericidal or bacteriostatic agents. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, disulfide bond protein A (PaDsbA1) plays a central role in the oxidative folding of virulence factors and is therefore an attractive target for the development of new anti-virulence antimicrobials. Using a fragment-based approach we have identified small molecules that bind to PaDsbA1. The fragment hits show selective binding to PaDsbA1 over the DsbA protein from Escherichia coli, suggesting that developing species-specific narrow-spectrum inhibitors of DsbA enzymes may be feasible. Structures of a co-complex of PaDsbA1 with the highest affinity fragment identified in the screen reveal that the fragment binds on the non-catalytic surface of the protein at a domain interface. This biophysical and structural data represent a starting point in the development of higher affinity compounds, which will be assessed for their potential as selective PaDsbA1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2603706614,"Objectives Preeclampsia is divided into early-onset (delivery before 34 weeks of gestation) and late-onset (delivery at or after 34 weeks) subtypes, which may rise from different etiopathogenic backgrounds. Early-onset disease is associated with placental dysfunction. Late-onset disease develops predominantly due to metabolic disturbances, obesity, diabetes, lipid dysfunction, and inflammation, which affect endothelial function. Our aim was to use cluster analysis to investigate clinical factors predicting the onset and severity of preeclampsia in a cohort of women with known clinical risk factors. Methods We recruited 903 pregnant women with risk factors for preeclampsia at gestational weeks 12+0–13+6. Each individual outcome diagnosis was independently verified from medical records. We applied a Bayesian clustering algorithm to classify the study participants to clusters based on their particular risk factor combination. For each cluster, we computed the risk ratio of each disease outcome, relative to the risk in the general population. Results The risk of preeclampsia increased exponentially with respect to the number of risk factors. Our analysis revealed 25 number of clusters. Preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy (n = 138) increased the risk of preeclampsia 8.1 fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7–11.2) compared to a general population of pregnant women. Having a small for gestational age infant (n = 57) in a previous pregnancy increased the risk of early-onset preeclampsia 17.5 fold (95%CI 2.1–60.5). Cluster of those two risk factors together (n = 21) increased the risk of severe preeclampsia to 23.8-fold (95%CI 5.1–60.6), intermediate onset (delivery between 34+0–36+6 weeks of gestation) to 25.1-fold (95%CI 3.1–79.9) and preterm preeclampsia (delivery before 37+0 weeks of gestation) to 16.4-fold (95%CI 2.0–52.4). Body mass index over 30 kg/m2 (n = 228) as a sole risk factor increased the risk of preeclampsia to 2.1-fold (95%CI 1.1–3.6). Together with preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy the risk increased to 11.4 (95%CI 4.5–20.9). Chronic hypertension (n = 60) increased the risk of preeclampsia 5.3-fold (95%CI 2.4–9.8), of severe preeclampsia 22.2-fold (95%CI 9.9–41.0), and risk of early-onset preeclampsia 16.7-fold (95%CI 2.0–57.6). If a woman had chronic hypertension combined with obesity, gestational diabetes and earlier preeclampsia, the risk of term preeclampsia increased 4.8-fold (95%CI 0.1–21.7). Women with type 1 diabetes mellitus had a high risk of all subgroups of preeclampsia. Conclusion The risk of preeclampsia increases exponentially with respect to the number of risk factors. Early-onset preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia have different risk profile from term preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2600813577,"Education about virus biology at school is of pivotal interest to raise public awareness concerning means of disease transmission and, thus, methods to prevent infection, and to reduce unnecessary antibiotic treatment due to patient pressure on physicians in case of viral diseases such as influenza. This study aimed at making visible the knowledge of Austrian high school and university students with respect to virus biology, virus structure and health-education issues. The data presented here stem from comprehensive questionnaire analyses, including the task to draw a virus, from a cross-sectional study with 133 grade 7 and 199 grade 10 high school students, and 133 first-year biology and 181 first-year non-biology university students. Analyses were performed both quantitatively and qualitatively. ANOVA revealed a highly significant group effect for total knowledge relating to virus biology and health issues (F(3, 642) = 44.17, p < 0.01, η2p = 0.17). Specific post-hoc tests by means of the Tukey test showed significant differences between all groups (p < .01) with the exception of 1st year non-biology students and grade 10 high school students. Students enrolled in university-level biology outperformed all other groups, even though they had not yet encountered this topic at their courses; part of this phenomenon might be due to their affinity for learning about biological topics. However, even many first-year biology students had a high number of severe misconceptions, e.g., defining a virus as a pro- or eukaryotic cell, or falsely naming malaria as a viral disease. Since there was no significant difference in virus-related knowledge between high schools, virus biology seems to have been taught similarly among the tested schools. However, the majority of participants stated that the virus-related knowledge they had acquired at school was not sufficient. Based on the results presented here we urgently suggest improving and intensifying teaching this topic at school, since virus-related knowledge was by far too fragmentary among many participants. Such lack of health-relevant knowledge may contribute to pressure on physicians by patients to unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics, and possibly lead to potentially dangerous neglect concerning vaccination. The effectiveness of newly developed virus-related teaching units and material could be tested with the instrument used here."
https://openalex.org/W2601002254,"To date, recombination between different strains of the avian alphaherpesvirus infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) has only been detected in field samples using full genome sequencing and sequence analysis. These previous studies have revealed that natural recombination is widespread in ILTV and have demonstrated that recombination between two attenuated ILTV vaccine strains generated highly virulent viruses that produced widespread disease within poultry flocks in Australia. In order to better understand ILTV recombination, this study developed a TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay to detect recombination between two field strains of ILTV (CSW-1 and V1-99 ILTV) under experimental conditions. Following in vivo co-inoculation of these two ILTV strains in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, recovered viruses were plaque purified and subjected to the SNP genotyping assay. This assay revealed ILTV recombinants in all co-inoculated chickens. In total 64/87 (74%) of the recovered viruses were recombinants and 23 different recombination patterns were detected, with some of them occurring more frequently than others. The results from this study demonstrate that the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay is a useful tool to study recombination in ILTV and also show that recombination occurs frequently during experimental co-infection with ILTV in SPF chickens. This tool, when used to assess ILTV recombination in the natural host, has the potential to greatly contribute to our understanding of alphaherpesvirus recombination."

The retrospective cohort study herein aimed to investigate the association between asthma, corticosteroid use, and schizophrenia.Longitudinal data (2000 to 2007) from adults with asthma (n = 50,046) and without asthma (n = 50,046) were compared on measures of schizophrenia incidence using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Incidence of schizophrenia diagnosis (ICD-9 codes 295.XX) between 2000 and 2007 were compared between groups. Competing risk-adjusted Cox regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for sex, age, residence, socioeconomic status, corticosteroid use, outpatient and emergency room visit frequency, Charlson comorbidity index, and total length of hospital stays days for any disorder.Of the 75,069 subjects, 238 received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The mean (SD) follow-up interval for all subjects was 5.8 (2.3) years. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, asthma was associated with significantly greater hazard ratio for incident schizophrenia 1.40 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.87). Additional factors associated with greater incidence of schizophrenia were rural residence, lower economic status, and poor general health. Older age (i.e. ≥65 years) was negatively associated with schizophrenia incidence. Corticosteroid use was not associated with increased risk for schizophrenia.Asthma was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. The results herein suggest that a convergent disturbance in the immune-inflammatory system may contribute to the pathoetiology of asthma and schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2598147855,"Background Novelty-seeking (NS) and impulsive personality traits have been proposed to reflect an interplay between fronto-cortical and limbic systems, including the limbic striatum (LS). Although neuroimaging studies have provided some evidence for this, most are comprised of small samples and many report surprisingly large effects given the challenges of trying to relate a snapshot of brain function or structure to an entity as complex as personality. The current work tested a priori hypotheses about associations between striatal dopamine (DA) release, cortical thickness (CT), and NS in a large sample of healthy adults. Methods Fifty-two healthy adults (45M/7F; age: 23.8±4.93) underwent two positron emission tomography scans with [11C]raclopride (specific for striatal DA D2/3 receptors) with or without amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, p.o.). Structural magnetic resonance image scans were acquired, as were Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire data. Amphetamine-induced changes in [11C]raclopride binding potential values (ΔBPND) were examined in the limbic, sensorimotor (SMS) and associative (AST) striatum. CT measures, adjusted for whole brain volume, were extracted from the dorsolateral sensorimotor and ventromedial/limbic cortices. Results BPND values were lower in the amphetamine vs. no-drug sessions, with the largest effect in the LS. When comparing low vs. high LS ΔBPND groups (median split), higher NS2 (impulsiveness) scores were found in the high ΔBPND group. Partial correlations (age and gender as covariates) yielded a negative relation between ASTS ΔBPND and sensorimotor CT; trends for inverse associations existed between ΔBPND values in other striatal regions and frontal CT. In other words, the greater the amphetamine-induced striatal DA response, the thinner the frontal cortex. Conclusions These data expand upon previously reported associations between striatal DA release in the LS and both NS related impulsiveness and CT in the largest sample reported to date. The findings add to the plausibility of these associations while suggesting that the effects are likely weaker than has been previously proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2600571081,"Introduction Risky sexual practice among people living with HIV/AIDS is a public health concern because of the risk of transmission of the virus to sero-discordant partner/s. There is also the risk of re-infection with new, drug resistant viral strains between sero-concordant partners. However, there is lack of information on risky sexual practices among HIV positive adults. Therefore, this study aimed to assess risky sexual practice and associated factors among adult HIV positive clients at Gondar University Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2015. Methods An institution based cross sectional study was conducted at Gondar University Referral Hospital from May to June 2015. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Using systematic random sampling technique, a total of 513 respondents were participated in this study. The data were entered into EPI info version 3.5.3 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were done. A P-value <0.05 was considered to determine the statistical significance of the association between factors (independent variables) and risky sexual practice. The Odds ratio was also used to determine the presence and the degree of association between the dependent and independent variables. Results A total of 513 respondents were participated in this study. The prevalence of risky sexual practices in the past three months was 38% (95% CI: 33.3%, 42.3%). Being in the age range of 18–29 years (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.55, 4.47) and 30–39 years (AOR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.48, 3.53), being single (AOR = 6.32, 95%CI: 2.43, 16.44),being married (AOR = 6.06, 95% CI: 2.81, 13.07), having no child (AOR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.17, 5.72), and a CD4 count of greater than 500/mm3 were factors significantly associated with risky sexual practices. Conclusions A considerable number of HIV positive clients had risky sexual practices. It is strongly recommended that the Regional Health Bureau and health service providers working at Gondar University Hospital especially in the ART Clinic need to work hard on behavioral change communication."
https://openalex.org/W2598295942,"Given finite attentional resources, how emotional aspects of stimuli are processed automatically is controversial. Present study examined the time-course for automatic processing of facial expression by assessing N170, and late positive potentials (LPPs) of event-related potentials (ERPs) using a modified rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. Observers were required to confirm a certain house image and to detect whether a face image was presented at the end of a series of pictures. There were no significant main effects on emotional type for P1 amplitudes, whereas happy and fearful expressions elicited larger N170 amplitudes than neutral expressions. Significantly different LPP amplitudes were elicited depending on the type of emotional facial expressions (fear > happy > neutral). These results indicated that threatening priority was absent but discrimination of expressive vs. neutral faces occurred in implicit emotional tasks, at approximately 250 ms post-stimulus. Moreover, the three types of expressions were discriminated during the later stages of processing. Encoding emotional information of faces can be automated to a relatively higher degree, when attentional resources are mostly allocated to superficial analyzing."
https://openalex.org/W2601303322,"Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance and contribution to phytoplankton biomass was studied in Hungarian shallow lakes to test the effect of inorganic turbidity determining the size distribution of the phytoplankton. The studied lakes displayed wide turbidity (TSS: 4–2250 mg l-1) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a: 1–460 μg l-1) range, as well as APP abundance (0 and 100 million cells ml-1) and contribution (0–100%) to total phytoplankton biomass. Inorganic turbidity had a significant effect on the abundance and contribution of APP, resulting in higher values compared to other freshwater lakes with the same phytoplankton biomass. Our analysis has provided empirical evidence for a switching point (50 mg l-1 inorganic turbidity), above which turbidity is the key factor causing APP predominance regardless of phytoplankton biomass in shallow turbid lakes. Our results have shown that turbid shallow lakes are unique waters, where the formerly and widely accepted model (decreasing APP contribution with increasing phytoplankton biomass) is not applicable. We hypothesize that this unusual behaviour of APP in turbid waters is a result of either diminished underwater light intensity or a reduced grazing pressure due to high inorganic turbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2601558987,"Honeybees face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. The crop microbiota of Apis mellifera, composed of 13 Lactic Acid Bacterial (LAB) species within the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, form a beneficial symbiotic relationship with each other and the honeybee to protect their niche and their host. Possibly playing a vital role in honeybee health, it is important that these honeybee specific Lactic Acid Bacterial (hbs-LAB) symbionts can be correctly identified, isolated and cultured, to further investigate their health promoting properties. We have previously reported successful identification to the strain level by culture-dependent methods and we recently sequenced and annotated the genomes of the 13 hbs-LAB. However, the hitherto applied techniques are unfortunately very time consuming, expensive and not ideal when analyzing a vast quantity of samples. In addition, other researchers have constantly failed to identify the 13 hbs-LAB from honeybee samples by using inadequate media and/or molecular techniques based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing with insufficient discriminatory power. The aim of this study was to develop better and more suitable methods for the identification and cultivation of hbs-LAB. We compared currently used bacterial cultivation media and could for the first time demonstrate a significant variation in the hbs-LAB basic requirements for optimal growth. We also present a new bacterial identification approach based on amplicon sequencing of a region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina platform and an error correction software that can be used to successfully differentiate and rapidly identify the 13 hbs-LAB to the strain level."
https://openalex.org/W2597736509,"MF6p/FhHDM-1 is a small protein secreted by the parasitic flatworm (trematode) Fasciola hepatica that belongs to a broad family of heme-binding proteins (MF6p/helminth defense molecules (HDMs)). MF6p/HDMs are of interest for understanding heme homeostasis in trematodes and as potential targets for the development of new flukicides. Moreover, interest in these molecules has also increased because of their immunomodulatory properties. Here we have extended our previous findings on the mechanism of MF6p/HDM-heme interactions and mapped the protein regions required for heme binding and for other biological functions. Our data revealed that MF6p/FhHDM-1 forms high-molecular-weight complexes when associated with heme and that these complexes are reorganized by a stacking procedure to form fibril-like and granular nanostructures. Furthermore, we showed that MF6p/FhHDM-1 is a transitory heme-binding protein as protein·heme complexes can be disrupted by contact with an apoprotein (e.g. apomyoglobin) with higher affinity for heme. We also demonstrated that (i) the heme-binding region is located in the MF6p/FhHDM-1 C-terminal moiety, which also inhibits the peroxidase-like activity of heme, and (ii) MF6p/HDMs from other trematodes, such as Opisthorchis viverrini and Paragonimus westermani, also bind heme. Finally, we observed that the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal, moiety of MF6p/HDMs has a predicted structural analogy with cell-penetrating peptides and that both the entire protein and the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal moiety of MF6p/FhHDM-1 interact in vitro with cell membranes in hemin-preconditioned erythrocytes. Our findings suggest that MF6p/HDMs can transport heme in trematodes and thereby shield the parasite from the harmful effects of heme."
https://openalex.org/W2598371005,"Retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma are fast spreading eye tumors usually diagnosed by using 2D Fundus Image Photography (Fundus) and 2D Ultrasound (US). Diagnosis and treatment planning of such diseases often require additional complementary imaging to confirm the tumor extend via 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this context, having automatic segmentations to estimate the size and the distribution of the pathological tissue would be advantageous towards tumor characterization. Until now, the alternative has been the manual delineation of eye structures, a rather time consuming and error-prone task, to be conducted in multiple MRI sequences simultaneously. This situation, and the lack of tools for accurate eye MRI analysis, reduces the interest in MRI beyond the qualitative evaluation of the optic nerve invasion and the confirmation of recurrent malignancies below calcified tumors. In this manuscript, we propose a new framework for the automatic segmentation of eye structures and ocular tumors in multi-sequence MRI. Our key contribution is the introduction of a pathological eye model from which Eye Patient-Specific Features (EPSF) can be computed. These features combine intensity and shape information of pathological tissue while embedded in healthy structures of the eye. We assess our work on a dataset of pathological patient eyes by computing the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of the sclera, the cornea, the vitreous humor, the lens and the tumor.

One possible HSV-1 target might be DNA damage-tolerance mechanisms, such as the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway. In TLS, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage-caused replication fork stalling. Ubiquitinated PCNA then facilitates the error-prone DNA polymerase · (pol·)-mediated TLS, allowing the fork to bypass damaged sites. Because of the involvement of PCNA ubiquitination in DNA-damage repair, we hypothesized that the function of PCNA might be altered by HSV-1. Here we show that PCNA is a substrate of the HSV-1 deubiquitinase UL36USP, which has previously been shown to be involved mainly in virus uptake and maturation. In HSV-1-infected cells, viral infection-associated UL36USP consistently reduced PCNA ubiquitination. The deubiquitination of PCNA inhibited the formation of pol· foci and also increased cell sensitivity to DNA-damage agents. Moreover, the catalytically inactive mutant UL36C40A failed to deubiquitinate PCNA. Of note, the levels of virus marker genes increased strikingly in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1, but only moderately in UL36C40A mutant virus-infected cells, indicating that the UL36USP deubiquitinating activity supports HSV-1 virus replication during infection. These findings suggest a role of UL36USP in the DNA damage-response pathway.

During DNA replication, multiple environmental toxins and pathogen invasions cause DNA damages (1Luftig M.A. Viruses and the DNA damage response: activation and antagonism.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2014; 1: 605-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High-fidelity DNA polymerase cannot accommodate these damaged bases, which leads to stalled and collapsed replication forks, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) 2The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble-strand breaksTLStranslesion synthesisPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRPAreplication protein APIPPCNA interaction proteinDDRDNA-damage responseUSPubiquitin-specific proteaseTIFTriton X-100-insoluble fractionco-IPco-immunoprecipitationCHXcycloheximideFAFanconi anemiaHRhomologous recombinationEBVEpstein-Barr virus.

To prevent DSB caused by collapsed replication forks, the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway is activated to bypass DNA-damage sites, which is mediated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) monoubiquitination (2Kannouche P.L.

PCNA can form a homotrimer clamp that slides along the DNA chain to provide scaffold for replication complex assembly (4Mailand N. Gibbs-Seymour I. Bekker-Jensen S.

Blockage of the replication fork results in prolonged single-stranded DNA that is rapidly coated by replication protein A (RPA). Then RPA triggers the recruitment of RAD6-RAD18 ubiquitination ligase to monoubiquitinate PCNA on lysine 164 (5Davies A.A. Huttner D. Daigaku Y. Chen S. Ulrich H.D. Activation of ubiquitin-dependent DNA damage bypass is mediated by replication protein A.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The monoubiquitinated PCNA then promotes the recruitment of pol· that belongs to the error-prone Y-family polymerase used in TLS pathway. Pol· contains three PCNA interaction protein (PIP) boxes and an ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain. The PIP domains of pol· are less efficient than canonical PIP domains in error-free DNA polymerase, which lead to a minor affinity between pol· and PCNA during normal DNA replication. Pol· has a flexible active site that can accommodate damaged DNA template, allowing replication complex to bypass the lesion sites, thus preventing replication fork collapse and leaving the damaged sites to be repaired by other error-free pathways (6Sale J.E.

Translesion DNA synthesis and mutagenesis in eukaryotes.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a012708Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These studies described a widely accepted model of the function of ubiquitinated PCNA in TLS. However, a debate on the role of PCNA ubiquitination in TLS arose from recent extensive quantitative studies by Hedglin et al. (8Hedglin M. Pandey B. Benkovic S.J. Characterization of human translesion DNA synthesis across a UV-induced DNA lesion.Elife. 2016; 5e19788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Their results demonstrated that monoubiquitination of PCNA did not change the binding affinity between PCNA and pol·, and the subsequent TLS across a DNA lesion was also independent of PCNA monoubiquitination. They proposed that PCNA monoubiquitination indirectly promotes DNA synthesis by increasing the residence time of pol· within the damaged sites, likely through altering the chromatin structure around damaged sites, although further studies are needed to test this hypothesis (8Hedglin M. Pandey B. Benkovic S.J. Characterization of human translesion DNA synthesis across a UV-induced DNA lesion.Elife. 2016; 5e19788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Besides multiple chemical or physical stimuli that induce DNA damage, many pathogens also cause cellular DNA damage and even manipulate DNA-damage repair proteins to facilitate their own proliferation (9Weitzman M.D. Weitzman J.B. What's the damage? The impact of pathogens on pathways that maintain host genome integrity.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 15: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HSV-1 is a large double-stranded DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid wrapped by an envelope. The tegument layer between the capsid and envelope contains proteins that are important for virus infection and capsid assembly. HSV-1 infection usually occurs at oral mucosa neurons. After primary infection, virus particles transport along the neuronal axons to the nucleus and establish a latent state. During the latent infection stage, virus DNA is packed into a repressed structure and most genes remain silent. Latent virus can be reactivated by multiple stimulus including UV exposure and transport from the neurons down to primary infection sites, resulting in herpetic stomatitis. The reactivation of HSV-1 can happen multiple times during one's lifetime. Besides the oral mucosa, HSV-1 also infects genitals and corneal tissues, causing genital herpes or herpes keratitis, respectively (10Whitley R.J. Kimberlin D.W. Roizman B.

Herpes simplex viruses: mechanisms of DNA replication.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4a013011Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The infection of HSV-1 activates a cellular defense system including DNA-damage response. Multi-virus proteins coordinate these DNA-damage response (DDR) pathways elegantly to facilitate virus DNA replication. It has been reported that the ATM signaling pathway is activated during HSV-1 infection, whereas ATR and DNA-PKCs pathways are inhibited (1Luftig M.A. Viruses and the DNA damage response: activation and antagonism.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2014; 1: 605-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chaurushiya M.S. Weitzman M.D. Viral manipulation of DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints.DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 1166-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to function in the DDR signaling pathway, PCNA and several other DDR proteins including RPA, DNA-PKCs, Rad50, Ku86, Ku70, PARP1, and Mre11 have also been observed to aggregate at the HSV-1 virus replication compartment (13Wilcock D.

However, the putative roles of PCNA in viral replication remain poorly documented. UL36 (VP1/2) is the largest tegument protein of HSV-1 containing more than 3000 amino acids, which helps HSV-1 viruses enter cells (16Shanda S.K. Wilson D.W.

The herpesvirus VP1/2 protein is an effector of dynein-mediated capsid transport and neuroinvasion.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When most tegument proteins are released into the cytoplasm, UL36 remains attached to capsid and facilitate viral DNA entering the nucleus. This direct attachment enables UL36 to play a central role in the whole tegument structure assembly and virions maturation (18Cardone G. Newcomb W.W. Cheng N. Wingfield P.T. Trus B.L. Brown J.C.

Virol. 2010; 84: 9408-9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal of UL36 cleaved from the full-length protein has been reported to possess deubiquitination activity (21Kattenhorn L.M. Korbel G.A. Kessler B.M. Spooner E. Ploegh H.L. A deubiquitinating enzyme encoded by HSV-1 belongs to a family of cysteine proteases that is conserved across the family Herpesviridae.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 547-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This fragment contains around 500 amino acids and named as UL36 ubiquitin-specific protease (UL36USP). Cysteine at position 40 in the HSV-1 F strain has been recognized as the active site for UL36USP deubiquitination activity (22Wang S. Wang K. Li J. Zheng C. Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin-specific protease UL36 inhibits β interferon production by deubiquitinating TRAF3.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 11851-11860Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). UL36USP can cleave K48 and K63 ubiquitin chains specifically and has no cleavage activity for ubiquitin-like protein modifications (23Schlieker C. Korbel G.A. Kattenhorn L.M. Ploegh H.L. A deubiquitinating activity is conserved in the large tegument protein of the herpesviridae.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15582-15585Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). So far, two substrates of UL36USP have been identified (22Wang S. Wang K. Li J. Zheng C. Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin-specific protease UL36 inhibits β interferon production by deubiquitinating TRAF3.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 11851-11860Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Bolstad M. Abaitua F. Crump C.M. O'Hare P. Autocatalytic activity of the ubiquitin-specific protease domain of herpes simplex virus 1 VP1–2.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8738-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (22Wang S. Wang K. Li J. Zheng C. Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin-specific protease UL36 inhibits β interferon production by deubiquitinating TRAF3.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 11851-11860Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) discovered that UL36USP inhibits the IFN-β pathway by deubiquitinating TRAF3. The O'Hare group (24Bolstad M. Abaitua F. Crump C.M. O'Hare P. Autocatalytic activity of the ubiquitin-specific protease domain of herpes simplex virus 1 VP1–2.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8738-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) explored the effect of UL36 USP activity on its own stability. Moreover, HSV-1 infection has been found to regulate DNA-damage pathways, however, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear (1Luftig M.A. Viruses and the DNA damage response: activation and antagonism.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2014; 1: 605-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that PCNA is observed at the HSV-1 replication center and knockdown of PCNA reduces viral replication and histone deposition, and PCNA monoubiquitination plays critical roles in TLS pathway, it is worth investigating the effect of HSV-1 virus infection on PCNA ubiquitination and the TLS pathway (25Sanders I. Boyer M. Fraser N.W. Early nucleosome deposition on, and replication of, HSV DNA requires cell factor PCNA.J. Neurovirol. 2015; 21: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that in response to DNA damage, UL36USP deubiquitinated PCNA and inhibited pol· recruitment, and cells with stably expressed UL36USP showed a significant decrease of cell viability. These results indicate that HSV-1 suppresses the TLS pathway through the deubiquitinating activity of UL36USP. Our findings provide new insight into DNA-repair pathways in HSV-1 infection. As a crucial member of cellular DDR pathways, the observation of PCNA in the HSV-1 virus DNA replication compartment suggests an active manipulation of PCNA by virus (13Wilcock D. Lane D.P. Localization of P53, retinoblastoma and host replication proteins at sites of viral replication in herpes-infected cells.Nature. 1991; 349: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Taylor T.J. Knipe D.M. Proteomics of herpes simplex virus replication compartments: association of cellular DNA replication, repair, recombination, and chromatin remodeling proteins with ICP8.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5856-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because PCNA ubiquitination has been well studied in the DDR pathway, we wondered whether UL36USP, a deubiquitinase of the HSV-1 virus, targets monoubiquitinated PCNA in response to DNA damage. Different deubiquitinases were transfected into HEK293T cells together with His-ubiquitin, and PCNA ubiquitination was analyzed by His pulldown analysis. USP1/UAF1, a known deubiquitinase for PCNA was used as a positive control, whereas USP11 and USP25 were used as negative controls. In cells treated with H2O2, we found that UL36USP inhibited the level of PCNA ubiquitination more efficiently than USP1/UAF1 (Fig. 1A). Next, we investigated if the deubiquitinase activity of UL36USP is essential for its effect on PCNA during the DNA damage repair process. As shown in Fig. 1B, UL36USP is the N-terminal domain of HSV-1 large tegument protein UL36. Cysteine at position 40 is the key residue for the deubiquitination activity of UL36USP, and mutation of Cys at 40 to Ala (C40A) causes a significant loss of deubiquitination activity (22Wang S. Wang K. Li J. Zheng C. Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin-specific protease UL36 inhibits β interferon production by deubiquitinating TRAF3.J. Virol. 2013; 87: 11851-11860Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we next explored whether the deubiquitination of PCNA by UL36USP was dependent on its deubiquitination activity. Cells were transfected with UL36USP or UL36C40A and the ubiquitination of PCNA was examined by a His pulldown assay after treatment with ultraviolet (UV) or H2O2. As expected, both UV and H2O2 promoted PCNA ubiquitination efficiently, and UL36USP inhibited PCNA ubiquitination completely, whereas the UL36C40A mutant exhibited no capability of deubiquitinating PCNA with or without DNA-damage stimuli (Fig. 1, C and D). The His pulldown experiment using UV as DNA-damage stimuli were repeated three times and quantified with Odyssey software. The intensity of ubiquitinated PCNA was normalized to that of the empty vector transfected but not stimulated group, and the deubiquitination effect of UL36USP on PCNA ubiquitination was significant with p value equaling 0.0076 (Fig. 1E). To avoid the influence of ubiquitin overexpression in the His pulldown assay described above and confirm the deubiquitinating activity of UL36USP, we performed a chromatin fractionation assay. Cells transfected with UL36USP or -C40A were subjected to UV or H2O2 treatments, and endogenous chromatin-associated proteins were isolated by using Triton X-100 containing buffer. Monoubiquitinated PCNA should be concentrated in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (TIF), as it is associated with the chromatin. Indeed, UL36USP reduced accumulation of ubiquitinated PCNA induced by UV (Fig. 1F) or H2O2 treatments (Fig. 1G), whereas the UL36C40A mutant had no such effect. Interestingly, we also found an unexpected band that migrated slower than UL36C40A itself but not wild-type UL36USP (Fig. 1, F and G), which was similar to the results of ubiquitinated VP1–2 NT1 C65A in a previous report (24Bolstad M. Abaitua F. Crump C.M. O'Hare P. Autocatalytic activity of the ubiquitin-specific protease domain of herpes simplex virus 1 VP1–2.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 8738-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that UL36C40A might be ubiquitinated, which will be discussed later. These results demonstrate that UL36USP deubiquitinates PCNA in vivo, whereas UL36C40A loses its deubiquitinating activity on PCNA, suggesting that viral protein UL36USP is involved in the TLS pathway. The in vivo experiments indicate that UL36USP deubiquitinates PCNA by its catalytic activity, to detect the direct deubiquitination of PCNA by UL36USP, we performed an in vitro deubiquitination experiment. Ubiquitinated PCNA was enriched by Ni2+ beads in Nonidet P-40 containing cell lysis buffer, and washed with deubiquitinating buffer three times. UL36USP or -C40A recombinant proteins purified from Escherichia coli were incubated with ubiquitinated PCNA at 30 °C following an experimental procedure reported by Huang et al. (26Huang T.T. Nijman S.M. Mirchandani K.D. Galardy P.J. Cohn M.A. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Ploegh H.L. Bernards R. D'Andrea A.D. Regulation of monoubiquitinated PCNA by DUB autocleavage.Nat. Cell. Biol. 2006; 8: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1H, UL36USP-deubiquitinated PCNA significantly, whereas the UL36C40A mutant did not. The result of the in vitro experiment confirms that UL36USP deubiquitinates PCNA directly by its catalytic activity but not through other proteins. The observations that UL36USP-deubiquitinated PCNA spurred us to determine whether UL36USP interacted with PCNA, we then performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay to verify this hypothesis. HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-UL36USP and HA-PCNA were treated with or without UV irradiation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, the interaction between UL36USP and PCNA was detected in the presence of DNA-damage stimuli, suggesting that DNA damage stimulates the interaction of UL36USP with PCNA. We further investigated the interaction between UL36USP and endogenous PCNA after UV treatment for different times by using anti-FLAG® M2 magnetic beads (Fig. 2B). The interaction increasing with time prolongs and reached the maximum at 9 h after UV treatment, consistent with the result in Fig. 2A. This result indicates that UL36USP could respond to DNA damage by increasing its affinity with PCNA. Next, we investigated the interaction of both exogenous (Fig. 2C) and endogenous (Fig. 2D) PCNA to UL36USP and UL36C40A after DNA-damage stimuli. Both wild-type UL36USP and UL36C40A mutant associated with PCNA (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that the deubiquitinase activity of UL36USP has no effect on its binding to PCNA. A PIP domain is found in UL36USP (Fig. 2E), which is conserved in herpes viruses (27Whitehurst C.B. Vaziri C. Shackelford J. Pagano J.S. Epstein-Barr virus BPLF1 deubiquitinates PCNA and attenuates polymerase eta recruitment to DNA damage sites.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 8097-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As the two conserved phenylalanines in the PIP domain play a crucial role in PIP-mediated PCNA interaction (27Whitehurst C.B. Vaziri C. Shackelford J. Pagano J.S.

The result showed that mutation of the key residues in the PIP domain abolished its interaction with PCNA (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the PIP domain is critical in the UL36USP-PCNA interaction. Moreover, to investigate whether mutation of the PIP domain will also affect the deubiquitination of PCNA by UL36USP, HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-UL36USP or FLAG-UL36PIP or FLAG-UL36C40A mutants together with His-ubiquitin were subjected to UV stimulation, and then the levels of ubiquitinated PCNA were detected by a His pulldown assay (Fig. 2F). As expected, UV induced a significant increase of PCNA ubiquitination in the empty vector expressing group, whereas no ubiquitinated PCNA was detected in cells transfected with wild-type UL36USP. Similar to UL36C40A, the UL36PIP mutant could not inhibit PCNA ubiquitination. This result suggests that the PIP domain contributes to the deubiquitination process by promoting the interaction between UL36USP and PCNA. Because UL36USP deubiquitinated PCNA, we wondered whether it would compromise the accumulation of pol· at replication stalling sites. HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-UL36USP, -C40A, or empty vector plasmids were treated with or without UV, and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining. Endogenous pol· foci were detected by anti-pol· antibody, whereas UL36USP or -C40A were labeled using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Images were taken by Zeiss 710 confocal microscope. Cells with more than 10 pol· focus were considered positive, and the percentage of pol· foci-positive cells were counted, respectively, in three groups and then normalized to the empty vector group. This experiment was conducted three times and around 1000 cells for each group were counted and processed by using Bitplane Imaris software. Notice that due to low transfection efficiency in HeLa cells, only cells expressing UL36USP or -C40A (labeled green) were counted in each group (Fig. 3A). As expected, UL36USP decreased both the number of pol· foci and percentage of pol· foci-positive cells induced by DNA-damage stimuli. However, catalytically inactive UL36C40A expressing cells exhibited an equivalent percentage of pol· foci-positive cells to that of control (Fig. 3, A and B). The expression of UL36USP or UL36C40A in cells that used immunofluorescence were detected at the same time. Quantification of ubiquitinated PCNA were normalized relative to Lamin B. Consistent with the reduced pol· foci, a decreased ubiquitinated PCNA level was observed in UL36USP-expressing cells in comparison to the control or UL36C40A group (Fig. 3C). The relatively moderate deubiquitinating effect of UL36USP might be due to a restricted transfection efficiency in HeLa cells compared with that in HEK293T cells. These results indicate that UL36USP inhibits the TLS pathway via deubiquitinating PCNA and inhibiting pol· foci formation. Because UL36USP transient expression caused significant deubiquitination of PCNA (Fig. 1), we further explored the effect of viral infection-associated UL36USP on PCNA during HSV-1 virus infection. We infected HEK293T cells with wild-type or UL36C40A HSV-1 virus and then chromatin-associated PCNA was enriched in TIF after chromatin fractionation (Fig. 4A). The infection of the catalytically inactive UL36C40A mutant virus resulted in a significant increase of PCNA ubiquitination, suggesting activation of the TLS pathway. On the contrary, cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 virus exhibited an equivalent level of PCNA ubiquitination to that of the mock infection group. These data suggest that wild-type HSV-1 virus infection also induces a DNA-damage response, which is compromised by the deubiquitination activity of virus infection-associated UL36USP. Because the level of ICP8 in cells infected by wild-type virus is higher than that in cells with HSV-1 UL36C40A mutant virus infection (Fig. 4A), we therefore assumed that HSV-1 facilitates its own replication through the deubiquitination activity of UL36USP. To assess this prediction, we performed quantitative RT-PCR to examine the replication rate of wild-type and UL36C40A mutant virus by determination of the levels of two virus DNA marker genes, thymidine kinase (tk) and vp16. The levels of both tk (Fig. 4B) and vp16 (Fig. 4C) increased strikingly in cells infected with wild-type HSV-1 but moderately in the UL36C40A mutant virus-infected group, indicating a higher replication rate of wild-type virus than C40A virus. These results demonstrate that the deubiquitinating activity of UL36USP facilitates HSV-1 virus DNA replication during infection. When suffering from DNA damage, cells with an activated TLS pathway would survive better than those with a deficient TLS pathway (6Sale J.E. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of information about its antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the antimicrobial and genetic variability of different Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum field isolates. For this purpose, the growth inhibition effect of 18 antimicrobials and a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on five housekeeping genes (fusA, glpQ, gyrB, lepA and rpoB) were performed on 32 selected field isolates from Italy and Spain.The results showed a wide range of growth inhibitory effects for almost all the antimicrobials studied. Macrolides presented lower efficacy inhibiting Mcc growth than in previous works performed on other CA-causative mycoplasmas. Erythromycin was not able to inhibit the growth of any of the studied strains, contrary to doxycycline, which inhibited the growth of all of them from low concentrations. On the other hand, the study of the concatenated genes revealed a high genetic variability among the different Mcc isolates. Hence, these genetic variations were greater than the ones reported in prior works on other mycoplasma species."
https://openalex.org/W2603195095,"Monoclonal free light chain (LC) proteins are present in the circulation of patients with immunoproliferative disorders such as light chain (AL) amyloidosis and multiple myeloma (MM). Light chain-associated amyloid is a complex pathology composed of proteinaceous fibrils and extracellular matrix proteins found in all patients with AL and in ~10-30% of patients who presented with MM. Amyloid deposits systemically in multiple organs and tissues leading to dysfunction and ultimately death. The overall survival of patients with amyloidosis is worse than for those with early stage MM.We have developed a sensitive binding assay quantifying the recruitment of full length, patient-derived LC proteins by synthetic amyloid fibrils, as a method for studying their amyloidogenic potential. In a survey of eight urinary LC, both AL and MM-associated proteins were recruited by synthetic amyloid fibrils; however, AL-associated LC bound significantly more efficiently (p < 0.05) than did MM LCs. The LC proteins used in this study were isolated from urine and presumed to represent a surrogate of serum free light chains.The binding of LC to synthetic fibrils in this assay accurately differentiated LC with amyloidogenic propensity from MM LC that were not associated with clinical amyloid disease. Notably, the LC from a MM patient who subsequently developed amyloid behaved as an AL-associated protein in the assay, indicating the possibility for identifying MM patients at risk for developing amyloidosis based on the light chain recruitment efficacy. With this information, at risk patients can be monitored more closely for the development of amyloidosis, allowing timely administration of novel, amyloid-directed immunotherapies-this approach may improve the prognosis for these patients."

In this study, we have analyzed the thermal adaptation in two closely related respiratory pathogens Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica. Although B. pertussis represents a pathogen strictly adapted to the human body temperature, B. bronchiseptica causes infection in a broad range of animals and survives also outside of the host. We applied GC-MS to determine the fatty acids of both Bordetella species grown at different temperatures and analyzed the membrane fluidity by fluorescence anisotropy measurement. In parallel, we also monitored the effect of growth temperature changes on the expression and production of several virulence factors. In response to low temperatures, B. pertussis adapted its fatty acid composition and membrane fluidity to a considerably lesser extent when compared with B. bronchiseptica. Remarkably, B. pertussis maintained the production of virulence factors at 24 °C, whereas B. bronchiseptica cells resumed the production only upon temperature upshift to 37 °C. This growth temperature-associated differential modulation of virulence factor production was linked to the phosphorylation state of transcriptional regulator BvgA. The observed differences in low-temperature adaptation between B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica may result from selective adaptation of B. pertussis to the human host. We propose that the reduced plasticity of the B. pertussis membranes ensures sustained production of virulence factors at suboptimal temperatures and may play an important role in the transmission of the disease.

https://openalex.org/W2602066688,"The objective of this study was to develop an injectable in situ forming gel system based on Poloxamer for sustained release of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), thus achieved once or twice administration instead of frequent dosing during long-term treatment. The optimal formulation is 10 g APS, 18 g poloxamer 407, 2 g poloxamer 188, 0.15 g CMC-Na, 0.85 g sodium chloride in 100 ml gel in situ which had a preferable sol-gel transition temperature(T sol-gel) (34.1 ± 0.4°C), and good stability. In vitro release studies, all formulations containing polymer additives had prolonged release time and decreased initial burst to some extent. The optimal formulation containing 0.15% CMC-Na showed a best sustained release profile for about 132 h with the lowest initial burst in vitro about 16.30% in 12 h). In vivo, Male BALB/c mice (18-20 g) were administrated with APS in-situ gel just once, the values of immune organ indices, spleen lymphocyte proliferation, and serum IgM, IgG, IL-2 and IL-6 had significant increase, which was consistent with the mice given daily APS injections (7 times), while the above indices were increased more significantly in which administrated with APS in-situ gel twice. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the Poloxamer depot is a promising carrier for the sustained release of APS with an ideal release behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2601598528,"Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs) are innate-like T cells that play a pivotal role in the host defense against infectious diseases, and are also implicated in autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Recent studies have shown that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from MAITs selectively redifferentiate into MAITs without altering their antigen specificity. Such a selective differentiation is a prerequisite for the use of MAITs in cell therapy and/or regenerative medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we performed methylome and transcriptome analyses of MAITs during the course of differentiation from iPSCs. Our multi-omics analyses revealed that recombination-activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) and DNA nucleotidylexotransferase (DNTT) were highly methylated with their expression being repressed throughout differentiation. Since these genes are essential for V(D)J recombination of the T cell receptor (TCR) locus, this indicates that nascent MAITs are kept from further rearrangement that may alter their antigen specificity. Importantly, we found that the repression of RAGs was assured in two layers: one by the modulation of transcription factors for RAGs, and the other by DNA methylation at the RAG loci. Together, our study provides a possible explanation for the unaltered antigen specificity in the selective differentiation of MAITs from iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2601019632,"Background The most-used protease-inhibitor in children is Lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r), which provides durable suppression of viral load and increases CD4+T-counts. This study describes the virological outcome of the HIV-1-infected paediatric population exposed to LPV/r during 15 years in Spain. Methodology Patients from the Madrid Cohort of HIV-1-infected-children and adolescents exposed to LPV/r as different line therapy during 2000–2014 were selected. The baseline epidemiological-clinical features, viral suppression, changes in CD4+T-CD8+T cell counts and drug susceptibility were recorded before and during LPV/r exposure. Drug resistance mutations (DRM) were identified in viruses from samples collected until 2011. We predicted drug susceptibility to 19 antiretrovirals among those carrying DRM using the Stanford′s HIVdb Algorithm. Results A total of 199 (37.3%) of the 534 patients from the cohort were exposed to LPV/r during 2000–2014 in first (group 1), second (group 2) or more line-therapies (group 3). Patients were mainly Spaniards (81.9%), perinatally infected (96.5%) with subtype-B (65.3%) and HIV-diagnosed before year 2000 (67.8%). The mean age at first LPV/r exposure was 9.7 years. After protease-inhibitor exposure, viral suppression was higher in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3. Viral suppression occurred in 87.5%, 68.6% and 64.8% patients from groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Among the 64 patients with available resistance data during LPV/r treatment, 27(42.3%) carried DRM to protease-inhibitor, 28 (58.3%) to reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors and 21 (43.7%) to non-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors. Darunavir/ritonavir, atazanavir-ritonavir and tipranavir/ritonavir presented the highest susceptibility and nelfinavir the lowest. Conclusions A better lymphocyte recovering occurred when protease-inhibitor was taken as part of a first-line regimen and a higher number of patients reached viral suppression. The least compromised antiretrovirals for rescue antiretroviral regimens, according to DRM in the LPV/r-exposed-paediatric cohort, were mainly the new protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2599334786,"Filamin-mediated linkages between transmembrane receptors (TR) and the actin cytoskeleton are crucial for regulating many cytoskeleton-dependent cellular processes such as cell shape change and migration. A major TR binding site in the immunoglobulin repeat 21 (Ig21) of filamin is masked by the adjacent repeat Ig20, resulting in autoinhibition. The TR binding to this site triggers the relief of Ig20 and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-2152, thereby dynamically regulating the TR-actin linkages. A P2204L mutation in Ig20 reportedly cause frontometaphyseal dysplasia, a skeletal disorder with unknown pathogenesis. We show here that the P2204L mutation impairs a hydrophobic core of Ig20, generating a conformationally fluctuating molten globule-like state. Consequently, unlike in WT filamin, where PKA-mediated Ser-2152 phosphorylation is ligand-dependent, the P2204L mutant is readily accessible to PKA, promoting ligand-independent phosphorylation on Ser-2152. Strong TR peptide ligands from platelet GP1bα and G-protein-coupled receptor MAS effectively bound Ig21 by displacing Ig20 from autoinhibited WT filamin, but surprisingly, the capacity of these ligands to bind the P2204L mutant was much reduced despite the mutation-induced destabilization of the Ig20 structure that supposedly weakens the autoinhibition. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that compared with WT filamin, the conformationally fluctuating state of the Ig20 mutant makes Ig21 enthalpically favorable to bind ligand but with substantial entropic penalty, resulting in total higher free energy and reduced ligand affinity.

Overall, our results reveal an unusual structural and thermodynamic basis for the P2204L-induced dysfunction of filamin and frontometaphyseal dysplasia disease. Discovered four decades ago, filamin is widely known as an actin cross-linking protein (1Nakamura F. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. The filamins: organizers of cell structure and function.Cell Adh.

The 24th repeat links the 280-kDa monomers of filamin into a 560-kDa functional dimer. Two hinge regions susceptible to calpain cleavage are present between Ig repeats 15–16 and 23–24. The only major sequence variation among mammalian filamins is the presence of an 82-amino acid insert of unknown functional significance in filamin C at Ig20. Although filamins A and B are near ubiquitously expressed, filamin C expression is restricted to skeletal muscle (1Nakamura F. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H.

Mouse knockout of all three filamin isoforms is lethal, but the developmental deficiencies are distinct, indicating a significant degree of specialization in function (3Zhou A.X. Hartwig J.H.

Among the 24 repeats of vertebrate filamins, 7 repeats (4, 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 23) have a conserved “CD” groove in their immunoglobulin domain (Ig) that can accommodate an 11–13-residue-long amino acid segment of a binding partner protein (4Ithychanda S.S.

The intramolecular binding of the N-terminal residues of Ig20 to the ligand binding site on Ig21 creates autoinhibition that prevents Ig21 binding to external ligands (18Lad Y. Kiema T. Jiang P.

The binding of ligands relieves autoinhibition, generating a conformation compatible as a substrate for PKA-mediated phosphorylation (17Ithychanda S.S. Fang X. Mohan M.L. Zhu L. Tirupula K.C.

In other words, the competent substrate selects the kinase rather than the activated kinase binding a preferential substrate, a novel paradigm in biological signaling mechanisms. The intramolecular nature of autoinhibition means that ligands that bind Ig21 tightly can displace the Ig20 segment to potently promote phosphorylation at Ser-2152. In an analogous manner, cytoplasmic segments of many GPCRs are also very tight filamin-binding partners (19Tirupula K.C. Ithychanda S.S. Mohan M.L. Naga Prasad S.V. Qin J. Karnik S.S. G protein-coupled receptors directly bind filamin A with high affinity and promote filamin phosphorylation.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 6673-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These peptide ligands are predominantly part of a conserved intracellular helix in GPCRs that could accelerate PKA-mediated Ser-2152 phosphorylation in vitro. Consistent with this prediction, it was found that GPCR agonist stimulation enhances this Ser-2152 phosphorylation, implying a close physical contact between the GPCR and filamin (19Tirupula K.C.

Bioinformatics studies now predict that a majority of GPCRs have segments that potentially bind filamin, and such binding may play crucial role in GPCR signaling (19Tirupula K.C. Ithychanda S.S.

In this paper, using recombinant and purified filamin fragments, we undertook detailed structural and biochemical studies on a disease causing P2204L mutation (24Bertola D. Passos-Bueno M.R. Pereira A. Kim C. Morgan T. Robertson S.P.

Our analyses revealed an unusual structural and thermodynamic basis for the P2204L mutation with defects in autoinhibition, ligand binding, and Ser-2152 phosphorylation, thus providing crucial clues for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of FMD. Fig. 1A displays the crystal structure (18Lad Y. Kiema T. Jiang P. Pentikäinen O.T. Coles C.H. Campbell I.D. Calderwood D.A. Ylänne J. Structure of three tandem filamin domains reveals auto-inhibition of ligand binding.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3993-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) of filamin Ig19–21 (PDB 2J3S) containing the autoinhibitory unit Ig20–21, where the FMD disease mutation site Pro-2204 is located in a long loop of Ig20 far away from the autoinhibited interface yet buried in a hydrophobic core of the Ig20 domain involving Val-2153, Phe-2202, Phe-2228, and Val-2230. Molecular modeling indicates that although the mutation of Pro into Leu at 2204 maintains the hydrophobic feature, the long side chain of Leu would cause a minor steric clash with some of these hydrophobic residues including Phe-2202, Phe-2228, Val-2230, and also a polar residue His-2210 (Fig. 1B), thus potentially perturbing the local folding of the protein. To evaluate this prediction, we made the minimal double domain construct Ig20–21, that has no ligand binding interference with the neighboring Ig19 or Ig23. First, we compared the gel-filtration elution profiles of the purified Ig20–21 WT with that of the disease-causing mutant P2204L under identical conditions using a Superdex75 size exclusion column. As shown in Fig. 2A, the mutant eluted as a single peak, 2.7 ml, ahead of the WT, indicating a greater radius with somewhat more elongated shape. The single peak at 81 ml demonstrates that the mutant is clearly not in an aggregated form but is structurally perturbed. To gain further insight into the folding property of the mutant, we subjected the 15N-labeled WT and mutant Ig20–21 to an NMR-based HSQC experiment (Fig. 2B). The WT Ig20–21 (in black, Fig. 2B) is well folded given the widely dispersed uniform backbone amide peaks in the spectrum. However, under identical conditions the amide peaks of the mutant P2204L are substantially broadened. A few highly downfield-shifted weak signals (>9 ppm) were observed in positions corresponding to folded WT Ig20–21 (Fig. 2B), yet the line-broadened spectrum is clearly incompatible with a single folded protein like the WT. The mutant is not in a denatured state as its spectrum did not collapse into a narrow 8–9-ppm region on the 1H axis with characteristic overlapping sharp peaks. Rather, the line-broadened spectrum and somewhat more voluminous shape (based on Fig. 2, A and B) are consistent with a conformationally fluctuating partially folded intermediate or a molten globule. Despite the mutation being in Ig20, Ig21 is affected as exemplified by the significant shift of W2262 side chain amide, suggesting that the mutated Ig20 still engages with Ig21 but in a different fashion. Perturbed intrinsic fluorescence of a protein dominated by tryptophan residues is another measure of the folded state of the protein (32Eftink M.R. The use of fluorescence methods to monitor unfolding transitions in proteins.Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 33Royer C.A.

Sci. 2014; 15: 22518-22538Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The Ig20–21 construct has a single tryptophan residue at position 2262, and we recorded the fluorescence emission spectra by exciting the tryptophan at 278 nm, the absorption maximum for both the WT and the P2204L mutant at 5 μm protein concentration in buffer conditions identical to that used for gel filtration and HSQC-NMR above. The emission intensity for the mutant was significantly higher, and the emission maximum (λmax) was red-shifted to 340 nm from 335 nm in the WT (Fig. 2C). This tryptophan is located in Ig21 and is >20 Å from the P2204L mutation site. This result provides strong evidence that the mutant has undergone a substantial global structural transition as opposed to a local change around the site of the mutation. To rule out the contribution of phenylalanine and tyrosine residues to the emission spectra, we recorded the fluorescence emission by exciting the protein at 295 nm, and this experiment too resulted in similar red shifted emission for the P2204L mutant (supplemental Fig. S1), furthering the notion of a molten globule. To further gain insight into the altered folding state of the mutant, we performed 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) binding experiment. The enhanced fluorescence from ANS binding to protein is a widely used sensitive marker for differentiating molten globule from folded/unfolded states of proteins (35Kim K.H. Yun S. Mok K.H. Lee E.K. Thermodynamic analysis of ANS binding to partially unfolded α-lactalbumin: correlation of endothermic to exothermic changeover with formation of authentic molten globules.J. Mol.

Res. 2008; 25: 1487-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). ANS does not bind appreciably to native or totally unfolded proteins but binds well to partially folded/molten globule state with hydrophobic patches exposed (35Kim K.H. Yun S. Mok K.H. Lee E.K. Thermodynamic analysis of ANS binding to partially unfolded α-lactalbumin: correlation of endothermic to exothermic changeover with formation of authentic molten globules.J. Mol.

Res. 2008; 25: 1487-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). We probed ANS binding to Ig20–21 WT and the P2204L mutant using excitation at 380 nm and recording the emission from 400–600 nm using a 50 molar excess of ANS (5 μm protein and 250 μm ANS). Fluorescence enhancement was minimal in the WT when compared with the ANS only buffer control (Fig. 2D). The mutant though had much higher fluorescent intensity, and the emission max was blue-shifted to 502 nm (Fig. 2D). This feature is consistent with a molten globule state as documented previously (35Kim K.H. Yun S. Mok K.H. Lee E.K. Thermodynamic analysis of ANS binding to partially unfolded α-lactalbumin: correlation of endothermic to exothermic changeover with formation of authentic molten globules.J. Mol. Recognit. 2016; 29: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Note that control ANS experiments in denaturant, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, leads to a loss of these emergent fluorescent features leading to uniform spectral outputs (supplemental Fig. 2). Overall, all the four above experiments, size exclusion, HSQC-NMR, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and extrinsic ANS fluorescence, together provide strong evidence that the mutant P2204L Ig20–21 is likely a molten globule. Because previous studies showed that ligand binding to Ig21 relieves Ig20 causing a global conformational change and enhanced PKA-mediated phosphorylation on Ig20 Ser-2152 (17Ithychanda S.S. Fang X.

Chem. 2015; 290: 8527-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we first wondered how the P2204L-induced destabilization of Ig20 would impact on the Ser-2152 phosphorylation. As done previously (17Ithychanda S.S. Fang X. Mohan M.L. Zhu L. Tirupula K.C. Naga Prasad S.V. Wang Y.X. Karnik S.S. Qin J. A mechanism of global shape-dependent recognition and phosphorylation of filamin by protein kinase A.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 8527-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we used the dimeric Ig16–24 construct encompassing the entire rod 2 domain of filamin A to test the phosphorylation effect. Interestingly, unlike WT, which had minimal phosphorylation without ligand binding due to the autoinhibited conformation, the mutant Ig16–24 was readily phosphorylated in the absence of ligand (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 7–9). As demonstrated earlier (19Tirupula K.C. Ithychanda S.S. Mohan M.L. Naga Prasad S.V. Qin J. Karnik S.S. G protein-coupled receptors directly bind filamin A with high affinity and promote filamin phosphorylation.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 6673-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the tight binding MAS GPCR peptide enhanced Ser-2152 phosphorylation of Ig 16–24 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1–3 with lanes 4–6), but the MAS peptide led to saturation of phosphorylation at a much earlier time point in the P2204L mutant (Fig. 3, compare P2204L lanes 10–12 with lanes 1–9).

MT purified from the bacterial suspension showed one polypeptide with a molecular weight of 7 kDa by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE). Western-blotting confirmed the polypeptides had a specific reactivity with mouse polyclonal MT anti-serum. Based on the purified MT and MT anti-serum, the reaction parameters for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed. The direct coating ELISA showed a higher linear relationship compared to antibody sandwich coating ELISA. The optimal dilution rates of purified MT anti-serum and coating period were shown to be 1:160,000 and 12 hours at 4°C. At 37°C, the appropriate reaction duration of the first antibody and the second antibody were 2 hours and 1 hour, respectively. According to these optimal parameters, the standard linear equation, y = 0.0032x + 0.1769 (R2 = 0.9779, x, y representing MT concentration and OD450 value), was established for the determination of MT concentration with a valid range of 3.9-500 ng/ml. In verification experiments, the mean coefficients of variation of the intra-assay and inter-assay were 3.260% and 3.736%, respectively. According to the result of MT recovery, ELISA with an approaching 100% MT recovery was more reliable and sensitive than the Cd saturation assay. In conclusion, the newly developed ELISA of this study was precise, stable and repeatable, and could be used as a biomarker tool to monitor pollution by heavy metals."
https://openalex.org/W2601436811,"Here we report the use of a fluorescein-tagged peroxisomal targeting sequence peptide (F-PTS1, acetyl-C{K(FITC)}GGAKL) for investigating pH regulation of glycosomes in live procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei. When added to cells, this fluorescent peptide is internalized within vesicular structures, including glycosomes, and can be visualized after 30–60 min. Using F-PTS1 we are able to observe the pH conditions inside glycosomes in response to starvation conditions. Previous studies have shown that in the absence of glucose, the glycosome exhibits mild acidification from pH 7.4 ± 0.2 to 6.8 ± 0.2. Our results suggest that this response occurs under proline starvation as well. This pH regulation is found to be independent from cytosolic pH and requires a source of Na+ ions. Glycosomes were also observed to be more resistant to external pH changes than the cytosol; placement of cells in acidic buffers (pH 5) reduced the pH of the cytosol by 0.8 ± 0.1 pH units, whereas glycosomal pH decreases by 0.5 ± 0.1 pH units. This observation suggests that regulation of glycosomal pH is different and independent from cytosolic pH regulation. Furthermore, pH regulation is likely to work by an active process, because cells depleted of ATP with 2-deoxyglucose and sodium azide were unable to properly regulate pH. Finally, inhibitor studies with bafilomycin and EIPA suggest that both V-ATPases and Na+/H+ exchangers are required for glycosomal pH regulation."

A control group with a suburethral tape without division was established in a 1:2 ratio and matched for age, tape used and year of tape insertion. Patients completed the Kings´ Health Questionnaire (KHQ), Incontinence Outcome Questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Index Questionnaire and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement score.Tape division or excision was performed in 32 women. Overall, 15 (60%) of 25 women who were alive were available for clinical examination and completed the questionnaires. Tape division was performed for voiding dysfunction (n = 7), overactive bladder (n = 2), mesh extrusion (n = 3) and ongoing pain (n = 3). Median time to tape division/excision was 10 months. Three women in the tape division group had undergone reoperation for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). At a median follow-up of 11 years (IQR 9-13) subjective SUI rate was 53% (8/15 women) in the tape division group and 17% (5/30) in the control group (p = 0.016), with no significant differences in objective SUI rates between groups. With regard to quality of life, the study group had significantly worse scores in the SUI related domains role limitation, physical limitation, severity measures and social limitations (KHQ) compared to the control group.Women needing tape division or excision have lower SUI related QoL scores compared to controls mostly because of higher subjective SUI rates."
https://openalex.org/W2603601669,"Background & Aims Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) submitted to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have a variable 5-year survival rate limited mostly by tumor recurrence. The etiology, age, sex, alcohol, Child-Pugh, and the immunesuppressor have been associated with tumour recurrence. The expression of ΔNp73 is related to the reduced survival of patients with HCC. The study evaluated the expression of p63 and p73 isoforms and cell death receptors, and their relation to tumour recurrence and survival. The results were in vitro validated in HCC cell lines. Methods HCC sections from patients submitted to OLT were used. The in vitro study was done in differentiated hepatitis B virus (HBV)-expressing Hep3B and control HepG2 cells. The expression of cell death receptors and cFLIPS/L, caspase-8 and -3 activities, and cell proliferation were determined in control and p63 and p73 overexpressing HCC cells. Results The reduced tumor expression of cell death receptors and TAp63 and TAp73, and increased ΔNp63 and ΔNp73 expression were associated with tumor recurrence and reduced survival. The in vitro study demonstrated that HBV-expressing Hep3B vs HepG2 cells showed reduced expression of p63 and p73, cell death receptors and caspase activation, and increased cFLIPL/cFLIPS ratio. The overexpression of TAp63 and TAp73 exerted a more potent pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in Hep3B than HepG2-transfected cells which was related to cFLIPL upregulation. Conclusions The reduction of TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms, rather than alteration of ΔN isoform expression, exerted a significant functional repercussion on cell death and proliferation in HBV-expressing HepB cells."
https://openalex.org/W2603828536,"In normal-hearing listeners, rippled-spectrum discrimination was psychophysically investigated in both silence and with a simultaneous masker background using the following two paradigms: measuring the ripple density resolution with the phase-reversal test and measuring the ripple-shift threshold with the ripple-shift test. The 0.5-oct wide signal was centered on 2 kHz, the signal levels were 50 and 80 dB SPL, and the masker levels varied from 30 to 100 dB SPL. The baseline ripple density resolutions were 8.7 oct-1 and 8.6 oct-1 for the 50-dB and 80-dB signals, respectively. The baseline ripple shift thresholds were 0.015 oct and 0.018 oct for the 50-dB and 80-dB signals, respectively. The maskers were 0.5-oct noises centered on 2 kHz (on-frequency) or 0.75 to 1.25 oct below the signal (off-frequency maskers). The effects of the maskers were as follows: (i) both on- and low-frequency maskers reduced the ripple density resolution and increased the ripple shift thresholds, (ii) the masker levels at threshold (the ripple density resolution decrease down to 3 oct–1 or ripple shift threshold increased up to 0.1 oct) increased with increasing frequency spacing between the signal and masker, (iii) the masker levels at threshold were higher for the 80-dB signal than for the 50-dB signal, and (iv) the difference between the masker levels at threshold for the 50-dB and 80-dB signals decreased with increasing frequency spacing between the masker and signal. Within the 30-dB (from 50 to 80 dB SPL) signal level, the growth of the masker level at threshold was 27.8 dB for the on-frequency masker and 9 dB for the low-frequency masker. It is assumed that the difference between the on- and low-frequency masking of the rippled-spectrum discrimination reflects the cochlear compressive non-linearity. With this assumption, the compression was 0.3 dB/dB."
