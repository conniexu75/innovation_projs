https://openalex.org/W2027569621,"The DNA binding subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, p50, has been cloned. p50 appears to be synthesized as a larger protein that is then processed to its functional size. Sequence analysis reveals remarkable homology for over 300 amino acids at the amino-terminal end to the oncogene v-rel, its cellular homolog c-rel, and the Drosophila maternal effect gene dorsal. This establishes NF-kappa B as a member of the rel family of proteins, all of which display nuclear-cytosolic translocation. Protein sequence from the p65 polypeptide has established that it is not encoded in the same mRNA as p50. However, p65 appears homologous to c-rel, suggesting that c-rel may form heterodimers with p50 and rel may include a homodimerization motif."
https://openalex.org/W2085021338,"Pelham previously proposed that the hsp70 family of heat shock proteins could prevent the formation and/or allow the dissolution of protein aggregates created during stress conditions. We confirmed this hypothesis by showing that the E. coli hsp70 homolog, the dnaK gene product, protects the host RNA polymerase enzyme from heat inactivation in an ATP-independent reaction. In addition, we show that heat-inactivated and aggregated RNA polymerase is both disaggregated and reactivated following simultaneous incubation with DnaK protein and hydrolyzable ATP. The DnaK756 mutant protein has lost the ability to disaggregate the inactivated RNA polymerase enzyme. Our results demonstrate that the DnaK protein contributes to E. coli's growth not only by protecting some enzymes from denaturation but also by reactivating some once they are misfolded or aggregated."
https://openalex.org/W2053413122,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization makes possible direct visualization of single sequences not only on chromosomes, but within decondensed interphase nuclei, providing a potentially powerful approach for high-resolution (1 Mb and below) gene mapping and the analysis of nuclear organization. Interphase mapping was able to extend the ability to resolve and order sequences up to two orders of magnitude beyond localization on banded or unbanded chromosomes. Sequences within the human dystrophin gene separated by <100 kb to 1 Mb were visually resolved at interphase by means of standard microscopy. In contrast, distances in the 1-Mb range could not be ordered on the metaphase chromosome length. Analysis of sequences 100 kb to 1 Mb apart indicates a strong correlation between interphase distance and linear DNA distance, which could facilitate a variety of gene-mapping efforts. Results estimate chromatin condensation up to 1 Mb and indicate a comparable condensation for different cell types prepared by different techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1538199768,"Bacterial endotoxin-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rapidly induced hepatic metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels in the LPS-sensitive CD-1 strain of mice. This LPS effect was severely attenuated in the LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ strain of mice, but could be mimicked by injection of human recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) or human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). In the CD-1 strain, LPS induction of MT gene expression occurred in each of 10 organs examined (liver, kidney, pancreas, intestine, lung, heart, brain, ovary, uterus, and spleen). Solution hybridization with probes specific for MT-I or MT-II mRNA established that these genes were co-induced in each of the organs and that the liver and kidney contained the highest absolute levels of these mRNAs, whereas in the intestine and spleen they were 10-20-fold lower. LPS and cytokine induction of hepatic MT gene expression occurred in hypophysectomized mice, which suggests a lack of significant involvement of glucocorticoids. Several recombinant cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as well as poly(rI.rC) were effective inducers of hepatic MT-I and MT-II genes. As an attempt to determine which of these cytokines may mediate LPS effects on MT gene expression in vivo, CD-1 mice were injected with LPS or various cytokines, and RNA from liver, ovary, and uterus was extracted at various times postinjection and analyzed by Northern blotting using probes specific for IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MT mRNA. In each organ examined, LPS, IL-1 alpha, or IL-1 beta injection caused a rapid, coordinate, transient increase in the levels of each of the cytokine mRNAs which peaked by 1 h and declined to low levels by 4 h. In contrast, levels of MT mRNA did not reach a peak until 4-6 h postinjection. TNF-alpha had minimal effects on expression of cytokine and MT genes in organs other than liver. IL-6 had no effect on hepatic cytokine mRNA levels, and induced MT mRNA only in the liver which suggests a direct effect of IL-6 on hepatic MT gene expression. These data suggest that the acute effects of LPS on MT gene expression may include complex paracrine interactions between a variety of cytokines and the cells expressing MT genes in each organ, and tissue-specific cytokine effects on the MT genes."
https://openalex.org/W3118895760,"Farnesylation of Ras occurs in vivo on a Cys residue in the C-terminal sequence -Cys-Val-Leu-Ser (termed a CAAX box). This modification is required for Ras membrane localization and cell transforming activity. Using [3H]farnesyl-PPi as precursor and Escherichia coli-expressed Ras, forms of Ras having the CAAX sequence were radiolabeled upon incubation with the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain. Forms of Ras having a deletion of the CAAX sequence or a Cys to Ser substitution in this sequence were not substrates. Radioactivity incorporated into Ras by bovine brain cytosol was released by treatment with iodomethane but not with methanolic KOH indicating a thioether linkage. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the cleavage products on a C-18 column showed a major peak of radioactivity that co-eluted with a farnesol standard. The enzyme responsible for Ras farnesylation in bovine brain was approximately 190 kDa as estimated by gel filtration and required a divalent cation for activity. Nonradioactive farnesyl-PPi, geranylgeranyl-PPi, and Ras peptides having the C-terminal sequence -Cys-Val-Leu-Ser competed in the assay with IC50 values of 0.7, 1.4, and 1-3 microM, respectively. Farnesol and Ras peptides having the sequence -Ser-Val-Leu-Ser were not inhibitory. These results identify a farnesyl-protein transferase activity that may be responsible for the polyisoprenylation of Ras in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1982084965,"The yeast mer1 mutant produces inviable spores and is defective in both meiotic recombination and chromosome pairing. A gene called MER2 partially suppresses the mer1 phenotype when present in high copy number. Both gene conversion and chromosome pairing are completely restored in mer1 strains overexpressing MER2; however, reciprocal crossing over and spore viability are not restored. The data presented are consistent with a model in which chromosome pairing is a direct consequence of a homology search mediated through gene conversion. Analysis of random viable spores indicates that the crossovers that occur in mer1 strains overexpressing MER2 are more effective in ensuring meiosis I disjunction than those that occur in mer1 strains. One interpretation of this result is that only those crossovers that occur in the context of the synaptonemal complex lead to the establishment of functional chiasmata. The MER2 gene product is essential for meiosis."

https://openalex.org/W1563493034,"Abstract The substrate specificity of the protease which generates mature human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) from pro-interleukin-1 beta was investigated using synthetic peptide substrates and recombinant pro-IL-1 beta. The requirement of an L-aspartate in the P-1 position was confirmed together with the need for a small hydrophobic residue in the P-1' position (Gly or Ala). It was shown that the enzyme can tolerate conservative substitutions in the P-2 and P-2' positions. We found little difference in the enzyme's ability to cleave denatured and native pro-IL-1 beta, indicating that tertiary structure recognition is not involved in binding. The enzyme did, however, require a peptide of more than six amino acids for cleavage to occur. These results conclusively demonstrate the unusual specificity of this protease."
https://openalex.org/W1490480074,"The existence of an intracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) involved in the production of 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and free arachidonic acid has been repeatedly postulated. Using 1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as a substrate and a series of conventional and high-pressure liquid chromatographic techniques, we have purified a PLA2 from the soluble fraction of differentiated human monocytic U937 cells. The enzyme has been purified nearly 2000-fold to homogeneity. The purified enzyme has a molecular mass of 56 kDa, under reducing conditions, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The enzyme activity has a pH optimum of 8.0 and is calcium concentration-dependent. The EC50 for the activation of the enzyme activity by calcium is 300 nM. When the cells were homogenized in the presence of the calcium chelator EGTA (0.2 mM), the enzyme was found to be soluble (more than 90% of the activity in the 100,000 x g supernatant). However, when Ca2+ concentration was controlled from 10 nM to 100 microM in Ca2(+)-EGTA buffers, increasing amounts of the activity were found in the particulate fraction (100,000 x g pellet). This suggests that membrane translocation and activation of the soluble PLA2 may be regulated by physiological intracellular levels of Ca2+. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed different phosphatidylcholine substrates presented in either vesicular or Triton X-100 mix micellar forms. In both situations, the enzyme showed a high degree of specificity for arachidonic acid on the sn-2 position of the substrate. Substitution of palmitic or oleic on the sn-2 position substantially reduced the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme. When vesicles of arachidonic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol were presented to the purified enzyme, all of them were hydrolyzed with comparable efficiency. However, only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol were hydrolyzed when presented in Triton X-100 mixed micelles."
https://openalex.org/W1965010154,"The transcription factor C/EBP uses a bipartite structural motif to bind DNA. Two protein chains dimerize through a set of amphipathic alpha helices termed the leucine zipper. Highly basic polypeptide regions emerge from the zipper to form a linked set of DNA contact surfaces. In the recently proposed a ""scissors grip"" model, the paired set of basic regions begin DNA contact at a central point and track in opposite directions along the major groove, forming a molecular clamp around DNA. This model predicts that C/EBP must undertake significant changes in protein conformation as it binds and releases DNA. The basic region of ligand-free C/EBP is highly sensitive to protease digestion. Pronounced resistance to proteolysis occurred when C/EBP associated with its specific DNA substrate. Sequencing of discrete proteolytic fragments showed that prominent sites for proteolysis occur at two junction points predicted by the ""scissors grip"" model. One junction corresponds to the cleft where the basic regions emerge from the leucine zipper. The other corresponds to a localized nonhelical segment that has been hypothesized to contain an N-cap and facilitate the sharp angulation necessary for the basic region to track continuously in the major groove of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1604936501,"In previous studies we described enzyme(s) from Escherichia coli that transfer two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) residues from two CMP-KDO molecules to a tetraacyldisaccharide-1,4'-bis-phosphate precursor of lipid A, termed lipid IVA (Brozek, K. A., Hosaka, K., Robertson, A. D., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6956-6966). The product, designated (KDO)2-IVA, can be prepared in milligram quantities and/or radiolabeled with 32P at position 4' of the IVA moiety. We now demonstrate the presence of enzymes in E. coli extracts that transfer laurate and/or myristate residues from lauroyl or myristoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to (KDO)2-IVA. Thioesters of coenzyme A are not substrates. The cytosolic fraction catalyzes rapid acylation with lauroyl-ACP, but not with myristoyl, R-3-hydroxymyristoyl, palmitoyl, or palmitoleoyl-ACP. The membrane fraction transfers both laurate and myristate to (KDO)2-IVA. Evidence for the enzymatic acylation of (KDO)2-IVA is provided by (a) conversion of [4'-32P](KDO)2-IVA to more rapidly migrating products in the presence of the appropriate acyl-ACP, (b) incorporation of [1-14C]laurate or [1-14C]myristate into these metabolites in the presence of (KDO)2-IVA, (c) fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and (d) 1H NMR spectroscopy. At protein concentrations less than 0.5 mg/ml, the acylation of (KDO)2-IVA by the cytoplasmic fraction is absolutely dependent upon the addition of exogenous acyl-ACP. These acyltransferases cannot utilize lipid IVA as a substrate, demonstrating that they possess novel KDO recognition domains. The unusual substrate specificity of these enzymes provides compelling evidence for their involvement in lipid A biosynthesis. Depending on the conditions it is possible to acylate (KDO)2-IVA with 1 or 2 lauroyl residues, with 1 or 2 myristoyl residues, or with 1 of each."
https://openalex.org/W1499808375,"Highly purified, recombinant preparations of the virally encoded proteases from human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) 1 and 2 have been compared relative to 1) their specificities toward non-viral protein and synthetic peptide substrates, and 2) their inhibition by several P1-P1' pseudodipeptidyl-modified substrate analogs. Hydrolysis of the Leu-Leu and Leu-Ala bonds in the Pseudomonas exotoxin derivative, Lys-PE40, is qualitatively the same for HIV-2 protease as published earlier for the HIV-1 enzyme (Tomasselli, A. G., Hui, J. O., Sawyer, T. K., Staples, D. J., FitzGerald, D. J., Chaudhary, V. K., Pastan, I., and Heinrikson, R. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 408-413). However, the rates of cleavage at these two sites are reversed for the HIV-2 protease which prefers the Leu-Ala bond. The kinetics of hydrolysis of this protein substrate by both enzymes are mirrored by those obtained from cleavage of model peptides. Hydrolysis by the two proteases of other synthetic peptides modeled after processing sites in HIV-1 and HIV-2 gag polyproteins and selected analogs thereof demonstrated differences, as well as similarities, in selectivity. For example, while the two proteases were nearly identical in their rates of cleavage of the Tyr-Pro bond in the HIV-1 gag fragment, Val-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val, the HIV-1 protease showed a 64-fold enhancement over the HIV-2 enzyme in hydrolysis of a Tyr-Val bond in the same template. Accordingly, the HIV-2 protease appears to have a different specificity than the HIV-1 enzyme; it is better able to hydrolyze substrates with small amino acids in P1 and P1', but is variable in its rate of hydrolysis of peptides with bulky substituents in these positions. In addition to these comparisons of the two proteases with respect to substrate specificity, we present inhibitor structure-activity data for the HIV-2 protease. Relative to P1-P1' statine or Phe psi [CH2N]Pro-modified pseudopeptidyl inhibitors, compounds having Xaa psi[CH(OH)CH2]Yaa inserts were found to show significantly higher affinities to both enzymes, generally binding from 10 to 100 times stronger to HIV-1 protease than to the HIV-2 enzyme. Molecular modeling comparisons based upon the sequence homology of the two enzymes and x-ray crystal structures of HIV-1 protease suggest that most of the nonconservative amino acid replacements occur in regions well outside the catalytic cleft, while only subtle structural differences exist within the active site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1599269403,"Two forms of the 32 kDa-D1 reaction center protein of photosystem II (PSII), having slightly different mobilities on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, have been resolved in Spirodela oligorrhiza, Glycine max L., Gossypium hirsutum L., Triticum aestivum L., and Zea mays L. The protein band with faster mobility is identified as the 32 kDa-D1 protein, and the less mobile band as a novel form, designated 32*. The two forms are structurally similar based on immunological and partial proteolytic tests. 32* is associated exclusively with the grana and is present in the PSII reaction center. Temporally, 32* appears several hours after the translocation of newly synthesized and processed 32 kDa-D1 protein from the stroma lamellae to the grana. Formation of the 32* is strictly light-dependent under physiological light intensities and correlates with a reciprocal loss of the 32-kDa form. Light induced formation of 32* is inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea but is not coupled to linear electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W1492157617,"In this study we examined the effects of insulin on protein kinase C (PKC) activity in cultured fetal chick neurons. PKC activity, measured as 32P incorporation into histone H1 in the presence of calcium (500 microM), phosphatidylserine (100 micrograms/ml), and diolein (3.3 micrograms/ml) minus the incorporation in the presence of calcium alone, was detected in neuronal cytosolic (207 +/- 33 pmol/min/mg) and membrane (33 +/- 8 pmol/min/mg) fractions. Insulin added to intact neurons increased the activity of PKC in both cytosolic and membrane fractions by about 40%. Neurons preincubated with cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) 30 min prior to insulin treatment showed the same degree of stimulation of PKC activity by insulin. The activation of PKC was maximal within 5-10 min of insulin exposure and was sustained for at least 60 min. Insulin stimulated PKC in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal response obtained at 100 ng/ml. Addition of phosphatidylserine and diolein to neuronal cell extracts resulted in the phosphorylation of four major cytosolic proteins (70, 57, 18, and 16 kDa) and one major membrane protein (75 kDa). Phosphorylation of all five proteins was increased 2-fold in extracts from insulin-treated neurons. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts using antibodies against PKC-alpha, PKC-beta, PKC-gamma, PKC-delta, and PKC-epsilon revealed that cultured fetal chick neurons contained only one of these PKC isoforms, the epsilon-isoform. The enzyme was mostly cytosolic. Insulin had no effect on either the amount of distribution of PKC-epsilon in cultured neurons but induced a small change in the mobility of PKC-epsilon on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. When assay conditions were designed to measure specifically the activity of PKC-epsilon, using a synthetic peptide substrate in the absence of calcium, activity was 50 +/- 12% higher in insulin-treated cells (p less than 0.005). PKC activity in control and insulin treated-neurons was almost completely inhibited when assays included a peptide identical to the pseudo-substrate binding site of PKC-epsilon. We conclude that PKC-epsilon is the major PKC isoform present in cultured fetal chick neurons. Insulin stimulates PKC-epsilon activity by a mechanism that does not involve translocation of the enzyme from cytosol to membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1509081656,"In this study we have reconstituted transactivation of gene expression by the human glucocorticoid receptor in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have expressed the C-terminal half of the human glucocorticoid receptor (residues 415-777), the smallest derivative that can be expected to function as a ligand-dependent activator of transcription, in yeast cells. The function of the expressed protein has been assayed using a reporter gene consisting of the beta-galactosidase gene from Escherichia coli fused to the yeast iso-1-cytochrome c promoter with a glucocorticoid-responsive element from the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene upstream. Transactivation of expression from the reporter gene by the expressed receptor is seen only in the presence of steroid hormones with glucocorticoid activity and occurs via specific interaction of receptor with the glucocorticoid-responsive element upstream of the reporter gene. This result is different from those obtained for the estrogen receptor in which a similar derivative was not functional in yeast. This suggests that the well documented conservation of structure and function between steroid receptors may not extend to the transactivation domains. Our results also suggest that the mechanism by which receptors are sequestered in an inactive, non-DNA binding state in the absence of ligand may be functionally conserved in yeast. In support of this we show evidence that the expressed receptor is associated with the yeast molecular weight 90,000 heat shock protein as seen in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1563562578,"The hamster islet B cell line HIT retains the ability to secret insulin in response to glucose and several receptor agonists. We used HIT cells to study the initial signaling events in glucose or receptor agonist-stimulated insulin secretion. Glucose stimulated insulin release from HIT cells in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal effect seen already at 1 mM. Insulin release was also stimulated by carbachol in a glucose-dependent manner. Glucose depolarized the HIT cell membrane potential as assessed with the fluorescent probe bisoxonol and raised intracellular Ca2+ as revealed by fura-2 measurements. Using a Mn2+ fura-2 quenching technique, we could show that the rise in intracellular Ca2+ was due to Ca2+ influx following opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Glucose is thought to increase the diacylglycerol (DAG) content of insulin-secreting cells. However, although HIT cells respond to glucose in terms of insulin secretion, membrane depolarization, and Ca2+ rise, the hexose was unable to increase the proportion of protein kinase C activity associated with membranes. In contrast, the membrane-associated protein kinase C activity increased in HIT cells exposed to the two receptor agonists carbachol and bombesin. Bombesin was shown to generate DAG with the expected fatty acid composition of activators of phospholipase C. Glucose, in contrast, only caused minor increases in DAG containing myristic and palmitic acid without affecting total DAG mass. The failure to detect stimulation of protein kinase C by glucose could be due to both the limited amount and to the different fatty acid composition of the metabolically generated DAG. The latter was in part supported by experiments performed on protein kinase C partially purified from HIT cells. Indeed, 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, presumed to be the main DAG species generated by glucose, was only one-third as active as 1,2-dioleoylglycerol and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonylglycerol in stimulating the isolated enzyme at physiological Ca2+ concentration. It is therefore unlikely that DAG and protein kinase C play a major role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1485797794,"We have shown previously that the outer layers of yeast ascospore walls contain dityrosine and that this amino acid is a major component of the cross-linked peptides present in the spore wall (Briza, P., Winkler, G., Kalchhauser, H., and Breitenbach, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4288-4294). We now present evidence that dityrosine is located in the outermost layer and that it is in the DL-configuration. Although the proteins (peptides) of the spore wall are insoluble, the macromolecule containing dityrosine can be solubilized by partial acid hydrolysis of spore walls. Analysis of this macromolecule indicates that it contains more than 50 mol% dityrosine and a very limited number of other amino acids. Interestingly, part of the dityrosine of spore walls is present in the DL-configuration. We speculate that not only the high degree of cross-links in the outermost layer but also the D-configuration of part of the alpha-C-atoms of dityrosine could contribute to the spores' resistance to lytic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1524678095,"Abstract Each R2 subunit of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase contains a pair of high spin ferric ions and a tyrosyl free radical essential for activity. To study the mechanism of tyrosyl radical formation, substoichiometric amounts of Fe(II) were added to recombinant mouse R2 apoprotein under strictly anaerobic conditions and then the solution was exposed to air. Low temperature EPR spectroscopy showed that the signal from the generated tyrosyl free radical correlated well with the quantity of the Fe(II) added with a stoichiometry of 3 Fe(II) needed to produce 1 tyrosyl radical: 3 Fe(II) + P + O2 + Tyr-OH + H+----Fe(III)O2-Fe(III)-P + H2O. + Tyr-O. + Fe(III), where P is an iron-binding site of protein R2 and Tyr-OH is the active tyrosyl residue. The O-O bond of a postulated intermediate O2(2-)-Fe(III)2-P state is cleaved by the extra electron provided by Fe(II) leading to formation of OH., which in turn reacts with Tyr-OH to give Tyr-O.. In the presence of ascorbate, added to reduce the monomeric Fe(III) formed, 80% of the Fe(II) added produced a radical. The results strongly indicate that each dimeric Fe(III) center during its formation can generate a tyrosyl-free radical and that iron binding to R2 apoprotein is highly cooperative."
https://openalex.org/W1532738146,"The initial step in the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins involves the activation of ubiquitin by ubiquitin activating enzyme, E1. Previously, we purified and characterized multiple species of E1 from wheat germ. We now describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding E1 from wheat. This clone (UBA1) was isolated from a cDNA expression library with anti-wheat E1 antibodies. It contained an open reading frame coding for 1051 amino acids and directed the synthesis of a protein that comigrated with a wheat germ E1 of 117 kDa. UBA1 was confirmed as encoding E1 by (i) comparison of the peptide map of the protein product of UBA1 synthesized in Escherichia coli with that of purified E1 from wheat, and (ii) amino acid sequence identity of peptides generated from purified E1 with regions of the derived amino acid sequence of UBA1. The isolation of two additional cDNAs closely related to UBA1 indicated that E1 was encoded by a small gene family in wheat. Nonetheless, a single poly(A+) mRNA size class of 4 kilobases hybridized with UBA1. When expressed in E. coli, the product of UBA1 catalyzed the formation of a thiol ester linkage between ubiquitin and an ubiquitin carrier protein. The ability of E. coli containing UBA1 to synthesize an active protein will allow us to identify domains important for E1 function using in vitro mutagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1615898285,"The yeast TUF factor binds specifically to RPG-like sequences involved in multiple functions at enhancers, silencers, and telomeres. We have characterized the interaction of TUF with its optimal binding sequence, rpg-1 (1-ACACCCATACATTT-14), using a gel DNA-binding assay in combination with methylation protection and mutagenesis experiments. As many as 10 base pairs appear to be engaged in factor binding. Analysis of a collection of 30 different RPG mutants demonstrated the importance of 8 base pairs at position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12 and the critical role of the central GC pair at position 5. Methylation protection data on four different natural sites confirmed a close contact at positions 4, 5, 6, and 10 and suggested additional contacts at base pairs 8, 12, and 13. The derived consensus sequence was RCAAYCCRYNCAYY. A quantitative band shift analysis was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant for the complex of TUF and its optimal binding site rpg-1. The specific dissociation constant (K8) was found to be 1.3 x 10(-11) M. The comparison of the K8 value with the dissociation constant obtained for nonspecific DNA sites (Kn8 = 8.7 x 10(-6) M) shows the high binding selectivity of TUF for its specific RPG target."
https://openalex.org/W1897011370,"We have used gel retardation and DNase protection assays to investigate the trans-acting factors involved in the regulation of yeast RNA polymerase genes RPC160 and RPC40. The same binding component was found to interact with the promoter of the two genes, at a short distance (100-150 base pairs) from the transcription start sites. From its size, its DNA-binding specificity and its immunological properties, this factor appears to correspond to the autonomous replication sequences and silencer-binding factor ABF1/SBF-B. The interaction of ABF1 with the polymerase upstream box sequence was characterized using gel DNA-binding assay. The factor binds with high affinity to the polymerase upstream box sequence (Kapp = 5.10(-10) M). A mutational analysis showed that nine base pairs belonging to two separated attachment sites are involved in factor binding. The consensus sequence RTCRYB(N)4ACG was derived from the present binding studies. These data provide an experimental basis for evaluating the efficiency of known or potential ABF1 sites and for comparing several factors with ABF1-like binding properties."
https://openalex.org/W1496864433,"The yeast translational elongation factor 3 (EF-3) stimulates EF-1 alpha-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA by the ribosome. The requirement for EF-3 is unique to fungi; a functional analog has not been found in prokaryotes or other eukaryotes. We have isolated and characterized the structural gene, YEF3, that encodes EF-3. The YEF3 gene is present in one copy/haploid genome and is essential for vegetative growth. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the YEF3 gene contains an open reading frame of 1044 codons. The deduced amino acid sequence contains two repeats of a nucleotide-binding motif, which is similar to the nucleotide-binding consensus sequences of hydrophilic, membrane-associated ATPases. EF-3 catalyzes ATP hydrolysis in a ribosome-dependent manner. A modified assay procedure has been developed that allows measurement of the ATP hydrolytic activity of EF-3 in cell-free extracts without interference by other nucleotide hydrolyase activities. Using this modified assay, we have shown that the wild-type YEF3 gene restores heat stable EF-3 activity in a yeast strain containing a temperature-sensitive EF-3. Introduction of the YEF3 gene on a high copy number plasmid into yeast strains increases the ribosome-dependent ATPase activity. The level of EF-3 protein is also increased 3-5-fold. Elevated EF-3 protein levels did not cause a significant increase in EF-1 alpha and EF-2 protein. Yeast strains containing elevated EF-3 protein levels are more sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotics hygromycin and paromomycin. These drugs are known to increase translational errors. This observation suggests that EF-3 may indirectly affect translational accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W1503993378,"We have studied the intracellular processing of insulin in the rat hepatoma cell line Fao. Fao cells internalized cohorts of surface-bound 125I-insulin or 125I-insulin-like growth factor II within 3-5 min. Degraded 125I-insulin-like growth factor II did not appear in the medium until 20-30 min after uptake, consistent with a time course of lysosomal delivery. In contrast, internalized insulin was completely degraded within 7-10 min. The half-times for dissociation and degradation of internalized insulin were identical at 37 degrees C (3 min), suggesting that the two processes occurred in the same compartment. Subcellular fractionation of Fao cells showed that a pulse of internalized insulin was largely intact after 3 min and associated with a light membrane fraction devoid of lysosomal markers. After an additional 4 min, the amount of insulin in this compartment decreased by 40%, with an increase in degraded insulin in the cytosol; no transfer of intact insulin to lysosomes or the cytosol was detected. The relationship between insulin-receptor dissociation and insulin degradation was further studied with inhibitors of insulin processing. Monensin blocked both dissociation and degradation of internalized insulin, as did incubation of the cells at 20 degrees C, suggesting that both endosomal acidification and endosomal fusion were required for insulin processing. At 25 degrees C, dissociation (+ t 1/2 = 12.9 min) preceded degradation (+ t 1/2 = 15.8 min). Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases were without effect on the half-time for either process. In contrast, bacitracin, an inhibitor of insulin degradation, caused a 2-fold increase in the half-times for both dissociation and degradation. Thus, intracellular insulin dissociation and degradation are tightly coupled endosomal processes in Fao cells, and insulin degradation facilitates the dissociation of insulin from its receptor inside the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1549638117,"Neutrophil NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase activity, essential in the killing of bacteria by neutrophils, can be elicited in a cell-free system that requires plasma membranes, cytosol and sodium dodecyl sulfate. In addition, GTP or its nonhydrolyzable analog guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) enhances NADPH oxidase activity. We investigated the mechanism of this effect of GTP gamma S in the cell-free system. Cytosol from human neutrophils was separated in three different soluble oxidase components (SOC I, SOC II, and SOC III). Previously we (Bolscher, B. G. J. M., Van Zwieten, R., Kramer, I. J. M., Weening, R. S., Verhoeven, A. J., and Roos, D. (1989) J. Clin. Invest. 83, 757-763) reported that the cytosol contains two components which act synergistically. We now report that one component (previously labeled SOC II) contains two different components that can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Immunoblotting with antiserum B-1 (Volpp, B. D., Nauseef, W. M., and Clark, R. A. (1988) Science 242, 1295-1297), directed against a cytosolic complex capable of activating latent membranes in the cell-free system, showed a 47-kDa protein in SOC II and a 67-kDa protein in SOC III. SOC II also contains the 47-kDa phosphoprotein, which indicates that this phosphoprotein and the protein recognized by the antiserum are identical. Low rates of NADPH-dependent O2 consumption can be elicited by SOC II and SOC III in the absence of SOC I. This activity is independent of GTP gamma S. Addition of SOC I increases this activity 3-4-fold, only when GTP gamma S is present. Plasma membranes, incubated with SOC I plus GTP gamma S and re-isolated, showed a similar 3-4-fold enhanced O2 consumption with SOC II and SOC III. The GTP gamma S effect is exerted primarily at the level of the plasma membrane. The concentration of GTP gamma S that causes a half-maximal stimulation was 0.4 mu M. It is concluded that SOC I is a functional component of the NADPH oxidase."

https://openalex.org/W1585130906,"Endo.SceI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a heterodimeric site-specific endonuclease, which is distinguishable from prokaryotic restriction endonucleases in the mode of recognition of its cleavage site. We have used monoclonal antibodies specific to the larger subunit (75 kDa) of Endo.SceI to isolate the gene for the subunit (ENS1) from S. cerevisiae. Unexpectedly, ENS1 was found to encode a 70-kDa heat shock protein-related polypeptide and to be identical to recently cloned SSC1. Subcellular fractionation experiments on yeast cells revealed that the primary target site of the larger subunit is mitochondria, where almost all the Endo.SceI activity is localized. Molecular genetic analysis of ENS1 demonstrated its indispensability for growth and the requirement of a high level of its expression at the sporulation and germination stages. The data suggest that ENS1 plays an important role, especially at these differentiation stages."
https://openalex.org/W1921658241,"The mechanisms by which arginine-vasopressin (AVP) affects pancreatic B-cell function were studied in normal mouse islets. AVP produced a dose-dependent (0.1-1000 nM; EC50 approximately 1-2 nM) amplification of glucose-induced insulin release. This amplification was of slow onset and reversibility. AVP was ineffective when the concentration of glucose was less than 7 mM, but was still very effective in 30 mM glucose. The increase in insulin release produced by AVP was accompanied by small accelerations of 86Rb and 45Ca efflux from islet cells. Omission of extracellular Ca2+ accentuated the effect of AVP on 86Rb efflux, attenuated that on 45Ca efflux, and abolished that on release. Under no condition did AVP inhibit 86Rb efflux. AVP did not significantly affect cAMP levels, but increased inositol phosphate levels in islet cells, even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. AVP did not affect the membrane potential in unstimulated B-cells and augmented glucose-induced electrical activity only slightly. This was not due to a direct action on ATP-sensitive K+ channels as revealed by patch-clamp recordings (whole cell and outside-out patches). In conclusion, AVP is not an initiator of insulin release, but it potently amplifies glucose-induced insulin release in normal mouse B-cells. This effect involves a stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism, and presumably an activation of protein kinase C, rather than a change in cAMP levels or a direct control of the membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1480617624,"Revertants of nonfunctional cytochrome b mutants were isolated and characterized to determine how specific deleterious mutations in cytochrome b can be suppressed by secondary mutations not restoring a wild type protein. It was recently shown that the cytochrome b function can be recovered following various pseudo-wild type reversions at the level of the original site mutation or adjacent positions (di Rago, J.-P., Netter, P., and Slonimski, P. P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3332-3339). In the present study, we describe how the cytochrome b function can be recovered by secondary mutations in positions which are removed from the original mutation by up to more than 100 amino acids. Such revertant mutants are useful for the study of the three-dimensional structure of cytochrome b. The results of the analysis of four deficient mutations which affect a short region of the protein (positions 131-138 of the polypeptide chain) lead us to propose a possible mode of interactive combination between the first five putative transmembrane segments of cytochrome b within the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1567084795,"The influence of the insulin secretagogues, carbachol and glucose, on protein kinase C activation in isolated pancreatic islets has been examined by determination of the phosphorylation state of an endogenous 80-kDa protein substrate of protein kinase C. The islet 80-kDa protein was identified as the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate previously described (Stumpo D. J., Graff, J. M., Albert, K. A., Greengard, P., and Blackshear, P. J. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 4012-4016) by immunoprecipitation studies. The muscarinic agonist, carbachol (500 microM), induced insulin secretion and a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation state of this protein in islets. This phosphorylation was maximal (220 +/- 24% of control) at 5 min and was suppressed by the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine. Concentrations of glucose (28 mM) which induce maximal insulin secretion did not induce a statistically significant increase in 80-kDa phosphorylation. The combination of carbachol and a submaximally stimulatory concentration of glucose (10 mM), when added simultaneously, exerted a marked synergistic effect on insulin secretion and a synergistic effect on the phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein kinase C substrate. These data suggest that the activation of protein kinase C may play an important role in carbachol-induced insulin secretion and in the potentiation by carbachol of insulin secretion induced by glucose. However, the activation of protein kinase C does not appear to be a primary determinant of insulin secretion induced by glucose alone."
https://openalex.org/W1582797688,"Permeabilized and intact UMR-106-01 cells attached to culture plates or coverslips were used to evaluate compartmentalized generation and the effective concentration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (In-1,4,5-P3) during agonist-mediated Ca2+ release. In permeabilized cells, Ca2+ release had the following characteristics. In-1,4,5-P3 released approximately 65% of the Ca2+ incorporated into intracellular stores. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), endothelin, or GTP(gamma S) alone released a small amount or no Ca2+. However, the agonists together with GTP(gamma S) were as effective as In-1,4,5-P3 in releasing Ca2+. Both agonist- and In-1,4,5-P3-mediated Ca2+ release required the presence of permeable ion. Agonists, like In-1,4,5-P3, stimulated 45Ca uptake from low Ca2+ medium devoid of permeable ions into Ca2(+)-loaded intracellular stores. The permeabilized cell system was then used to evaluate compartmentalized generation and action of In-1,4,5-P3 during agonist stimulation. Mass measurement shows that in intact resting cells In-1,4,5-P3 concentration was 1.4 microM and was reduced to 0.05 microM following permeabilization. Stimulation with agonists increases In-1,4,5-P3 concentration from 0.05 to 0.34 microM. Ca2+ release by this concentration of In-1,4,5-P3 evenly distributed in the cytosol can account for only part of the agonist-mediated Ca2+ release. However, the effects of saturating In-1,4,5-P3 concentration and agonists were blocked by the specific inhibitor heparin. Measurement of heparin dependency of In-1,4,5-P3-mediated Ca2+ release was used to calculate an affinity for In-1,4,5-P3 of 0.39 microM. Similar measurements with agonists show that In-1,4,5-P3 concentration at the site of Ca2+ release during agonist stimulation is 11.2 microM. Hence, the total increase in In-1,4,5-P3 is reflected in considerably higher localized concentrations. This is interpreted to suggest compartmentalized generation and action of In-1,4,5-P3 during agonist stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1670666373,"In Escherichia coli, the outer membrane protein FepA is a receptor for the siderophore complex ferric enterobactin and for colicins B and D. To identify protein domains important for FepA activity, the effects of deletion and linker insertion mutations on receptor structure and function were examined. In-frame internal deletion mutations removing sequences encoding up to 304 amino acid residues resulted in functionally defective FepA polypeptides, although most were translocated efficiently to the outer membrane. One exception, a derivative lacking 87 internal amino acid residues near the N terminus, showed an inability to transport ferric enterobactin but retained limited colicin receptor function. Analysis of cells carrying 3'-terminal fepA deletion mutations suggested that residues within the C terminus of FepA may be involved in secretion and proper translocation of the protein to the outer membrane. Introduction of the peptide Leu-Glu after FepA residues 55, 142, or 324 severely impaired receptor function for all three ligands, while the same insertion after residues 339 or 359 had virtually no detrimental effect on FepA function. Foreign peptides inserted after residues 204 or 635 restricted colicin B and D function only, leaving ferric enterobactin transport ability at near wild-type levels. The results presented in this study have identified key regions of FepA potentially involved in receptor function and demonstrate the presence of both shared and unique ligand-responsive domains."
https://openalex.org/W1533101931,"N-Glycosidase F (peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glycosaminyl)asparagine amidase; EC 3.5.1.52) catalyzes the cleavage of N-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains between N-acetylglucosamine and asparagine. The structural gene was isolated by screening a Flavobacterium meningosepticum genomic DNA library in lambda gt10 with oligonucleotides, deduced from partial amino acid sequences of the protein. A clone with an open reading frame of 1062 bases was obtained. The amino acid sequence reveals a 42-residue-long leader peptide, which shows similarities to the endoglycosidase H-leader with respect to the cleavage site of the signal peptide, but is distinct from the ones known from other Gram-positive or -negative bacteria. The molecular weight of the native protein, derived from the DNA sequence, is in agreement with the molecular weight of the purified protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35,000). Escherichia coli, transformed with a plasmid containing this DNA sequence, expresses N-glycosidase F activity. The enzyme with its natural Flavobacterium promoter and leader peptide is not secreted in E. coli but seems to be associated with cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1557649454,"DNA damage and repair were studied in a DNA fragment containing the insulin gene after treatment of cells with methylnitrosourea. For these studies, two clonal isolates from the same rat insulinoma cell line which differ in that the insulin gene is transcribed in one (RINr 38) and is silent in the other (RINr B2) were utilized. Both the determination of immunologically reactive insulin released and the expression of insulin mRNA were used to verify that the gene was transcribed in the RINr 38 cells and not in the RINr B2 cells. Repair kinetics for the removal of alkali-labile sites were comparable across the entire genome in the RINr 38 and RINr B2 cells as determined using alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation and a 32P end-labeling assay for the quantitation of N7-methylguanine. Quantitative DNA blot analysis was utilized to assess the formation and repair of alkali-labile sites within the restriction fragment containing the insulin gene. Alkali-labile sites appeared to be formed equally within the restriction fragment containing the insulin gene in both the RINr 38 and RINr B2 cells. However, at 24 h, 60% of the lesions were removed from the fragment in the RINr 38 cells, where the gene was transcribed, compared to the removal of only 20% in the RINr B2 cells, where the gene was silent. Thus, it appears that alkali-labile sites induced by exposure to methylnitrosourea are repaired more efficiently in the DNA fragment containing the insulin gene when it is actively transcribed."
https://openalex.org/W1593723998,"Abstract Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants that expressed human insulin receptors whose glycine 996 was substituted by valine were studied. Receptor processing and insulin binding were unaffected by this mutation; however, this mutant insulin receptor had little or no tyrosine kinase activity. Nevertheless, the Val996 mutant exhibited seryl and threonyl phosphorylation in both the basal and insulin-stimulated state in intact cells. This is in contrast to the Lys----Ala1018 tyrosine kinase deficient mutant (Russell, D. S., Gherzi, R., Johnson, E. L., Chou, C-K., and Rosen, O. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11833-11840). Cells expressing the normal human receptor were 10-fold more sensitive to insulin than the untransfected CHO cells with respect to phosphorylation of a cellular substrate (pp 185) on tyrosyl residues, glucose incorporation into glycogen, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Cells expressing the mutant receptor exhibited the same insulin sensitivity as the untransfected CHO cells. Insulin was rapidly internalized in cells expressing the normal human receptor and the number of receptors expressed on the cell surface was decreased in response to exposure to insulin. However, little insulin was internalized in cells expressing the mutant receptor, and the number of receptors on the cell surface was not significantly diminished in response to exposure to insulin. It is concluded that despite the occurrence of seryl and threonyl phosphorylations, post-receptor effects of insulin described above are not mediated by the tyrosine kinase-deficient receptor, Val996."
https://openalex.org/W1534605614,"The kinetics of the cleavage of superhelical plasmid DNA (pBR322) by the restriction endonuclease, BamHI, have been analyzed in terms a compartmental model consistent with the chemistry first proposed by Rubin and Modrich (Rubin, R. A., and Modrich, P. (1978) Nucleic Acids Res. 5, 2991-2997) for analysis of the kinetics of the restriction endonuclease, EcoRI. The model was defined in terms of two compartments representing DNA substrate (bound and free), two compartments representing nicked intermediate (bound and free), one compartment representing linear product, and one compartment for free enzyme. A simultaneous analysis of concentration changes over time of the three DNA forms (superhelical, nicked, and linear) at six different enzyme concentrations was undertaken employing this compartmental model using SAAM (Simulation Analysis And Modeling) software. Results showed that rate constants characterizing the association of enzyme with superhelical DNA (6.0 x 10(5) M-1 s-1) and nicked DNA (2.8 x 10(5) M-1 s-1) were similar in magnitude and rate constants characterizing cleavage of the first (1.2 x 10(-2) s-1) and second phosphodiester bonds (3.1 x 10(-2) s-1) were also similar. The analysis yields a kinetically determined equilibrium constant of 12.9 nM for the dissociation of nicked intermediate from the enzyme. The rate constant describing the release of the nicked intermediate from the enzyme has a value of 3.7 x 10(-3) s-1. By comparing the value of this release rate constant to the value of the constant describing the second cleavage event, it can be determined that only 10% of the nicked intermediate bound to the enzyme is released as free nicked DNA and that 90% of the nicked intermediate is processed to the linear form without being released. Hence, most of the DNA is cleaved as the result of a single enzyme-DNA recognition event. No steady state assumptions were made in the analysis. The approach was to directly solve the differential equations which described the kinetic processes using an interactive method. This study demonstrates the usefulness of this approach for the analysis of kinetics of protein-DNA interactions for the restriction endonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W1513651808,"Minimal alterations at the carboxyl terminus of the B subunit (EtxB) of heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli were found to have a marked effect on the assembly and release of this polypeptide into the periplasm. Nine mutant EtxB polypeptides were obtained by genetic manipulation of the 3'-end of the etxB gene using Bal31 nuclease digestion and codon substitution. A correlation was observed between the magnitude of the changes introduced at the carboxyl terminus and the extent to which the mutant polypeptides were defective in assembly and release. Some of the mutant B subunits, exemplified by those in which the last 2 amino acids had been deleted or in which the last 4 residues had been replaced by three different ones, were found to be only partially defective, with a proportion being associated with the periplasmic face of the cytoplasmic membrane and the remainder being exported to the periplasm. The portion associated with membranes was detected as monomers on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, whereas the portion exported to the periplasm were detected as assembled oligomers. We conclude that the last few amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of EtxB exert a profound influence on the assembly and release of the B subunit from the cytoplasmic membrane during export in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1549894357,"Ligand-induced ultraviolet difference spectra have been determined for Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase. The most prominent feature of the spectra is an absorbance difference which resembles a single period of a sine wave spanning the 245-320 nm region with a maximum at approximately 270 nm and a minimum at around 295-300 nm. This broad absorbance difference is typical of a blue-shift 1La band of tryptophan. Superimposed on the broad band in the 275-310 nm region is a series of smaller, narrow peaks resulted from red-shifted 1Lb bands of tryptophan and tyrosine residues. At pH 8.5, only carbamoyl phosphate and its analog phosphonacetamide yield a large ultraviolet difference absorbance (approximately 1800 M-1 cm-1) when bound to the enzyme. The spectra obtained are essentially the same in lineshape to and 80% in intensity of that produced by the bisubstrate analogy, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-ornithine. In contrast, inorganic phosphate, a product of the reaction, induces small protein absorbance changes (approximately 300 M-1 cm-1) mainly in the 275-310 nm range. When complexed to the free enzyme, L-ornithine yields a marginally discernible ultraviolet difference spectrum in the 275-310 nm region, and its analogs L-norvaline and L-citrulline provide no absorbance change. However, inorganic phosphate in combination with any of the L-amino acids produces a difference spectrum similar to that given by carbamoyl phosphate alone. Collectively, these spectra suggest that carbamoyl phosphate elicits an isomerization required for the formation of the ternary complex and are consistent with the compulsory ordered mechanism of the enzyme at pH 8.5 with carbamoyl phosphate being the first substrate bound. Below pH 8, there is a kinetically discernible amount of random binding, but ordered addition is still the preferred pathway (Wargnies B., Legrain, C., and Stalon, V. (1978) Eur J. Biochem. 89, 203-212). Reflecting this change, the difference absorbance of the enzyme bound with carbamoyl phosphate is also pH dependent. The 1La band in the carbamoyl phosphate difference spectrum diminishes by approximately 20% at low pH. The PALO-induced changes, however, are pH invariant suggesting that full extent of the induced-fit isomerization is always reached in the ternary complex."

Parallel experiments with peroxidase coupled to streptavidin and with biotinylated phycoerythrin were also performed. The loss of function of each compound was analyzed according to target theory. Target analysis revealed that the radiation-sensitive mass associated with the enzymatic activity and that associated with the fluorescence were unchanged by irradiation in the strongly coupled state. Therefore the noncovalent bonds between biotin and avidin do not permit the transfer of radiation-deposited energy in amounts sufficient to destroy the activity of apposing molecule.

Chem. 265, 15300-15307) for analysis of the time courses of the cleavage of superhelical DNA substrates by the restriction endonuclease, BamHI, has been used to quantify the effects of changes in temperature, ionic strength, superhelical density, and the DNA substrate on the binding and strand cleavage processes. Studies reported here indicate that changes in topology may be introduced into the DNA substrate solely as a result of the plasmid preparation process and in the absence of covalent bond cleavage and ligation. These changes in topology have qualitatively different effects on the kinetics than those promoted by changes in the superhelical density. The former are removed by briefly warming the DNA prior to assay, suggesting that they are only kinetically stable, while the latter changes are not affected by heating. Increasing the [NaCl] from 0.01 M to 0.1 M increases the overall rate of plasmid cleavage by increasing both the rates of cleavage and enzyme DNA association. To describe the decrease in the overall cleavage rate observed in 0.15 M NaCl, an ionic strength-dependent rate-determining structural transition in the DNA substrate was incorporated into the model. The largest changes in the rate of the cleavage process resulted from changes in the DNA substrate. For the SV40 substrate compared to pBR322, the rate constants describing the two association processes and the first bond cleavage event were increased 6- to 7-fold. The rate of the second bond cleavage process was not affected. These changes may be due to differences in the flanking sequences."

Proteolytic digestion of intact cells produced a 23-kDa fragment of the receptor that retained the photoaffinity label used to identify the receptor. Additionally, this fragment contained the sites phosphorylated by CAR-kinase, the enzyme that phosphorylates the ligand-occupied form of the receptor. The fragment was also found to be phosphorylated in response to cAMP stimulation of cells. Proteolytic digestion of either intact cells or membrane preparations did not appreciably alter the binding properties of the receptor, indicating that the domains which determine the cAMP binding pocket are likely to be transmembrane regions of the protein. Additionally, the sensitivity of down-regulated receptors to chymotrypsin digestion suggests that the initial loss of cAMP binding activity upon incubation of cells with high concentrations of ligand does not require receptor internalization."
