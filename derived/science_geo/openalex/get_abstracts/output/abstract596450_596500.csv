This is in part because of the materials used to extract the charge carriers (electrons and holes) from the active layer. Arora et al. replaced organic hole transporter layers with CuCSN to improve thermal stability. Device lifetime was enhanced when a conducting reduced graphene oxide spacer was added between the CuSCN layer and the gold electrode. Science , this issue p. 768"

Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world's tropical forests are a net carbon source of 425.2 ± 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year-1). This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year-1 and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year-1 Gains result from forest growth; losses result from deforestation and from reductions in carbon density within standing forests (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses."

Microcephaly and neuropathologies associated with Zika have only been reported recently, most prevalently in the Americas. Yuan et al. investigated recent stable mutations in the virus genome and engineered them into a low-virulence ancestral strain (see the Perspective by Screaton and Mongkolsapaya). A single amino acid substitution (serine to asparagine, S139N) in the viral precursor membrane protein exacerbated symptoms in pregnant mice. The reverse mutation (N139S) was less virulent. The S139N mutation arose in 2013 in French Polynesia before the virus jumped to Brazil in 2015. In vitro, this amino acid change made the virus more infectious for mouse and human neural progenitor cells and promoted apoptosis. The terrible sequelae of infection during pregnancy could thus be the result of a simple viral mutation. Science , this issue p. 933 ; see also p. 863"
https://openalex.org/W2760172958,"Southern Africa is consistently placed as a potential region for the evolution of Homo sapiens We present genome sequences, up to 13x coverage, from seven ancient individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The remains of three Stone Age hunter-gatherers (about 2000 years old) were genetically similar to current-day southern San groups, and those of four Iron Age farmers (300 to 500 years old) were genetically similar to present-day Bantu-language speakers. We estimate that all modern-day Khoe-San groups have been influenced by 9 to 30% genetic admixture from East Africans/Eurasians. Using traditional and new approaches, we estimate the first modern human population divergence time to between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. This estimate increases the deepest divergence among modern humans, coinciding with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans, as represented in the local fossil record."

The gut produces large quantities of immunoglobulin A (IgA), which adheres to the surface of gut microbes. Bunker et al. discovered that antibodies produced by naïve small intestinal plasma cells are recirculated and enriched within Peyer's patches, independently of exogenous antigen and T cell help. The resulting polyreactive IgAs are released into the gut lumen and bind to microbial surface glycans, thus innately recognizing the gut microbiota. Polyreactive IgAs appear to be a product of the coevolution of host and microbiota to maintain symbiotic homeostasis. Science , this issue p. eaan6619"
https://openalex.org/W2761961449,"Administration of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) could improve some neurologic conditions by transferring functional biomolecules to recipient cells. Furthermore, exosomes from hypoxic progenitor cells exerted better therapeutic effects in organ injury through specific cargoes. However, there are no related reports about whether exosomes derived from MSCs or hypoxia-preconditioned MSCs (PC-MSCs) could prevent memory deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, the exosomes derived from MSCs or PC-MSCs were systemically administered to transgenic APP/PS1 mice. The expression of miR-21 in MSCs was significantly increased after hypoxic treatment. Injection of exosomes from normoxic MSCs could rescue cognition and memory impairment according to results of the Morris water maze test, reduced plaque deposition, and Aβ levels in the brain; could decrease the activation of astrocytes and microglia; could down-regulate proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β); and could up-regulate anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and -10) in AD mice, as well as reduce the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-κB. Compared to the group administered exosomes from normoxic MSCs, in the group administered exosomes from PC-MSCs, learning and memory capabilities were significantly improved; the plaque deposition and Aβ levels were lower, and expression of growth-associated protein 43, synapsin 1, and IL-10 was increased; and the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, TNF-α, IL-1β, and activation of STAT3 and NF-κB were sharply decreased. More importantly, exosomes from PC-MSCs effectively increased the level of miR-21 in the brain of AD mice. Additionally, replenishment of miR-21 restored the cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and prevented pathologic features. Taken together, these findings suggest that exosomes from PC-MSCs could improve the learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 mice, and that the underlying mechanism may lie in the restoration of synaptic dysfunction and regulation of inflammatory responses through regulation of miR-21.—Cui, G.-H., Wu, J., Mou, F.-F., Xie, W.-H., Wang, F.-B., Wang, Q.-L., Fang, J., Xu, Y.-W., Dong, Y.-R., Liu, J.-R., Guo, H.-D.

Thapsigargin (Tg) blocks the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis, and causes cell death.

Here, we report that low (0.1 μm) concentrations of Tg and Tg analogs with various long-chain substitutions at the O-8 position extensively inhibit SERCA1a-mediated Ca2+ transport. We also found that, in both prostate and breast cancer cells, exposure to Tg or Tg analogs for 1 day caused extensive drainage of the ER Ca2+ stores. This Ca2+ depletion was followed by markedly reduced cell proliferation rates and morphological changes that developed over 2–4 days and culminated in cell death. Interestingly, these changes were not accompanied by bulk increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Moreover, knockdown of two key store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) components, Orai1 and STIM1, did not reduce Tg cytotoxicity, indicating that SOCE and Ca2+ entry are not critical for Tg-induced cell death. However, we observed a correlation between the abilities of Tg and Tg analogs to deplete ER Ca2+ stores and their detrimental effects on cell viability. Furthermore, caspase activation and cell death were associated with a sustained unfolded protein response.

Part of the problem is that the virus is constantly mutating. Kadam et al. tested the cell entry stage of the virus life cycle as a drug target (see the Perspective by Whitehead). Cell entry is mediated by the major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). This stage can be blocked by broadly neutralizing antibodies binding to HA. The authors generated small cyclic peptides that bind to the same sites on HA as the antibodies and mimic their activity. The peptides are cheap and easy to synthesize, are nontoxic to mice, and prevented infection of cells by many types of influenza virus. Science , this issue p. 496 ; see also p. 450"
https://openalex.org/W2763470412,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for most selective protein degradation in eukaryotes and regulates numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle control and protein quality control. A component of this system, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP14, associates with the proteasome where it can rescue substrates from degradation by removal of the ubiquitin tag. We previously found that a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14, known as IU1, can increase the rate of degradation of a subset of proteasome substrates. We report here the synthesis and characterization of 87 variants of IU1, which resulted in the identification of a 10-fold more potent USP14 inhibitor that retains specificity for USP14. The capacity of this compound, IU1-47, to enhance protein degradation in cells was tested using as a reporter the microtubule-associated protein tau, which has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. Using primary neuronal cultures, IU1-47 was found to accelerate the rate of degradation of wild-type tau, the pathological tau mutants P301L and P301S, and the A152T tau variant. We also report that a specific residue in tau, lysine 174, is critical for the IU1-47-mediated tau degradation by the proteasome. Finally, we show that IU1-47 stimulates autophagic flux in primary neurons. In summary, these findings provide a powerful research tool for investigating the complex biology of USP14."
https://openalex.org/W2761137596,"Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix or to surrounding cells plays a key role in cell proliferation and differentiation and is critical for proper tissue homeostasis. An important pathway in adhesion-dependent cell proliferation is the Hippo signaling cascade, which is coregulated by the transcription factors Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). However, how cells integrate extracellular information at the molecular level to regulate YAP1’s nuclear localization is still puzzling. Herein, we investigated the role of β1 integrins in regulating this process. We found that β1 integrin–dependent cell adhesion is critical for supporting cell proliferation in mesenchymal cells both in vivo and in vitro. β1 integrin–dependent cell adhesion relied on the relocation of YAP1 to the nucleus after the down-regulation of its phosphorylated state mediated by large tumor suppressor gene 1 and 2 (LATS1/2). We also found that this phenotype relies on β1 integrin–dependent local activation of the small GTPase RAC1 at the plasma membrane to control the activity of P21 (RAC1)-activated kinase (PAK) of group 1. We further report that the regulatory protein merlin (neurofibromin 2, NF2) interacts with both YAP1 and LATS1/2 via its C-terminal moiety and FERM domain, respectively. PAK1-mediated merlin phosphorylation on Ser-518 reduced merlin’s interactions with both LATS1/2 and YAP1, resulting in YAP1 dephosphorylation and nuclear shuttling.

Our results highlight RAC/PAK1 as major players in YAP1 regulation triggered by cell adhesion. Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix or to surrounding cells plays a key role in cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis and consequently is critical for proper development or tissue homeostasis (1Hynes R.O. Integrins: versatility, modulation, and signaling in cell adhesion.Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). However, deregulation of this process often contributes to pathological disorders such as tumor formation, growth, and metastasis (2Bouvard D. Pouwels J. De Franceschi N. Ivaska J.

Hippo signaling was identified as an important regulatory pathway that restricts cell proliferation, thereby controlling organ size and morphogenesis (5Zhao B. Tumaneng K. Guan K.L.

The Drosophila Mst ortholog, Hippo, restricts growth and cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis.Cell. 2003; 114: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). This is achieved mainly through the control of two transcriptional coactivators: Yes-associated protein (YAP1) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ/WWTR1). Upon restrictive proliferative conditions, these molecules are phosphorylated by the products of the large tumor suppressor gene 1 and 2 (LATS1/2). This phosphorylation creates a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins and promotes YAP/TAZ sequestration in the cytoplasm. As a consequence, phosphorylated forms of YAP/TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm (7Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C.

Although originally described as the main switch to block cell proliferation when confluency is reached, it has become clear that the Hippo signaling pathway is integrating several inputs such as cell density, cell geometry, matrix stiffness, metabolic status, and serum composition (9Meng Z. Moroishi T. Guan K.L. Mechanisms of Hippo pathway regulation.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Indeed, activation of YAP/TAZ-mediated transcriptions, which correlates with their nuclear localization, is tightly controlled by cell-matrix adhesion (10Zhao B. Li L. Wang L. Wang C.Y. Yu J. Guan K.L. Cell detachment activates the Hippo pathway via cytoskeleton reorganization to induce anoikis.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 11Kim N.-G. Gumbiner B.M. Adhesion to fibronectin regulates Hippo signaling via the FAK-SRC-PI3K pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 210: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This process explains why cells are dependent on matrix adhesion for a full mitogenic response to growth factor exposure (12Huang S. Ingber D.E. Cell tension, matrix mechanics, and cancer development.Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 175-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Loss of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is known to induce an increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is correlated with the inhibition of mitogenic signaling (13Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Regulation of anchorage-dependent signal transduction by protein kinase A and p21-activated kinase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because YAP/TAZ activities are also inhibited by cAMP, this rise in cAMP was proposed as the main factor to regulate YAP/TAZ upon cell detachment, potentially mediated though downstream players such as RHOA or LATS1/2 (10Zhao B. Li L. Wang L. Wang C.Y. Yu J. Guan K.L.

In contrast, cell adhesion to cell-matrix proteins was shown to trigger YAP nuclear localization through an integrin/SRC axis (11Kim N.-G. Gumbiner B.M. Adhesion to fibronectin regulates Hippo signaling via the FAK-SRC-PI3K pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 210: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).

Initially, RHOA was identified as a critical regulator of YAP; however, more recently RAC1 and CDC42 were also found to be involved in its regulation (16Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E.

Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). So far, how small RHOA family GTPases regulate YAP nuclear translocation remains elusive. Knowing that integrins are key regulators of this GTPase class, we wondered whether β1 integrins might regulate YAP by controlling RHOA GTPases. Herein, we address the mechanistic role of β1 integrins in the regulation of YAP localization and thereby cell proliferation. We found that β1 integrin–dependent cell adhesion was critical for supporting cell proliferation in mesenchymal cells both in vivo and in vitro by controlling YAP signaling rather than MAPK cascade. Mechanistically, we showed that β1 integrins are required for localizing the GTPase RAC1 at plasma membrane extensions. There, RAC1 activates its effector PAK1 and initiates in a merlin-dependent manner the nuclear translocation of YAP. Indeed, we found that merlin binds LATS via its FERM N-terminal domain but also interacts with YAP with its C-terminal moiety. The interactions between merlin and YAP or LATS are down-regulated upon phosphorylation by PAK1 at Ser-518. Altogether our data revealed a novel signaling pathway orchestrated by β1 integrins to locally activate a RAC/PAK1 cascade and negatively regulate the inhibitory protein merlin. To explore the function of β1 integrins in bone tissue, we inactivated the β1 integrin gene in osteoblasts using Osterix-driven Cre recombinase expression. Mice with an osteoblast-specific β1-integrin deletion survived to adulthood but suffered from a growth deficit along with a significant decrease in the absolute number of osteoblasts (Fig. 1A). Because β1 integrins are known to regulate cell proliferation, we wondered whether the reduced osteoblast numbers observed could be due to a reduced proliferative capability of those cells. Although TUNEL staining did not reveal any significant difference in apoptotic cell number (Fig. 1, B and C), a significant reduction in BrdU incorporation was observed in mutant animals (Fig. 1, D and E). Similarly, in vitro, the loss of β1 integrins in isolated osteoblasts resulted in a significant proliferation defect (Fig. 1F). To rule out any osteoblast-specific phenotypes, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and confirmed that the loss of β1 integrin expression was associated with a reduced proliferative capability of the cells (Fig. 1G). Although it was proposed that integrins are important regulators of ERK signaling (19Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Integrin-dependent activation of MAP kinase: a link to shape-dependent cell proliferation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we could not rescue the proliferation defect of β1 integrin-deficient cells by activating the MAPK/ERK pathway (Fig. 1H). In addition, we did not detect any significant modification of ERK phosphorylation when β1 integrin-deficient cells were compared with wild-type cells (data not shown). YAP-dependent gene expression has emerged as an important pathway regulating cell proliferation (20Ehmer U. Sage J. Control of proliferation and cancer growth by the Hippo signaling pathway.Mol. Cancer Res. 2016; 14: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently reported that YAP nuclear localization is controlled in a cell adhesion manner through integrins and SRC/FAK (21Elbediwy A. Vincent-Mistiaen Z.I. Spencer-Dene B. Stone R.K. Boeing S. Wculek S.K. Cordero J. Tan E.H. Ridgway R. Brunton V.G. Sahai E. Gerhardt H. Behrens A. Malanchi I. Sansom O.J. Thompson B.J. Integrin signalling regulates YAP and TAZ to control skin homeostasis.Development. 2016; 143: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); therefore, we first asked whether the loss of β1 integrin expression was indeed associated with a defect in YAP nuclear localization, which might account for the reduced proliferation observed in β1-deficient cells. When compared with wild-type cells that displayed a prominent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization, the lack of β1 integrins was correlated with a strong relocation of these proteins within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and B). This observation was confirmed with the other clones analyzed (Fig. 2C), as well as in cell lines stably expressing a flag-tagged YAP (Fig. 2D). To further evaluate the involvement of the ERK/MAPK pathway in controlling YAP nuclear localization downstream of β1 integrins, we isolated MEF cells from mice bearing a constitutively active allele of K-Ras (K-RasG12D) (22Johnson L. Mercer K. Greenbaum D. Bronson R.T. Crowley D. Tuveson D.A. Jacks T. Somatic activation of the K-ras oncogene causes early onset lung cancer in mice.Nature. 2001; 410: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) with one or two deleted alleles of the β1 integrin gene. Even in the presence of the activated allele of K-Ras, YAP was mainly cytoplasmic as soon as the β1 integrin chain was genetically ablated (Fig. 2E). Notably, YAP/TAZ nuclear localization was completely restored upon re-expression of the human β1 integrin subunit in β1-deficient mouse cells, showing a direct relationship between β1 expression and the nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ (Fig. 2, A and B). In line with these observations, biochemical fractionations revealed a decrease in the nuclear pool of YAP in β1-deficient cells (Fig. 2F). Along with the reduced level of nuclear YAP, the expression of its target genes was also down-regulated in β1-deficient cells (Fig. 3A). YAP was shown to be sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins after the activation of its upstream protein kinase LATS (7Kanai F. Marignani P.A. Sarbassova D. Yagi R. Hall R.A. Donowitz M. Hisaminato A. Fujiwara T. Ito Y. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. TAZ: a novel transcriptional co-activator regulated by interactions with 14-3-3 and PDZ domain proteins.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6778-6791Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this, we noticed that the phosphorylation of YAP on Ser-127 (required for 14-3-3 binding) increased upon the deletion of β1 integrins as well as the ratio of activated (phosphorylated) versus total form of LATS (Fig. 3B). Therefore, taken together, these data confirmed that β1 integrins are important players in controlling YAP nuclear localization most likely in a LATS-dependent manner.Figure 3β1 integrins control proliferation via YAP transcriptional activity.

Our data highlighted that LATS-dependent phosphorylation of YAP was up-regulated in β1-deficient cells. Therefore, we stably expressed in those cells a non-phosphorylatable form of YAP. The expression of YAP5SA in β1 integrin-null cells relocated YAP into the nucleus and up-regulated its target genes (Fig. 3, C and D). Importantly, the expression of YAP5SA fully restored β1−/− cell proliferation capabilities as quantified by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 3E). Therefore, our data highlighted the important role of YAP signaling in the control of cell proliferation downstream of β1 integrins. Finally, to confirm this view, we performed unbiased transcriptomic analyses on wild-type and β1 integrin-deficient cells under optimal growth conditions. With the defined filtering and statistical criterion, 800 probes representing 555 well-annotated genes were identified as being differentially expressed between the two considered groups (supplemental Fig. S1). Known YAP/TEAD target genes were significantly down-regulated in β1−/− cells. Among those were ankrd1, ctgf, and cyr61 (supplemental Fig. S2). These results confirmed our previous RT-qPCR analyses (Fig. 3, A and D). Consistent with the above-mentioned proliferation defect, a number of cell-cycle regulators were also deregulated (supplemental Fig. S1). To directly estimate whether the YAP–TEAD complex might impact the expression of those important cell-cycle regulators, we analyzed p19Arf, p21CIP, and cyclin D2 expression by RT-qPCR in cell expressing YAP5SA. In contrast to what was measured in β1-deficient cells, the expression of YAP5SA in wild-type cells was able to up-regulate cyclin D2 and down-regulate p19Arf but not p21CIP when compared with control cells (Fig. 3E). This strongly suggests that some important cell-cycle regulators are transcriptionally modified by the YAP–TEAD complex. Although accumulating evidence pinpointed a role for FAK and SRC in integrin–dependent control of the Hippo pathway (21Elbediwy A. Vincent-Mistiaen Z.I. Spencer-Dene B. Stone R.K. Boeing S.

Integrin signalling regulates YAP and TAZ to control skin homeostasis.Development. 2016; 143: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), little is known about the downstream effectors. However, members of the Rho GTPase family were shown to be involved in the control of YAP activity (10Zhao B. Li L. Wang L. Wang C.Y. Yu J. Guan K.L.

Yap- and CDC42-dependent nephrogenesis and morphogenesis during mouse kidney development.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003380Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is well known that integrins also play a critical role in the activation or the coupling of Rho GTPases with their effectors. Therefore, we wondered whether YAP nuclear localization driven by β1 integrins might also be regulated by Rho GTPases and, if so, which one. To address this question, we used β1-deficient osteoblasts that displayed a dramatic defect in YAP nuclear localization to generate stable cell lines expressing constitutively activated forms of RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42. Then, we analyzed which Rho GTPase was able to induce the relocation of YAP within the nucleus. Surprisingly, activated RHOA was unable to restore the nuclear localization of YAP (Fig. 4, A and B). In line with this observation, we neither observed any significant difference in RHOA-GTP levels in wild-type versus β1-deficient cells nor any change in its cellular distribution (Fig. 4, C and D). In sharp contrast, RACG12V expression (and to a lower extent CDC42G12V) was associated with a significant increase in YAP nuclear localization in β1−/− cells (Fig. 4, A and E). Importantly, RACG12V expression restored YAP nuclear localization in β1-deficient cells but not their spreading defect (Fig. 4F). This strongly suggested that RAC1 and CDC42 might act downstream of β1 integrins in the signaling pathway that regulates YAP nuclear localization. Because the expression of constitutively activated CDC42 and RAC1 could activate common effectors such as PAK, we wondered whether both small GTPase proteins were physiologically involved in this regulation. Hence, to discriminate between RAC1 and CDC42, we specifically inhibited their activities and analyzed YAP subcellular localization. The expression of a dominant-negative form of CDC42 (CDC42Asn-17) did not result in any significant YAP redistribution in wild-type cells (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S3). In sharp contrast, the inhibition of RAC1 activity either pharmacologically with ETH1864 or by the expression of a dominant-negative form (RACAsn-17) led to a significant YAP redistribution to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. S3). As our previous data pointed out for a major role of RAC1, we next analyzed whether the expression of constitutively active RAC1 could reverse the proliferation defect observed in β1-deficient cells. Indeed, RACG12V expression in β1-deficient cells restored proliferation up to the level of control cells (Fig. 5B). This suggested that both RAC1 and YAP were in a common pathway to regulate β1-dependent cell proliferation. Indeed, the expression of RACG12V in β1-deficient cells induced a decrease in YAP phosphorylation to a comparable level to the one observed in β1f/f cells (Fig. 5C). From these results, we concluded that RAC1 is involved in YAP signaling upon β1-dependent cell adhesion. Surprisingly, quantification of RACGTP levels in β1f/f and β1−/− in whole-cell lysates did not reveal any significant difference (Fig. 5D). This discrepancy suggested that an altered RAC1 localization, rather than a global defect in its activity per se, resulted in YAP mislocalization observed in β1-deficient cells. Supporting this hypothesis, it was reported that cell adhesion regulates RAC1 plasma membrane localization (25Das S. Yin T. Yang Q. Zhang J. Wu Y.I. Yu J. Single-molecule tracking of small GTPase Rac1 uncovers spatial regulation of membrane translocation and mechanism for polarized signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E267-E276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although the role of β1 integrin in this process was not addressed. To address this question directly, we performed immunostaining to analyze endogenous RAC1 localization in β1f/f and β1−/− cells. As expected, in wild-type cells RAC1 frequently accumulated at protrusive cell edges; however, this localization was strongly reduced upon β1 removal (Fig. 5, E and F). To orchestrate actin dynamics, it was previously shown that RAC1 recruits cortactin at cell lamellipodia (26Weed S.A. Du Y. Parsons J.T. Translocation of cortactin to the cell periphery is mediated by the small GTPase Rac1.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2433-2443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further supporting the defect in RAC1 membrane localization in β1-deficient cells, we observed that cortactin localization at cell edges was also significantly reduced in mutant cells (Fig. 5, G and H). On our search of how RAC1 could affect YAP nuclear localization, we focused our attention on its effectors, the PAK family. Indeed, PAK1/2 are activated at the plasma membrane by RAC1 and/or CDC42, where they regulate membrane dynamics (27Parrini M.C. Camonis J. Matsuda M. de Gunzburg J. Dissecting activation of the PAK1 kinase at protrusions in living cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24133-24143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. Temporal and spatial distribution of activated Pak1 in fibroblasts.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). First, we asked whether impaired RAC1 targeting to the plasma membrane was translated into a defect in PAK1 activity. As expected, this activity, monitored by its phosphorylation, was reduced in β1-deficient cells but restored upon the re-expression of β1 integrins (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the defect in RAC1 recruitment to the plasma membrane, PAK membrane localization was reduced in β1-deficient cells but restored upon the expression of the constitutively active RACG12V (Fig. 6B). Altogether, these results supported the view that β1 integrins by regulating RAC1 localization at the plasma membrane would promote the recruitment and activation of its downstream effectors such as PAK and cortactin. Having shown that RAC1 was required for controlling YAP nuclear translocation downstream of β1 integrins, and that PAK1 activity was reduced in β1-deficient cells, we wondered whether YAP nuclear translocation was also dependent on PAK activity. We transiently expressed in both wild-type and β1-deficient cells the constitutively active mutant of PAK1 (PAK1T423E) and analyzed YAP subcellular localization. As observed previously with the expression of activated RAC1, the expression of constitutively active PAK1 also rescued the defective YAP nuclear localization in β1-deficient cells (Fig. 6C), whereas the pharmacological inhibition of group I PAK using IPA3 (a specific inhibitor of this class) in wild-type cells, significantly reduced it (Fig. 6D). Similarly, the expression of a dominant-negative form of PAK1 (PAK1K299R) resulted in the delocalization of YAP out of the nucleus (Fig. 6E). Altogether, our data strongly suggest that β1 integrins control YAP nuclear localization in a RAC/PAK1-dependent manner. As mentioned previously, SRC was described to mediate YAP nuclear translocation downstream of integrins. SRC was also shown to be required for RAC1 activity (29Choma D.P. Milano V. Pumiglia K.M. DiPersio C.M. Integrin α3β1-dependent activation of FAK/SRC regulates Rac1-mediated keratinocyte polarization on laminin-5.J. Invest.

Invest. 2011; 121: 4670-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether the loss of β1 integrin expression also impaired SRC activity. Indeed, we observed that in β1−/− cells SRC was not properly activated (Fig. 7A). Consistent with this observation, the expression of a constitutively activated SRC rescued β1-deficient cell proliferation as well as YAP nuclear accumulation (Fig. 7, B–D) and PAK1 activation (Fig. 7E). Yet, the inhibition of RAC1 was still able to block YAP nuclear translocation (Fig. 7D). Altogether, these data clearly indicated that SRC is downstream of β1 integrins and upstream of RAC1 in this signaling pathway. Next, we hypothesized that merlin, a known regulator of LATS1/2 (31Yin F. Yu J. Zheng Y. Chen Q. Zhang N"

Although a wide range of SIRT5 targets have been identified, the overall function of SIRT5 in organismal metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. Given that SIRT5 expression is highest in the heart and that sirtuins are commonly stress-response proteins, we used an established model of pressure overload-induced heart muscle hypertrophy caused by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to determine SIRT5's role in cardiac stress responses. Remarkably, SIRT5KO mice had reduced survival upon TAC compared with wild-type mice but exhibited no mortality when undergoing a sham control operation. The increased mortality with TAC was associated with increased pathological hypertrophy and with key abnormalities in both cardiac performance and ventricular compliance. By combining high-resolution MS-based metabolomic and proteomic analyses of cardiac tissues from wild-type and SIRT5KO mice, we found several biochemical abnormalities exacerbated in the SIRT5KO mice, including apparent decreases in fatty acid oxidation and glucose oxidation as well as an overall decrease in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH. Together, these abnormalities suggest that SIRT5 deacylates protein substrates involved in cellular oxidative metabolism to maintain mitochondrial energy production. Overall, the functional and metabolic results presented here suggest an accelerated development of cardiac dysfunction in SIRT5KO mice in response to TAC, explaining increased mortality upon cardiac stress. Our findings reveal a key role for SIRT5 in maintaining cardiac oxidative metabolism under pressure overload to ensure survival."
https://openalex.org/W2764320008,"Silybin is one of the effective, traditional Chinese medicines used as a hepatoprotective agent in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapy worldwide, and the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been recognized as an important factor involved in NAFLD development. However, little is known about the mechanisms of silybin in the regulation of high-fat diet (HFD)–induced liver inflammation. In our study, we found that silybin inhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the livers of HFD-fed mice and in cultured hepatocytes. Phosphorylation of inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE) 1α and eIF2α, expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein and cleaved caspase-1, and release of IL-1β were reduced by silybin. In addition, silybin inhibited the approach of calreticulin and translocase of outer membrane 20 (Tom20), prevented assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and suppressed the accumulation of acetylated a-tubulin in the perinuclear region. Both MEC-17 and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) were influenced by palmitate and silybin, whereas histone deacetylase 6 was not affected. In addition, supplementing NAD+ directly or increasing NAD+ concentration with silybin could maintain the activity of SIRT2. The anti-inflammatory effect of silybin was blocked by SIRT2 silencing or by the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2, as evidenced by NLRP3/ASC colocalization, AC-α-tubulin expression, and IL-1β release. These findings indicate that the NAD+/SIRT2 pathway is an important mediator through which silybin prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation during NAFLD.—Zhang, B., Xu, D., She, L., Wang, Z., Yang, N., Sun, R., Zhang, Y., Yan, C., Wei, Q., Aa, J., Liu, B., Wang G., Xie, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2762080276,"Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major source of fibrogenesis in the liver, contributing to cirrhosis. When activated, HSCs transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts and undergo profound functional alterations paralleling an overhaul of the transcriptome, the mechanism of which remains largely undefined. We investigated the involvement of the class III deacetylase sirtuin [silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)] in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. SIRT1 levels were down-regulated in the livers in mouse models of liver fibrosis, in patients with cirrhosis, and in activated HSCs as opposed to quiescent HSCs. SIRT1 activation halted, whereas SIRT1 inhibition promoted, HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts. Liver fibrosis was exacerbated in mice with HSC-specific deletion of SIRT1 [conditional knockout (cKO)], receiving CCl4 (1 mg/kg) injection or subjected to bile duct ligation, compared to wild-type littermates. SIRT1 regulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcription by deacetylating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in quiescent HSCs. Finally, EZH2 inhibition or PPARγ activation ameliorated fibrogenesis in cKO mice. In summary, our data suggest that SIRT1 plays an essential role guiding the transition of HSC phenotypes.-Li, M., Hong, W., Hao, C., Li, L., Wu, D., Shen, A., Lu, J., Zheng, Y., Li, P., Xu, Y.

However, the arginine demethylase responsible for this activity was not identified. JMJD6 (Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing protein 6) was the first arginine demethylase described, capable of demethylating arginine residues on histone H3R2 and histone H4R3 (40Chang B. Chen Y.

Our previous work demonstrated rapid demethylation of G3BP1 following arsenite stress. The emerging role of JMJD6 as a demethylase prompted us to investigate JMJD6 activity on G3BP1. Here we show that JMJD6 is a new component of SGs that directly interacts with G3BP1. Expression of JMJD6 specifically reduced the levels of ω-NG,NG-asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) modifications on proteins, including on G3BP1, and promoted SG assembly during arsenite stress. Furthermore, shRNA silencing of JMJD6 or chemical inhibition with a pan-Jmjc domain inhibitor decreased SG formation during stress. Mass spectrometry confirmed that G3BP1 was demethylated at Arg-435, Arg-447, and Arg-460 by overexpression of JMJD6. Lastly, rescue experiments showed that expression of wild-type JMJD6, but not a catalytically inactive mutant, caused demethylation of G3BP1 and promoted SG assembly during arsenite stress. Collectively, these data indicate that catalytic activity of JMJD6 results in G3BP1 demethylation that triggers SG assembly during oxidative stress and strongly suggest methylated G3BP1 is a substrate of JMJD6. G3BP1 is a dominant SG–nucleating protein regulated by phosphorylation and arginine methylation. Recently, the kinase responsible for G3BP1 phosphorylation was identified (39Reineke L.C. Tsai W.-C. Jain A. Kaelber J.T. Jung S.Y. Lloyd R.E. Casein kinase 2 is linked to stress granule dynamics through phosphorylation of the stress granule nucleating protein G3BP1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 37: e00596-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the demethylase(s) that governs SG condensation has not been resolved. G3BP1 is arginine-methylated, and JMJD6 was reported to demethylate methylarginine substrates, suggesting that JMJD6 might catalyze G3BP1 demethylation (40Chang B. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Bruick R.K.

To investigate whether JMJD6 is involved in the cellular stress granule response, we visualized the distribution of endogenous JMJD6 in U2OS and HeLa cells during arsenite stress. In unstressed cells, immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) indicated that JMJD6 was most strongly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1a, top panels), which agreed with previous studies from other groups (48Hahn P. Wegener I. Burrells A. Böse J. Wolf A. Erck C. Butler D. Schofield C.J. Böttger A. Lengeling A.

However, we found much of the cytoplasmic fraction of JMJD6 concentrated in cytoplasmic punctate foci after 30 min of arsenite treatment, which colocalized with the SG marker Tia1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 1a, bottom panels). To confirm that these JMJD6 foci are stress granules, we costained cells for JMJD6 and the SG marker G3BP1, during either arsenite, thapsigargin, or heat shock stress (Fig. 1b). We also confirmed that canonical SGs formed in these conditions by staining for translation factors eIF3B, eIF3c, and RNA-HuR (data not shown). Under all conditions, JMJD6 concentrated and colocalized in stress granules as indicated by this marker. To test whether G3BP1 interacts with JMJD6, we immunoprecipitated G3BP1 from unstressed and arsenite-stressed cells followed by Western blotting to detect JMJD6 in G3BP1 complexes. Our results indicated that JMJD6 associated with G3BP1 protein complexes under unstressed conditions, and there was an increase in association of these proteins during arsenite stress (Fig. 1c). The recruitment of JMJD6 into SGs induced by treatment with arsenite, thapsigargin, and heat shock suggested that JMJD6 is a new component of SGs. To understand the role of JMJD6 in stress responses, we used methods to manipulate JMJD6 activity to examine methylation levels in cells and how it impacts SG assembly. Overexpression of GFP-JMJD6 in U2OS cells resulted in 30% reduction of global ADMA signal in cells compared with a GFP-transfected control (Fig. 2b, left panel). Symmetric dimethyl arginine (SDMA) is another common arginine methylation pattern on proteins, but global SDMA signals are unaffected by JMJD6 overexpression (Fig. 2b, right panel), indicating that JMJD6 bears a substrate preference for ADMA-modified proteins. To further confirm the alteration of ADMA levels in cells correlated with enzymatic activity of JMJD6, we generated dual point mutations H187A/D189A in the catalytic domain of JMJD6, which has been shown to abolish enzymatic activity of JMJD6 (40Chang B.

U2OS cells expressing JMJD6M showed no alteration of ADMA levels in cells (Fig. 2b, left panel), suggesting that the reduction of ADMA levels of proteins correlated with enzymatic activity of JMJD6.

Squalene monooxygenase (SM) is the second rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and is regulated both transcriptionally and post-translationally.

The first 100 amino acids of SM (designated SM N100) are necessary for this degradative process and represent the shortest cholesterol-regulated degron identified to date. However, the fundamental intrinsic characteristics of this degron remain unknown. In this study, we performed a series of deletions, point mutations, and domain swaps to identify a 12-residue region (residues Gln-62–Leu-73), required for SM cholesterol-mediated turnover. Molecular dynamics and circular dichroism revealed an amphipathic helix within this 12-residue region. Moreover, 70% of the variation in cholesterol regulation was dependent on the hydrophobicity of this region. Of note, the earliest known Doa10 yeast degron, Deg1, also contains an amphipathic helix and exhibits 42% amino acid similarity with SM N100. Mutating SM residues Phe-35/Ser-37/Leu-65/Ile-69 into alanine, based on the key residues in Deg1, blunted SM cholesterol-mediated turnover. Taken together, our results support a model whereby the amphipathic helix in SM N100 attaches reversibly to the ER membrane depending on cholesterol levels; with excess, the helix is ejected and unravels, exposing a hydrophobic patch, which then serves as a degradation signal.

We previously showed that the first 100 amino acids of SM (SM N100) represent the region responsible for its cholesterol-mediated turnover (2Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J.

To date, this represents the shortest degron known to respond to cholesterol. However, the inherent elements of these 100 amino acids that permit the cholesterol-regulated turnover event remain unknown. Examining the components of this cholesterol-regulated degron is fundamental to understand how SM fulfills its function in responding to excess cholesterol and limiting cholesterol synthesis. We recently characterized the membrane topology of SM N100 (8Howe V. Chua N.K. Stevenson J. Brown A.J.

Both the N and C termini are cytosolic, and a re-entrant loop spanning 24 (between residues 18 and 41) to 33 residues (between residues 11 and 43) anchors the protein to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 1A). Excess cholesterol induces a conformational change in SM N100, detected at residues 9, 11 and 41, bordering the ER membrane–cytosol interface of the re-entrant loop (8Howe V. Chua N.K. Stevenson J.

We also demonstrated that membrane-associated RING finger protein 6 (MARCH6, also called TEB4) is the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the cholesterol-dependent degradation of SM (9Zelcer N.

In addition, the importance of intrinsically disordered regions in degrons is becoming more widely recognized (20Guharoy M. Bhowmick P. Sallam M. Tompa P.

Sequence composition of disordered regions fine-tunes protein half-life.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to identify the critical regions or residues required for cholesterol regulation of SM N100, and we have discovered a key amphipathic helix located in the second half of this degron, which shares remarkable sequence homology with Deg1. We previously showed that the N-terminal half of SM N100 (SM N49) was not cholesterol-regulated, and we showed higher basal protein expression than SM N100 (8Howe V. Chua N.K. Stevenson J. Brown A.J. The regulatory domain of squalene monooxygenase contains a re-entrant loop and senses cholesterol via a conformational change.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27533-27544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following this finding, we considered the possibility that the C-terminal half of SM N100 is critical for cholesterol regulation. We cloned the second half of SM N100 (SM N100 Δ48), fused to GFP, to test alongside the SM N49 and wild-type (WT) SM N100 constructs (Fig. 1B). SM N100 Δ48 protein expression was lower compared with WT SM N100 (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that the second half of SM N100 contains a degron element. We also compared the cholesterol regulation of the N- and C-terminal halves of SM N100, relative to WT SM N100. We found that cholesterol regulation in SM N49 was blunted, whereas SM N100 Δ48 remained cholesterol-regulated (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that both halves of SM N100 are required for normal cholesterol regulation and protein expression. Because cholesterol regulation was observed in the low-expressing SM N100 Δ48, and SM N49 showed blunted cholesterol regulation (Fig. 1, C and D), we predicted there was a region in the second half of SM N100 needed for cholesterol-mediated turnover. To test this, we created four constructs with successive 10-amino acid truncations of the C-terminal half of SM N100, generating SM N90, SM N80, SM N70, and SM N60, all fused to GFP (Fig. 2A). We tested the cholesterol regulation of these mutants and compared them with WT SM N100. Both SM N70 and SM N60 showed little to no cholesterol regulation (Fig. 2, B and C). Cholesterol regulation of SM N80 reached the same level as WT SM N100 (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that a region between residues 60 and 80 is necessary for cholesterol-mediated turnover of SM N100. To locate short linear motifs required for the cholesterol-regulated degron, we performed systematic site-directed mutagenesis of SM N100 by mutating every second amino acid to alanine and testing each mutant for cholesterol regulation (Fig. 3A). We expected point mutations that diminished cholesterol-mediated turnover would reveal important residues or motifs. Such approaches have been used to identify important residues in other cholesterol-related proteins such as Insig-2 (23Radhakrishnan A. Ikeda Y. Kwon H.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sterol-regulated transport of SREBPs from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi: oxysterols block transport by binding to Insig.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6511-6518Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), Scap (24Zhang Y. Motamed M. Seemann J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Identification of surface residues on Niemann-Pick C2 essential for hydrophobic handoff of cholesterol to NPC1 in lysosomes.Cell Metab. 2010; 12: 166-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We quantified the protein expression (Fig. 3B) and cholesterol regulation (Fig. 3C) of all 47 alanine mutants, normalized to WT SM N100. To increase stringency and reduce false discovery rates, we further imposed an arbitrary threshold, with relative protein expression levels below 0.5 or above 1.5 and relative cholesterol regulation below 0.8 or above 1.2 required to accept any observed statistical significance. We noted V32A did not express, whereas W2A and L70A expressed very poorly (Fig. 3B). Val-32 is located within the known re-entrant loop (8Howe V. Chua N.K. Stevenson J. Brown A.J. The regulatory domain of squalene monooxygenase contains a re-entrant loop and senses cholesterol via a conformational change.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 27533-27544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), so the mutation could be a destabilizing mutation that affects the native structure of the re-entrant loop. One mutant, L42A, containing a mutated residue at the boundary of the exiting re-entrant loop (Fig. 1A), showed significantly higher protein levels and blunted cholesterol regulation (Fig. 3, B and C). However, alanine mutations of the neighboring residues (V41A and S43A) had normal cholesterol regulation (data not shown). Taken together, our alanine-scanning approach failed to identify short linear motifs required for the cholesterol-mediated turnover of SM N100, indicating that other approaches are needed to elucidate the degron. Next, we took a comparative biology approach to identify motifs necessary for cholesterol regulation. SM N100 is well-conserved in mammals, but this region is lacking in lower eukaryotes such as yeast (2Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that hamster full-length SM undergoes cholesterol-mediated turnover, highlighting the mammalian conservation of SM regulation (2Gill S. Stevenson J. Kristiana I. Brown A.J. Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 260-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that SM N100 cholesterol regulation differs in lower order vertebrates due to evolutionary divergence giving rise to different primary amino acid sequences. We aligned the first 100 amino acids of human, chicken, zebrafish, and lamprey SM (Fig. 4A). These animals were chosen to represent different evolutionary time points, with the lamprey, a jawless fish, being one of the earliest known vertebrates. Our multiple sequence alignment showed 14 identical residues, which were mostly in the first half of SM N100 (Fig. 4A). Cholesterol regulation might be expected to emerge with species like chicken, which are more closely conserved with human SM N100 (62% similarity), whereas the most divergent sequences such as lamprey (43% similarity) (Fig. 4B) may not be cholesterol-regulated. To test this, we cloned SM N100-GFP constructs for each of these species and tested their protein expression and cholesterol regulation. Protein expression of chicken SM N100 was significantly higher than human SM N100, whereas both zebrafish and lamprey had low expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Unexpectedly, chicken SM N100, which had the highest similarity and identity to human SM N100 (Fig. 4B), showed blunted cholesterol regulation (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, zebrafish SM N100 remained cholesterol-regulated, and lamprey SM N100 was stabilized by cholesterol (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, these divergent sequences appear to affect both protein expression and cholesterol regulation in an unpredictable manner. We then investigated the overall protein sequence variability. We observed high sequence variability between residues 41–70 and 91–100 (Fig. 4E), consistent with the lack of conservation from the sequence alignment (Fig. 4A). The high variability and low conservation prompted us to determine whether disordered regions were present in SM N100, as disordered regions tend to be evolutionarily less conserved, exhibiting higher variability (26Forman-Kay J.D. Mittag T. From sequence and forces to structure, function, and evolution of intrinsically disordered proteins.Structure. 2013; 21: 1492-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). More importantly, disordered regions are recognized as essential features in degrons (18Melo S.P. Barbour K.W. Berger F.G. Cooperation between an intrinsically disordered region and a helical segment is required for ubiquitin-independent degradation by the proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 36559-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Guharoy M. Bhowmick P. Sallam M. Tompa P.

Sequence composition of disordered regions fine-tunes protein half-life.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Next, we obtained disordered predictions from 13 predictors. In both human and chicken SM N100, residues 91–100 were most frequently predicted to be disordered, followed by residues 81–90 and 51–60 (Fig. 4F). As expected, the disordered distribution was different in the two more distant species, zebrafish and lamprey. Taken together, we propose that the different cholesterol regulation and protein expression is not due to primary sequence divergence alone. Instead, structural differences, such as disordered regions, may explain the different responses observed in each degron variant. We next considered known degron examples in the literature. One of the earliest-identified and most well-studied degrons is Deg1, which contains an amphipathic helix necessary for degradation (12Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Degradation signal masking by heterodimerization of MATα2 and MATa1 blocks their mutual destruction by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it is degraded by Doa10, the yeast homolog of MARCH6 (14Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. A conserved ubiquitin ligase of the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum that functions in both ER-associated and Matα2 repressor degradation.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We compared Deg1 with our SM N100 degron through a pairwise alignment, and we observed SM N100 has 27% identity and 42% similarity with the 62 residues of Deg1. Moreover, we observed that four critical amphipathic helix residues of Deg1 (12Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Degradation signal masking by heterodimerization of MATα2 and MATa1 blocks their mutual destruction by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) aligned with SM N100. These residues corresponded to Phe-35, Ser-37, Leu-65, and Ile-69 in SM N100 (Fig. 5A). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we produced a quadruple alanine mutant F35A/S37A/L65A/I69A in both SM N100 and full-length SM. In both cases, protein levels increased for the mutants, whereas the cholesterol regulation was blunted (Fig. 5, B–E). This suggests that these four conserved degron residues play an important role in SM cholesterol-mediated turnover. Amphipathic helices have been implicated as degrons of other proteins (12Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M.

We hypothesized that there may be an amphipathic helix in the second half of SM N100, which is required for SM cholesterol-mediated turnover. We first determined any secondary structural elements in full-length SM with PSIPRED version 3.3 and focused on residues 50–100. We identified secondary helix structures from residues 62 to 73 and 90 to 99 (Fig. 6A). We also used PEP-FOLD3 and identified a helical structure between residues 61 and 71 (Fig. 6B), but no other secondary structure existed for the rest of the second half of SM N100 (data not shown). To verify this, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of SM N100 in an all-atomistic representation. Two independent molecular dynamics simulations with different ab initio modeled starting structures were performed (Fig. 6, C and D). The total computing time was 2.4 μs. Simulation 1 showed residues 59–61 and 68–71 formed a 310-helix (Fig. 6C), whereas simulation 2 showed residues 63–75 formed the longest and"

Partial deacetylation renders PEL cationic, a reaction catalyzed by the multidomain protein PelA, whose domain architecture and deacetylase activity have been described previously (11Colvin K.M. Alnabelseya N. Baker P. Whitney J.C. Howell P.L. Parsek M.R. PelA deacetylase activity is required for Pel polysaccharide synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutation of PelA residues involved in catalysis abrogate biofilm formation, suggesting that deacetylation of PEL is an essential modification. Our recent characterization of the outer membrane lipoprotein PelC revealed that this protein forms a dodecameric ring that positions a negatively charged surface toward the periplasm. We proposed that PelC functions as an electronegative funnel that guides cationic PEL toward the export channel formed by the outer membrane protein PelB (8Marmont L.S. Rich J.D. Whitney J.C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114: 2892-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PelB is a 135-kDa multidomain protein with properties suggestive of a transmembrane β-barrel at its C terminus, which we hypothesized is required for polysaccharide export (8Marmont L.S. Rich J.D. Whitney J.C. Whitfield G.B. Almblad H. Robinson H. Parsek M.R. Harrison J.J. Howell P.L.

U.S.A. 2017; 114: 2892-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The N terminus of PelB is thought to contain a large periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)-containing domain connected to the C-terminal porin by an ∼120-amino acid linker with poorly predicted secondary structure (8Marmont L.S.

Although our characterization of PelC has begun to provide insight into the translocation of PEL across the periplasmic space, important questions remain, including whether polysaccharide modification enzymes such as PelA are recruited to the secretion apparatus and, if so, how this process is facilitated. TPR motifs adopt a helix-turn-helix arrangement comprising ∼34 residues of alternating small and large amino acids. Multiple repeats are frequently arranged in tandem arrays, resulting in a series of antiparallel α-helices. In proteins possessing four or more tandem repeats, the TPR-containing domain adopts a right-handed superhelix (13Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D.

Ratajczak T. Versatile TPR domains accommodate different modes of target protein recognition and function.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2011; 16: 353-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). TPR motifs are found in proteins from all domains of life and function as protein–protein interaction modules, acting as scaffolds for large protein complexes involved in diverse cellular processes (15Zeytuni N.

Structural and functional discussion of the tetra-trico-peptide repeat, a protein interaction module.Structure. 2012; 20: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In bacteria, these include the maintenance of outer membrane integrity (16Krachler A.M. Sharma A. Cauldwell A. Papadakos G. Kleanthous C. TolA modulates the oligomeric status of YbgF in the bacterial periplasm.J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6961-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given the tendency of TPR-containing proteins to be involved in protein–protein interactions, we hypothesized that PelB may interact with other components of the PEL biosynthetic machinery and thus serve as a protein scaffold within the periplasm. Here, we describe an interaction between the TPR-containing domain of PelB and the multidomain enzyme PelA. Using specific TPR deletions, we found that when repeat 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 is deleted, the interaction between PelA and PelB is abrogated and PEL-dependent biofilm formation is abolished. Copurification experiments demonstrate a direct interaction between these two proteins and allowed us to assess whether the enzymatic activities of PelA were influenced by this interaction. We found that PelA–PelB complex formation increases the polysaccharide deacetylase activity of PelA, whereas its glycoside hydrolase activity is attenuated. Together, our results suggest that the TPR-containing domain of PelB acts as a scaffold, localizing PelA within the periplasm to the export machinery to increase polysaccharide deacetylation during PEL biosynthesis and biofilm development. PelA is a periplasmically localized protein (11Colvin K.M. Alnabelseya N. Baker P. Whitney J.C. Howell P.L. Parsek M.R. PelA deacetylase activity is required for Pel polysaccharide synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) essential for Pel biosynthesis. Given that this protein modifies the Pel polymer, we sought to determine whether this protein associates with any other Pel proteins with domains localized to the periplasm. For this and subsequent experiments, we used the P. aeruginosa PAO1 ΔwspF Δpsl PBADpel strain (parental), which has been engineered to enable l-arabinose-inducible expression of PEL (8Marmont L.S. Rich J.D. Whitney J.C. Whitfield G.B. Almblad H. Robinson H. Parsek M.R. Harrison J.J. Howell P.L.

PelA deacetylase activity is required for Pel polysaccharide synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To investigate a potential interaction between PelA and PelB, we generated a complementation vector to be used in a PAO1 ΔwspF Δpsl PBADpel ΔpelA strain (11Colvin K.M. Alnabelseya N. Baker P. Whitney J.C. Howell P.L. Parsek M.R. PelA deacetylase activity is required for Pel polysaccharide synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2013; 195: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Multisite recombination was used to assemble a miniTn7-based vector in which araC-PBAD was fused directly to the pelA open reading frame. The ΔwspF Δpsl PBADpel ΔpelA strain was then complemented with either wild-type pelA (wild type) or pelA encoding a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus (PelA-C-His6). Addition of the hexahistidine tag did not affect PelA stability, and this strain displayed pellicle formation and surface attachment phenotypes comparable with a strain expressing wild-type PelA (Fig. 1A). Next, we used nickel-affinity chromatography to purify PelA-C-His6 and analyzed the eluate using Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry. Western blotting with PelB-specific antibodies revealed a band in the PelA-C-His6 pulldown eluate, but not the PelA eluate, ∼40 kDa less than the expected molecular mass of PelB (Fig. 1B). Mass spectrometry analysis of the eluates confirmed the enrichment of both PelA and PelB in the PelA-C-His6 pulldown compared with the untagged control (Fig. 1C). The identified peptides almost exclusively belonged to the TPR domain of PelB. We hypothesize that the porin domain was perhaps destabilized and degraded during the purification process. These data also indicate that, under the conditions tested, PelA and PelB form a binary complex that does not strongly associate with other Pel proteins as PelC, PelD, and PelF were not significantly enriched, and peptides of PelE and PelG were not detected. Previously, we demonstrated that PelB is localized to the outer membrane (8Marmont L.S. Rich J.D. Whitney J.C. Whitfield G.B. Almblad H. Robinson H. Parsek M.R. Harrison J.J. Howell P.L. Oligomeric lipoprotein PelC guides Pel polysaccharide export across the outer membrane of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114: 2892-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Having identified an interaction between PelA and PelB, we hypothesized that PelA should localize to the outer membrane in a PelB-dependent manner. To investigate this, we used subcellular fractionation to determine the cellular location of the proteins. Following fractionation of the parental strain, we found that PelA was enriched in the outer membrane fraction compared with the periplasm (Fig. 1D). As described previously, some PelA and PelB are detected in the cytoplasmic and inner membrane compartments likely due to overexpression of the pel operon and saturation of the general protein secretion pathway (8Marmont L.S. Rich J.D. Whitney J.C. Whitfield G.B. Almblad H. Robinson H. Parsek M.R. Harrison J.J. Howell P.L.

U.S.A. 2017; 114: 2892-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consistent with our interaction data, in a strain lacking pelB, PelA no longer associated with the outer membrane. Complementation of ΔpelB with a wild-type pelB at the attTn7 site restored the localization of PelA to the outer membrane. These data suggest that PelB recruits PelA to the outer membrane. Our previous bioinformatics analyses suggest that PelB contains multiple TPR motifs between residues 69 and 728 (12Keiski C.-L. Harwich M. Jain S. Neculai A.M. Yip P. Robinson H. Whitney J.C. Riley L. Burrows L.L. Ohman D.E. Howell P.L. AlgK is a TPR-containing protein and the periplasmic component of a novel exopolysaccharide secretin.Structure. 2010; 18: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We predicted that PelB has 16 non-contiguous TPRs. Secondary structure prediction algorithms suggest regions 355–387 and 524–592 will be α-helical, but fold prediction algorithms fail to identify TPR motifs in these amino acid stretches (19Karpenahalli M.R. Lupas A.N. Söding J. TPRpred: a tool for prediction of TPR-, PPR- and SEL1-like repeats from protein sequences.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar). Proteins with TPRs are typically found in an uninterrupted parallel arrangement and are not defined by a consensus sequence but rather by a pattern of large and small amino acids at specific positions. Thus, we hypothesize that although residues 355–387 and 524–592 are not predicted to form TPRs, these predicted α-helical regions of PelB will be part of a superhelical arrangement and that PelB contains a total of 19 TPRs (R1–R19). To gain further insight into PelB function, we undertook structural studies of the TPR domain of PelB. As constructs encompassing the full-length TPR domain failed to crystallize, several different truncations of the TPR domain excluding the predicted signal sequence were pursued. A construct encompassing residues 248–625 of PelB crystallized, and the structure was solved using selenomethionine incorporation and the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion technique (Table 1). The crystals belong to space group P6522 with one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit. Examination of the density only allowed for residues 319–436, encompassing R8 to the first 15 residues of R11, to be modeled, and this structure is depicted in Fig. 2. SDS-PAGE of native PelB crystals confirmed that the predominant species migrated at a molecular mass corresponding to the residues modeled (supplemental Fig. S1B), demonstrating that degradation had occurred during the crystallization process. The all-helical structure forms two complete TPR motifs (Fig. 2, cyan and indigo) that correspond to R9 and R10. R9 (residues 355–387; Fig. 2, cyan) was not initially predicted to form a TPR (12Keiski C.-L. Harwich M. Jain S. Neculai A.M. Yip P. Robinson H. Whitney J.C. Riley L. Burrows L.L. Ohman D.E. Howell P.L. AlgK is a TPR-containing protein and the periplasmic component of a novel exopolysaccharide secretin.Structure. 2010; 18: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The first helices of R9 and R10 superimpose well; however, a distortion in the second helix of R10 is apparent (Fig. 2). We hypothesize that the conformation of R8 observed is not biologically relevant and that this repeat was likely distorted during the crystallization process. The C-terminal helix is missing the remaining 19 residues to complete R11. Our structure reveals the TPRs of PelB, including residues 355–387 (R9), which was previously not predicted to adopt this fold. Together, this suggests that the periplasmic domain of PelB forms a contiguous TPR domain (12Keiski C.-L. Harwich M. Jain S. Neculai A.M. Yip P. Robinson H. Whitney J.C. Riley L. Burrows L.L.

We hypothesize that PelA will be positioned close to the outer membrane with the deacetylase domain in proximity to the negatively charged surface of PelC to facilitate the export of cationic polymer. Therefore, to determine whether a specific region of the periplasmic domain of PelB was required for interaction with PelA, we systematically deleted individual TPRs starting from the C-terminal end of this domain (residue 728; R19; Fig. 3A). We used a similar genetic approach as described above for PelA. To determine whether deleting a single repeat resulted in a disruption of the PelA–PelB interaction, we used subcellular fractionation to characterize the enrichment of PelA in the periplasm compared with the outer membrane as an indirect measure of the interaction. We found that, for PelB ΔR19, ΔR18, ΔR17, and ΔR16, PelA was still enriched in the outer membrane compared with the periplasmic fraction, whereas for ΔR14, ΔR13, ΔR12, ΔR11, ΔR10, and ΔR9, PelA was found almost entirely in the periplasmic fraction, suggesting that each deletion significantly perturbed the interaction between PelA and PelB. In ΔR15 and ΔR8, although some PelA was detected in the periplasmic fraction, PelA was enriched in the outer membrane fraction; therefore we propose that these repeats indicate the C- and N-terminal boundaries, respectively, of the TPRs required for the PelA–PelB interaction (Fig. 3B). Having established which repeats are required to localize PelA to the outer membrane, we next tested whether the mislocalization of PelA affects PEL-dependent biofilm formation at the air–liquid interface (Fig. 3C, bottom, biofilm formation indicated by arrow). We found that ΔR14 to ΔR19 formed biofilms similar to the wild-type strain, whereas no biofilm was observed from ΔR9 to ΔR13 (Fig. 3C, bottom). These data correspond well with our subcellular fractionation data with the exception of ΔR14 as, although the interaction is significantly perturbed, it appears that the residual amount of PelA localized to the outer membrane is sufficient for biofilm formation. ΔR8 appeared to form a biofilm comparable with wild type, again delineating the boundary for the interaction. As the standing biofilm assay is qualitative and subject to interpretation, we quantified these observations by evaluating the surface attachment of these strains in a modified crystal violet assay. Surface attachment decreased from ΔR19 to ΔR14 and was completely abolished from ΔR13 to ΔR9. Surface attachment of ΔR8 is reduced compared with wild type (Fig. 3C, top), and this correlates with the subcellular fractionation data where some PelA is still found in the periplasm. PelB protein levels in each of the TPR deletion strains were comparable with wild type, suggesting that the TPR deletion does not affect protein stability and that biofilm abrogation is not due to a reduction in the levels of PelB (Fig. 3D). Together, these data suggest that a large surface area spanning multiple TPRs of PelB, specifically R9–R14, is required for the outer membrane localization of PelA and that an interaction between PelA and PelB is required for PEL-dependent biofilm formation. Because deletion of individual PelB TPRs R9–R14 alters the association of PelA with the outer membrane, we hypothesized that this region of the protein might directly interact with PelA. To test this, we next characterized the interaction between PelA and PelB in vitro by copurification using size-exclusion chromatography. For these studies, we used a construct encoding mature PelA without its native signal sequence (PelA(Δ46)) (11Colvin K.M. Alnabelseya N. Baker P. Whitney J.C. Howell P.L. Parsek M.R.

The retention volumes of purified PelA or PelB were determined by analytical gel filtration and apparent molecular masses were calculated by interpolation from a standard curve.

https://openalex.org/W2756923999,"Within the plant ATP-binding cassette transporter family, pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters play essential functions, such as in hormone transport or defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. NtPDR1 from Nicotiana tabacum has been shown to be involved in the constitutive defense against pathogens through the secretion of toxic cyclic diterpenes, such as the antimicrobial substrates cembrene and sclareol from the leaf hairs (trichomes). However, direct evidence of an interaction between NtPDR1 and terpenes is lacking. Here, we stably expressed NtPDR1 in N. tabacum BY-2 suspension cells. NtPDR1 was purified as an active monomer glycosylated at a single site in the third external loop. NtPDR1 reconstitution in proteoliposomes stimulated its basal ATPase activity from 21 to 38 nmol of Pi·mg-1·min-1, and ATPase activity was further stimulated by the NtPDR1 substrates cembrene and sclareol, providing direct evidence of an interaction between NtPDR1 and its two substrates. Interestingly, NtPDR1 was also stimulated by capsidiol, a sesquiterpene produced by N. tabacum upon pathogen attack. We also monitored the transcriptional activity from the NtPDR1 promoter in situ with a reporter gene and found that, although NtPDR1 expression was limited to trichomes under normal conditions, addition of methyl jasmonate, a biotic stress hormone, induced expression in all leaf tissues. This finding indicated that NtPDR1 is involved not only in constitutive but also in induced plant defenses. In conclusion, we provide direct evidence of an interaction between the NtPDR1 transporter and its substrates and that NtPDR1 transports compounds involved in both constitutive (diterpenes) and induced (sesquiterpenes) plant defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2763216026,"Heparanase (HPSE) is part of the biologic network triggered by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a complication of renal transplantation and acute kidney injury. During this period, the kidney or graft undergoes a process of macrophages recruitment and activation. HPSE may therefore control these biologic effects. We measured the ability of HPSE and its inhibitor, SST0001, to regulate macrophage polarization and the crosstalk between macrophages and HK-2 renal tubular cells during in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Furthermore, we evaluated in vivo renal inflammation, macrophage polarization, and histologic changes in mice subjected to monolateral I/R and treated with SST0001 for 2 or 7 d. The in vitro experiments showed that HPSE sustained M1 macrophage polarization and modulated apoptosis, the release of damage associated molecular patterns in post-H/R tubular cells, the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, and the up-regulation of TLRs on both epithelial cells and macrophages. HPSE also regulated M1 polarization induced by H/R-injured tubular cells and the partial epithelial–mesenchymal transition of these epithelial cells by M1 macrophages. All these effects were prevented by inhibiting HPSE. Furthermore, the inhibition of HPSE in vivo reduced inflammation and M1 polarization in mice undergoing I/R injury, partially restored renal function and normal histology, and reduced apoptosis. These results show for the first time that HPSE regulates macrophage polarization as well as renal damage and repair after I/R. HPSE inhibitors could therefore provide a new pharmacologic approach to minimize acute kidney injury and to prevent the chronic profibrotic damages induced by I/R.—Masola, V., Zaza, G., Bellin, G., Dall'Olmo, L., Granata, S., Vischini, G., Secchi, M.

https://openalex.org/W2757706163,"In the CNS, microglia are activated in response to injury or infection and in neurodegenerative diseases. The endocytic and cell signaling receptor, LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), is reported to suppress innate immunity in macrophages and oppose microglial activation. The goal of this study was to identify novel mechanisms by which LRP1 may regulate microglial activation. Using primary cultures of microglia isolated from mouse brains, we demonstrated that LRP1 gene silencing increases expression of proinflammatory mediators; however, the observed response was modest. By contrast, the LRP1 ligand, receptor-associated protein (RAP), robustly activated microglia, and its activity was attenuated in LRP1-deficient cells. An important element of the mechanism by which RAP activated microglia was its ability to cause LRP1 shedding from the plasma membrane. This process eliminated cellular LRP1, which is anti-inflammatory, and generated a soluble product, shed LRP1 (sLRP1), which is potently proinflammatory. Purified sLRP1 induced expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and the mRNA encoding inducible nitric-oxide synthase in both LRP1-expressing and -deficient microglia. LPS also stimulated LRP1 shedding, as did the heat-shock protein and LRP1 ligand, calreticulin. Other LRP1 ligands, including α2-macroglobulin and tissue-type plasminogen activator, failed to cause LRP1 shedding. Treatment of microglia with a metalloproteinase inhibitor inhibited LRP1 shedding and significantly attenuated RAP-induced cytokine expression. RAP and sLRP1 both caused neuroinflammation in vivo when administered by stereotaxic injection into mouse spinal cords. Collectively, these results suggest that LRP1 shedding from microglia may amplify and sustain neuroinflammation in response to proinflammatory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2760187019,"Cytotoxin-producing Klebsiella oxytoca is the causative agent of antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis (AAHC). Recently, the cytotoxin associated with AAHC was identified as tilivalline, a known pentacyclic pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) metabolite produced by K. oxytoca. Although this assertion of tilivalline's role in AAHC is supported by evidence from animal experiments, some key aspects of this finding appear to be incompatible with toxicity mechanisms of known PBD toxins. We therefore hypothesized that K. oxytoca may produce some other uncharacterized cytotoxins. To address this question, we investigated whether tilivalline alone is indeed necessary and sufficient to induce cytotoxicity or whether K. oxytoca also produces other cytotoxins. LC-MS- and NMR-based metabolomic analyses revealed the presence of an abundant tricyclic PBD, provisionally designated kleboxymycin, in the supernatant of toxigenic K. oxytoca strains. Moreover, by generating multiple mutants with gene deletions affecting tilivalline biosynthesis, we show that a tryptophanase-deficient, tilivalline-negative K. oxytoca mutant induced cytotoxicity in vitro similar to tilivalline-positive K. oxytoca strains. Furthermore, synthetic kleboxymycin exhibited greater than 9-fold higher cytotoxicity than tilivalline in TC50 cell culture assays. We also found that the biosynthetic pathways for kleboxymycin and tilivalline appear to overlap, as tilivalline is an indole derivative of kleboxymycin. In summary, our results indicate that tilivalline is not essential for inducing cytotoxicity observed in K. oxytoca-associated AAHC and that kleboxymycin is a tilivalline-related bacterial metabolite with even higher cytotoxicity.

MP production is elevated in patients with diabetes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that raising glucose above the physiological level of 5.5 mm would stimulate leukocytes to produce MPs and activate the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat pyrin domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. We found that when incubated in buffer with up to 20 mm glucose, human and murine neutrophils, but not monocytes, generate progressively more MPs with high interleukin (IL)-1β content. Enhanced MP production required generation of reactive chemical species by mitochondria, NADPH oxidase, and type 2 nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) and resulted in S-nitrosylation of actin. Depleting cells of capon (C-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase protein), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC), or pro-IL-1β prevented the hyperglycemia-induced enhancement of reactive species production, MP generation, and IL-1β synthesis. Additional components required for these responses included inositol 1,3,5-triphosphate receptors, PKC, and enhancement of filamentous-actin turnover. Numerous proteins become localized to short filamentous actin in response to S-nitrosylation, including vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, focal adhesion kinase, the membrane phospholipid translocation enzymes flippase and floppase, capon, NLRP3, and ASC.

https://openalex.org/W2760905236,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, subdivided into 6 subfamilies in mammals, have essential roles in sensory physiology. They respond to remarkably diverse stimuli, comprising thermal, chemical, and mechanical modalities, through opening or closing of channel gates. In this study, we systematically substituted the hydrophobic residues within the distal fragment of pore-lining helix S6 with hydrophilic residues and, based on Xenopus oocyte and mammalian cell electrophysiology and a hydrophobic gate theory, identified hydrophobic gates in TRPV6/V5/V4/C4/M8. We found that channel activity drastically increased when TRPV6Ala616 or Met617 or TRPV5Ala576 or Met577, but not any of their adjacent residues, was substituted with hydrophilic residues. Channel activity strongly correlated with the hydrophilicity of the residues at those sites, suggesting that consecutive hydrophobic residues TRPV6Ala616-Met617 and TRPV5Ala576-Met577 form a double-residue gate in each channel. By the same strategy, we identified a hydrophobic single-residue gate in TRPV4Iso715, TRPC4Iso617, and TRPM8Val976. In support of the hydrophobic gate theory, hydrophilic substitution at the gate site, which removes the hydrophobic gate seal, substantially increased the activity of TRP channels in low-activity states but had little effect on the function of activated channels. The double-residue gate channels were more sensitive to small changes in the gate's hydrophobicity or size than single-residue gate channels. The unconventional double-reside gating mechanism in TRP channels may have been evolved to respond especially to physiologic stimuli that trigger relatively small gate conformational changes.-Zheng, W., Hu, R., Cai, R., Hofmann, L., Hu, Q., Fatehi, M., Long, W., Kong, T., Tang, J., Light, P., Flockerzi, V., Cao, Y., Chen, X.-Z.

Here, we investigated the mechanism for the evolution of a triple IN substitution (T124N/V165I/T174I) that emerges in cell culture with a representative MINI, KF116. We show that HIV-1 NL4-3(IN T124N/V165I/T174I) confers marked (>2000-fold) resistance to KF116. Two IN substitutions (T124N/T174I) directly weaken inhibitor binding at the dimer interface of the catalytic core domain but at the same time markedly impair HIV-1 replication capacity. Unexpectedly, T124N/T174I IN substitutions inhibited proteolytic processing of HIV-1 polyproteins Gag and Gag-Pol, resulting in immature virions. Strikingly, the addition of the third IN substitution (V165I) restored polyprotein processing, virus particle maturation, and significant levels of replication capacity. These results reveal an unanticipated role of IN for polyprotein proteolytic processing during virion morphogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2761725448,"Proper neural commitment is essential for ensuring the appropriate development of the human brain and for preventing neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and intellectual disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the neural commitment in humans remain elusive. Here, we report the establishment of a neural differentiation system based on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and on comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis of transcriptome dynamics during early hESC differentiation. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we reveal that the hESC neurodevelopmental trajectory has five stages: pluripotency (day 0); differentiation initiation (days 2, 4, and 6); neural commitment (days 8-10); neural progenitor cell proliferation (days 12, 14, and 16); and neuronal differentiation (days 18, 20, and 22). These stages were characterized by unique module genes, which may recapitulate the early human cortical development. Moreover, a comparison of our RNA-sequencing data with several other transcriptome profiling datasets from mice and humans indicated that Module 3 associated with the day 8-10 stage is a critical window of fate switch from the pluripotency to the neural lineage. Interestingly, at this stage, no key extrinsic signals were activated. In contrast, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts, we also found that intrinsic hub transcription factors, including the schizophrenia-associated SIX3 gene and septo-optic dysplasia-related HESX1 gene, are required to program hESC neural determination. Our results improve the understanding of the mechanism of neural commitment in the human brain and may help elucidate the etiology of human mental disorders and advance therapies for managing these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2762651085,"PI-PLCβ1 is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) pathogenesis. Moreover, the increased activity of PI-PLCβ1 reduces the expression of PKC-α, which, in turn, delays the cell proliferation and is linked to erythropoiesis. Lenalidomide is currently used in low-risk patients with MDS and del (5q), where it can suppress the del(5q) clone and restore normal erythropoiesis. In this study, we analyzed the effect of lenalidomide on 16 patients with low-risk del(5q) MDS, as well as del(5q) and non-del(5q) hematopoietic cell lines, mainly focusing on erythropoiesis, cell cycle, and PI-PLCβ1/PKC-a signaling. Overall, 11 patients were evaluated clinically, and 10 (90%) had favorable responses; the remaining case had a stable disease. At a molecular level, both responder patients and del(5q) cells showed a specific induction of erythropoiesis, with a reduced γ /β-globin ratio, an increase in glycophorin A, and a nuclear translocation of PKC-α. Moreover, lenalidomide could induce a selective G0/G1 arrest of the cell cycle in del(5q) cells, slowing down the rate proliferation in those cells. Altogether, our results could not only better explain the role of PI-PLC β1/PKC-α signaling in erythropoiesis but also lead to a better comprehension of the lenalidomide effect on del(5q) MDS and pave the way to innovative, targeted therapies.—Poli, A., Ratti, S., Finelli, C., Mongiorgi, S., Clissa, C., Lonetti, A., Cappellini, A., Catozzi, A., Barraco, M., Suh, P.-G., Manzoli, L., McCubrey, J.

MR studies have been conducted on various rodent organs, such as liver, adipose tissue, heart, bones, and skeletal muscle, to elucidate its benefits to the healthspan; however, studies of the direct effect of MR on kidneys are lacking. To investigate the renal effects of MR, we used young and aged unilateral nephrectomized and 5/6 nephrectomized (5/6Nx) mice. Our studies indicated that MR mice experienced polydipsia and polyuria compared with control-fed counterparts. Urine albumin, creatinine, albumin-to-creatinine ratio, sulfur amino acids, and electrolytes were reduced in MR mice. Kidneys of MR mice up-regulated genes that are involved in ion transport, such as Aqp2, Scnn1a, and Slc6a19, which indicated a response to maintain osmotic balance. In addition, we identified renoprotective biomarkers that are affected by MR, such as clusterin and cystatin C. Of importance, MR attenuated kidney injury in 5/6Nx mice by down-regulating inflammation and fibrosis mechanisms. Thus, our studies in mice show the important role of kidneys during MR in maintaining osmotic homeostasis.

Biotin-switch assays indicated that SlPDK1 is a target of S-nitrosylation. Moreover, the kinase activity of SlPDK1 was inhibited by S-nitrosoglutathione in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that SlPDK1 activity is abrogated by S-nitrosylation. The S-nitrosoglutathione–induced inhibition was reversible in the presence of a reducing agent but additively enhanced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

During oocyte maturation, MTOCs undergo remodeling processes, including decondensation, fragmentation, and self-organization. However, the underlying mechanisms of MTOC remodeling in mouse oocytes are not well understood. We showed that two pericentriolar proteins, Cep192 and Cep152, play crucial roles during MTOC remodeling in mouse oocytes. Cep192 is present in MTOCs at all stages of oocyte maturation, and its depletion induces ablation of MTOCs, delay in spindle formation, and abnormal chromosomal alignment in spindles. In the case of Cep152, its localization on MTOCs is limited at the germinal vesicle stage and then disappears from the MTOCs after the germinal vesicle breakdown stage. Cep152 exclusion from MTOCs is involved in the fragmentation of MTOCs, and it is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity.

Metabolites and pathways previously implicated as signals for GIIS were measured in the cells at 2–25 mm glucose, with or without 5 mm metformin. We defined three criteria to identify candidate signals: 1) glucose-responsiveness, 2) sensitivity to metformin-induced inhibition of the glucose effect at intermediate glucose concentrations, and 3) alleviation of metformin inhibition by elevated glucose concentrations. Despite the lack of recovery from metformin-induced impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism (glucose oxidation, O2 consumption, and ATP production), insulin secretion was almost completely restored at elevated glucose concentrations. Meeting the criteria for candidates involved in promoting GIIS were the following metabolic indicators and metabolites: cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio (inferred from the dihydroxyacetone phosphate:glycerol-3-phosphate ratio), mitochondrial membrane potential, ADP, Ca2+, 1-monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, malonyl-CoA, and HMG-CoA.

When combined, these factors enhanced ELC1 binding 49-fold (to a Kd of 12 nm). Using the full-length MyoA motor (residues 1–831), we then showed that, in addition to coordinating the neck region, ELC1 appears to engage the MyoA converter subdomain, which couples the motor domain to the neck. These data support an assembly model where staged binding events cooperate to yield high-affinity complexes that are able to maximize force transduction. Protozoan parasites of phylum Apicomplexa cause significant disease in humans and animals.

Central to the pathogenesis of apicomplexans is a unique form of substrate-dependent locomotion termed “gliding motility,” which is essential for traversing the environment and invading host cells (7Heintzelman M.B. Gliding motility in apicomplexan parasites.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 46: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Driving motility is a class XIV unconventional myosin motor (MyoA), which is notably divergent from canonical myosins in that it lacks a “tail” and conventional sequence motifs in both the neck and motor regions (8Foth B.J.

Here we use a combination of solution-binding and structural studies to establish a molecular blueprint of the MyoA–MLC1–ELC1 complex from the model organism T. gondii. Our data support a model that relies on staged and cooperative binding events to generate high-affinity complexes that are optimal for efficient force transduction. These data, combined with the divergence of MyoA from canonical myosins, may prove valuable for ongoing research in targeted therapeutic development. To map the assembly of MLC1 and ELC1 on MyoA, we first synthesized a MyoA neck peptide incorporating residues 775–818, which was designed based on secondary structure predictions and previous studies of MyoA from T. gondii and Plasmodium falciparum (17Williams M.J.

A C775S mutation was included to prevent spurious disulfide bond formation with free cysteines in ELC1. We recombinantly produced full-length ELC1 and an N-terminal deletion construct of MLC1 (Ala66–Glu210; hereafter referred to simply as MLC1). Notably, the N-terminal tail was also removed in related plasmodium experiments (18Douse C.H. Green J.L. Salgado P.S. Simpson P.J. Thomas J.C. Langsley G. Holder A.A. Tate E.W. Cota E.

Chem. 2012; 287: 36968-36977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and actin-based motility assays show that its removal does not affect in vitro motility, because MyoA bound with either full-length MLC1 or the Ala66–Glu210 truncation moved actin filaments with no significant difference in velocity (2.58 ± 0.25 or 2.62 ± 0.02 μm/s, respectively). Solution-binding studies were then performed using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), which quantifies exchange of amide hydrogens with deuterium to reveal differences in secondary structure upon complex formation. HDX-MS studies were carried out using a short pulse of deuterium exposure (3 s at 0 and 23 °C) with MyoA neck peptide (775–818) in the presence of MLC1 and ELC1 individually and collectively (Fig. 2a). The apo MyoA neck peptide was fully deuterated at every time point of exchange, indicating a complete lack of secondary structure. Decreased amide exchange was observed in residues 775–795 upon ELC1 binding, consistent with a recent study that identified a binding region of 770–800 (17Williams M.J. Alonso H. Enciso M. Egarter S. Sheiner L. Meissner M. Striepen B. Smith B.J. Tonkin C.J. Two essential light chains regulate the MyoA lever arm to promote Toxoplasma gliding motility.MBio. 2015; 6 (e00815): e00845Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). MLC1 binding induced large decreases in exchange in residues 801–818. These decreases in HDX suggest that there is a disorder-order transition in the MyoA neck peptide upon either MLC1 or ELC1 binding. MLC1 binding alone also induced a small decrease in exchange in residues 779–784, which might reflect either an additional MLC1 protein binding with low affinity in the absence of ELC1 or MLC1 causing an allosteric conformational change at the ELC1 binding site. We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to address this possibility and definitively measure stoichiometry. These data show that MLC1 bound to MyoA neck constructs 775–818 and 801–818 with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 2b) (Table 1), consistent with a discrete binary complex. Notably, a larger entropic penalty was associated with MLC1 binding the full MyoA neck (775–818) (Table 1), consistent with the HDX data that showed a general order imparted by MLC1 binding.Table 1Summary of ITC thermodynamic parametersLight chainMyoA/light chainCaCl2Molar ratioKdΔH−TΔSnmkcal/molkcal/molMLC1801–818−1.05 ± 0.0110.0 ± 1.4−26.9 ± 0.216.0 ± 0.2775–818−1.00 ± 0.0143.1 ± 6.5−40.7 ± 0.630.6 ± 0.6ELC1775–818−0.99 ± 0.03590.6 ± 46.5−5.7 ± 0.2−3.0 ± 0.1+1.02 ± 0.0382.8 ± 17.7−10.4 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.2775–818/MLC1−1.02 ± 0.0471.8 ± 5.0−9.9 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.1+1.02 ± 0.0411.5 ± 5.2−13.2 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.5FL/MLC1−1.02 ± 0.011.9 ± 1.5−15.8 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.8ELC1 WT+0.97 ± 0.382.3 E4 ± 0.9 E41.3 ± 0.3−7.6 ± 0.1MgCl20.34 ± 0.0914.4 E4 ± 2.1 E49.0 ± 2.5−14.3 ± 2.4ELC1 D80A+1.43 ± 0.051.8 E4 ± 0.3 E40.9 ± 0.1−7.3 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To complement the solution-binding studies and further dissect the molecular interface, we next determined the 1.85 Å resolution crystal structure of MLC1 in complex with a truncated MyoA neck peptide (Fig. 2c).

Notably, however, MLC1 lacks functional calcium-binding motifs, and no role for calcium was identified from previous studies with the plasmodium homologue PfMTIP (11Herm-Götz A. Weiss S. Stratmann R.

The complex is stabilized via an apical salt bridge (MLC1, Asp145–MyoA, Arg808) (Fig. 2c, inset 1) and a basal, interdomain clamp, which secures MLC1 in a closed conformation around MyoA with a pair of hydrogen bonds (MLC1, Glu179–backbone amides of Tyr114 and Ala115) (Fig. 2c, inset 2). Overall, the buried interface between MLC1 and MyoA is largely electrostatic in nature (Fig. 2c, right panels). Although residues 801–818 of MyoA adopt an ordered α-helix, consistent with the HDX results (Fig. 2a), the C-terminal extension (819–831) lacks secondary structure, and its conformation appears to be a by-product of the crystal-packing interface.

Notably, calcium was previously observed to enhance the thermostability of T. gondii ELC1 (17Williams M.J. Alonso H. Enciso M. Egarter S. Sheiner L. Meissner M. Striepen B. Smith B.J. Tonkin C.J.

Binding of a newly identified essential light chain to expressed Plasmodium falciparum class XIV myosin enhances actin motility.BioRXiv. 2017; 10.1101/127118Google Scholar). To assess the ability of ELC1 to directly coordinate Ca2+, we generated D15A and D80A mutants, corresponding to key Ca2+-coordinating residues of putative EF hands 1 and 2, respectively, based on the EF-hand consensus motif (Fig. 3a). HDX-MS revealed significant decreases in exchange in the N-terminal lobes (residues ∼1–58) of ELC1 WT and D80A in the presence of calcium; however, no decreases in exchange were observed in the D15A mutant (Fig. 3b). ITC measurement revealed low-micromolar affinity of Ca2+ binding to ELC1 WT and D80A but no binding to D15A (Fig. 3c). These data definitively show that ELC1 possesses a single functional EF-hand motif capable of directly binding Ca2+ ions. It is of note that ELC1 was also shown to bind Mg2+, albeit with an affinity at least 6-fold weaker (Table 1). We next reasoned that an ELC1–Ca2+ complex might display enhanced binding to the MyoA neck. ITC experiments revealed greater than a 7-fold (Kd = 591 nm to 83 nm) stronger binding affinity of ELC1 to MyoA (775–818) when titrations were carried out in the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 3d). Together, these results are consistent with a model where calcium functions as a regulator for ELC1 binding to the MyoA neck. Through mapping of the molecular interfaces, we established that MLC1 and ELC1 bind adjacent sites on the MyoA neck (Fig. 2a). The close proximity of the two light chain-binding sites suggests the possibility of direct interactions between light chains, as observed in canonical myosins (22Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. A model of Ca2+-free calmodulin binding to unconventional myosins reveals how calmodulin acts as a regulatory switch.Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure of the regulatory domain of scallop myosin at 2 A resolution: implications for regulation.Structure. 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This, coupled with the observation that MLC1 indirectly orders the ELC1 binding region in absence of ELC1 (Fig. 2a), led us to speculate that ELC1 may be cooperatively recruited to the MyoA neck when MLC1 is already present. We reasoned that if such an interaction were to occur, the affinity for ELC1 should be greater for the preformed MyoA–MLC1 complex. To test this, ITC experiments were performed assessing the affinity of ELC1 binding to the MyoA neck peptide (775–818), with the added step of prebinding MLC1 to the peptide (Fig. 3e). These experiments showed significantly stronger binding of ELC1 to MyoA when MLC1 is prebound (Kd = 591 nm to 72 nm). It is worth noting that the reverse experiment, binding MLC1 to the preformed MyoA–ELC1 complex, was attempted but could not be completed due to limited solubility of the MyoA–ELC1 complex. The enhanced binding supports an assembly mechanism that relies on cooperative binding. Repeating these experiments in the presence of CaCl2 further strengthened binding of ELC1 to MyoA–MLC1 (Kd = 12 nm). These data support a model where ELC1 binds weakly on its own, but calcium and MLC1-based cooperative recruitment of ELC1 combine to yield a highly stable ternary complex. To control for the fact that our previous binding studies were performed with truncated neck peptides and with the C775S mutation, we next used ITC to measure the affinity of ELC1 for the full-length, WT MyoA (1–831) prebound with MLC1 (Fig. 4a). Full-length recombinant MyoA was produced in insect cells by co-expressing with MLC1 and the recently identified myosin chaperone, UNC (16Bookwalter C.S. Kelsen A. Leung J.M. Ward G.E. Trybus K.M. A Toxoplasma gondii class XIV myosin, expressed in Sf9 cells with a parasite co-chaperone, requires two light chains for fast motility.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 30832-30841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Notably, co-expression with MLC1 was required to stabilize the neck region of full-length MyoA, and thus we were unable to perform ITC studies with the apo form of the motor. These experiments revealed significantly stronger binding of ELC1 to full-length MyoA (1–831), compared with the truncated MyoA neck peptide (775–818) (Kd = 72 nm to 1.9 nm). Although our previous experiments suggest it is likely that the addition of Ca2+ would further enhance binding affinity, a Kd of 1 nm is near the detection limit of ITC, and thus, enhanced binding could not be accurately measured. We reasoned that the increase in affinity was likely due to interactions between ELC1 and additional regions of full-length MyoA not represented in the MyoA peptide-based experiments. Previous genetic studies have shown that MyoA residues 706–763 may form the “converter subdomain” (11Herm-Götz A. Weiss S. Stratmann R. Fujita-Becker S. Ruff C. Meyhöfer E. Soldati T. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Soldati D. Toxoplasma gondii myosin A and its light chain: a fast, single-headed, plus-end-directed motor.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), a discrete region of the myosin responsible for transducing small conformational changes in the motor domain, that are then amplified into larger steps by the swinging motion of the neck region. This led us to hypothesize that ELC1 could form contacts with the converter subdomain of MyoA, in addition to its contacts with the MyoA neck. To test this hypothesis, HDX-MS was performed on the MyoA (1–831)–MLC1 complex in the presence and absence of ELC1–Ca2+ (Fig. 4, b and c). These results showed the expected reduction in deuterium incorporation in the MyoA neck (775–818) as observed previously (Fig. 2a). Notably, however, an additional region of reduced deuterium incorporation on MyoA (∼710–740) was observed that corresponds to the predicted converter subdomain (Fig. 4, b and c). Thus, it appears that ELC1 engages two distinct regions on MyoA (710–740 and 775–795), resulting in an exceptionally stable complex that is optimized for force transduction. Interestingly, an isolated region of the MyoA N terminus also showed reduced deuteration in response to ELC1 binding consistent with a stabilizing interaction (Fig. 4b). Notably, the N terminus of MyoA has been shown to contain a regulatory phosphorylation site important for parasite egress (27Gaji R.Y. Johnson D.E. Treeck M. Wang M. Hudmon A. Arrizabalaga G. Phosphorylation of a myosin motor by TgCDPK3 facilitates rapid initiation of motility During Toxoplasma gondii egress.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11: e1005268Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and ELC1 was shown to interact with the N terminus of smooth muscle myosin type II (28Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C.

However, the variability in the N termini of myosins makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the role of an interaction between the N termini of MyoA and ELC1. The structure of the full-length MyoA ternary complex will likely be required to ultimately validate this putative interaction. Apicomplexan parasites rely on a unique form of “gliding motility” powered by a divergent class XIV myosin motor.

https://openalex.org/W2761597439,"We found that the orally administered thermolysin digest of β-conglycinin exhibits antidepressant-like effects in tail suspension and forced swim tests in mice. A comprehensive peptide analysis of the digest using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed, and LSSTQAQQSY emerged as a candidate antidepressant-like peptide. Orally administered synthetic LSSTQAQQSY exhibited antidepressant-like effects at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg; therefore, we named the decapeptide soy-deprestatin. In contrast, intraperitoneally administered soy-deprestatin was ineffective. We then hypothesized that it acted on the gut, and its signal was transferred to the brain. Indeed, orally administered soy-deprestatin exhibited antidepressant-like activity in sham-treated, but not vagotomized, mice. Oral administration of soy-deprestatin also increased the c-Fos expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract, which receives inputs from the vagus nerve. These results suggested that the antidepressant-like effects were mediated by the vagus nerve. Thermolysin digest- and soy-deprestatin–induced antidepressant-like effects were also blocked by antagonists of serotonin 5-HT1A, dopamine D1, or GABAA receptors. We also clarified the order of receptor activation as 5-HT1A, D1, and GABAA, using selective agonists and antagonists. Taken together, soy-deprestatin may exhibit antidepressant-like effects after oral administration via a novel pathway mediated by 5-HT1A, followed by D1 and GABAA systems. This is the first orally active peptide demonstrating antidepressant-like effects via gut–brain communication.—Mori, Y., Asakura, S., Yamamoto, A., Odagiri, S., Yamada, D., Sekiguchi, M., Wada, K., Sato, M., Kurabayashi, A., Suzuki, H., Kanamoto, R., Ohinata, K.

Here we studied the subcellular localization of human ClC-4 in heterologous expression systems. ClC-4 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon overexpression in HEK293T cells. Co-expression with distinct ClC-3 splice variants targets ClC-4 to late endosome/lysosomes (ClC-3a and ClC-3b) or recycling endosome (ClC-3c). When expressed in cultured astrocytes, ClC-4 sorted to endocytic compartments in WT cells but was retained in the ER in Clcn3−/− cells. To understand the virtual absence of ER-localized ClC-4 in WT astrocytes, we performed association studies by high-resolution clear native gel electrophoresis. Although other CLC channels and transporters form stable dimers, ClC-4 was mostly observed as monomer, with ClC-3–ClC-4 heterodimers being more stable than ClC-4 homodimers. We conclude that unique oligomerization properties of ClC-4 permit regulated targeting of ClC-4 to various endosomal compartment systems via expression of different ClC-3 splice variants.

https://openalex.org/W2760871452,"Hippocampal neurogenesis is a lifelong process whereby new neurons are produced and integrate into the host circuitry within the hippocampus. It is regulated by a multitude of extrinsic and intrinsic regulators and is believed to contribute to certain hippocampal-dependent cognitive tasks. Hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognition have been demonstrated to be impaired after increases in the levels of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the hippocampus, such as that which occurs in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. IL-1β also suppresses the expression of TLX (orphan nuclear receptor tailless homolog), which is an orphan nuclear receptor that functions to promote neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and suppress neuronal differentiation; therefore, manipulation of TLX represents a potential strategy with which to prevent the antiproliferative effects of IL-1β. In this study, we assessed the mechanism that underlies IL-1β–induced changes in TLX expression and determined the protective capacity of TLX to mitigate the effects of IL-1β on embryonic rat hippocampal neurosphere expansion. We demonstrate that IL-1β activated the NF-κB pathway in proliferating NPCs and that this activation was responsible for IL-1β–induced changes in TLX expression. In addition, we report that enhancing TLX expression prevented the IL-1β–induced suppression of neurosphere expansion. Thus, we highlight TLX as a potential protective regulator of the antiproliferative effects of IL-1β on hippocampal neurogenesis.—Ó’Leime, C. S., Kozareva, D. A., Hoban, A. E., Long-Smith, C.

Pseudomonas fluorescens has a TliDEF ATP-binding cassette transporter, a type I secretion system, which recognizes C-terminal LARD3 signal sequence of thermostable lipase TliA. Many proteins are secreted by TliDEF in vivo when recombined with LARD3, but there are still others that cannot be secreted by TliDEF even when LARD3 is attached. However, the factors that determine whether or not a recombinant protein can be secreted through TliDEF are still unknown. Here, we recombined LARD3 with several proteins and examined their secretion through TliDEF. We found that the proteins secreted via LARD3 are highly negatively charged with highly-acidic isoelectric points (pI) lower than 5.5. Attaching oligo-aspartate to lower the pI of negatively-charged recombinant proteins improved their secretion, and attaching oligo-arginine to negatively-charged proteins blocked their secretion by LARD3. In addition, negatively supercharged green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed improved secretion, whereas positively supercharged GFP did not secrete. These results disclosed that proteins’ acidic pI and net negative charge are major factors that determine their secretion through TliDEF. Homology modeling for TliDEF revealed that TliD dimer forms evolutionarily-conserved positively-charged clusters in its pore and substrate entrance site, which also partially explains the pI dependence of the TliDEF-dependent secretions. In conclusion, lowering the isoelectric point improved LARD3-mediated protein secretion, both widening the range of protein targets for efficient production via secretion and signifying an important aspect of ABC transporter–mediated secretions.

However, it is unclear how Δ9-desaturase expression is regulated in response to changes in the levels of fatty acid desaturation. In this study, we found that the degradation of DESAT1, the sole Δ9-desaturase in the Drosophila cell line S2, was significantly enhanced when the amounts of unsaturated acyl chains of membrane phospholipids were increased by supplementation with unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acids. In contrast, inhibition of DESAT1 activity remarkably suppressed its degradation. Of note, removal of the DESAT1 N-terminal domain abolished the responsiveness of DESAT1 degradation to the level of fatty acid unsaturation. Further truncation and amino acid replacement analyses revealed that two sequential prolines, the second and third residues of DESAT1, were responsible for the unsaturated fatty acid–dependent degradation. Although degradation of mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) was unaffected by changes in fatty acid unsaturation, introduction of the N-terminal sequential proline residues into SCD1 conferred responsiveness to unsaturated fatty acid–dependent degradation. Furthermore, we also found that the Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease calpain is involved in the sequential proline–dependent degradation of DESAT1.

One of these retinoids, all-trans-retinal, is released in the rod outer segment by photoactivated rhodopsin after light excitation. Following its release, all-trans-retinal is reduced by the retinol dehydrogenase RDH8 to all-trans-retinol in an NADPH-dependent reaction. However, all-trans-retinal can also react with outer segment components, sometimes forming lipofuscin precursors, which after conversion to lipofuscin accumulate in the lysosomes of the retinal pigment epithelium and display cytotoxic effects. Here, we have imaged the fluorescence of all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinal, and lipofuscin precursors in real time in single isolated mouse rod photoreceptors. We found that IRBP removes all-trans-retinol from individual rod photoreceptors in a concentration-dependent manner. The rate constant for retinol removal increased linearly with IRBP concentration with a slope of 0.012 min−1 μm−1. IRBP also removed all-trans-retinal, but with much less efficacy, indicating that the reduction of retinal to retinol promotes faster clearance of the photoisomerized rhodopsin chromophore. The presence of physiological IRBP concentrations in the extracellular medium resulted in lower levels of all-trans-retinal and retinol in rod outer segments following light exposure. It also prevented light-induced lipofuscin precursor formation, but it did not remove precursors that were already present.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is quite possibly the most widely used assay for characterizing the interactions between TFs and specific sites on chromatin. ChIP typically uses formaldehyde to cross-link TFs to their chromatin sites (14Solomon M.J. Varshavsky A. Formaldehyde-mediated DNA-protein cross-linking: a probe for in vivo chromatin structures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and although it is an undeniably powerful approach for determining transcription factor-binding locations with high precision (3Rhee H.S. Pugh B.F. Genome-wide structure and organization of eukaryotic pre-initiation complexes.Nature. 2012; 483: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), standard ChIP assays are static measurements that do not provide unambiguous insight into the in vivo kinetics of these dynamic interactions. Several assays have expanded ChIP to attempt to capture these relationships. We previously developed a ChIP-based method, the cross-linking kinetics (CLK) assay, which exploits the time dependence of formaldehyde–cross-linking to model chromatin-TF–binding dynamics on a broad time scale and at individual loci (15Poorey K. Viswanathan R. Carver M.N. Karpova T.S. Cirimotich S.M. McNally J.G. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T. Measuring chromatin interaction dynamics on the second time scale at single-copy genes.Science. 2013; 342: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this approach, cells are incubated with formaldehyde for various periods of time; unreacted formaldehyde is then quenched, and the extent of DNA site cross-linking of a TF of interest at each time point is quantified by ChIP. The time-dependent increase in ChIP signal results from a combination of time-dependent formaldehyde reactivity and time-dependent binding of free TF molecules to unoccupied DNA sites in the cell population. To distinguish kinetic effects of cross-linking chemistry from kinetic effects of TF binding, measurements are made using congenic cells differing only in the concentration of TF, and the data are fit using both sets of data simultaneously (15Poorey K. Viswanathan R. Carver M.N. Karpova T.S. Cirimotich S.M. McNally J.G. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T.

A challenge with the development of locus-specific kinetic assays such as CLK is that aspects of the effects of formaldehyde on cells largely remain a black box (17Gavrilov A. Razin S.V. Cavalli G. In vivo formaldehyde–cross-linking: it is time for black box analysis.Brief. Funct. Genomics. 2015; 14: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and validation of the extracted dynamic parameters is difficult because complementary approaches are still being developed, and there are few “gold standard” interactions with convergent kinetic measurements obtained by different approaches. Support for the CLK approach was obtained by measurement of binding dynamics for two TFs with very different dynamic properties that had been assessed by live-cell imaging (15Poorey K. Viswanathan R.

Quantifying transcription factor kinetics: at work or at play?.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

An alternative approach is competition ChIP, an assay that measures the rate of turnover between an endogenous and inducible copy of a TF. Our recent work demonstrates that quantitative estimates of locus-specific binding kinetics can be obtained by modeling competition ChIP data, including the estimation of residence times much shorter than the time for full induction of the competitor TF (23Zaidi H.A. Auble D.T. Bekiranov S. RNA synthesis is associated with multiple TBP-chromatin binding events.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 39631Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Importantly, comparison of CLK and competition ChIP data for TATA-binding protein (TBP) to a few specific loci shows that the time scales for chromatin interaction are similar as judged by the two methods, with residence times for promoter binding being in general on the order of several minutes (23Zaidi H.A. Auble D.T. Bekiranov S. RNA synthesis is associated with multiple TBP-chromatin binding events.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 39631Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, locus-specific TF-chromatin dynamics are just beginning to be explored, with only a small number of TFs and chromatin sites for which CLK, competition ChIP, and/or live-cell imaging kinetic data are available. A key aspect of the CLK assay involves the trapping of bound species using formaldehyde. Here, we report biochemical results that better define the chemical behavior of formaldehyde in yeast cells. An increased formaldehyde concentration led to more rapid cross-linking, which improved the time resolution and analytical ability of the assay to extract locus-specific binding kinetic information for some TFs. For other TFs, an increased formaldehyde concentration resulted in their depletion from the soluble pool, and in some cases a rapid depletion was observed. These observations emphasize the importance of optimizing the CLK approach for analysis of the dynamic behavior of a particular TF. We report the development of a general and improved CLK method framework with both more rapid cross-linking and more efficient quenching in yeast cells. We also report improved computational methods for data analysis and describe improved approaches for distinguishing contributions of cross-linking rate and binding kinetics to the time-dependent increases in ChIP signal. The CLK method relies on time-resolved formaldehyde–cross-linking ChIP data to assess the kinetics and thermodynamics of TF-chromatin binding. The original CLK method (15Poorey K. Viswanathan R. Carver M.N. Karpova T.S. Cirimotich S.M. McNally J.G. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T.

Under these conditions, the concentration of glycine is sub-stoichiometric to the formaldehyde concentration as added, but cross-linking was performed by adding formaldehyde to cells in YPD medium, which is made from an amino acid-rich extract of yeast cells. Therefore, the concentration of unreacted formaldehyde that reaches cells under these conditions is unknown and is most likely well below the initial concentration. Order-of-addition experiments showed that 250 mm glycine could block cross-linking of the Gal4–promoter interaction (15Poorey K. Viswanathan R. Carver M.N. Karpova T.S. Cirimotich S.M. McNally J.G. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T. Measuring chromatin interaction dynamics on the second time scale at single-copy genes.Science. 2013; 342: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but we noted in subsequent work that quenching may be variably efficient under these conditions (26Hoffman E.A. Frey B.L. Smith L.M. Auble D.T. Formaldehyde–cross-linking: a tool for the study of chromatin complexes.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 26404-26411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have noticed that for unknown reasons the quench efficiency can be variable from experiment to experiment for certain TFs (supplemental Fig. S1) (27Sutherland B.W. Toews J. Kast J. Utility of formaldehyde–cross-linking and mass spectrometry in the study of protein-protein interactions.J. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 43: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To better define time-dependent cross-linking behavior and the impact of different quenching conditions on the resulting ChIP signals, data were obtained using 1% (360 mm) formaldehyde and either 250 mm or 2.93 m glycine using the interaction between yeast TBP-myc and the URA1 promoter as a model interaction. The high concentration of 2.93 m glycine used in this and subsequent experiments was the maximum achievable based on the solubility of glycine in aqueous solution (∼3 m) and subsequent dilution resulting from addition of a relatively small volume of concentrated yeast cell culture to the quenching solution (see “Experimental procedures”). For this reason, we refer to this as the “max glycine” quench condition hereafter. As shown in Fig. 1A, the max glycine-quench conditions resulted in lower ChIP signals at each time point compared with 250 mm glycine. These results demonstrate that the concentration of glycine used in the quench can have a significant effect on the magnitude of the ChIP signal, suggesting that more robust quenching of formaldehyde can be achieved with a higher concentration of glycine. In addition to lower signals at each time point obtained using max glycine conditions, some time-dependent datasets showed initial shallow slopes, which continuously increase until the curve reaches apparent linear behavior at longer times (Fig. 1). We refer to this as “positive curvature.” This type of behavior has several possible explanations (discussed below), but none are accounted for in the original CLK model. To better understand how glycine concentration affected the time course of formaldehyde–cross-linking, experiments were performed to test both the dependence of the reaction on formaldehyde concentration and how ChIP data were affected using Tris, rather than glycine, to quench the reaction. Tris has been reported to be a robust quencher of formaldehyde reactivity (27Sutherland B.W. Toews J. Kast J. Utility of formaldehyde–cross-linking and mass spectrometry in the study of protein-protein interactions.J. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 43: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, using max glycine-quenching conditions, the ChIP signal depended on the formaldehyde concentration, as reaction with 4.7% formaldehyde increased the ChIP signal at each time point compared with reactions that employed 1% formaldehyde. A dependence on formaldehyde concentration was also seen in reactions using Tris as the quenching agent (Fig. 1C). However, in reactions that were quenched with Tris, the ChIP signals obtained for a given concentration of formaldehyde were reduced compared with the values obtained using glycine, and the resulting reaction progress curves showed positive curvature similar to reactions quenched with max glycine discussed above. Although Tris is apparently a more efficient quencher than glycine, it also has the potential to reverse cross-links (28Kawashima Y. Kodera Y. Singh A. Matsumoto M. Matsumoto H. Efficient extraction of proteins from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues requires higher concentration of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane.Clin. Proteomics. 2014; 11: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Shi S.-R. Taylor C.R. Fowler C.B. Mason J.T. Complete solubilization of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue may improve proteomic studies.Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2013; 7: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cross-link reversal would be problematic for the CLK assay as it could lead to underestimates of ChIP signal, with potentially large percentage-wise effects on the modest levels of cross-linked material obtained after short cross-linking times. To test the potential for reversal with both Tris and glycine, samples were cross-linked, quenched, and incubated at room temperature for different periods of time in the quenching solution. As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation of cells in Tris-containing solution led to a loss of TBP ChIP signal over time. The greatest effect was observed with 750 mm Tris, but the ChIP signal diminished when cells were incubated in 50 mm Tris as well. In contrast, there was no detectable decrease in TBP ChIP signal over time when cross-linked cells were incubated in max glycine solution (Fig. 2B). Thus, although Tris is a robust quenching agent, we ruled out its use in the assay because it decreased the recovery of cross-linked complexes. The results thus far led to implementation of two significant changes in the CLK methodology. First, to obtain the most accurate time-resolved ChIP data, we employed the more robust quenching afforded by max glycine conditions, which lack the negative attributes of Tris as a quencher. Second, as the cross-linking rate is dependent on formaldehyde concentration, we employed 5% formaldehyde rather than 1% as used in previous work (Ref. 15Poorey K. Viswanathan R. Carver M.N. Karpova T.S. Cirimotich S.M. McNally J.G. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T. Measuring chromatin interaction dynamics on the second time scale at single-copy genes.Science. 2013; 342: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and most ChIP experiments published to date). Although 5% formaldehyde optimized the assay for analysis of several interactions in this study, it will be important to determine the optimal formaldehyde concentration for analysis of other types of interactions and in other cell types. We sought the highest feasible formaldehyde concentration for two reasons. First, experimentally, we wanted the ChIP signal to be minimally affected by noise. Second, because the overall cross-linking rate depends on the formaldehyde concentration, faster cross-linking would yield better time resolution between the cross-linking and binding dynamics time scales. To achieve the desired concentrations of reagents in the reactions and to obtain sufficient cellular material for analysis, cell cultures were concentrated by centrifugation; formaldehyde was added to the concentrated cell suspension, and then aliquots of cells were quenched by dilution in a much larger volume of glycine at high concentration. This approach also has the advantage that formaldehyde reactivity is reduced by dilution to 0.1% after glycine addition. Prior work showed that little cross-linking was detectable using 0.1% formaldehyde, so dilution alone was expected to have a substantial impact on formaldehyde reactivity (16Viswanathan R. Hoffman E.A. Shetty S.J. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T. Analysis of chromatin binding dynamics using the cross-linking kinetics (CLK) method.Methods. 2014; 70: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, the glycine-quenching solution was adjusted to pH 5, which further improves the ability of glycine and formaldehyde to react (27Sutherland B.W. Toews J. Kast J. Utility of formaldehyde–cross-linking and mass spectrometry in the study of protein-protein interactions.J. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 43: 699-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We refer to the experimental approach employing all of these modifications as CLKv2 (Fig. 3A) to distinguish it from the original CLK method. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, order-of-addition experiments established that glycine was a very efficient quencher of formaldehyde reactivity when used in this way; the TBP-myc ChIP signal obtained in reactions in which formaldehyde was added first was ∼28-fold higher than in reactions with no formaldehyde. In contrast, the ChIP signal obtained when glycine was added before formaldehyde was not statistically different from the background ChIP signal obtained with no formaldehyde at all (p = 0.20). Next, the use of 5% formaldehyde prompted us to evaluate how this higher level of formaldehyde might generally impact cellular constituents. As shown in Fig. 4A, protein yields were reduced in whole-cell extracts prepared from cells treated with 5% formaldehyde for increasing periods of time. In contrast, there was no change in the yield of chromatin protein associated with extracts prepared as normally done for ChIP. In addition, there was little change in the pattern of protein bands or their relative intensities over a time course of formaldehyde incubation, indicating that the majority of proteins present in these chromatin extracts were not notably depleted or modified (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the reduced yield of protein in whole-cell extracts was due to cross-linked cells being refractory to lysis by rapid agitation with glass beads, whereas soluble protein contents were more efficiently released in the chromatin extract preparation procedure, which utilizes a combination of glass bead agitation plus sonication. Protein samples are typically heated to facilitate their denaturation prior to electrophoresis, but formaldehyde cross-links are also reversible by heat, so we analyzed protein extracts on gels with and without heating. There was relatively little difference in the overall protein-banding pattern when chromatin extract proteins were analyzed following brief heating to facilitate protein denaturation versus unheated samples (Fig. 4B). Heating did reduce an indistinct smear of protein toward the top of the lanes of unheated samples, consistent with heat improving denaturation of the samples. Brief heating had a dramatic effect on the ability to detect TBP in extracts by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). The formaldehyde cross-link reversal time is much longer than this brief heating period (30Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Loss of DNA-protein cross-links from formaldehyde-exposed cells occurs through spontaneous hydrolysis and an active repair process linked to proteosome function.Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that heating in this experiment facilitated disruption of TF-protein complexes and protein unfolding rather than cross-link reversal. In the case of TBP, it is likely that its association with the TATA-binding protein-associated factors and potentially other regulatory factors in extracts (31Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. The general transcription machinery and general cofactors.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) make detection of monomeric TBP difficult or impossible without heating. MNase titration experiments were performed to examine the overall chromatin state resulting from treatment with cross-linker and quencher. Compared with untreated cells, we observed no difference in the overall chromatin digestion pattern when cells were treated with 2.93 m glycine, pH 5, with or without prior formaldehyde incubation (Fig. 4D). Thus, formaldehyde and glycine do not cause any detectable bulk structural changes in chromatin or affect chromatin accessibility. A key requirement for the CLK method is that the unbound pool of the TF being investigated is not depleted significantly by formaldehyde incubation (15Poorey K. Viswanathan R. Carver M.N. Karpova T.S. Cirimotich S.M. McNally J.G. Bekiranov S. Auble D.T. Measuring chromatin interaction dynamics on the second time scale at single-copy genes.Science. 2013; 342: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This ensures that there are sufficient molecules available for interaction with unbound DNA sites and that the overall on-rate, which depends on the concentration of the free TF, does not change over the course of the reaction. To determine the effect of 5% formaldehyde on the soluble pools of particular TFs, Western blottings were performed using extracts obtained from cells treated with formaldehyde for various periods of time. Based on the results in Fig. 4, B and C, a brief heating step was used prior to loading samples on the gels to accurately estimate the relative amount of soluble TF without reversing any cross-links that had formed. Western blotting showed that 5% formaldehyde treatment resulted in depletion of some TFs and not others, and the rates of depletion among those that were depleted varied significantly (Fig. 5, A–F). TBP, Gal4, and Ace1 were not significantly depleted in these experiments, whereas Reb1, Cat8, Abf1, TFIIB, and Tfa1"

https://openalex.org/W2758657057,"The mechanism of Nedd4-2 has been quantitatively explored for the first time using biochemically defined kinetic assays examining rates of 125I-polyubiquitin chain assembly as a functional readout. We demonstrate that Nedd4-2 exhibits broad specificity for E2 paralogs of the Ubc4/5 clade to assemble Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Full-length Nedd4-2 catalyzes free 125I-polyubiquitin chain assembly by hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to Ubc5B∼ubiquitin thioester concentration (Km = 44 ± 6 nm; kcat = 0.020 ± 0.007 s-1) and substrate inhibition above 0.5 μm (Ki = 2.5 ± 1.3 μm) that tends to zero velocity, requiring ordered binding at two functionally distinct E2∼ubiquitin-binding sites. The Ubc5BC85A product analog non-competitively inhibits Nedd4-2 (Ki = 2.0 ± 0.5 μm), consistent with the presence of the second E2-binding site. In contrast, the isosteric Ubc5BC85S-ubiquitin oxyester substrate analog exhibits competitive inhibition at the high-affinity Site 1 (Ki = 720 ± 340 nm) and non-essential activation at the lower-affinity Site 2 (Kact = 750 ± 260 nm). Additional studies utilizing Ubc5BF62A, defective in binding the canonical E2 site, demonstrate that the cryptic Site 1 is associated with thioester formation, whereas binding at the canonical site (Site 2) is associated with polyubiquitin chain elongation. Finally, previously described Ca2+-dependent C2 domain-mediated autoinhibition of Nedd4-2 is not observed under our reported experimental conditions. These studies collectively demonstrate that Nedd4-2 catalyzes polyubiquitin chain assembly by an ordered two-step mechanism requiring two dynamically linked E2∼ubiquitin-binding sites analogous to that recently reported for E6AP, the founding member of the Hect ligase family."

However, clinical use of NMs is limited because of their own mutagenic properties. The mechanisms of NM-induced mutagenesis remain unclear.

In addition to cross-linking, the cationic N7-NM-dG adduct can undergo a secondary reaction that proceeds via the addition of a hydroxide to the C8 position with a subsequent imidazole ring-opening, yielding the N5-NM-substituted formamidopyrimidine adduct (NM-Fapy-dG) (Fig. 1C).

Following treatment of calf thymus DNA in vitro, the NM-Fapy-dG adducts were formed at a level ∼20% that of the N7-NM-dG adducts. When these studies were extended to a tumor cell line that was exposed to bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine, NM-Fapy-dG was detected at the level of 180 adducts per 107 nucleosides, representing ∼13% of all adducts measured. DNA cross-links were also detected in the products from both of the experimental systems described above. Interestingly, a fraction of these cross-links contained dGs that underwent ring-opening. These data demonstrated that N7-NM-dG monoadducts or cross-links are routinely converted to the corresponding Fapy-dG species and thus, contribution of these ring-fragmented lesions to NM-induced mutagenesis should be considered. To facilitate investigations on the structure and function of the NM-Fapy-dG adducts, the Rizzo group developed chemistry for the site-specific synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides containing bis(2-chloroethyl)ethylamine-derived Fapy-dG (Fig. 1A) and employed Escherichia coli endonuclease IV (Endo IV), an enzyme that selectively incises double-stranded DNA at α-nucleotides (22Ide H.

Single-stranded vectors containing a site-specific NM-Fapy-dG were replicated in COS7 and E. coli cells, and frequencies and spectra of mutations were assessed. Furthermore, the effect of NM-Fapy-dG on DNA synthesis was investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol δ, a high-fidelity DNA polymerase that represents one of the two major nuclear polymerases in eukaryotic cells. The 8-oxo-dG adduct was tested under identical conditions as a reference lesion. In addition, differential effects on replication were evaluated for the two anomeric forms of NM-Fapy-dG.

In the case of Me-Fapy-dG, a subset of misincorporations was hypothesized to be directed by the 5′-neighboring nucleotide, as the result of primer/template misalignment, followed by primer realignment and extension. Considering the structural similarity of various imidazole ring-fragmented dG adducts, the current study investigated the mutagenic properties of NM-Fapy-dG and in particular, addressed the potential effect on mutagenesis of the 5′-nucleotide. The adduct in either a 5′-CXG-3′ or 5′-TXG-3′ sequence context was incorporated into a single-stranded pSBL vector as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1. Identically designed vectors were also engineered to contain 8-oxo-dG. This adduct was selected to serve as a reference lesion because the NM-Fapy-dG and 8-oxo-dG adducts have a certain structural similarity and in particular, both retain the canonical Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonding face of dG. The pSBL vectors containing 8-oxo-dG or NM-Fapy-dG in either 5′-CXG-3′ or 5′-TXG-3′ sequence context were replicated in COS7 cells. Following isolation of the progeny DNAs, individual clones were obtained by transforming E. coli DH5α cells and analyzed for mutations using a combination of differential hybridization technique and Sanger sequencing. Analyses of control vectors that contained dG at the target site were performed in parallel experiments. These results demonstrated essentially error-free replication of non-damaged vectors as we have recently reported (28Sha Y. Minko I.G. Malik C.K. Rizzo C.J. Lloyd R.S. Error-prone replication bypass of the imidazole ring-opened formamidopyrimidine deoxyguanosine adduct.Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2017; 58: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although our experimental approach was not designed to evaluate the bypass efficiency, no correlation was noticed between the yield of bacterial transformants and the type of DNA replicated. Thus, the NM-Fapy-dG lesion is unlikely to represent a very strong block for the mammalian replication machinery. The data on the mutagenic properties of 8-oxo-dG and NM-Fapy-dG were collected from a minimum of three independent transfections of COS7 cells and are shown in Table 1.Table 1Mutations generated following replication of site-specifically modified vectors in COS7 cellsTarget siteSequence contextClones testedG to T No.G to C No.G to A No.G del.

In addition, low levels (∼1.2%) of various deletions were observed only in the 5′-CXG-3′ sequence.

It cannot be excluded, however, that a subset of these transversions, occurring in the 5′-TXG-3′ sequence context could be formed via a primer/template misalignment. Relative to 8-oxo-dG, the NM-Fapy-dG adduct caused targeted mutations at ∼2-fold higher frequencies (∼11.6 versus ∼4.4%, p = 0.019, in 5′-CXG-3′ and ∼10.6 versus ∼5.3%, p = 0.032, in 5′-TXG-3′). G → T transversions were most common in both sequence contexts (∼8.3% in 5′-CXG-3′ and ∼8.8% in 5′-TXG-3′), although other base substitutions also occurred. The spectra of base substitutions were minimally affected by the local sequence context. Frequencies of G → C transversions in 5′-CXG-3′ were slightly higher than in 5′-TXG-3′ (∼1.8 and ∼0.3%, respectively), but the difference was not statistically significant. Deletions were detected exclusively in the 5′-CXG-3′ context and were at near background levels. Thus, whereas the structure of the correctly matched pair can be easily envisioned for NM-Fapy-dG (Fig. 1G), the nature of replication intermediates leading to mutagenesis is less apparent. Conventional primer-template misalignment models can only explain a small fraction of NM-Fapy-dG-induced mutations. Specifically with regard to the major mutation, a G → T transversion, the recognized model of mispair involving the Hoogsteen face in 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 1F) cannot be applied to NM-Fapy-dG, because this face is affected by the NM modification (Fig. 1C). The pSBL vectors containing NM-Fapy-dG in the 5′-CXG-3′ sequence were replicated in wild-type E. coli (ZK126, W3110ΔlacU169tna-2) and the isogenic mutant lacking all three DNA damage-inducible (SOS) DNA polymerases, pol II, pol IV, and pol V (SF2018, ZK126 polB::Spcr dinB::Kanr umuDC::Camr).

Often, bacterial carbohydrate-binding proteins, i.e. lectins, also act as toxins in addition to their function as adhesins to enable host colonization.

The P. luminescens genome harbors several genes of predicted lectins that are homologs of LecB (25Imberty A. Wimmerová M. Mitchell E.P. Gilboa-Garber N. Structures of the lectins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: insight into the molecular basis for host glycan recognition.Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast, homologs of LecA are comparably rare and are not present in the genomes of the former species. In P. luminescens, a single gene encoding for a LecA homolog (plu2096) was predicted by Duchaud et al. (10Duchaud E. Rusniok C. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Givaudan A. Taourit S. Bocs S. Boursaux-Eude C. Chandler M. Charles J.-F. Dassa E. Derose R. Derzelle S. Freyssinet G. Gaudriault S. et al.The genome sequence of the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of the P. luminescens lectin PllA. We demonstrate that PllA is highly specific for α-galactoside–containing ligands. By determining several crystal structures of PllA in complex with ligands, we were able to rationalize PllA’s strong preference for α-galactosides. We further demonstrate that PllA can serve as a detection tool for the specific visualization of the α-Gal epitope present on porcine tissue. This epitope is responsible for hyperacute rejection of pig to primate organ xenotransplants. Although P. aeruginosa LecB orthologs have been widely studied, orthologs of LecA have not been characterized in detail. We searched the publicly accessible NCBI database using protein blast and the protein sequence of LecA from strain PAO1 as a template. A moderate number of orthologs was retrieved from only a few different genera of Gram-negative bacteria. These were mainly entomopathogenic Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus species, as well as human opportunistic pathogens from the Enterobacter spp. and a few other pathogenic bacterial species (see supplemental Fig. S1). In P. luminescens, the gene plu2096 was previously proposed as the coding gene for a LecA-like protein (10Duchaud E. Rusniok C. Frangeul L. Buchrieser C. Givaudan A. Taourit S. Bocs S. Boursaux-Eude C. Chandler M. Charles J.-F. Dassa E. Derose R. Derzelle S. Freyssinet G. Gaudriault S. et al.The genome sequence of the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and later confirmed (26McMahon K. Structural and Functional Characterisation of Lectins from the PA-IL Superfamily. Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland2009Google Scholar) to be a galactose-binding lectin. An alignment of the retrieved orthologs of LecA in each Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus species shows a high degree of similarity within these entomopathogenic species (Fig. 1). Although the residues involved in metal and ligand binding in LecA are relatively conserved, distinct differences to P. aeruginosa LecA were observed; LecA contains an insert flanked by two cysteines that are absent in PllA, and the Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus homologs contain an additional C-terminal tail of 5–13 amino acids, which is partially conserved (Fig. 1). PllA has 37% sequence identity to LecA, and all amino acids whose side chains are involved in calcium ion binding are conserved except for one Asn (LecA) to Asp (PllA) variation. Amino acids involved in carbohydrate recognition are only partially conserved. The plu2096 gene was amplified from genomic DNA of P. luminescens subsp. laumondii TTO1 and cloned into the pET22b(+) vector. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) yielded a protein product at a 13-kDa apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), which corresponds to its predicted size of 12.95 kDa. Because of the sequence homology to galactose-binding LecA, we subjected the cell lysate to galactosylated Sepharose (27Joachim I. Rikker S. Hauck D. Ponader D. Boden S. Sommer R. Hartmann L. Titz A. Development and optimization of a competitive binding assay for the galactophilic low affinity lectin LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2016; 14: 7933-7948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PllA was retained on this affinity resin. Subsequent elution was achieved using galactose in the elution buffer. Purification yielded ∼6 mg of PllA/liter of bacterial culture, which was later improved to 19 mg/liter by purification on melibiose-coupled Sepharose (see below). Because lectins often oligomerize and LecA forms a tetramer (28Cioci G. Mitchell E.P. Gautier C. Wimmerová M. Sudakevitz D. Pérez S. Gilboa-Garber N. Imberty A. Structural basis of calcium and galactose recognition by the lectin PA-IL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we analyzed PllA's multimeric state using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). 3The abbreviations used are: SECsize-exclusion chromatographyPDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolDLSdynamic light scatteringGTKOα-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock-outSCNTsomatic cell nuclear transferIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideBACbacterial artificial chromosome. The protein's observed apparent molecular mass was 27 kDa, which suggested a PllA dimer (Figs. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). When we used the more robust technique of dynamic light scattering (DLS), we observed a homogeneous sample with an apparent molecular mass of 52.1 kDa (Fig. 2C). The tetramer LecA was also studied by DLS under identical conditions, and its apparent molecular mass of 52.4 kDa (supplemental Fig. S3) matched the value for PllA and thus suggests the tetramerization of PllA in solution. The observed differences for PllA in SEC and DLS could result from weak interactions between PllA and the glycan-based Sepharose resin, altering the observed molecular mass to a smaller size. size-exclusion chromatography Protein Data Bank root mean square deviation 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol dynamic light scattering α-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock-out somatic cell nuclear transfer isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside bacterial artificial chromosome. To assess the carbohydrate-binding specificity of PllA, the protein was fluorescently labeled using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and binding to a glycan array containing over 600 carbohydrate epitopes was performed at the Consortium for Functional Genomics (Fig. 3A). The LecA homolog PllA showed a strict specificity toward glycans with terminal α-galactosides, whereas β-galactosides and other carbohydrates only showed very weak or no binding. The highest apparent binding affinity was detected for the bivalent α-Gal-terminating N-glycan (Gal-α-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc)2Man3GlcNAc2 (glycan nos. 360 and 550) or its difucosylated derivative glycan no. 368 bearing blood group B antigens at the non-reducing end and the two monovalent disaccharides Gal-α-1,3-GalNAc (glycan no. 112) and Gal-α-1,4-GlcNAc (glycan no. 123). The highest apparent binding was observed for bivalent Gal-α-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc terminating glycans (glycans no. 360, 368, and 550). This glycan structure, called the α-Gal epitope (29Galili U. The α-Gal epitope and the anti-Gal antibody in xenotransplantation and in cancer immunotherapy.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), is a ubiquitous constituent of glycans in non-primate mammals and new world monkeys. The nematode Parelaphostrongylus tenuis also contains N-glycans decorated with this epitope (30Duffy M.S. Morris H.R. Dell A. Appleton J.A. Haslam S.M. Protein glycosylation in Parelaphostrongylus tenuis–first description of the Galα1–3Gal sequence in a nematode.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This epitope is mainly responsible for hyperacute rejection of porcine organ transplants in humans during xenotransplantation (29Galili U. The α-Gal epitope and the anti-Gal antibody in xenotransplantation and in cancer immunotherapy.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Ekser B. Cooper D.K. Overcoming the barriers to xenotransplantation: prospects for the future.Expert Rev. Clin. Immunol. 2010; 6: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the corresponding monovalent glycans (no. 105 and 115) showed a 4–5-fold lower binding signal (Table 1), indicating that PllA binds carbohydrates multivalently as known for its ortholog LecA. Interestingly, when the same monovalent epitopes were presented on a shorter spacer (Sp0) with one mannose between spacer and epitope (no. 516 and 517), binding was reduced further.Table 1Comparison between high binding glycans and structurally related glycans on the array, i.e. comparison of linkagetypes and multivalent-monovalent effect Open table in a new tab Apart from the divalent ligands, only the two disaccharides, Gal-α-1,3-GalNAc and Gal-α-1,4-GlcNAc, showed a high binding signal among the monovalent series (Fig. 3A). These two ligands are monovalently displayed and may reveal the intrinsic specificity of PllA, because other monovalent ligands showed only weak or no binding to PllA on this glycan array. Interestingly, these two ligands displayed much stronger binding than analogous Gal-α-1,3-Gal and Gal-α-1,2-Gal, suggesting an important role of the acetamide moiety in the penultimate residue for binding to PllA (Table 1). Among the monovalent ligands on the array, the observed linkage specificity of PllA was broad for glycans containing terminal Gal-α-1,3 and Gal-α-1,4 linkages. The single present Gal-α-1,6-linked ligand (Gal-α-1,6-Glc) was moderately bound, whereas the single Gal-α-1,2-linked ligand (Gal-α-1,2-Gal) was not recognized by PllA (Table 1). To compare the carbohydrate specificity of PllA with its previously characterized ortholog LecA (32Blanchard B. Nurisso A. Hollville E. Tétaud C. Wiels J. Pokorná M. Wimmerová M. Varrot A. Imberty A. Structural basis of the preferential binding for globo-series glycosphingolipids displayed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin I.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 837-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), glycan array binding data of monovalent glycan ligands for both lectins was normalized and plotted (Fig. 3B). Notably, LecA showed the best binding to Gal-α-1,4-Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc, which is only weakly recognized by PllA. This glycan is part of the glycosphingolipid Gb3, which when bound by LecA triggers membrane bending, a process that was proposed as an entry pathway for P. aeruginosa invasion into the host cell (33Eierhoff T. Bastian B. Thuenauer R. Madl J. Audfray A. Aigal S. Juillot S. Rydell G.E. Müller S. de Bentzmann S. Imberty A. Fleck C. Römer W. A lipid zipper triggers bacterial invasion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 12895-12900Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, PllA showed high apparent binding to the epitopes Gal-α-1,3-GalNAc and Gal-α-1,4-GlcNAc, whereas LecA only shows moderate apparent binding as observed for a number of other α-galactosides on the glycan array (Fig. 3B). In summary, LecA is a rather promiscuous receptor for a variety of monovalent galactosides. In addition to PllA’s binding to the bivalent N-glycan structures described above, PllA was rather specific for Gal-α-1,3-GalNAc and Gal-α-1,4-GlcNAc, one or both of which may be the natural ligand of PllA. To rapidly assess and quantify the binding specificity of PllA, we developed a competitive binding assay for PllA by utilizing fluorescence polarization, which is based on our previous work (19Sommer R. Wagner S. Varrot A. Nycholat C.M. Khaledi A. Häussler S. Paulson J.C. Imberty A. Titz A.

In contrast, titration of α-galactoside 1 resulted in binding with a Kd of 62.7 μm as observed by the increase in fluorescence polarization. These data confirmed the strict α-galactoside specificity of PllA in solution that was observed on the glycan array. The latter system was then used for a competitive binding assay, where fluorescent α-galactoside 1 was competitively displaced from PllA using methyl α-d-galactoside (12), and a set of available d-galactose derivatives (Fig. 4D and Table 2). Interestingly, the obtained IC50 for 12 was 0.52 mm, which is ∼10-fold weaker than the determined affinity of the fluorescent analog 1. Among the monosaccharides tested, free d-galactose (9), showed inhibition of PllA with a reduced affinity (IC50 = 1.57 mm) compared with glycoside 12, probably due to the partial presence of the non-binding β-anomer. Methyl α-glycosides of d-glucose (5), l-fucose (6), d-mannose (7), or methyl β-d-arabinoside (8) did not show detectable binding to PllA. Replacement of the 2-hydroxy group of galactose with a free amine in d-galactosamine (10) led to a 2-fold increase in the binding affinity (IC50 = 0.86 mm). Acetamide substitution in the same position, i.e. N-acetylgalactosamine (11), resulted in a complete loss of binding. Next, we tested α-galactosides with different aglycons of varying size, e.g. methyl, allyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 4-methylumbelliferyl, and X-Gal (12–14, 16–18). These modifications only showed a small effect on the binding affinity. O-Alkylation of ring hydroxyl groups is a requirement for ligand binding of some lectins like the tectonins (35Wohlschlager T.

Chem. 2016; 12: 2828-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For PllA, O-methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group resulted in a complete loss of affinity (14 → 15). A similar loss of affinity was observed for O-methylation of the P. aeruginosa LecB or B. cenocepacia BC2L-A ligands fucose and mannose (21Beshr G. Sommer R. Hauck D. Siebert D.C.B. Hofmann A.

Gal-α-1,3-Gal (20, IC50 = 0.90 mm) and Gal-α-1,4-Gal (21, IC50 = 1.08 mm) showed a 2-fold lower binding affinity to PllA than melibiose (Gal-α-1,6-Glc, 22, IC50 = 0.39 mm), whereas Gal-α-1,2-Gal (19) was only weakly active and resulted in ∼50% inhibition at 10 mm. A comparable binding specificity for Gal-α-1,6-Glc has been reported for LecA from P. aeruginosa (37Chen C.P. Song S.C. Gilboa-Garber N. Chang K.S. Wu A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2758507870,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate gene transcription by recruiting coregulators, involved in chromatin remodeling and assembly of the basal transcription machinery. The NR-associated protein ligand-dependent corepressor (LCoR) has previously been shown to suppress hepatic lipogenesis by decreasing the binding of steroid receptor coactivators to thyroid hormone receptor. However, the role of LCoR in adipogenesis has not been established. Here, we show that LCoR expression is reduced in the early stage of adipogenesis in vitro. LCoR overexpression inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, whereas LCoR knockdown promoted it. Using an unbiased affinity purification approach, we identified CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a key transcriptional regulator in early adipogenesis, and corepressor C-terminal binding proteins as potential components of an LCoR-containing complex in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that LCoR directly interacts with C/EBPβ through its C-terminal helix-turn-helix domain, required for LCoR’s inhibitory effects on adipogenesis. LCoR overexpression also inhibited C/EBPβ transcriptional activity, leading to inhibition of mitotic clonal expansion and transcriptional repression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2). However, LCoR overexpression did not affect the recruitment of C/EBPβ to the promoters of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Of note, restoration of PPARγ2 or C/EBPα expression attenuated the inhibitory effect of LCoR on adipogenesis. Mechanistically, LCoR suppressed C/EBPβ-mediated transcription by recruiting C-terminal binding proteins to the C/EBPα and PPARγ2 promoters and by modulating histone modifications. Taken together, our results indicate that LCoR negatively regulates early adipogenesis by repressing C/EBPβ transcriptional activity and add LCoR to the growing list of transcriptional corepressors of adipogenesis.

Taken together, our results indicate that LCoR negatively regulates early adipogenesis by repressing C/EBPβ transcriptional activity and add LCoR to the growing list of transcriptional corepressors of adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2759883570,"Several biophysical approaches are available to study protein-protein interactions. Most approaches are conducted in bulk solution, and are therefore limited to an average measurement of the ensemble of molecular interactions. Here, we show how single-particle EM can enrich our understanding of protein-protein interactions at the single-molecule level and potentially capture states that are unobservable with ensemble methods because they are below the limit of detection or not conducted on an appropriate time scale. Using the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and its interaction with receptor CD4-binding site neutralizing antibodies as a model system, we both corroborate ensemble kinetics-derived parameters and demonstrate how time-course EM can further dissect stoichiometric states of complexes that are not readily observable with other methods. Visualization of the kinetics and stoichiometry of Env-antibody complexes demonstrated the applicability of our approach to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively differentiate two highly similar neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, implementation of machine-learning techniques for sorting class averages of these complexes into discrete subclasses of particles helped reduce human bias. Our data provide proof of concept that single-particle EM can be used to generate a visual kinetic profile that should be amenable to studying many other protein-protein interactions, is relatively simple and complementary to well-established biophysical approaches. Moreover, our method provides critical insights into broadly neutralizing antibody recognition of Env, which may inform vaccine immunogen design and immunotherapeutic development."

Although many of these enzyme families are well-characterized in terms of function and substrate specificity, regulation across most thioesterase families is poorly understood. Here, we characterized a TE6 thioesterase from the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. Structural analysis with X-ray crystallographic diffraction data to 2.0-Å revealed that each protein subunit harbors a hot dog-fold and that the TE6 enzyme forms a hexamer with D3 symmetry. An assessment of thioesterase activity against a range of acyl-CoA substrates revealed the greatest activity against acetyl-CoA, and structure-guided mutagenesis of putative active site residues identified Asn24 and Asp39 as being essential for activity. Our structural analysis revealed that six GDP nucleotides bound the enzyme in close proximity to an intersubunit disulfide bond interactions that covalently link thioesterase domains in a double hot dog dimer. Structure-guided mutagenesis of residues within the GDP-binding pocket identified Arg93 as playing a key role in the nucleotide interaction and revealed that GDP is required for activity.

The purified EcChiP was shown to form a fully opening channel in artificial planar lipid membranes, displaying an average single-channel conductance of 0.5 ± 0.05 nS.

Inspection of the amino acid sequence of EcChiP shows a large number of Trp residues. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of EcChiP, containing a total of 15 Trp residues, (indicated in red). Fig. 2 (A and B) shows the modeled 3D structure of EcChiP, with the precise locations of these Trp residues within the molecule. Residues Trp-46, Trp-168, Trp-176, Trp-266, Trp-288, Trp-342, and Trp-357 are all located within the transmembrane segments that form the outer surface of the protein barrel, whereas Trp-98 (in L2), Trp-138 (in L3), Trp-176 (in L4), Trp-364 (in L8), and Trp-417 (in L9) are in the extracellular loops (denoted Ln, where n indicates the loop number). These loops are presumed to be highly flexible and could protrude into the protein lumen and serve as part of the sugar-conducting pathway. For the assay of chitohexaose binding by fluorescence enhancement, we first prepared highly purified EcChiP. As shown in Fig. 2C, recombinant EcChiP expressed in the Omp-deficient E. coli strain was purified to homogeneity in two steps: detergent extraction, followed by gel filtration chromatography. Fig. 2C (inset) shows the single band of EcChiP obtained in the gel filtration step. The protein migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass slightly above 45 kDa, which agrees well with the predicted value of 52,780 Da, and with the value for native, monomeric EcChiP determined previously (12Soysa H.S. Suginta W. Identification and functional characterization of a novel OprD-like chitin uptake channel in non-chitinolytic bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 13622-13633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To quantify sugar-channel interactions, we measured changes in protein fluorescence intensity when EcChiP was titrated with chitohexaose in the concentration range of 0–40 μm. Fig. 2D shows fluorescence emission spectra (300–450 nm) of EcChiP, excited at 295 nm. The maximum fluorescence emission intensity (Fmax) was observed at 345 nm, in the absence and presence of sugar. When the protein was titrated with chitohexaose, the fluorescence was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. Plotting the fluorescence intensity change (ΔF) against sugar concentration yielded a typical hyperbolic binding curve (Fig. 2E), which approached saturation with a sugar concentration of >8 μm. No observable blue or red shift in the maximal intensity was induced by sugar addition. Fitting the fluorescence intensity data with a non-linear regression function, assuming single-site-binding model, yielded the Kd value of 3.4 μm, equivalent to a binding constant (K) of 2.9 × 105 m−1.Figure 2Protein–ligand binding studied by fluorescence spectroscopy.

Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results shown are averages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We employed ITC to assess the binding affinity and the thermodynamic characteristics of sugar-channel interactions. In these experiments, purified EcChiP in solution was titrated with chitohexaose, generating the thermogram shown in Fig. 3A (top trace). Other traces are the control thermograms derived from titrating sugar into buffer (second trace from top), buffer into buffer (third trace from top), and buffer into EcChiP (bottom trace). These control traces were used for background subtraction to obtain the normalized integrated heat change of the sugar-channel complex shown in Fig. 3B. Fitting the integrated heat to the ligand–protein ratio using a one-site binding model yielded an ideal hyperbolic curve, with an average binding constant (K) of 2.5 × 105 m−1, a Gibb’s free energy change for binding (ΔGbinding) of −7.0 ± 0.07 kcal mol−1, an enthalpy change (ΔH) of +4.0 ± 0.11 kcal mol−1, and an entropy change (−TΔS) of −11.0 ± 0.15 kcal mol−1. In contrast, zero integrated heat change was obtained when the channel was titrated with chitosan hexamer or maltohexaose, showing that the channel did not interact with these structurally related sugars (Fig. 3, C and D). Sugar-channel affinity was further confirmed by single molecule electrophysiology. Explicitly, ion conductance, sugar specificity, and the kinetics of EcChiP binding to chitin substrates were determined using the black lipid membrane (BLM) reconstitution technique and time-resolved current measurements. In our trials, we found that single molecules of EcChiP could readily insert into phospholipid bilayers when stimulated with high potentials, i.e. ±150 to ±199 mV. Once inserted, a channel remained fully open for the entire period of data acquisition and did not exhibit gating under a wide range of applied potentials, although gating did occasionally occur when ±199 mV was applied. The average conductance of EcChiP in 1 KCl electrolyte was found to be about 0.5 nS (Fig. 4A); this value was consistent throughout this study. To test sugar specificity, chitohexaose was added to either the cis or the trans side of the chamber, and the kinetics of channel blockade by the sugar molecules were examined. The trace in Fig. 4B shows the transient drops in ion current, I(t), in a single EcChiP channel, caused by channel occlusion with chitohexaose. Clearly, the addition of chitohexaose at the low concentration of 20 μm triggered frequent, complete blockages of ion current, whereas the I(t) trace without sugar showed no change in ion current (Fig. 4A). In contrast, two sugar analogs of equivalent chain length, chitosan hexamer (Fig. 4C) and maltohexaose (Fig. 4D), did not block the ion flow at all, even at concentrations up to 200 μm. This result suggested that the EcChiP was highly selective for chitohexaose. Next we examined the voltage dependence of EcChiP sugar uptake and release behavior through measurements of the ionic channel current in the presence of chitohexaose and at a set of different transmembrane potentials. The on (kon) and off rate (koff) values were determined at applied voltages of ±25 to ±200 mV. Fig. 5 (A–D) shows the I(t) traces at +25, +50, +100, and +150 mV, respectively. The ionic current, as well as the number of sugar blocking events, increased with increasing applied potential, whereas the residence time (τc), which reflects the duration of sugar binding inside the channel, decreased with increasing voltage. Plots of the on-rate constant (kon) for the sugar addition on the cis side versus applied voltage (Fig. 5E) showed that kon increased with increasing applied voltage up to ±100 mV and then remained unchanged at negative voltages of −125 to −200 mV, whereas the value dropped at high positive voltages. Similar results were observed with trans sugar addition (Fig. 5G), but the behavior of the on-rate fluctuations was the converse of those with cis addition. In the case of off-rate (koff) analysis (Fig. 5F for cis addition and Fig. 5H for trans addition), plots of koff versus applied voltage showed a steady increase in the value of koff as the applied potential was raised discretely from ±25 to ±100 mV, and then the value was sharply elevated at >±100 mV. The same results were obtained with sugar addition on both the cis and the trans sides. To obtain further information on the kinetics of sugar-channel interactions, we titrated the membrane-inserted EcChiP channel with 2-fold increments in the concentration of chitohexaose (GlcNAc6). Fig. 6 (A–D, left panel) shows I(t) recordings and shows frequent current fluctuations with the cumulative addition of chitohexaose on the trans side and an applied potential of +100 mV. Histogram analyses indicate progressive decreases in the ratio of the open-to-closed states of the channel, correlated with increases in the sugar concentration from 1.25 to 10 μm (Fig. 6, A–D, right panels). Subsequent sugar titration experiments allowed evaluation of the kinetic parameters for the sugar-channel interactions. The kon value, representing the number of sugar blocking events per unit time, is given by Equation 2, whereas the koff value, representing the reciprocal of the residence time (1/τc), is given by Equation 3. Fig. 6E shows the nearly constant kon values calculated from the increasing number of blocking events per unit time with increasing concentrations of chitohexaose. At higher concentrations of chitohexaose, however, the calculated value of kon was found to decrease. This may occur because of the resolution limit of detection of our BLM setup, very frequent entry of sugar molecules into one side of the channel leading to frequent, unresolved blocking events and, as a result, the underestimation of the kon values. On the other hand, the calculated values of koff were essentially constant over the entire range of chitohexaose concentration (Fig. 6F). The respective values of kon, koff, and K for the three oligosaccharides tested are summarized in Table 1. Both on- and off-rate constants were found to be dependent on the length of the chitooligosaccharide, under all the conditions investigated. With sugar addition on cis side and an applied potential of +100 mV (hereafter referred as cis/+100 mV), the average time for sugar molecules residing inside the EcChiP channel (defined as the residence time, τc) increased from 0.4 ± 0.2 ms for chitotetraose to 3.5 ± 0.9 ms for chitopentaose and 12.0 ± 0.7 ms for chitohexaose, yielding a 10-fold decrease in the off-rate constant (koff, 1/τc) from chitotetraose (2,550 s−1) to chitopentaose (250 s−1) and a 32-fold decrease to chitohexaose (80 s−1), respectively. The on-rate constant (kon) for the same series of sugars increased respectively from (1.0 ± 0.3) × 106 to (2 ± 1.5) × 106 and (4 ± 2) × 106 m−1 s−1. Hence, the correlated binding constant (K, m−1) increased with increasing length of sugar chain from chitotetraose (400 m−1) to chitopentaose (8,000 m−1) and chitohexaose (50,000 m−1), reflecting an increased affinity in sugar-channel interactions.

E. coli are non-chitinolytic bacteria that maintain a silent chip gene in their chromosome, to allow them to utilize chitin as an emergency source of energy. We recently identified the chip gene, encoding a chitin-uptake channel (so-called EcChiP), in the genome of E. coli. This gene is usually unexpressed when the bacteria are grown in glucose-enriched medium. However, it has been reported that expression of the chip gene could be induced when the bacteria were grown on chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc2 or GlcNAc3) (7Figueroa-Bossi N. Valentini M.

These results indicated that the chitin-utilization pathway of E. coli was positively regulated by the availability of chitin nutrients. In a previous study, we cloned and expressed EcChiP in the Omp-deficient E. coli host (12Soysa H.S. Suginta W.

The recombinant EcChiP was shown to be a 50-kDa protein that formed a monomeric channel in planar lipid membranes. Liposome swelling assays showed the bulk permeation of chitosugars, the greatest permeation rate being observed with chitohexaose. Detailed thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of EcChiP was used to elucidate the mechanistic features of EcChiP-mediated passage of chitin oligosaccharides through the bacterial outer membrane. We first investigated sugar-channel interactions using protein fluorescence spectroscopy. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of EcChiP showed 15 Trp residues, seven of which, Trp-46, Trp-168, Trp-176, Trp-266, Trp-288, Trp-342, and Trp-357, are distributed throughout the outer wall of the protein barrel and presumed to interact with lipid membranes at the lipid-protein interface. Other Trp residues are part of the extracellular loops, which could also protrude into the protein channel. Among these, Trp-22, Trp-98, Trp-138, Trp-316, Trp-317, and Trp-417 reside on the wall of the channel interior (Fig. 2B) and are likely to play crucial roles in sugar binding and translocation. Trp residues are innate fluorophores that are typically excited at a wavelength (λEX) of ∼295 nm, with an emission wavelength (λEM) of ∼340 nm (24Ghisaidoobe A.B. Chung S.J.

Sci. 2014; 15: 22518-22538Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). From our observations, we expected that the Trp residues located in the inner wall of the EcChiP pore would be highly susceptible to sugar titration and as such would function as specific reporter groups for ligand binding. In our study, titrating EcChiP with chitohexaose caused enhancement of the intrinsic fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner, reflecting changes in the hydrophobicity of the environment. Fluorescence enhancement usually indicates that the Trp residues are covered, partially or fully, through their binding to a sugar molecule, and as a result are screened from quenching by the hydrophilic environment (25Srivastava D.B. Ethayathulla A.S. Kumar J. Singh N. Sharma S. Das U. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. Crystal structure of a secretory signalling glycoprotein from sheep at 2.0 Å resolution.J. Struct.

Fluorescence methods for studying equilibrium macromolecule-ligand interactions.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We also observed that the emission wavelength of maximum intensity (Fmax) in the emission spectra was always 345 nm and remained unchanged in the presence of chitohexaose. This result suggested that no overall protein conformation change was induced by sugar binding. Non-linear curve fitting of the sugar titration curve yielded the binding constant (K) of 2.9 × 105 m−1, a value that agreed well with the values obtained from ITC experiments and from single channel recordings. Fluorescence enhancement derived from sugar-Trp interactions had been observed for other carbohydrate-binding proteins. For instance, when a sheep secretory glycoprotein (SPS-40) was titrated with chitosugars, Trp fluorescence intensity was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner, yielding the best binding constant value for chitohexaose (25Srivastav"

Proper folding of these proteins is monitored by the unfolded protein response and involves protein degradation pathways to ensure quality control. Here, we identify a new pathway for quality control of major facilitator superfamily transporters that occurs before the first transmembrane helix, the signal sequence recognized by the signal recognition particle, is made by the ribosome. Increased rates of translation elongation of the N-terminal sequence of these integral membrane proteins can divert the nascent protein chains to the ribosome-associated complex and stress-seventy subfamily B chaperones. We also show that quality control of integral membrane proteins by ribosome-associated complex-stress-seventy subfamily B couples translation rate to the unfolded protein response, which has implications for understanding mechanisms underlying human disease and protein production in biotechnology."

To afford insight into the molecular determinants of FBP aldolase stereospecificity during aldol addition, a key ternary complex formed by DHAP and d-G3P, comprising 2% of the equilibrium population at physiological pH, was cryotrapped in the active site of Toxoplasma gondii aldolase crystals to high resolution. The growth of T. gondii aldolase crystals in acidic conditions enabled trapping of the ternary complex as a dominant population. The obligate 3(S)-4(R) stereochemistry at the nascent C3–C4 bond of FBP requires a si-face attack by the covalent DHAP nucleophile on the d-G3P aldehyde si-face in the active site. The cis-isomer of the d-G3P aldehyde, representing the dominant population trapped in the ternary complex, would lead to re-face attack on the aldehyde and yield tagatose 1,6-bisphosphate, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. We propose that unhindered rotational isomerization by the d-G3P aldehyde moiety in the ternary complex generates the active trans-isomer competent for carbonyl bond activation by active-site residues, thereby enabling si-face attack by the DHAP enamine. C–C bond formation by the cis-isomer is suppressed by hydrogen bonding of the cis-aldehyde carbonyl with the DHAP enamine phosphate dianion through a tetrahedrally coordinated water molecule.

Aldolases are central enzymes that catalyze stereospecific carbon–carbon bond formation. Their role is best known in glycolysis, where fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) 3The abbreviations used are: FBPfructose 1,6-bisphosphateDHAPdihydroxyacetone phosphateG3Pglyceraldehyde 3-phosphateTgALDT. gondii aldolaseTBPd-tagatose-1,6-bisphosphateSBPl-sorbose 1,6-bisphosphatetriose-Ptriose-phosphatePDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.root mean squareCCcorrelation coefficient. aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) reversibly cleaves FBP into the triose-phosphates, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (d-G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The catalytic mechanism has been extensively investigated in class I aldolases from rabbit muscle, namely for its ease of purification and high sequence identity to the human counterpart. Class I aldolases make use of a covalent mechanism implicating Schiff base formation between a lysine residue and a ketose substrate (1Grazi E. Rowley P.T. Cheng T. Tchola O. Horecker B.L.

The thermodynamically favored aldol addition involves formation of a Schiff base with the keto triose-P (DHAP), shown as intermediate 1 in Scheme 1. Stereospecific abstraction of the pro(S) C3 proton on DHAP ensures the development of a carbanionic character at C3 of DHAP, which is stabilized by resonance with the enamine form (intermediate 2). The DHAP-enamine condenses with d-G3P (intermediate 3) to form the C3–C4 bond, generating the ketimine intermediate (intermediate 4), which undergoes hydrolysis to release FBP. The ordered Uni Bi reaction mechanism is a consequence of structural changes at the molecular level, whereby DHAP binding stabilizes a conformational change with respect to the free enzyme that narrows the active site cleft (2St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. High resolution reaction intermediates of rabbit muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase: substrate cleavage and induced fit.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27262-27270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The narrowing is responsible for ordered binding, as it positions side chains at the P6-phosphate binding locus such that they are now able to interact with d-G3P or with the nascent aldehyde moiety of FBP, as FBP binding mimics the structural changes induced by DHAP (3St-Jean M.

In the absence of these structural changes, stabilized by attachment at the P1-phosphate binding locus, d-G3P binding is unlikely or so weak that it has not been observed. Studies with substrates and analogues have contributed immensely to our understanding of the active-site architecture and catalytic mechanism in aldolases (4Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L.

Conflicting reports regarding the discrimination of diastereomers at the C5 position have been reported, notably regarding the l-isomer of G3P. First reports indicated that aldolase catalyzed the condensation of DHAP and l-G3P, producing l-sorbose 1,6-bisphosphate (SBP), albeit at a much lower rate than with incorporation of the d-isomer (10Richards O.C.

Substrate specificity of muscle aldolase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 14: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cleavage of SBP by FBP aldolase was equally reduced compared with FBP. However, subsequent experiments by fluorescence quenching (4Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Studies on the interaction of aldolase with substrate analogues.J. Biol.

Commun. 1968; 30: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) demonstrated that aldolase is rather progressively inactivated by l-G3P and that l-G3P is not a substrate for aldolase (4Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Studies on the interaction of aldolase with substrate analogues.J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 126-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prototypical class I aldolase used for mechanistic studies has long been the muscle isoform from rabbit aldolase. Cryocrystallography has enabled active-site trapping of a number of reaction intermediates that were determined to high resolution and, in complement with site-directed mutagenesis, delineated precise roles for several key residues, including Lys-229, the Schiff base–forming residue, and Glu-187, which mediates various proton transfer steps (2St-Jean M.

Crystal structures emanating from previous studies involved long soaking times (≥3 min) and high substrate concentrations (10 mm FBP) (2St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J.

Therefore, the cryogenic structures trapped only the highly populated intermediates, consistent with biochemical determination of active-site populations near equilibrium (14Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Kuo D.J. Concentration and partitioning of intermediates in the fructose bisphosphate aldolase reaction: comparison of the muscle and liver enzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has precluded the trapping of the elusive ternary enzymatic complex, aldolase·enamine·d-G3P, consistent with incipient aldol addition. Under neutral equilibrium conditions, this complex comprises ∼2% of the total bound intermediates (6Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Complexes of muscle aldolase in equilibrium with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3952-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 15Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L.

Crystallographic characterization of this low-abundance active-site population would afford insight into the structural constraints imposed by the active-site architecture upon the formation of the ternary complex that ensures 3(S)-4(R) stereospecificity in C–C bond formation in FBP aldolases. In class I aldolases, several interconversions of reaction intermediates are pH-dependent in the catalytic mechanism. We reasoned that crystallization conditions favoring acidic pH would provide an opportunity to stabilize reaction intermediates that would otherwise be of low occupancy in human and rabbit muscle aldolase crystals, which are typically grown at neutral pH. Specifically, a key proton transfer step, mediated by Glu-187, is required for both aldol addition and cleavage in mammalian class I aldolases and has a pKa of 5.2 in the muscle isozyme (16Maurady A. Zdanov A. de Moissac D. Beaudry D. Sygusch J. A conserved glutamate residue exhibits multifunctional catalytic roles in d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9474-9483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We reasoned that acidic crystallization conditions would make proton transfer at Glu-187 a rate-limiting step. Crystals suitable for detailed structural analysis in acidic conditions (pH 4.5–5.5) were grown for a class I aldolase from Toxoplasma gondii (TgALD), a unicellular protozoan, that shares a 57% overall sequence identity (363 residues) and 100% conservation of active-site residues with human muscle aldolase. Additionally, acid pH stabilizes Schiff base formation rather than enamine formation (6Rose I.A. Warms J.V.B. Complexes of muscle aldolase in equilibrium with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3952-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and together these considerations would argue in favor of cryotrapping intermediates with reaction geometries conducive for incipient aldolization in the direction of triose-P condensation. Crystals for TgALD were soaked with FBP substrate for various times and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to cryotrap enzymatic intermediates. The acid crystallization conditions yielded a series of high-resolution structures of enzymatic intermediates that corresponded to a series of snapshots delineating the progress of central reaction intermediates along the reaction pathway in TgALD. Notably, a ternary intermediate complex was successfully cryotrapped as a dominant population that could be shown to be consistent with incipient aldol addition. The active-site configuration of the intermediate provided intimate detail of the stereo control determinants during aldol addition. Further analyses of these structures revealed the structural basis by which glycolytic aldolases discriminate against the l-G3P enantiomer to ensure aldehyde stereospecificity. TgALD crystallized with one tetrameric subunit in the asymmetric unit of space group P42212, adopting the classic (α/β)8-barrel fold, characteristic of other class I aldolases (Fig. 1A, left). The TgALD quaternary structure corresponds to a tetramer and has 222-fold symmetry from the crystallographic packing. Data collection and refinement statistics for all crystal structures are shown in Table 1. All crystal structures were determined to high resolution (1.75–2.09 Å) and had comparable data collection and refinement statistics with Rfree values close to or inferior to 20%. Flash freezing of class I TgALD crystals previously soaked in the presence of substrate for various time intervals ranging between 0 and 30 min trapped a series of enzymatic intermediates. The intermediates included d-G3P and covalently bound DHAP simultaneously trapped before the aldol reaction step, leading to product formation (Fig. 1).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsCrystal structureNative0.5 min1 min2 min10 min30 minPDB code5TJS5TK35TKC5TKL5TKN5TKPData collection Resolution range (Å)38.97–1.78 (1.84–1.78)aAll values in parentheses are given for the highest resolution shell.49.03–1.83 (1.90–1.83)38.82–1.78 (1.84–1.78)49.02–1.75 (1.81–1.75)27.27–1.92 (1.99–1.92)48.97–2.09 (2.165–2.09) Space groupP 42 21 2P 42 21 2P 42 21 2P 42 21 2P 42 21 2P 42 21 2 No. in asymmetric unit111111 Unit cell a (Å), c (Å), degrees110.2, 54.9, 90109.8, 54.8, 90109.8, 54.9, 90109.6, 55.0, 90109.1, 54.7, 90109.12, 54.8, 90Total reflections426,298 (25,526)319,675 (24,753)404,145 (23,443)414,630 (34,281)169,255 (5154)154,210 (4866)Unique reflections32,599 (2922)29,287 (2843)31,953 (2659)34,191 (3285)21,046 (1229)19,150 (1602)Multiplicity13.1 (8.9)10.9 (8.7)12.7 (9.0)12.1 (7.5)8.0 (4.3)8.1 (3.7)Completeness0.99 (0.89)0.97 (0.97)0.97 (0.82)1.000.82 (0.48)0.87 (0.67)Average I/σ(I)20.8 (1.5)23.5 (2.5)26.2 (2.7)26.0 (1.9)20.0 (1.4)17.0 (1.3)Wilson B-factor24.626.222.623.929.630.5RmergebRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) − Īi(hkl)|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), with i running over the number of independent observations of reflection hkl.0.085 (1.243)0.061 (0.909)0.059 (0.713)0.064 (0.896)0.067 (0.717)0.084 (0.929)RmeascRmeas = Σhkl (n/(n−1))Σi(|Ii − Imean|)/ΣhklΣi(Ii).0.089 (1.322)0.064 (0.966)0.062 (0.754)0.067 (0.962)0.071 (0.800)0.089 (1.055)CC*1 (0.863)1 (0.949)1 (0.958)1 (0.914)1 (0.886)1 (0.837)Refinement RworkdRwork = Σhkl‖Io(hkl)|−|Ic(hkl)‖/Σhkl|Io(hkl)|.0.155 (0.284)0.161 (0.259)0.152 (0.235)0.149 (0.270)0.150 (0.303)0.161 (0.239) RfreeeRfree = ΣhklΕT‖Io(hkl) − |Ic(hkl)‖/ΣhklΕT|Io(hkl)|, where T is a test data set randomly selected from the observed reflections before refinement.

Open table in a new tab Active-site residues in TgALD, shown in Fig. 1A (inset), are identical to rabbit muscle aldolase except for a serine residue in the rabbit homolog, which becomes Thr-39 in TgALD. At the structural level, there is complete conservation of the subunit β-barrel fold. The TgALD structure at 30-min soaking time (Fig. 1A) corresponds to an active site fully occupied by FBP that superposes identically with the FBP-bound structure of the rabbit homolog (PDB entry 1ZAI) (r.m.s. deviation = 0.41 Å based on equivalent Cα atoms) (shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Surrounding active-site residues of the same intermediates also superpose identically (r.m.s. deviation = 0.14 Å based on equivalent Cα atoms of active-site residues). In the homology alignment of class I aldolases from diverse species shown in supplemental Fig. S2, key active-site residues, shown in Fig. 1A, are colored according to their biochemical properties. The alignment underscores the high level of sequence conservation of active-site residues in class I aldolases. The blue color scheme emphasizes the level of similarity in residues flanking the active site. The active-site similarity in both sequence and structure makes TgALD a potential candidate for studying reaction mechanisms in class I aldolases. To validate TgALD as a suitable model for studying the reaction mechanism of FBP aldolase, kinetic parameters were determined (Table 2). Values were comparable with cited values for rabbit muscle aldolase (13St-Jean M. Blonski C. Sygusch J. Charge stabilization and entropy reduction of central lysine residues in fructose-bisphosphate aldolase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Likewise, a bell-shaped pH activity profile for TgALD with pKa estimates of 5.0 ± 0.1 for the acidic limb and 9.4 ± 0.2 for the basic limb (Fig. 2) were comparable with values obtained previously for rabbit muscle aldolase (16Maurady A. Zdanov A. de Moissac D. Beaudry D. Sygusch J. A conserved glutamate residue exhibits multifunctional catalytic roles in d-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9474-9483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The active-site residues, which are evolutionarily conserved in both TgALD and rabbit muscle aldolase, together with activity profiles are consistent with Glu-189 of TgALD, which hydrogen-bonds to the C4 hydroxyl of FBP in the 30-min structure (Fig. 1A, inset), as the titrated residue responsible for proton transfer in aldol and reverse aldol reactions. In the mammalian enzyme, the homologous residue Glu-187 has been shown by structural and site-directed mutagenesis to be responsible for proton abstraction at the C4 hydroxyl of FBP and constitutes the acidic limb of the pH profile (2St-Jean M.

As indicated previously, the basic limb corresponds most likely to a proton transfer step involving the carbinolamine intermediate (17Cordes E.H. Jencks W.P.

The kinetic data imply that TgALD active-site functionality is typical of class I FBP aldolases and is stereospecific.Table 2Kinetic parameters of the FBP cleavage reaction for recombinant native aldolases from T. gondii and rabbit muscleEnzymekcataRMA, rabbit muscle aldolase; values from previous reports (13).KmpKa1/pKa2s−1μmTgALD WT7.09 ± 0.204.05 ± 0.805.0/9.4RMA WTaRMA, rabbit muscle aldolase; values from previous reports (13).13.225.1 ± 1.95.1/∼10bpKa values reported previously (16).a RMA, rabbit muscle aldolase; values from previous reports (13St-Jean M.

Open table in a new tab Active-site electron density consistent with potential reaction intermediates was carefully analyzed at each time point with simulated-annealing and iterative-build electron density omit maps to reduce model bias and to assess the fidelity of the intermediate modeling. In the native structure (Fig. 1B), the active site is solvated by numerous water molecules that extend to two and three hydration shells. The tightly bound water molecules in the first hydration shell of the active site (average B-factor of 35 ± 3 Å2 versus overall solvent B-factor of 44 ± 12 Å2) superimpose with the ligand binding loci. Water molecules W2 and W3 overlap with the d-G3P–binding site, whereas W4 overlaps with the DHAP O3 atom position. In addition, the P1-phosphate site is occupied by several water molecules. The P6-phosphate–binding site is bound by the glycerol cryoprotectant that can be seen in the 0.5min structure, where refinement indicated partial occupancies of triose-P, glycerol, and water molecules. Refinement of the active-site binding loci with water molecules revealed only residual electron density in the difference density maps, notably around water molecules whose positions coincided with those of FBP or triose-P atoms bound under saturating conditions. Diffusion of FBP into the crystal from the mother liquor results in an initial concentration gradient that eventually dissipates over time; however, before equilibration, the interior of the crystal lattice will be undersaturated with respect to the exterior substrate concentration used for crystal soaking. To assess occupancies of various active-site entities, a linear combination of three active-site populations was refined and consisted of water molecules as positioned in the native structure, FBP as found in the fully equilibrated structures, and triose-Ps as these became evident in the difference electron density map. Densities corresponding to other active-site entities were not evident. Populations having partial occupancies of <0.1 at any given time point were excluded from further refinement. At 0.5 min, the refined occupancies of DHAP and d-G3P were 0.44 and 0.25, respectively (Table 3), whereas that of water molecules was 0.68 for W2, 0.72 for W3, and 0.62 for W4, yielding combined occupancies near 1.00, as expected. Upon 1 min of soaking with FBP, the populations increased to 0.72 and 0.66 for DHAP and d-G3P, respectively. The first sign of FBP occurs at 2 min, with a refined occupancy of 0.46 and 0.52/0.51 for DHAP/d-G3P. Longer soaking times (10 min) sufficed to fully populate the TgALD active site with FBP, where trace amounts of triose-Ps were rejected from the refinement. No changes were noted in the FBP population beyond 10 min (occupancy of 1.00 at 30 min). These results indicate that the TgALD conformer has demonstrable catalytic activity in the crystal state.Table 3Progress of populations of active-site species in TgALD crystals soaked with FBPStructureRefined substrate occupancyDHAPd-G3PFBPNative0000.5 min0.440.2501 min0.720.6602 min0.520.510.4610 min00130 min001 Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, the first distinguishable ligands observed in the active site as FBP diffused into the crystals were the products of the aldolase forward reaction, namely the triose-Ps, DHAP and d-G3P. This would appear contrary to the thermodynamic equilibrium governing the aldolase reaction, whose Keq for the cleavage reaction is ∼10−4 to 10−5 m, favoring aldol addition (24Connett R.J.

However, diffusion by FBP into the crystal lattice establishes a transient concentration gradient of FBP, before its equilibration, providing an explanation for these observations. At low FBP concentrations, as would occur at the diffusion front inside the crystal, the thermodynamic equilibrium is"
