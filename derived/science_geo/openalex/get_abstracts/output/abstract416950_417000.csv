https://openalex.org/W2039459523,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated protein secretion and quality control have been shown to play an important role in immune responses in both animals and plants. In mammals, the ER membrane-located IRE1 kinase/endoribonuclease, a key regulator of unfolded protein response (UPR), is required for plasma cell development to accommodate massive secretion of immunoglobulins. Plant cells can secrete the so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins with antimicrobial activities upon pathogen challenge. However, whether IRE1 plays any role in plant immunity is not known. Arabidopsis thaliana has two copies of IRE1, IRE1a and IRE1b. Here, we show that both IRE1a and IRE1b are transcriptionally induced during chemically-induced ER stress, bacterial pathogen infection and treatment with the immune signal salicylic acid (SA). However, we found that IRE1a plays a predominant role in the secretion of PR proteins upon SA treatment. Consequently, the ire1a mutant plants show enhanced susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen and are deficient in establishing systemic acquired resistance (SAR), whereas ire1b is unaffected in these responses. We further demonstrate that the immune deficiency in ire1a is due to a defect in SA- and pathogen-triggered, IRE1-mediated cytoplasmic splicing of the bZIP60 mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor involved in the expression of UPR-responsive genes. Consistently, IRE1a is preferentially required for bZIP60 splicing upon pathogen infection, while IRE1b plays a major role in bZIP60 processing upon Tunicamycin (Tm)-induced stress. We also show that SA-dependent induction of UPR-responsive genes is altered in the bzip60 mutant resulting in a moderate susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen. These results indicate that the IRE1/bZIP60 branch of UPR is a part of the plant response to pathogens for which the two Arabidopsis IRE1 isoforms play only partially overlapping roles and that IRE1 has both bZIP60-dependent and bZIP60-independent functions in plant immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1999720487,"Nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1) is required for the conversion of extracellular ATP into inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)), a recognised inhibitor of hydroxyapatite (HA) crystal formation. A detailed phenotypic assessment of a mouse model lacking NPP1 (Enpp1(-/-)) was completed to determine the role of NPP1 in skeletal and soft tissue mineralization in juvenile and adult mice. Histopathological assessment of Enpp1(-/-) mice at 22 weeks of age revealed calcification in the aorta and kidney and ectopic cartilage formation in the joints and spine. Radiographic assessment of the hind-limb showed hyper-mineralization in the talocrural joint and hypo-mineralization in the femur and tibia. MicroCT analysis of the tibia and femur disclosed altered trabecular architecture and bone geometry at 6 and 22 weeks of age in Enpp1(-/-) mice. Trabecular number, trabecular bone volume, structure model index, trabecular and cortical thickness were all significantly reduced in tibiae and femurs from Enpp1(-/-) mice (P<0.05). Bone stiffness as determined by 3-point bending was significantly reduced in Enpp1(-/-) tibiae and femurs from 22-week-old mice (P<0.05). Circulating phosphate and calcium levels were reduced (P<0.05) in the Enpp1(-/-) null mice. Plasma levels of osteocalcin were significantly decreased at 6 weeks of age (P<0.05) in Enpp1(-/-) mice, with no differences noted at 22 weeks of age. Plasma levels of CTx (Ratlaps™) and the phosphaturic hormone FGF-23 were significantly increased in the Enpp1(-/-) mice at 22 weeks of age (P<0.05). Fgf-23 messenger RNA expression in cavarial osteoblasts was increased 12-fold in Enpp1(-/-) mice compared to controls. These results indicate that Enpp1(-/-) mice are characterized by severe disruption to the architecture and mineralization of long-bones, dysregulation of calcium/phosphate homeostasis and changes in Fgf-23 expression. We conclude that NPP1 is essential for normal bone development and control of physiological bone mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2108292915,"Modelling the spatial distributions of human parasite species is crucial to understanding the environmental determinants of infection as well as for guiding the planning of control programmes. Here, we use ecological niche modelling to map the current potential distribution of the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), in Africa, and to estimate how future changes in climate and population could affect its spread and burden across the continent. We used 508 community-specific infection presence data collated from the published literature in conjunction with five predictive environmental/climatic and demographic variables, and a maximum entropy niche modelling method to construct the first ecological niche maps describing potential distribution and burden of LF in Africa. We also ran the best-fit model against climate projections made by the HADCM3 and CCCMA models for 2050 under A2a and B2a scenarios to simulate the likely distribution of LF under future climate and population changes. We predict a broad geographic distribution of LF in Africa extending from the west to the east across the middle region of the continent, with high probabilities of occurrence in the Western Africa compared to large areas of medium probability interspersed with smaller areas of high probability in Central and Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. We uncovered complex relationships between predictor ecological niche variables and the probability of LF occurrence. We show for the first time that predicted climate change and population growth will expand both the range and risk of LF infection (and ultimately disease) in an endemic region. We estimate that populations at risk to LF may range from 543 and 804 million currently, and that this could rise to between 1.65 to 1.86 billion in the future depending on the climate scenario used and thresholds applied to signify infection presence."
https://openalex.org/W2022401755,"Introduction Healthcare management is oriented toward single diseases, yet multimorbidity is nevertheless the rule and there is a tendency for certain diseases to occur in clusters. This study sought to identify comorbidity patterns in patients with chronic diseases, by reference to number of comorbidities, age and sex, in a population receiving medical care from 129 general practitioners in Spain, in 2007. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a health-area setting of the Madrid Autonomous Region (Comunidad Autónoma), covering a population of 198,670 individuals aged over 14 years. Multiple correspondences were analyzed to identify the clustering patterns of the conditions targeted. Results Forty-two percent (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.8–42.2) of the registered population had at least one chronic condition. In all, 24.5% (95% CI: 24.3–24.6) of the population presented with multimorbidity. In the correspondence analysis, 98.3% of the total information was accounted for by three dimensions. The following four, age- and sex-related comorbidity patterns were identified: pattern B, showing a high comorbidity rate; pattern C, showing a low comorbidity rate; and two patterns, A and D, showing intermediate comorbidity rates. Conclusions Four comorbidity patterns could be identified which grouped diseases as follows: one showing diseases with a high comorbidity burden; one showing diseases with a low comorbidity burden; and two showing diseases with an intermediate comorbidity burden."
https://openalex.org/W2040157017,"Background Invasive predators may change the structure of invaded communities through predation and competition with native species. In Europe, the invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is excluding the native white clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. Methodology and Principal Findings This study compared the predatory functional responses and prey choice of native and invasive crayfish and measured impacts of parasitism on the predatory strength of the native species. Invasive crayfish showed a higher (>10%) prey (Gammarus pulex) intake rate than (size matched) natives, reflecting a shorter (16%) prey handling time. The native crayfish also showed greater selection for crustacean prey over molluscs and bloodworm, whereas the invasive species was a more generalist predator. A. pallipes parasitised by the microsporidian parasite Thelohania contejeani showed a 30% reduction in prey intake. We suggest that this results from parasite-induced muscle damage, and this is supported by a reduced (38%) attack rate and increased (30%) prey handling time. Conclusions and Significance Our results indicate that the per capita (i.e., functional response) difference between the species may contribute to success of the invader and extinction of the native species, as well as decreased biodiversity and biomass in invaded rivers. In addition, the reduced predatory strength of parasitized natives may impair their competitive abilities, facilitating exclusion by the invader."
https://openalex.org/W2034778702,"Environmentally-induced fluctuation in the form and strength of natural selection can drive the evolution of morphology, physiology, and behavior. Here we test the idea that fluctuating climatic conditions may also influence the process of sexual selection by inducing unexpected reversals in the relative quality or sexual attractiveness of potential breeding partners. Although this phenomenon, known as 'ecological cross-over', has been documented in a variety of species, it remains unclear the extent to which it has driven the evolution of major interspecific differences in reproductive behavior. We show that after controlling for potentially influential life history and demographic variables, there are significant positive associations between the variability and predictability of annual climatic cycles and the prevalence of infidelity and divorce within populations of a taxonomically diverse array of socially monogamous birds. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmental factors have shaped the evolution of reproductive flexibility and suggest that in the absence of severe time constraints, secondary mate choice behaviors can help prevent, correct, or minimize the negative consequences of ecological cross-overs. Our findings also illustrate how a basic evolutionary process like sexual selection is susceptible to the increasing variability and unpredictability of climatic conditions that is resulting from climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2049699926,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe progressive muscular disorder caused by reading frame disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, preventing the synthesis of functional dystrophin. As dystrophin provides muscle fiber stability during contractions, dystrophin negative fibers are prone to exercise-induced damage. Upon exhaustion of the regenerative capacity, fibers will be replaced by fibrotic and fat tissue resulting in a progressive loss of function eventually leading to death in the early thirties. With several promising approaches for the treatment of DMD aiming at dystrophin restoration in clinical trials, there is an increasing need to determine more precisely which dystrophin levels are sufficient to restore muscle fiber integrity, protect against muscle damage and improve muscle function. To address this we generated a new mouse model (mdx-XistΔhs) with varying, low dystrophin levels (3–47%, mean 22.7%, stdev 12.1, n = 24) due to skewed X-inactivation. Longitudinal sections revealed that within individual fibers, some nuclei did and some did not express dystrophin, resulting in a random, mosaic pattern of dystrophin expression within fibers. Mdx-XistΔhs, mdx and wild type females underwent a 12 week functional test regime consisting of different tests to assess muscle function at base line, or after chronic treadmill running exercise. Overall, mdx-XistΔhs mice with 3–14% dystrophin outperformed mdx mice in the functional tests. Improved histopathology was observed in mice with 15–29% dystrophin and these levels also resulted in normalized expression of pro-inflammatory biomarker genes, while for other parameters >30% of dystrophin was needed. Chronic exercise clearly worsened pathology, which needed dystrophin levels >20% for protection. Based on these findings, we conclude that while even dystrophin levels below 15% can improve pathology and performance, levels of >20% are needed to fully protect muscle fibers from exercise-induced damage."
https://openalex.org/W2056464081,"The essential P-loop NTPases Cfd1 and Nbp35 of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly machinery perform a scaffold function for Fe-S cluster synthesis. Both proteins contain a nucleotide binding motif of unknown function and a C-terminal motif with four conserved cysteine residues. The latter motif defines the Mrp/Nbp35 subclass of P-loop NTPases and is suspected to be involved in transient Fe-S cluster binding. To elucidate the function of these two motifs, we first created cysteine mutant proteins of Cfd1 and Nbp35 and investigated the consequences of these mutations by genetic, cell biological, biochemical, and spectroscopic approaches. The two central cysteine residues (CPXC) of the C-terminal motif were found to be crucial for cell viability, protein function, coordination of a labile [4Fe-4S] cluster, and Cfd1-Nbp35 hetero-tetramer formation. Surprisingly, the two proximal cysteine residues were dispensable for all these functions, despite their strict evolutionary conservation. Several lines of evidence suggest that the C-terminal CPXC motifs of Cfd1-Nbp35 coordinate a bridging [4Fe-4S] cluster. Upon mutation of the nucleotide binding motifs Fe-S clusters could no longer be assembled on these proteins unless wild-type copies of Cfd1 and Nbp35 were present in trans. This result indicated that Fe-S cluster loading on these scaffold proteins is a nucleotide-dependent step. We propose that the bridging coordination of the C-terminal Fe-S cluster may be ideal for its facile assembly, labile binding, and efficient transfer to target Fe-S apoproteins, a step facilitated by the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly proteins Nar1 and Cia1 in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2046340080,"By virtue of its amplifying property, the alternative complement pathway has been implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases and constitutes an attractive therapeutic target. An anti-factor D Fab fragment (AFD) was generated to inhibit the alternative complement pathway in advanced dry age-related macular degeneration. AFD potently prevented factor D (FD)-mediated proteolytic activation of its macromolecular substrate C3bB, but not proteolysis of a small synthetic substrate, indicating that AFD did not block access of the substrate to the catalytic site. The crystal structures of AFD in complex with human and cynomolgus FD (at 2.4 and 2.3 Å, respectively) revealed the molecular details of the inhibitory mechanism. The structures show that the AFD-binding site includes surface loops of FD that form part of the FD exosite. Thus, AFD inhibits FD proteolytic function by interfering with macromolecular substrate access rather than by inhibiting FD catalysis, providing the molecular basis of AFD-mediated inhibition of a rate-limiting step in the alternative complement pathway.

Complement activation is an innate defense mechanism that, when uncontrolled, leads to inflammation and local tissue damage. Both gain- and loss-of-function SNPs in genes of the alternative complement pathway control risk of age-related macular degeneration.

Because of a strong genetic and pathophysiological link between alternative complement pathway activation and age-related macular degeneration, the past years have seen an increase in the number of therapeutics that target the complement pathways in this disease. Inhibitors that target complement pathway convertases are currently in preclinical development or in clinical trials (5Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Complement-targeted therapeutics.Nat.

FD is responsible for conversion of the alternative pathway proconvertases C3bB and C3b2B to form the active C3 convertase C3bBb or the C5 convertase C3b2Bb. Moreover, FD is a rate-limiting enzyme of the alternative complement pathway and has the lowest concentration in plasma among all complement proteins (6Volanakis J.E. Barnum S.R. Giddens M. Galla J.H. Renal filtration and catabolism of complement protein D.N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting FD with a neutralizing anti-FD antibody is a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit alternative complement activation for treatment of age-related macular degeneration. In addition to inhibiting the alternative pathway, an anti-FD antibody indirectly also blocks classical and mannose-binding lectin pathways, as amplification of these pathways depends on alternative pathway convertase activation (7Harboe M.

Humanization was performed by grafting the complementarity-determining regions of mAb 166-32 on human germ line framework regions. Minimal framework changes were required in the variable regions to retain high-affinity binding of AFD to FD. So far, it is unclear how AFD inhibits FD activation. The structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies described herein provide a detailed insight into the molecular mechanism by which AFD interferes with FD-dependent complement activation. AFD binds to an exosite region that is remote from the catalytic center of FD. As a result, AFD does not impair catalysis of a small synthetic substrate, but it potently inhibits binding and activation of the macromolecular substrate C3bB, leading to efficient attenuation of alternative complement pathway activation and its amplification.

Binding analysis was performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument. C3b was amine-coupled to a CM5 chip following the manufacturer's recommendation. The CM5 chip was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (flow rate of 5 μl/min, 30 μl). C3b (50 μg/ml) was flowed at 5 μl/min and 20 μl to achieve 7300 final resonance units.

Binding assays used the “co-inject” mode in the Biacore instrument. One μm FB was injected (flow rate of 30 μl/min, 90 μl), followed by co-injecting a mixture of 1 μm FB and FD(S195A) (2-fold dilutions, FD(S195A) concentration range of 15.6 nm to 4.0 μm, flow rate of 30 μl/min, 90 μl), and then allowed to dissociate in assay buffer for 5 min. The Biacore chip was regenerated by three 1-min washes with 3 m NaCl in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and re-equilibrated for 5 min with assay buffer.

An affinity column was prepared by coupling anti-FD Ab 8E2 to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Unreacted sites were blocked with ethanolamine. The harvested transient supernatants were applied to the 8E2 affinity column, washed with PBS, eluted with 0.1 m acetic acid, neutralized with 1.5 m Tris (pH 8.6), and dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 200 mm NaCl. Characterization of the purified proteins confirmed intact, monomeric, >98% pure FD with the signal peptide and propeptide fully processed. The final protein samples were in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 140 mm NaCl. AFD was provided in lyophilized form and reconstituted with water. The resulting solution was 50 mg/ml protein in 40 mm histidine hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium chloride, 180 mm sucrose, and 0.04% (w/v) polysorbate 20 (pH 5.4). Human FD protein and AFD were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and purified on a Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and 200 mm NaCl. The peak fractions containing the complex were pooled, concentrated to 30 mg/ml, and used in a crystallization trial. Crystals were grown at 4 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 m ammonium phosphate, 50% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 0.01 m hexamine cobalt(III) chloride was mixed in an equal volume with the protein solution. Crystals appeared after 6 days and belonged to space group P43212. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 2.4 Å data set was collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 9-2. The cynomolgus FD-AFD complex was purified following the same protocol as described above. Crystals used in the structure determination were grown at 19 °C in 0.1 m MES (pH 6.5), 25% PEG monomethyl ether 550, 0.01 m zinc sulfate, and 3% 6-aminohexanoic acid using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method and mixed with an equal volume of protein solution (20 mg/ml) and mother liquor. The crystals appeared after 1 day and belonged to space group C2. The crystals were dipped in artificial mother liquor containing 10% glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 2.1Å data set was collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 9-2. Structures were solved using the program Phaser (18Murshudov G.N. Skubák P. Lebedev A.A. Pannu N.S. Steiner R.A. Nicholls R.A. Winn M.D. Long F. Vagin A.A. REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures.Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar), the model was manually improved using the program Coot, and refinement was done with REFMAC and BUSTER (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13864) Google Scholar). The buried surface in the AFD-FD complex (supplemental Table S2) was determined by first calculating the surface area of each residue in the two structures (FD and AFD) separately and then calculating the surface that is accessible in the complex. The difference shows how much of the surface of each residue is buried in the interface. Figures were made using the program PyMOL (39DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.4. Schrödinger, LLC, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). AFD efficiently blocked FB cleavage and the formation of a C3 convertase (Fig. 1, A and B). AFD also inhibited amplification of the complement response in human serum (Fig. 1C). In contrast, 8E2, a Fab fragment of an antibody that binds to FD, did not inhibit FD proteolytic activity even at the highest concentration tested. AFD did not decrease the proteolytic conversion of the thioester substrate thiobenzyl benzyloxycarbonyl-l-Lysinate (Z-lys-SBzl) ester by FD (20Kim S. Narayana S.V. Volanakis J.E. Catalytic role of a surface loop of the complement serine protease factor D.J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6073-6079PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that FD thioesterolytic activity is not inhibited by AFD (supplemental Fig. S1). Rather, AFD enhanced the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction, whereas antibody 8E2 did not affect the enzymatic activity of FD. This indicates that AFD does not prevent small substrates from accessing the FD catalytic site. The unexpected increase in thioesterolytic activity following AFD binding maybe explained by stabilization of the active site, facilitating proteolysis of small substrates, but further analysis needs to be performed to confirm this. Thus, AFD binds to an epitope on FD that is implicated in proteolytic conversion of its macromolecular substrate C3bB, in human serum. Because AFD did not affect access of small substrates to the FD active site but effectively inhibited proteolysis of its macromolecular substrate, we employed surface plasmon resonance to determine whether AFD blocks alternative pathway complement activation by interfering with FD binding to C3bB. To establish binding of FD to C3bB, a constant amount of FB was injected onto immobilized C3b. This was followed by injection of a dilution series of FD(S195A), which is unable to cleave FB (Fig. 2A). FD did not bind C3b directly (supplemental Fig. S2), in line with previous observations (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The KD of FD(S195A) binding to C3bB is 720 nm (Fig. 2B), which is in reasonable agreement with the affinity reported previously (315 nm) (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of AFD on binding, a constant amount of FD(S195A) was premixed with a dilution series of AFD or control Ab 8E2 before binding to C3bB was measured. AFD, but not 8E2, inhibited binding of FD(S195A) to C3bB in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Full inhibition of binding was achieved at a ∼1:1 molar ratio of AFD to FD(S195A). The structures of human and cynomolgus FD in complex with AFD were solved at 2.4 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3, A–C, and Table S1). The two symmetry-related FD molecules in either of the Fab complexes superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.5 Å for the 228 common Cα positions. Similarly, human FD in complex with AFD superimposed well onto the cynomolgus FD-AFD complex with a root mean square deviation ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 Å for all Cα positions, with the largest differences occurring around the poorly ordered catalytic residue His-57 and the inhibitory loop (residues 212–218; chymotrypsin numbering has been used throughout this work) (supplemental Fig. S6B). Comparison of the FD-AFD complexes with published structures of FD illustrates that no conformational changes are required in FD to allow binding of AFD and that the structure of FD in the FD-AFD complex is similar to the overall structures of native FD (Protein Data Bank codes 1HFD (22Jing H.

The FD-AFD binding interface is >20 Å away from the catalytic center, and the interaction of AFD with FD does not change the conformation of the active site pocket or of the oxyanion hole. In the structure of cynomolgus FD (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S3C), the catalytic triad residues His-57, Asp-102, and Ser-195 are in a catalytically incompetent conformation, with the side chain of His-57 pointing away from the active site and the inhibitory loop (residues 212–218) adopting a non-competent conformation as seen in the structures of free FD (22Jing H. Babu Y.S. Moore D. Kilpatrick J.M. Liu X.Y. Volanakis J.E. Narayana S.V. Structures of native and complexed complement factor D: implications of the atypical His-57 conformation and self-inhibitory loop in the regulation of specific serine protease activity.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 1061-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Narayana S.V. Carson M. el-Kabbani O. Kilpatrick J.M. Moore D. Chen X. Bugg C.E. Volanakis J.E. DeLucas L.J. Structure of human factor D. A complement system protein at 2.0 Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inhibitory loop in human FD is rearranged compared with free FD and adopts a competent conformation similar to the one observed in the complex between C3b, FB, and FD (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the side chain of His-57 is poorly defined in the electron density and was modeled in two different conformations, only one of which is catalytically competent (Fig. 3B). These differences in residues of the rather flexible active site underscore the lack of an induced conformation by binding of AFD, and it is apparent that AFD can bind the active as well as the inactive conformation of FD. The interface between FD and AFD is virtually identical in all four complexes; we describe here the interface between chain A of human FD and AFD. A total of 1649 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface is buried in the interface between human FD and AFD: 901 Å2 buried on FD, 485 Å2 on the heavy chain (HC) of AFD, and the remaining 263 Å2 on the light chain (LC) of AFD (supplemental Table S2). AFD is in contact with residues 129A–132, the loop spanning residues 164–178, and Arg-223 and Lys-223A of FD (Fig. 4A). The bulk of the interaction (∼80% of the buried surface) is due to interactions involving the 170 loop of FD. Most prominently, the 170 loop of FD is “sandwiched” between the LC and HC of AFD with Arg-170A of FD deeply buried between the two chains. Arg-170A forms numerous potential hydrogen bonds and charged interactions with Glu-97 and Glu-99 of the HC and with Tyr-36 and Asn-34 of the LC (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S4). Additional charged interactions are formed between Lys-223A of FD and the side chains of Asp-30, Asp-32, and Asp-92 of the LC of AFD (Fig. 4B). The interaction between Arg-170A and the LC as well as HC residues in AFD likely explains the high affinity (KD < 10 pm by surface plasmon resonance) (supplemental Fig. S5, A and B) of AFD for FD. There are nine residue differences between human and cynomolgus FD, all of which, with one exception, are located in regions that are distant from the AFD-binding interface (supplemental Fig. S6, A and B). Residue 178 is the exception, with the Glu-178 side chain of human FD engaged in a weak hydrogen bond interaction with HC Thr-28. In comparison, Gln-178 of cynomolgus FD is engaged in a hydrogen bond interaction with HC Asn-31. These minor differences likely explain the lower affinity of AFD for cynomolgus FD compared with human FD (supplemental Fig. S5B). Recently, the crystal structure of FD bound to the proconvertase C3bB was reported (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this complex, FD forms contacts with FB in the C3bBD complex via four loops, including residues 145–149, 169–173, 185–188, and 220–224, collectively defining the FD exosite (Fig. 5, A and B) (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Upon binding to C3bB, FD exhibits conformational changes that increase serine protease activity (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These include structural changes in the self-inhibitory loop and the flipping of the side chain of His-57 to induce an active conformation of the catalytic triad. There are five residues in FD that establish contacts with both AFD and C3bB: Arg-170A, Thr-170B, Asp-173, Arg-223, and Lys-223A. Superimposition of AFD in complex with FD onto the structure of FD bound to C3bB (C3bBD) shows that steric clashes prevent access of FD to C3bB when bound to AFD (Fig. 5C). Hence, the structures clearly confirm the mechanism of action by which AFD inhibits the activation of alternative pathway convertase C3bB by FD. Here, we have described the molecular mechanism by which AFD, a promising therapeutic antibody, inhibits alternative pathway complement activation. The specificity and proteolytic activity of FD for its substrate FB are determined primarily by its exosite-mediated binding to the open form of FB (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Upon binding of AFD to the exosite, FD is not able to cleave FB in C3bB to generate an active C3Bb convertase and amplify the generation of complement effector molecules in serum. AFD is a potent inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, and the FD-AFD co-structure provides a molecular explanation for AFD activity. Although the size of the surface area on FD that is buried by AFD (901 Å) is typical for an Ab-protein interaction (26Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6804) Google Scholar), a key substrate-binding loop on FD is deeply buried in the interface wedged between the AFD HC and LC, allowing for formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and charged interactions between FD and AFD. Hence, the high potency of AFD can be explained by the high binding affinity of AFD for FD, which is >70,000-fold higher than the binding affinity of FD for its substrate C3bB. AFD binding to the exosite loop distant from the catalytic site can fully explain the mechanism by which AFD inhibits proteolytic activity, but not thioesterolytic activity. The fact that AFD binding to FD increases thioesterolytic activity for a small substrate indicates that subtle conformational changes may take place in the active site configuration that cannot be defined in the structure. An allosteric effect of AFD may explain why human FD is partly in the active conformation in the complex with AFD. However, interactions of FD with the open form of FB are required to induce full activation of FD (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and AFD prevents any of these interactions from taking place. Previous crystal structures of Fab-serine protease complexes defined two distinct mechanisms by which antibodies block catalytic activity (27Ganesan R. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. Structural and mechanistic insight into how antibodies inhibit serine proteases.Biochem. J. 2010; 430: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The antibodies either insert complementarity-determining region loops into the catalytic cleft to prevent access of the scissile peptide (steric inhibition) or impose structural changes at the S2–S4 sites by an allosteric mechanism (27Ganesan R. Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. Structural and mechanistic insight into how antibodies inhibit serine proteases.Biochem. J. 2010; 430: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Farady C.J. Sun J. Darragh M.R. Miller S.M. Craik C.S. The mechanism of inhibition of antibody-based inhibitors of membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1).J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Wu Y. Eigenbrot C. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Shia S. Fan B. Ganesan R. Lipari M.T. Kirchhofer D. Structural insight into distinct mechanisms of protease inhibition by antibodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19784-19789Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both mechanisms are competitive in nature and result in inhibition of small synthetic as well as macromolecular substrate proteolysis. The mechanism identified herein is different in that AFD binds to the FD exosite region to inhibit processing of the macromolecular substrate FB, but not of a small synthetic substrate. The latter finding that AFD did not inhibit small substrate cleavage is consistent with the absence of conformational changes at the catalytic cleft by AFD. Instead, AFD binds to two (170 and 220 loops) of the four FD surface loops that define the FD exosite (21Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Structures of C3b in complex with factors B and D give insight into complement convertase formation.Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and thereby completely prevents access of the open FB form to productively interact with FD. Therefore, inhibition of the exosite interaction by AFD defines a third molecular mechanism by which antibodies interfere with catalysis of trypsin-like serine proteases. Preventing substrates from interacting productively with complement convertases has been adopted by pathogens as a strategy to evade complement attack. Staphylococcus aureus inhibitors SCIN-A and SCIN-B bind to a functionally important site on C3b, entrapping the convertase in an inactive state (30Ricklin D. Tzekou A. Garcia B.L. Hammel M.

The extracellular fibrinogen-binding molecule of S. aureus acts as both an allosteric and a competitive inhibitor by inducing conformational changes in C3b that prevent formation of an active C3 convertase (33Chen H.

An example of a complement inhibitor that targets the substrate rather than the convertase is the tick C5 inhibitor OmCI, which binds to the C345C domain of C5, preventing interaction of C5 with its convertase (34Fredslund F.

Finally, complement receptor CRIg inhibits complement activation by preventing binding of C5 to the C5 convertase (17Wiesmann C. Katschke K.J. Yin J. Helmy K.Y. Steffek M. Fairbrother W.J.

Thus, steric inhibition is a potent strategy to inhibit complement convertases. In sum, this study demonstrates that a high-affinity antibody directed to the FD exosite can block a low-affinity enzyme-substrate interaction required for complement activation and amplification.

https://openalex.org/W1967813772,"The mechanism for inflammation associated tumor development is a central issue for tumor biology and immunology and remains to be fully elucidated. Although IL-17 is implicated in association with inflammation mediated carcinogenesis, mechanisms are largely elusive. In the current studies, we showed that IL-17 receptor-A gene deficient (IL-17R-/-) mice were resistant to chemical carcinogen-induced cutaneous carcinogenesis, a well-established inflammation associated tumor model in the skin. The deficiency in IL-17R increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells whereas it inhibited the infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells and development of myeloid derived suppressor cells. Inflammation induced skin hyperplasia and production of pro-tumor inflammatory molecules were inhibited in IL-17R-/- mice. We found that pre-existing inflammation in the skin increased the susceptibility to tumor growth, which was associated with increased development of tumor specific IL-17 producing T cells. This inflammation induced susceptibility to tumor growth was abrogated in IL-17R-/- mice. Finally, neutralizing IL-17 in mice that had already developed chemical carcinogen induced skin tumors could inhibit inflammation mediated tumor progression at late stages. These results demonstrate that IL-17 mediated inflammation is an important mechanism for inflammation mediated promotion of tumor development. The study has major implications for targeting IL-17 in prevention and treatment of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1999602656,"Bee venom is a rich source of pharmacologically active substances. In this study, we identified a bumblebee (Bombus ignitus) venom Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (Bi-KTI) that acts as a plasmin inhibitor. Bi-KTI showed no detectable inhibitory effect on factor Xa, thrombin, or tissue plasminogen activator. In contrast, Bi-KTI strongly inhibited plasmin, indicating that it acts as an antifibrinolytic agent; however, this inhibitory ability was two-fold weaker than that of aprotinin. The fibrin(ogen)olytic activities of B. ignitus venom serine protease (Bi-VSP) and plasmin in the presence of Bi-KTI indicate that Bi-KTI targets plasmin more specifically than Bi-VSP. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which bumblebee venom affects the hemostatic system through the antifibrinolytic activity of Bi-KTI and through Bi-VSP-mediated fibrin(ogen)olytic activities, raising interest in Bi-KTI and Bi-VSP as potential clinical agents."
https://openalex.org/W1974404575,"Background Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, expresses two aminopeptidases, PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP, critical to generating a free amino acid pool used by the intraerythrocytic stage of the parasite for proteins synthesis, growth and development. These exopeptidases are potential targets for the development of a new class of anti-malaria drugs. Methodology/Principal Findings To define the substrate specificity of recombinant forms of these two malaria aminopeptidases we used a new library consisting of 61 fluorogenic substrates derived both from natural and unnatural amino acids. We obtained a detailed substrate fingerprint for recombinant forms of the enzymes revealing that PfM1AAP exhibits a very broad substrate tolerance, capable of efficiently hydrolyzing neutral and basic amino acids, while PfM17LAP has narrower substrate specificity and preferentially cleaves bulky, hydrophobic amino acids. The substrate library was also exploited to profile the activity of the native aminopeptidases in soluble cell lysates of P. falciparum malaria. Conclusions/Significance This data showed that PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP are responsible for majority of the aminopeptidase activity in these extracts. These studies provide specific substrate and mechanistic information important for understanding the function of these aminopeptidases and could be exploited in the design of new inhibitors to specifically target these for anti-malaria treatment."

We have studied the trans-encoded class II HLA molecule DQ2.3 (DQA1*03:01/DQB1*02:01) that has received particular attention as it may explain the increased risk of certain individuals to type 1 diabetes. We report the x-ray crystal structure of this HLA molecule complexed with a gluten epitope at 3.05 Å resolution. The gluten epitope, which is the only known HLA-DQ2.3-restricted epitope, is preferentially recognized in the context of the DQ2.3 molecule by T-cell clones of a DQ8/DQ2.5 heterozygous celiac disease patient. This preferential recognition can be explained by improved HLA binding as the epitope combines the peptide-binding motif of DQ2.5 (negative charge at P4) and DQ8 (negative charge at P1). The analysis of the structure of DQ2.3 together with all other available DQ crystal structures and sequences led us to categorize DQA1 and DQB1 genes into two groups where any α-chain and β-chain belonging to the same group are expected to form a stable heterodimer.

https://openalex.org/W1967484841,"APOBEC3G (Apo3G) is a single-stranded (ss)DNA cytosine deaminase that eliminates HIV-1 infectivity by converting C → U in numerous small target motifs on the minus viral cDNA. Apo3G deaminates linear ssDNA in vitro with pronounced spatial asymmetry favoring the 3′ → 5′ direction. A similar polarity observed in vivo is believed responsible for initiating localized C → T mutational gradients that inactivate the virus. When compared with double-stranded (ds)DNA scanning enzymes, e.g. DNA glycosylases that excise rare aberrant bases, there is a paucity of mechanistic studies on ssDNA scanning enzymes. Here, we investigate ssDNA scanning and motif-targeting mechanisms for Apo3G using single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We address the specific issue of deamination asymmetry within the general context of ssDNA scanning mechanisms and show that Apo3G scanning trajectories, ssDNA contraction, and deamination efficiencies depend on motif sequence, location, and ionic strength. Notably, we observe the presence of bidirectional quasi-localized scanning of Apo3G occurring proximal to a 5′ hot motif, a motif-dependent DNA contraction greatest for 5′ hot > 3′ hot > 5′ cold motifs, and diminished mobility at low salt. We discuss the single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer data in terms of a model in which deamination polarity occurs as a consequence of Apo3G binding to ssDNA in two orientations, one that is catalytically favorable, with the other disfavorable.

Incidental deamination of dC → dU occurs frequently, especially on single-stranded (ss)DNA (1Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Repair and genetic consequences of endogenous DNA base damage in mammalian cells.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 445-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), which is a potential source of spontaneous C → T mutations. The elimination of U·G mismatches by base excision repair ensures that deamination-initiated mutations are minimized in genomic DNA (1Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

In the event that Apo3G does not induce sufficient mutagenesis to result in HIV-1 inactivation, it may contribute to HIV-1 evolution and development of drug-resistant quasi-species (10Jern P.

It is important to establish the biochemical mechanisms of how Apo3G induces multiple mutations in the HIV-1 genome per se, and also to support ongoing efforts to develop Apo3G-based HIV therapies (11Chiu Y.L.

APOBEC3G single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer transition density plot hidden Markov model post-synchronization histogram nucleotide poly(dT) poly(dA). Our objective is to examine how Apo3G locates and then deaminates C motifs on an ssDNA substrate. Apo3G contains two deaminase domains. The N-terminal domain (CD1) is not catalytically active, but it is required for HIV-1 virion encapsidation and can bind DNA and RNA (12Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. König R. Yu Q. Chiles K.

Crystal structure of the anti-viral APOBEC3G catalytic domain and functional implications.Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Previous “bulk” biochemical studies showed that Apo3G catalyzes processive deaminations on linear ssDNA prior to acting on another substrate molecule while displaying a pronounced catalytic polarity (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. APOBEC3G DNA deaminase acts processively 3′ → 5′ on single-stranded DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Trinucleotide motifs are deaminated with increased efficiency when located nearer to the 5′-end of the DNA, and the terminal 33 nt at the 3′-end of an ssDNA substrate are barely deaminated, creating a deamination “dead zone” (16Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F. A model for oligomeric regulation of APOBEC3G cytosine deaminase-dependent restriction of HIV.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13780-13791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The current model for the Apo3G scanning mechanism that has resulted from bulk biochemical studies has yet been unable to answer several questions regarding the scanning mechanism. These questions are addressed here using single molecule FRET (smFRET). From a biological perspective, it has been suggested that Apo3G deamination polarity offers a likely explanation for the presence of localized mutational gradients in the HIV-1 genome that appear to be important in viral inactivation (17Suspène R. Rusniok C. Vartanian J.P. Wain-Hobson S. Twin gradients in APOBEC3-edited HIV-1 DNA reflect the dynamics of lentiviral replication.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4677-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using smFRET, we visualize Apo3G movement and catalysis on linear ssDNA in real time. We investigate how motif location and identity, i.e. “hot” versus “cold” motifs, influence Apo3G motion, C deamination efficiency, and DNA contraction. The smFRET data provide new insights into a model in which Apo3G is presumed to scan ssDNA in a symmetric, bidirectional manner, yet causes spatially polar deaminations by binding asymmetrically to ssDNA in two orientations, one that is catalytically active and another that is essentially inactive (18Chelico L. Prochnow C. Erie D.A. Chen X.S. Goodman M.F. Structural model for deoxycytidine deamination mechanisms of the HIV-1 inactivation enzyme APOBEC3G.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16195-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with pseudo-localized scanning in the vicinity of a 5′ hot motif. To remove surface-exposed cysteine residues (confirmed by bioinformatic structural modeling of Apo3G), we used a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol to mutate cysteine 139, 243, and 308 to leucine, alanine, and leucine, respectively. Only one surface-exposed residue (Cys-356) is available for labeling with Cy5-maleimide. A baculovirus-expressed mutated GST-Apo3G protein variant was prepared as described previously (15Chelico L. Pham P. Calabrese P. Goodman M.F. APOBEC3G DNA deaminase acts processively 3′ → 5′ on single-stranded DNA.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The Cy5 maleimide mono-reactive dye kit (GE Healthcare) protocol was used to achieve 10–20% labeling efficiency, to prevent nonspecific labeling of protein side chains. Free label was removed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-6 (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay and BSA protein standardization. Labeling efficiency was determined by UV (280 and 552 nm). Mass spectrometry analysis of Cy5-Apo3G confirmed that the predicted surface-exposed Cys-356 was labeled (Harvard University Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Core). We have further verified by photobleaching that Apo3G has a single Cy5-label. Cy5-Apo3G retained activity and deamination properties of native Apo3G. We have also verified, based on previous atomic force microscopy data (16Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F.

Two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) of Pfu DNA polymerase expression vector pET-30a-PFU (Dr. Stephen Bell, Cambridge, UK) were performed (D125A, I48C) to make an exo-Pfu suitable for labeling. The resulting vector (pPFUe-I48C) was transformed into BL21 Rosetta(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Cells were grown at 37 °C until an A500 of ∼0.5 was reached. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (1 mm final concentration), and cells were grown at room temperature (∼25 °C) overnight and then centrifuged at 4 °C (4,000 rpm for 15 min) and resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, 50 mg/ml lysozyme. After sonication on ice (10 × 15-s pulses), 20 units of DNase I and 10 μg/ml RNase A were added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then boiled for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged twice (17,000 × g for 15 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin, Novagen) and washed four times with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration of fractions (∼90 kDa) was determined by near-UV absorbance (A280). Pfu D125A/I48C was labeled using the Cy5 maleimide mono-reactive dye kit (GE Healthcare) according to provided protocols. Quartz microscope slides were passivated with methoxy-PEG (Mr = 5,000; Laysan Bio Inc.) and 1% biotin-PEG (Mr = 3,400; Laysan Bio Inc.) to minimize nonspecific binding (19Ha T. Rasnik I. Cheng W.

Solution was serially diluted for surface immobilization (25–50 pm) of partial double-stranded DNA in standard buffer. Excess DNA was washed out, Cy5-labeled Apo3G (1 nm) was introduced in a standard buffer, immediately followed by data acquisition on a home-built prism-based total internal reflection single molecule fluorescence microscope at 1-s or 30-ms time resolution (21Zhao R. Rueda D. RNA folding dynamics by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Methods. 2009; 49: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Movies were recorded for ∼10 min in five different areas of the reaction channel. Long binding (from 25 s to 10 min), single molecule FRET time trajectories were analyzed using a hidden Markov model, as described (22McKinney S.A. Joo C. Ha T. Analysis of single-molecule FRET trajectories using hidden Markov modeling.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1941-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Transitions were divided into 10 virtual macrocanonical states separated by 0.1 FRET units, which do not correspond to specific conformational states, but rather to an ensemble of states with the protein located at a certain distance from the 5′-end. FRET trajectories were compiled into transition density plots (TDPs) showing the number of transitions observed between a given initial and final FRET value. All initial binding events originate from zero FRET and are located on the y axis. The excursion distance is calculated using the initial binding FRET value (∼0.2) and Förster's equation EFRET = 1/[1+(R/R0)6], where R is the observed distance and R0 is the Förster distance corresponding to 50% energy transfer (55 Å for Cy3, Cy5, assuming κ2 = 2/3). Final FRET values in the TDP upper diagonal represent the location of the protein after each transition, which is converted into a distance using Förster's equation. The TDP provides the fraction of transitions at this distance. The fraction of transitions is plotted as a function of the distance to the initial binding site to estimate the distance scanned by the protein, which decays exponentially, indicating random excursions. Because we are calculating differences in distances, the κ2 = 2/3 approximation only minimally affects our results. To synchronize the long binding events with respect to their initial bindings, we analyzed the long binding FRET trajectories from 10 s before the initial binding (threshold 0.15 FRET) until 10 s after the dissociation (0 FRET). Using a MATLAB script kindly provided by Jody Puglisy (Stanford University), we binned the trajectories (0.05 FRET bins, 3-s time bins) to determine how many trajectories are located at a given FRET and time value and then generate the histograms. DNA substrates were surface-immobilized as described above using deamination buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl). Cy5-labeled Pfu exo− (50 nm) and unlabeled Apo3G (1 nm) were introduced on to the surface-immobilized substrate DNA immediately followed by data acquisition with 1-s time resolution (21Zhao R. Rueda D. RNA folding dynamics by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Methods. 2009; 49: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for the first 10 min. For each substrate tested, we analyzed 100–200 single molecule trajectories (N), and for each substrate, we found the number of DNA molecules (n) showing any specific Cy5-labeled Pfu exo− binding (ton ≥ 1 s), and the bound percentage was calculated as n/N × 100%. A small background (∼10%) of nonspecific binding (measured in the absence of Apo3G) was subtracted for each substrate. To study the Apo3G-induced ssDNA conformational dynamics, we immobilized ssDNAs with 3′-Cy5- to the 5′-Cy3-labeled anchor DNA as described above. Data acquisition from five different areas of the reaction channel was done in the absence and presence of Apo3G (1 nm) with 1-s time resolution (21Zhao R. Rueda D. RNA folding dynamics by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Methods. 2009; 49: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for 10 min each. The smFRET histograms were obtained by time-binning <100 time trajectories and fit to a Gaussian distribution, y = A exp [−(FRET − FRET0)2/2σ2] using Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Apo3G was incubated with phage M13mp2 circular DNA containing a series of in-frame 5′-aaaCCCaaa hot motifs embedded in lacZα reporter sequence located within a single-stranded gapped region of M13 dsDNA (Fig. 1 1These authors contributed equally to this work.A). Following transfection of the DNA in Ung− Escherichia coli, Apo3G-catalyzed deaminations are identified as C → T mutations in DNA isolated and sequenced from individual mutant phage clones (23Pham P.

The mutations occur as singletons and in clusters containing 2–5 consecutively deaminated motifs, with deaminations observed predominantly at C in 5′-aaaCCCaaa (Fig. 1B). The data suggest that a single Apo3G molecule scans ssDNA processively, deaminating C → U haphazardly, reminiscent of the processive stochastic deamination patterns observed for activation-induced deoxycytidine deaminase (23Pham P.

The smFRET trajectories (Fig. 2B) show Apo3G binding and scanning motion as changes in apparent FRET efficiency, binding as an abrupt increase from zero, and dissociation as a sharp decrease to zero. Motions toward 5′ and 3′ directions are observed as increases and decreases in FRET, respectively. Representative traces, including anticorrelated FRET trajectories, are presented as supplemental material (supplemental Fig. S1). The FRET trajectories reveal two populations, consistent with bulk experiments (16Chelico L. Sacho E.J. Erie D.A. Goodman M.F.

About half show short Apo3G binding, <25 s (FRET ∼0.2), with apparent binding and dissociation pseudo-first order rate constants kon = 0.01 ± 0.01 s−1 and koff = 0.23 ± 0.04 s−1, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2). Long binding trajectories (≥25 s) exhibit more complex dynamics indicating rapid scanning (Fig. 2B, Scanning trajectories). The FRET efficiencies oscillate rapidly between ∼0.2 and 0.8 for up to 10 min, with an average bound time of 110 s (Fig. 2B, Scanning trajectories; supplemental Fig. S3; supplemental Table S2). Because specific FRET states could not be identified, a hidden Markov Model (HMM) (22McKinney S.A. Joo C. Ha T. Analysis of single-molecule FRET trajectories using hidden Markov modeling.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1941-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was used to determine FRET densities corresponding to the locations of Apo3G relative to the 5′-end. Thus, each “FRET state” corresponds to an ensemble of configurations characterized by the distance between the protein and the 5′-end. The HMM is used to generate a TDP showing the number of transitions observed between initial and final FRET states (Fig. 2B, TDP). All initial binding events stem from zero FRET on the y axis, with most occurring at ∼0.2 FRET, indicating that Apo3G binds preferentially away from the tethered 5′-end, confirmed by switching the tethered DNA to the 3′-end, in which case favored binding still occurs near the free end (i.e. 5′-end) (supplemental Fig. S4). Movements toward the 5′- and 3′-ends appear as peaks above and below the diagonal, respectively. The transitions are symmetric in both directions (Fig. 2B, TDP), indicating that Apo3G scans ssDNA without directional preference. Analysis of the dwell times between FRET states shows that scanning transitions occur with similar rate constants ∼1 s−1, measured at 33 frames/s (supplemental Fig. S5; supplemental Table S3). An estimate of scanning distance in either direction is obtained using the number of transitions in the TDP and Förster's equation. The number of transitions decays exponentially from the initial binding site, consistent with random excursions (Fig. 2B, Scanning lengths) with a half-distance l = 12 Å (∼9 nt) (26Lamichhane R. Daubner G.M. Thomas-Crusells J. Auweter S.D. Manatschal C. Austin K.S. Valniuk O. Allain F.H. Rueda D.

To eliminate data blurring from asynchronous binding, long binding trajectories were post-synchronized by alignment at the initial binding event (27Blanchard S.C. Gonzalez R.L. Kim H.D. Chu S. Puglisi J.D. tRNA selection and kinetic proofreading in translation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The post-synchronization histogram (PSH) shows an initial FRET increase to ∼0.2 (Fig. 2B, PSH), consistent with the initial binding observed in the TDP. The FRET ratio increases to ∼0.4 followed by oscillations between 0.2 and 0.7. Therefore, Apo3G moves in a bidirectional random manner yet hovers in the vicinity of the 5′ hot motif, as shown by trajectories that remain synchronized up to 150 s (Fig. 2B, PSH). Moving the hot motif closer to the 3′-end shows that scanning is strongly influenced by motif location, where Apo3G goes to high FRET values (>0.4) less often for the 3′ hot motif (Fig. 2C). The number of transitions from the initial binding site decays exponentially with a half-distance l = 7 Å (∼5-nt excursions) (Fig. 2C, Scanning lengths), about half when compared with the 5′ hot motif. The post-synchronization histogram for the 3′ hot trajectories confirms initial binding at ∼0.2 FRET followed by osc"
https://openalex.org/W1981899788,"Selenoproteins serve important functions in many organisms, usually providing essential oxidoreductase enzymatic activity, often for defense against toxic xenobiotic substances. Most eukaryotic genomes possess a small number of these proteins, usually not more than 20. Selenoproteins belong to various structural classes, often related to oxidoreductase function, yet a few of them are completely uncharacterised. Here, the structural and functional prediction for the uncharacterised selenoprotein O (SELO) is presented. Using bioinformatics tools, we predict that SELO protein adopts a three-dimensional fold similar to protein kinases. Furthermore, we argue that despite the lack of conservation of the “classic” catalytic aspartate residue of the archetypical His-Arg-Asp motif, SELO kinases might have retained catalytic phosphotransferase activity, albeit with an atypical active site. Lastly, the role of the selenocysteine residue is considered and the possibility of an oxidoreductase-regulated kinase function for SELO is discussed. The novel kinase prediction is discussed in the context of functional data on SELO orthologues in model organisms, FMP40 a.k.a.YPL222W (yeast), and ydiU (bacteria). Expression data from bacteria and yeast suggest a role in oxidative stress response. Analysis of genomic neighbourhoods of SELO homologues in the three domains of life points toward a role in regulation of ABC transport, in oxidative stress response, or in basic metabolism regulation. Among bacteria possessing SELO homologues, there is a significant over-representation of aquatic organisms, also of aerobic ones. The selenocysteine residue in SELO proteins occurs only in few members of this protein family, including proteins from Metazoa, and few small eukaryotes (Ostreococcus, stramenopiles). It is also demonstrated that enterobacterial mchC proteins involved in maturation of bactericidal antibiotics, microcins, form a distant subfamily of the SELO proteins. The new protein structural domain, with a putative kinase function assigned, expands the known kinome and deserves experimental determination of its biological role within the cell-signaling network."
https://openalex.org/W1981938184,"Apigenin, a dietary flavonoid, is reported to have several therapeutic effects in different diseases including cancer. Toxicity of Apigenin is however, least explored, and reports are scanty in literature. This warrants dose-specific evaluation of toxicity in vivo. In the present study, Apigenin was administered intraperitoneally to Swiss mice at doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg. Serum levels of alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured along with the examination of liver histology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in blood, lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione level, superoxide dismutase activity, catalase activity, glutathione S-transferase activity and gene expression in liver tissue. Increase in ALT, AST, ALP, ROS, ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) and LPO, altered enzyme activities along with damaged histoarchitecture in the liver of 100 or 200 mg/kg Apigenin treated animals were found. Microarray analysis revealed the differential expression of genes that correspond to different biologically relevant pathways including oxidative stress and apoptosis. In conclusion, these results suggested the oxidative stress induced liver damage which may be due to the regulation of multiple genes by Apigenin at higher doses in Swiss mice."
https://openalex.org/W1967899825,"Increases in cellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) concentration with age have been observed repeatedly in mammalian tissues. Concomitant increases in the proportion of replicatively senescent cells in ageing mammalian tissues have also been observed. Populations of mitotic human fibroblasts cultured in vitro, undergoing transition from proliferation competence to replicative senescence are useful models of ageing human tissues. Similar exponential increases in ROS with age have been observed in this model system. Tracking individual cells in dividing populations is difficult, and so the vast majority of observations have been cross-sectional, at the population level, rather than longitudinal observations of individual cells. One possible explanation for these observations is an exponential increase in ROS in individual fibroblasts with time (e.g. resulting from a vicious cycle between cellular ROS and damage). However, we demonstrate an alternative, simple hypothesis, equally consistent with these observations which does not depend on any gradual increase in ROS concentration: the Stochastic Step Model of Replicative Senescence (SSMRS). We also demonstrate that, consistent with the SSMRS, neither proliferation-competent human fibroblasts of any age, nor populations of hTERT overexpressing human fibroblasts passaged beyond the Hayflick limit, display high ROS concentrations. We conclude that longitudinal studies of single cells and their lineages are now required for testing hypotheses about roles and mechanisms of ROS increase during replicative senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1972221564,"LTR retrotransposons are often the most abundant components of plant genomes and can impact gene and genome evolution. Most reported LTR retrotransposons are large elements (>4 kb) and are most often found in heterochromatic (gene poor) regions. We report the smallest LTR retrotransposon found to date, only 292 bp. The element is found in rice, maize, sorghum and other grass genomes, which indicates that it was present in the ancestor of grass species, at least 50-80 MYA. Estimated insertion times, comparisons between sequenced rice lines, and mRNA data indicate that this element may still be active in some genomes. Unlike other LTR retrotransposons, the small LTR retrotransposons (SMARTs) are distributed throughout the genomes and are often located within or near genes with insertion patterns similar to MITEs (miniature inverted repeat transposable elements). Our data suggests that insertions of SMARTs into or near genes can, in a few instances, alter both gene structures and gene expression. Further evidence for a role in regulating gene expression, SMART-specific small RNAs (sRNAs) were identified that may be involved in gene regulation. Thus, SMARTs may have played an important role in genome evolution and genic innovation and may provide a valuable tool for gene tagging systems in grass."
https://openalex.org/W1993659680,"Background Cancer vaccines are designed to activate and enhance cancer-antigen-targeted T cells that are suppressed through multiple mechanisms of immune tolerance in cancer-bearing hosts. T regulatory cell (Treg) suppression of tumor-specific T cells is one barrier to effective immunization. A second mechanism is the deletion of high avidity tumor-specific T cells, which leaves a less effective low avidity tumor specific T cell repertoire available for activation by vaccines. Treg depleting agents including low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) and antibodies that deplete CD25-expressing Tregs have been used with limited success to enhance the potency of tumor-specific vaccines. In addition, few studies have evaluated mechanisms that activate low avidity cancer antigen-specific T cells. Therefore, we developed high and low avidity HER-2/neu-specific TCR transgenic mouse colonies specific for the same HER-2/neu epitope to define the tolerance mechanisms that specifically affect high versus low avidity tumor-specific T cells. Methodology/Principal Findings High and low avidity CD8+ T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice specific for the breast cancer antigen HER-2/neu (neu) were developed to provide a purified source of naïve, tumor-specific T cells that can be used to study tolerance mechanisms. Adoptive transfer studies into tolerant FVB/N-derived HER-2/neu transgenic (neu-N) mice demonstrated that high avidity, but not low avidity, neu-specific T cells are inhibited by Tregs as the dominant tolerizing mechanism. High avidity T cells persisted, produced IFNγ, trafficked into tumors, and lysed tumors after adoptive transfer into mice treated with a neu-specific vaccine and low dose Cy to deplete Tregs. Analysis of Treg subsets revealed a Cy-sensitive CD4+Foxp3+CD25low tumor-seeking migratory phenotype, characteristic of effector/memory Tregs, and capable of high avidity T cell suppression. Conclusion/Significance Depletion of CD25low Tregs allows activation of tumor-clearing high avidity T cells. Thus, the development of agents that specifically deplete Treg subsets should translate into more effective immunotherapies while avoiding autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2010959561,"Background The longer growing season under climate warming has served as a crucial mechanism for the enhancement of terrestrial carbon (C) sink over the past decades. A better understanding of this mechanism is critical for projection of changes in C cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings A 4-year field experiment with day and night warming was conducted to examine the responses of plant phenology and their influences on plant coverage and ecosystem C cycling in a temperate steppe in northern China. Greater phenological responses were observed under night than day warming. Both day and night warming prolonged the growing season by advancing phenology of early-blooming species but without changing that of late-blooming species. However, no warming response of vegetation coverage was found for any of the eight species. The variances in species-level coverage and ecosystem C fluxes under different treatments were positively dependent upon the accumulated precipitation within phenological duration but not the length of phenological duration. Conclusions/Significance These plants' phenology is more sensitive to night than day warming, and the warming effects on ecosystem C exchange via shifting plant phenology could be mediated by precipitation patterns in semi-arid grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2052924105,"Larval zebrafish innately perform a suite of behaviors that are tightly linked to their evolutionary past, notably escape from threatening stimuli and pursuit and capture of prey. These behaviors have been carefully examined in the past, but mostly with regard to the movements of the trunk and tail of the larvae. Here, we employ kinematics analyses to describe the movements of the pectoral fins during escape and predatory behavior. In accord with previous studies, we find roles for the pectoral fins in slow swimming and immediately after striking prey. We find novel roles for the pectoral fins in long-latency, but not in short-latency C-bends. We also observe fin movements that occur during orienting J-turns and S-starts that drive high-velocity predatory strikes. Finally, we find that the use of pectoral fins following a predatory strike is scaled to the velocity of the strike, supporting a role for the fins in braking. The implications of these results for central control of coordinated movements are discussed, and we hope that these results will provide baselines for future analyses of cross-body coordination using mutants, morphants, and transgenic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W1994458055,"Since the report of a paralogous acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC3.1.1.7) gene in the greenbug (Schizaphis graminum) in 2002, two different AChE genes (Ace1 and Ace2) have been identified in each of at least 27 insect species. However, the gene models of Ace1 and Ace2, and their molecular properties have not yet been comprehensively analyzed in any insect species. In this study, we sequenced the full-length cDNAs, computationally predicted the corresponding three-dimensional protein models, and profiled developmental stage and tissue-specific expression patterns of two Ace genes from the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum; TcAce1 and TcAce2), a globally distributed major pest of stored grain products and an emerging model organism. TcAce1 and TcAce2 encode 648 and 604 amino acid residues, respectively, and have conserved motifs including a choline-binding site, a catalytic triad, and an acyl pocket. Phylogenetic analysis show that both TcAce genes are grouped into two insect Ace clusters and TcAce1 is completely diverged from TcAce2, suggesting that these two genes evolve from their corresponding Ace gene lineages in insect species. In addition, TcAce1 is located on chromosome 5, whereas TcAce2 is located on chromosome 2. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR analyses indicate that both genes are virtually transcribed in all the developmental stages and predominately expressed in the insect brain. Our computational analyses suggest that the TcAce1 protein is a robust acetylcholine (ACh) hydrolase and has susceptibility to sulfhydryl agents whereas the TcAce2 protein is not a catalytically efficient ACh hydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W2030190302,"We analyzed the effects of dopamine signaling on the temporal organization of rest and activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Locomotor behaviors were recorded using a video-monitoring system, and the amounts of movements were quantified by using an image processing program. We, first, confirmed that rest bout durations followed long-tailed (i.e., power-law) distributions, whereas activity bout durations did not with a strict method described by Clauset et al. We also studied the effects of circadian rhythm and ambient temperature on rest bouts and activity bouts. The fraction of activity significantly increased during subjective day and at high temperature, but the power-law exponent of the rest bout distribution was not affected. The reduction in rest was realized by reduction in long rest bouts. The distribution of activity bouts did not change drastically under the above mentioned conditions. We then assessed the effects of dopamine. The distribution of rest bouts became less long-tailed and the time spent in activity significantly increased after the augmentation of dopamine signaling. Administration of a dopamine biosynthesis inhibitor yielded the opposite effects. However, the distribution of activity bouts did not contribute to the changes. These results suggest that the modulation of locomotor behavior by dopamine is predominantly controlled by changing the duration of rest bouts, rather than the duration of activity bouts."
https://openalex.org/W2038884068,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is an important component of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway. Depending on the cell type and conditions, RIPK1 mediates MAPK and NF-κB activation as well as cell death. Using a mutant form of RIPK1 (RIPK1ΔID) lacking the intermediate domain (ID), we confirm the requirement of this domain for activation of these signaling events. Moreover, expression of RIPK1ΔID resulted in enhanced recruitment of caspase-8 to the TNFR1 complex II component Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which allowed a shift from TNF-induced necroptosis to apoptosis in L929 cells. Addition of the RIPK1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1 strongly reduced recruitment of RIPK1 and caspase-8 to FADD and subsequent apoptosis, indicating a role for RIPK1 kinase activity in apoptotic complex formation. Our study shows that RIPK1 has an anti-apoptotic function residing in its ID and demonstrates a cellular system as an elegant genetic model for RIPK1 kinase-dependent apoptosis that, in contrast to the Smac mimetic model, does not rely on depletion of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 and 2 (cIAP1/2)."
https://openalex.org/W2051229799,"Promiscuity, the basis for the evolution of new functions through ‘tinkering’ of residues in the vicinity of the catalytic site, is yet to be quantitatively defined. We present a computational method Promiscuity Indices Estimator (PROMISE) - based on signatures derived from the spatial and electrostatic properties of the catalytic residues, to estimate the promiscuity (PromIndex) of proteins with known active site residues and 3D structure. PromIndex reflects the number of different active site signatures that have congruent matches in close proximity of its native catalytic site, the quality of the matches and difference in the enzymatic activity. Promiscuity in proteins is observed to follow a lognormal distribution (μ = 0.28, σ = 1.1 reduced chi-square = 3.0E-5). The PROMISE predicted promiscuous functions in any protein can serve as the starting point for directed evolution experiments. PROMISE ranks carboxypeptidase A and ribonuclease A amongst the more promiscuous proteins. We have also investigated the properties of the residues in the vicinity of the catalytic site that regulates its promiscuity. Linear regression establishes a weak correlation (R2∼0.1) between certain properties of the residues (charge, polar, etc) in the neighborhood of the catalytic residues and PromIndex. A stronger relationship states that most proteins with high promiscuity have high percentages of charged and polar residues within a radius of 3 Å of the catalytic site, which is validated using one-tailed hypothesis tests (P-values∼0.05). Since it is known that these characteristics are key factors in catalysis, their relationship with the promiscuity index cross validates the methodology of PROMISE."
https://openalex.org/W2081504343,"Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a constituent of edible cruciferous vegetables, decreases viability of cancer cells by causing apoptosis but the mechanism of cell death is not fully understood. The present study was undertaken to determine the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in BITC-induced apoptosis using MDA-MB-231 (breast), MCF-7 (breast), and HCT-116 (colon) human cancer cells. The B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) protein was dispensable for proapoptotic response to BITC in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells as judged by RNA interference studies. Instead, the BITC-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited upregulation of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) protein. The BITC-mediated induction of PUMA was relatively more pronounced in MCF-7 cells due to the presence of wild-type p53 compared with MDA-MB-231 with mutant p53. The BITC-induced apoptosis was partially but significantly attenuated by RNA interference of PUMA in MCF-7 cells. The PUMA knockout variant of HCT-116 cells exhibited significant resistance towards BITC-induced apoptosis compared with wild-type HCT-116 cells. Attenuation of BITC-induced apoptosis in PUMA knockout HCT-116 cells was accompanied by enhanced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest due to induction of p21 and down regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 protein. The BITC treatment caused a decrease in protein levels of Bcl-xL (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells) and Bcl-2 (MCF-7 cells). Ectopic expression of Bcl-xL in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and that of Bcl-2 in MCF-7 cells conferred protection against proapoptotic response to BITC. Interestingly, the BITC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited induction of Bcl-2 protein expression, and RNA interference of Bcl-2 in this cell line resulted in augmentation of BITC-induced apoptosis. The BITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth in vivo was associated with the induction of PUMA protein in the tumor. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that Bim-independent apoptosis by BITC in cancer cells is mediated by PUMA."
https://openalex.org/W2011020699,"The RSC chromatin remodeling complex has been implicated in contributing to DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in a number of studies. Both survival and levels of H2A phosphorylation in response to damage are reduced in the absence of RSC. Importantly, there is evidence for two isoforms of this complex, defined by the presence of either Rsc1 or Rsc2. Here, we investigated whether the two isoforms of RSC provide distinct contributions to DNA damage responses. First, we established that the two isoforms of RSC differ in the presence of Rsc1 or Rsc2 but otherwise have the same subunit composition. We found that both rsc1 and rsc2 mutant strains have intact DNA damage-induced checkpoint activity and transcriptional induction. In addition, both strains show reduced non-homologous end joining activity and have a similar spectrum of DSB repair junctions, suggesting perhaps that the two complexes provide the same functions. However, the hypersensitivity of a rsc1 strain cannot be complemented with an extra copy of RSC2, and likewise, the hypersensitivity of the rsc2 strain remains unchanged when an additional copy of RSC1 is present, indicating that the two proteins are unable to functionally compensate for one another in DNA damage responses. Rsc1, but not Rsc2, is required for nucleosome sliding flanking a DNA DSB. Interestingly, while swapping the domains from Rsc1 into the Rsc2 protein does not compromise hypersensitivity to DNA damage suggesting they are functionally interchangeable, the BAH domain from Rsc1 confers upon Rsc2 the ability to remodel chromatin at a DNA break. These data demonstrate that, despite the similarity between Rsc1 and Rsc2, the two different isoforms of RSC provide distinct functions in DNA damage responses, and that at least part of the functional specificity is dictated by the BAH domains."
https://openalex.org/W2088687387,"Several trap plasmids (enabling positive selection of transposition events) were used to identify a pool of functional transposable elements (TEs) residing in bacteria of the genus Paracoccus (Alphaproteobacteria). Complex analysis of 25 strains representing 20 species of this genus led to the capture and characterization of (i) 37 insertion sequences (ISs) representing 9 IS families (IS3, IS5, IS6, IS21, IS66, IS256, IS1182, IS1380 and IS1634), (ii) a composite transposon Tn6097 generated by two copies of the ISPfe2 (IS1634 family) containing two predicted genetic modules, involved in the arginine deiminase pathway and daunorubicin/doxorubicin resistance, (iii) 3 non-composite transposons of the Tn3 family, including Tn5393 carrying streptomycin resistance and (iv) a transposable genomic island TnPpa1 (45 kb). Some of the elements (e.g. Tn5393, Tn6097 and ISs of the IS903 group of the IS5 family) were shown to contain strong promoters able to drive transcription of genes placed downstream of the target site of transposition. Through the application of trap plasmid pCM132TC, containing a promoterless tetracycline resistance reporter gene, we identified five ways in which transposition can supply promoters to transcriptionally silent genes. Besides highlighting the diversity and specific features of several TEs, the analyses performed in this study have provided novel and interesting information on (i) the dynamics of the process of transposition (e.g. the unusually high frequency of transposition of TnPpa1) and (ii) structural changes in DNA mediated by transposition (e.g. the generation of large deletions in the recipient molecule upon transposition of ISPve1 of the IS21 family). We also demonstrated the great potential of TEs and transposition in the generation of diverse phenotypes as well as in the natural amplification and dissemination of genetic information (of adaptative value) by horizontal gene transfer, which is considered the driving force of bacterial evolution."

The most severe course of ALD progression is the cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating form of the disease, cALD. To date there is very little information on the cytokine mediators in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of these boys.Measurement of 23 different cytokines was performed on CSF and serum of boys with cerebral ALD and patients without ALD. Significant elevations in CSF IL-8 (29.3±2.2 vs 12.8±1.1 pg/ml, p = 0.0001), IL-1ra (166±30 vs 8.6±6.5 pg/ml, p = 0.005), MCP-1 (610±47 vs 328±34 pg/ml, p = 0.002), and MIP-1b (14.2±1.3 vs 2.0±1.4 pg/ml, p<0.0001) were found in boys with cALD versus the control group. The only serum cytokine showing an elevation in the ALD group was SDF-1 (2124±155 vs 1175±125 pg/ml, p = 0.0001). The CSF cytokines of IL-8 and MCP-1b correlated with the Loes MRI severity score (p = 0.04 and p = 0.008 respectively), as well as the serum SDF-1 level (p = 0.002). Finally, CSF total protein was also significantly elevated in boys with cALD and correlated with both IL-8, MCP-1b (p = 0.0001 for both), as well as Loes MRI severity score (p = 0.0007).IL-8, IL-1ra, MCP-1, MIP-1b and CSF total protein were significantly elevated in patients with cALD; IL-8, MCP-1b, and CSF total protein levels correlated with disease severity determined by MRI. This is the largest report of CSF cytokine levels in cALD to date, and identification of these key cytokines will provide further insight into disease progression and perhaps lead to improved targeted therapies."

The present study was designed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying adiponectin-induced UCP2 expression.Mice were treated with adiponectin and/or different drug inhibitors. Parenchymal (PCs) and nonparenchymal (NPCs) cells were fractionated from the liver tissues for mitochondria isolation, Western blotting and quantitative PCR analysis. Mitochondrial superoxide production was monitored by MitoSOX staining and flow cytometry analysis. Compared to control mice, the expression of UCP2 was significantly lower in NPCs, but not PCs of adiponectin knockout mice (AKO). Both chronic and acute treatment with adiponectin selectively increased the mRNA and protein abundance of UCP2 in NPCs, especially in the enriched endothelial cell fractions. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D could not block adiponectin-induced UCP2 expression, whereas the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited the elevation of UCP2 protein but not its mRNA levels. Mitochondrial content of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a nucleic acid binding protein involved in regulating mRNA transportation and stabilization, was significantly enhanced by adiponectin, which also evoked a transient elevation of mitochondrial superoxide. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, abolished adiponectin-induced superoxide production, hnRNP K recruitment and UCP2 expression.Mitochondrial superoxide production stimulated by adiponectin serves as a trigger to initiate the translocation of hnRNP K, which in turn promotes UCP2 expressions in liver."
https://openalex.org/W2016813359,"The postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) contains proliferating neural progenitor cells in close proximity to blood vessels. Insults and drug treatments acutely stimulate cell proliferation in the SVZ, which was assessed by labeling cells entering S phase. Although G1-to-S progression is metabolically demanding on a minute-to-hour time scale, it remains unknown whether increased SVZ cell proliferation is accompanied by a local hemodynamic response. This neurovascular coupling provides energy substrates to active neuronal assemblies. Transcardial dye perfusion revealed the presence of capillaries throughout the SVZ that constrict upon applications of the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U-46119 in acute brain slice preparations. We then monitored in vivo blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetry via a microprobe located either in the SVZ or a mature network. U-46119 injections into the lateral ventricle decreased blood flow in the SVZ and the striatum, which are near the ventricle. A 1-hour ventricular injection of epidermal and basic fibroblast growth factor (EGF and bFGF) significantly increased the percentage of Sox2 transcription factor-positive cells in S phase 1.5 hours post-injection. This increase was accompanied by a sustained rise in blood flow in the SVZ but not in the striatum. Direct growth factor injections into the cortex did not alter local blood flow, ruling out direct effects on capillaries. These findings suggest that an acute increase in the number of G1-to-S cycling SVZ cells is accompanied by neurometabolic-vascular coupling, which may provide energy and nutrient for cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2011496855,"Background The octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) was originally described as a marker of embryonic stem cells. Recently, the role of Oct4 as a key regulator in pluripotency was shown by its ability to reprogram somatic cells in vitro, either alone or in concert with other factors. While artificial induction of pluripotency using transcription factors is possible in mammalian cell culture, it remains unknown whether a potential natural transfer mechanism might be of functional relevance in vivo. The stem cell based regeneration of deer antlers is a unique model for rapid and complete tissue regeneration in mammals and therefore most suitable to study such mechanisms. Here, the transfer of pluripotency factors from resident stem cell niche cells to differentiated cells could recruit more stem cells and start rapid tissue regeneration. Methodology/Principal Findings We report on the ability of STRO-1+ deer antlerogenic mesenchymal stem cells (DaMSCs) to transport Oct4 via direct cell-to-cell connections. Upon cultivation in stem cell expansion medium, we observed nuclear Oct4 expression in nearly all cells. A number of these cells exhibit Oct4 expression not only in the nucleus, but also with perinuclear localisation and within far-ranging intercellular connections. Furthermore, many cells showed intercellular connections containing both F-actin and α-tubulin and through which transport could be observed. To proof that intercellular Oct4-transfer has functional consequences in recipient cells we used a co-culture approach with STRO-1+ DaMSCs and a murine embryonic fibroblast indicator cell line (Oct4-GFP MEF). In this cell line a reporter gene (GFP) under the control of an Oct4 responsive element is only expressed in the presence of Oct4. GFP expression in Oct4-GFP cells started after 24 hours of co-culture providing evidence of Oct4 transfer from STRO-1+ DaMSCs to Oct4-GFP MEF target cells. Conclusions Our findings indicate a possible mechanism for the expansion of a resident stem cell niche by induction of pluripotency in surrounding non-niche cells via transfer of transcription factors through intercellular connections. This provides a new approach to explain the rapid annual antler regrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2035273743,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and has become a global health threat. No HCV vaccine is currently available and treatment with antiviral therapy is associated with adverse side effects. Moreover, there is no preventive therapy for recurrent hepatitis C post liver transplantation. The NS3 serine protease is necessary for HCV replication and represents a prime target for developing anti HCV therapies. Recently we described a therapeutic approach for eradication of HCV infected cells that is based on protein delivery of two NS3 protease-activatable recombinant toxins we named ""zymoxins"". These toxins were inactivated by fusion to rationally designed inhibitory peptides via NS3-cleavable linkers. Once delivered to cells where NS3 protease is present, the inhibitory peptide is removed resulting in re-activation of cytotoxic activity. The zymoxins we described suffered from two limitations: they required high levels of protease for activation and had basal activities in the un-activated form that resulted in a narrow potential therapeutic window. Here, we present a solution that overcame the major limitations of the ""first generation zymoxins"" by converting MazF ribonuclease, the toxic component of the E. coli chromosomal MazEF toxin-antitoxin system, into an NS3-activated zymoxin that is introduced to cells by means of gene delivery. We constructed an expression cassette that encodes for a single polypeptide that incorporates both the toxin and a fragment of its potent natural antidote, MazE, linked via an NS3-cleavable linker. While covalently paired to its inhibitor, the ribonuclease is well tolerated when expressed in naïve, healthy cells. In contrast, activating proteolysis that is induced by even low levels of NS3, results in an eradication of NS3 expressing model cells and HCV infected cells. Zymoxins may thus become a valuable tool in eradicating cells infected by intracellular pathogens that express intracellular proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2084988171,"Background The cold shock domain (CSD) containing proteins (CSDPs) are one group of the evolutionarily conserved nucleic acid-binding proteins widely distributed in bacteria, plants, animals, and involved in various cellular processes, including adaptation to low temperature, cellular growth, nutrient stress and stationary phase. Methodology The cDNA of a novel CSDP was cloned from Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri (designated as CfCSP) by expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach. The full length cDNA of CfCSP was of 1735 bp containing a 927 bp open reading frame which encoded an N-terminal CSD with conserved nucleic acids binding motif and a C-terminal domain with four Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats. The CSD of CfCSP shared high homology with the CSDs from other CSDPs in vertebrate, invertebrate and bacteria. The mRNA transcripts of CfCSP were mainly detected in the tissue of adductor and also marginally detectable in gill, hepatopancreas, hemocytes, kidney, mantle and gonad of healthy scallop. The relative expression level of CfCSP was up-regulated significantly in adductor and hemocytes at 1 h and 24 h respectively after low temperature treatment (P<0.05). The recombinant CfCSP protein (rCfCSP) could bind ssDNA and in vitro transcribed mRNA, but it could not bind dsDNA. BX04, a cold sensitive Escherichia coli CSP quadruple-deletion mutant, was used to examine the cold adaptation ability of CfCSP. After incubation at 17°C for 120 h, the strain of BX04 containing the vector pINIII showed growth defect and failed to form colonies, while strain containing pINIII-CSPA or pINIII-CfCSP grew vigorously, indicating that CfCSP shared a similar function with E. coli CSPs for the cold adaptation. Conclusions These results suggest that CfCSP is a novel eukaryotic cold-regulated nucleic acid-binding protein and may function as an RNA chaperone in vivo during the cold adaptation process."
https://openalex.org/W2040330310,"Background H-1 parvovirus (H-1 PV), a rodent autonomous oncolytic parvovirus, has emerged as a novel class of promising anticancer agents, because of its ability to selectively find and destroy malignant cells. However, to probe H-1 PV multimodal antitumor potential one of the major prerequisites is to decipher H-1 PV direct interplay with human immune system, and so prevent any risk of impairment. Methodology/Principal findings Non activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are not sensitive to H-1 PV cytotoxic effect. However, the virus impairs both activated PBMC proliferation ability and viability. This effect is related to H-1 PV infection as evidenced by Western blotting detection of H-1 PV main protein NS1. However, TCID50 experiments did not allow newly generated virions to be detected. Moreover, flow cytometry has shown that H-1 PV preferentially targets B lymphocytes. Despite seeming harmful at first sight, H-1 PV seems to affect very few NK cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes and, above all, clearly does not affect human neutrophils and one of the major CD4+ T lymphocyte subpopulation. Very interestingly, flow cytometry analysis and ELISA assays proved that it even activates human CD4+ T cells by increasing activation marker expression (CD69 and CD30) and both effective Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion (IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-4). In addition, H-1 PV action does not come with any sign of immunosuppressive side effect. Finally, we have shown the efficiency of H-1 PV on xenotransplanted human nasopharyngeal carcinoma, in a SCID mouse model reconstituted with human PBMC. Conclusions/Significance Our results show for the first time that a wild-type oncolytic virus impairs some immune cell subpopulations while directly activating a Helper CD4+ T cell response. Thus, our data open numerous gripping perspectives of investigation and strongly argue for the use of H-1 PV as an anticancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2077916488,"Geobacter species play an important role in the natural biogeochemical cycles of aquatic sediments and subsurface environments as well as in subsurface bioremediation by oxidizing organic compounds with the reduction of insoluble Fe(III) oxides. Flagellum-based motility is considered to be critical for Geobacter species to locate fresh sources of Fe(III) oxides. Functional and comparative genomic approaches, coupled with genetic and biochemical methods, identified key regulators for flagellar gene expression in Geobacter species. A master transcriptional regulator, designated FgrM, is a member of the enhancer-binding protein family. The fgrM gene in the most studied strain of Geobacter species, Geobacter sulfurreducens strain DL-1, is truncated by a transposase gene, preventing flagellar biosynthesis. Integrating a functional FgrM homolog restored flagellar biosynthesis and motility in G. sulfurreducens DL-1 and enhanced the ability to reduce insoluble Fe(III) oxide. Interrupting the fgrM gene in G. sulfurreducens strain KN400, which is motile, removed the capacity for flagellar production and inhibited Fe(III) oxide reduction. FgrM, which is also a response regulator of the two-component His-Asp phosphorelay system, was phosphorylated by histidine kinase GHK4, which was essential for flagellar production and motility. GHK4, which is a hybrid kinase with a receiver domain at the N terminus, was phosphorylated by another histidine kinase, GHK3. Therefore, the multicomponent His-Asp phosphorelay system appears to control flagellar gene expression in Geobacter species."
https://openalex.org/W1993693761,"Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from mesenchymal tissues can propagate in vitro to some extent and differentiate into various tissue lineages to be used for cell-based therapies. Cellular senescence, which occurs readily in continual MSC culture, leads to loss of these characteristic properties, representing one of the major limitations to achieving the potential of MSCs. In this study, we investigated the effect of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a ubiquitous metabolite in membrane phospholipid synthesis, on the senescence program of human MSCs. We show that MSCs preferentially express the LPA receptor subtype 1, and an abrogation of the receptor engagement with the antagonistic compound Ki16425 attenuates senescence induction in continually propagated human MSCs. This anti-aging effect of Ki16425 results in extended rounds of cellular proliferation, increased clonogenic potential, and retained plasticity for osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Expressions of p16Ink4a, Rb, p53, and p21Cip1, which have been associated with cellular senescence, were all reduced in human MSCs by the pharmacological inhibition of LPA signaling. Disruption of this signaling pathway was accompanied by morphological changes such as cell thinning and elongation as well as actin filament deformation through decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Prevention of LPA receptor engagement also promoted ubiquitination-mediated c-Myc elimination in MSCs, and consequently the entry into a quiescent state, G0 phase, of the cell cycle. Collectively, these results highlight the potential of pharmacological intervention against LPA signaling for blunting senescence-associated loss of function characteristic of human MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1976778095,"The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and a PCP-like pathway has recently been described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The developmental function of this pathway is to coordinate the orientation of cells or structures within the plane of an epithelium or to organize cell-cell intercalation required for correct morphogenesis. Here, we describe a novel role of VANG-1, the only C. elegans ortholog of the conserved PCP component Strabismus/Van Gogh. We show that two alleles of vang-1 and depletion of the protein by RNAi cause an increase of mean life span up to 40%. Consistent with the longevity phenotype vang-1 animals also show enhanced resistance to thermal- and oxidative stress and decreased lipofuscin accumulation. In addition, vang-1 mutants show defects like reduced brood size, decreased ovulation rate and prolonged reproductive span, which are also related to gerontogenes. The germline, but not the intestine or neurons, seems to be the primary site of vang-1 function. Life span extension in vang-1 mutants depends on the insulin/IGF-1-like receptor DAF-2 and DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. RNAi against the phase II detoxification transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 also reduced vang-1 life span that might be explained by gradual inhibition of insulin/IGF-1-like signaling in vang-1. This is the first time that a key player of the PCP pathway is shown to be involved in the insulin/IGF-1-like signaling dependent modulation of life span in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1980314413,"Background Glucocorticoid hormones play a major role in fetal organ maturation. Yet, excessive glucocorticoid exposure in utero can result in a variety of detrimental effects, such as growth retardation and increased susceptibility to the development of hypertension. To protect the fetus, maternal glucocorticoids are metabolized into inactive compounds by placental 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type2 (11βHSD2). This enzyme is also expressed in the kidney, where it prevents illicit occupation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by glucocorticoids. We investigated the role of renal 11βHSD2 in the control of neonatal glucocorticoid metabolism in the human and mouse. Methods Cortisol (F) and cortisone (E) concentrations were measured in maternal plasma, umbilical cord blood and human newborn urine using HPLC. 11βHSD2 activity was indirectly assessed by comparing the F/E ratio between maternal and neonatal plasma (placental activity) and between plasma and urine in newborns (renal activity). Direct measurement of renal 11βHSD2 activity was subsequently evaluated in mice at various developmental stages. Renal 11βHSD2 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry during the perinatal period in both species. Results We demonstrate that, at variance with placental 11βHSD2 activity, renal 11βHSD2 activity is weak in newborn human and mouse and correlates with low renal mRNA levels and absence of detectable 11βHSD2 protein. Conclusions We provide evidence for a weak or absent expression of neonatal renal 11βHSD2 that is conserved among species. This temporal and tissue-specific 11βHSD2 expression could represent a physiological window for glucocorticoid action yet may constitute an important predictive factor for adverse outcomes of glucocorticoid excess through fetal programming."
https://openalex.org/W2051767032,"Bile acids (BAs) regulate cardiovascular function via diverse mechanisms. Although in both health and disease serum glycine-conjugated BAs are more abundant than taurine-conjugated BAs, their effects on myogenic tone (MT), a key determinant of systemic vascular resistance (SVR), have not been examined.Fourth-order mesenteric arteries (170-250 µm) isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats were pressurized at 70 mmHg and allowed to develop spontaneous constriction, i.e., MT. Deoxycholylglycine (DCG; 0.1-100 µM), a glycine-conjugated major secondary BA, induced reversible, concentration-dependent reduction of MT that was similar in endothelium-intact and -denuded arteries. DCG reduced the myogenic response to stepwise increase in pressure (20 to 100 mmHg). Neither atropine nor the combination of L-NAME (a NOS inhibitor) plus indomethacin altered DCG-mediated reduction of MT. K(+) channel blockade with glibenclamide (K(ATP)), 4-aminopyradine (K(V)), BaCl(2) (K(IR)) or tetraethylammonium (TEA, K(Ca)) were also ineffective. In Fluo-2-loaded arteries, DCG markedly reduced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSM) Ca(2+) fluorescence (∼50%). In arteries incubated with DCG, physiological salt solution (PSS) with high Ca(2+) (4 mM) restored myogenic response. DCG reduced vascular tone and VSM cytoplasmic Ca(2+) responses (∼50%) of phenylephrine (PE)- and Ang II-treated arteries, but did not affect KCl-induced vasoconstriction.In rat mesenteric resistance arteries DCG reduces pressure- and agonist-induced vasoconstriction and VSM cytoplasmic Ca(2+) responses, independent of muscarinic receptor, NO or K(+) channel activation. We conclude that BAs alter vasomotor responses, an effect favoring reduced SVR. These findings are likely pertinent to vascular dysfunction in cirrhosis and other conditions associated with elevated serum BAs."
https://openalex.org/W2073561582,"The Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway is an important regulator of tissue growth that is frequently subverted in human cancer. The key oncoprotein of the SWH pathway is the transcriptional co-activator, Yes-associated protein (YAP). YAP promotes tissue growth and transformation of cultured cells by interacting with transcriptional regulatory proteins via its WW domains, or, in the case of the TEAD1-4 transcription factors, an N-terminal binding domain. YAP possesses a putative transactivation domain in its C-terminus that is necessary to stimulate transcription factors in vitro, but its requirement for YAP function has not been investigated in detail. Interestingly, whilst the WW domains and TEAD-binding domain are highly conserved in the Drosophila melanogaster YAP orthologue, Yorkie, the majority of the C-terminal region of YAP is not present in Yorkie. To investigate this apparent conundrum, we assessed the functional roles of the YAP and Yorkie C-termini. We found that these regions were not required for Yorkie's ability to drive tissue growth in vivo, or YAP's ability to promote anchorage-independent growth or resistance to contact inhibition. However, the YAP transactivation domain was required for YAP's ability to induce cell migration and invasion. Moreover, a role for the YAP transactivation domain in cell transformation was uncovered when the YAP WW domains were mutated together with the transactivation domain. This shows that YAP can promote cell transformation in a flexible manner, presumably by contacting transcriptional regulatory proteins either via its WW domains or its transactivation domain."
https://openalex.org/W2084745548,"Background We aimed to further understand the relationship between cAMP concentration and mnesic performance. Methods and Findings Rats were injected with milrinone (PDE3 inhibitor, 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor, 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) and/or the selective 5-HT4R agonist RS 67333 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) before testing in the object recognition paradigm. Cyclic AMP concentrations were measured in brain structures linked to episodic-like memory (i.e. hippocampus, prefrontal and perirhinal cortices) before or after either the sample or the testing phase. Except in the hippocampus of rolipram treated-rats, all treatment increased cAMP levels in each brain sub-region studied before the sample phase. After the sample phase, cAMP levels were significantly increased in hippocampus (1.8 fold), prefrontal (1.3 fold) and perirhinal (1.3 fold) cortices from controls rat while decreased in prefrontal cortex (∼0.83 to 0.62 fold) from drug-treated rats (except for milrinone+RS 67333 treatment). After the testing phase, cAMP concentrations were still increased in both the hippocampus (2.76 fold) and the perirhinal cortex (2.1 fold) from controls animals. Minor increase were reported in hippocampus and perirhinal cortex from both rolipram (respectively, 1.44 fold and 1.70 fold) and milrinone (respectively 1.46 fold and 1.56 fold)-treated rat. Following the paradigm, cAMP levels were significantly lower in the hippocampus, prefrontal and perirhinal cortices from drug-treated rat when compared to controls animals, however, only drug-treated rats spent longer time exploring the novel object during the testing phase (inter-phase interval of 4 h). Conclusions Our results strongly suggest that a “pre-sample” early increase in cAMP levels followed by a specific lowering of cAMP concentrations in each brain sub-region linked to the object recognition paradigm support learning efficacy after a middle-term delay."
https://openalex.org/W2047503022,"Programmed mRNA localization to specific subcellular compartments for localized translation is a fundamental mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation that affects many, and possibly all, mRNAs in eukaryotes. We describe her e a systematic approach to identify the RNA cargoes associated with the cytoskeletal motor proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in combination with live-cell 3D super-localization microscopy of endogenously tagged mRNAs. Our analysis identified widespread association of mRNAs with cytoskeletal motor proteins, including association of Myo3 with mRNAs encoding key regulators of actin branching and endocytosis such as WASP and WIP. Using conventional fluorescence microscopy and expression of MS2-tagged mRNAs from endogenous loci, we observed a strong bias for actin patch nucleator mRNAs to localize to the cell cortex and the actin patch in a Myo3- and F-actin dependent manner. Use of a double-helix point spread function (DH-PSF) microscope allowed super-localization measurements of single mRNPs at a spatial precision of 25 nm in x and y and 50 nm in z in live cells with 50 ms exposure times, allowing quantitative profiling of mRNP dynamics. The actin patch mRNA exhibited distinct and characteristic diffusion coefficients when compared to a control mRNA. In addition, disruption of F-actin significantly expanded the 3D confinement radius of an actin patch nucleator mRNA, providing a quantitative assessment of the contribution of the actin cytoskeleton to mRNP dynamic localization. Our results provide evidence for specific association of mRNAs with cytoskeletal motor proteins in yeast, suggest that different mRNPs have distinct and characteristic dynamics, and lend insight into the mechanism of actin patch nucleator mRNA localization to actin patches."
https://openalex.org/W2029954507,"We have examined the effect of temperature on the electrophysiological properties of three neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (NACHR) subtypes: the rapidly desensitizing homomeric α7 nAChR, the more slowly desensitizing heteromeric α4β2 nAChR and on α7 nAChRs containing a transmembrane mutation (L247T) that results in dramatically reduced desensitization. In all cases, the functional properties of receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes at room temperature (RT; 21°C) were compared to those recorded at either physiological temperature (37°C) or at lower temperature (4°C). Alterations in temperature had dramatically differing effects on the amplitude of whole-cell responses detected with these three nAChR subtypes. Compared to responses at RT, the amplitude of agonist-evoked responses with α4β2 nAChRs was increased at high temperature (125±9%, n = 6, P<0.01) and reduced at low temperature (47±5%, n = 6, P<0.01), whereas the amplitude of α7 responses was reduced at high temperature (27±7%, n = 11, P<0.001) and increased at low temperatures (224±16%, n = 10, P<0.001). In contrast to the effects of temperature on α4β2 and wild type α7 nAChRs, the amplitude of α7 nAChRs containing the L247T mutation was unaffected by changes in temperature. In addition, changes in temperature had little or no effect on current amplitude when α7 nAChRs were activated by the largely non-desensitizing allosteric agonist 4BP-TQS. Despite these differing effects of temperature on the amplitude of agonist-evoked responses in different nAChRs, changes in temperature had a consistent effect on the rate of receptor desensitization on all subtypes examined. In all cases, higher temperature resulted in increased rates of desensitization. Thus, it appears that the differing effects of temperature on the amplitudes of whole-cell responses cannot be explained by temperature-induced changes in receptor desensitization rates."
https://openalex.org/W2032962067,"Background Cabut (Cbt) is a C2H2-class zinc finger transcription factor involved in embryonic dorsal closure, epithelial regeneration and other developmental processes in Drosophila melanogaster. Cbt orthologs have been identified in other Drosophila species and insects as well as in vertebrates. Indeed, Cbt is the Drosophila ortholog of the group of vertebrate proteins encoded by the TGF-ß-inducible early-response genes (TIEGs), which belong to Sp1-like/Krüppel-like family of transcription factors. Several functional domains involved in transcriptional control and subcellular localization have been identified in the vertebrate TIEGs. However, little is known of whether these domains and functions are also conserved in the Cbt protein. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the transcriptional regulatory activity of the Drosophila Cbt protein, we performed Gal4-based luciferase assays in S2 cells and showed that Cbt is a transcriptional repressor and able to regulate its own expression. Truncated forms of Cbt were then generated to identify its functional domains. This analysis revealed a sequence similar to the mSin3A-interacting repressor domain found in vertebrate TIEGs, although located in a different part of the Cbt protein. Using β-Galactosidase and eGFP fusion proteins, we also showed that Cbt contains the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) previously identified in TIEG proteins, although it is non-functional in insect cells. Instead, a monopartite NLS, located at the amino terminus of the protein and conserved across insects, is functional in Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera exigua Sec301 cells. Last but not least, genetic interaction and immunohistochemical assays suggested that Cbt nuclear import is mediated by Importin-α2. Conclusions/Significance Our results constitute the first characterization of the molecular mechanisms of Cbt-mediated transcriptional control as well as of Cbt nuclear import, and demonstrate the existence of similarities and differences in both aspects of Cbt function between the insect and the vertebrate TIEG proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2087933609,"Barbiturates potentiate GABA actions at the GABAA receptor and act as central nervous system depressants that can induce effects ranging from sedation to general anesthesia. No structural information has been available about how barbiturates are recognized by their protein targets. For this reason, we tested whether these drugs were able to bind specifically to horse spleen apoferritin, a model protein that has previously been shown to bind many anesthetic agents with affinities that are closely correlated with anesthetic potency. Thiopental, pentobarbital, and phenobarbital were all found to bind to apoferritin with affinities ranging from 10–500 µM, approximately matching the concentrations required to produce anesthetic and GABAergic responses. X-ray crystal structures were determined for the complexes of apoferritin with thiopental and pentobarbital at resolutions of 1.9 and 2.0 Å, respectively. These structures reveal that the barbiturates bind to a cavity in the apoferritin shell that also binds haloalkanes, halogenated ethers, and propofol. Unlike these other general anesthetics, however, which rely entirely upon van der Waals interactions and the hydrophobic effect for recognition, the barbiturates are recognized in the apoferritin site using a mixture of both polar and nonpolar interactions. These results suggest that any protein binding site that is able to recognize and respond to the chemically and structurally diverse set of compounds used as general anesthetics is likely to include a versatile mixture of both polar and hydrophobic elements."
https://openalex.org/W2061777595,"Central memory CD8(+) T cells expressing the adhesion molecule CD62L (L-selectin) are potent mediators of anti-cancer immunity due to their ability to proliferate extensively upon antigen re-stimulation. The interaction of selectin with its ligands mediates leukocyte rolling along high endothelial venules. Mice deficient in α(1,3) Fucosyltransferase IV and VII (FtDKO) lack functional L, P and E selectin ligands. Thus, we addressed whether the lack of selectin ligand interactions alters tumor protection by CD8(+) T cells in FtDKO mice. Listeria monocytogenes-OVA (LM-OVA) infection evoked potent OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells that proliferated and contracted at similar kinetics and phenotype in FtDKO and wild-type mice. Additionally, OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells in both mouse strains exhibited similar phenotypic differentiation, in vivo cytolytic activity and IFN-γ expression. However, FtDKO mice succumbed to B16-OVA tumors significantly earlier than wild-type mice. In contrast, FtDKO mice evoked strong recall memory CD8(+) T cell responses and protection to systemic LM-OVA re-challenge. The diminished tumor protection in FtDKO mice was not related to defective antigen presentation by dendritic cells or reduced proliferation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. However, WT or FtDKO OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells showed significantly reduced ability to traffic to lymph nodes upon adoptive transfer into naïve FtDKO recipients. Furthermore, FtDKO OVA-specific CD8(+) T cells displayed poor ability to infiltrate tumors growing in WT mice. These results reveal that selectin ligand expression on host endothelium as well CD8(+) T cells may be important for their efficient and continued extravasation into peripheral tumors."

Tat plays an essential role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, not only for HIV-1 replication but also as an extracellular toxin able to disrupt the immune system. We showed previously that immunization of rabbits with Tat Oyi, a variant cloned from an African woman who did not develop AIDS following HIV-1 infection, raised antibodies able to recognize different Tat variants. We carried out mice immunization with Tat Oyi and selected a mAb named 7G12, which had the capacity to cross-recognize heterologous Tat variants by a common three-dimensional epitope. These results highlighted that Tat variants were able to acquire a structure, in contrast to a number of studies showing Tat as an unfolded protein. mAb 7G12 also had the capacity to neutralize the biological activities of these Tat variants by blocking the cellular uptake of extracellular Tat. This is the first study using Tat Oyi to produce a mAb able to neutralize effectively activities of extracellular Tats from different HIV-1 subtypes. This mAb has an important potential in therapeutic passive immunization and could help HIV-1 infected patients to restore their immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1970749700,"The TSH receptor (TSHR) comprises an extracellular leucine-rich domain (LRD) linked by a hinge region to the transmembrane domain (TMD). Insight into the orientation of these components to each other is required for understanding how ligands activate the receptor. We previously identified residue E251 at the LRD-hinge junction as contributing to coupling TSH binding with receptor activation. However, a single residue cannot stabilize the LRD-hinge unit. Therefore, based on the LRD crystal structure we selected for study four other potential LRD-hinge interface charged residues. Alanine substitutions of individual residues K244, E247, K250 and R255 (as well as previously known E251A) did not affect TSH binding or function. However, the cumulative mutation of these residues in varying permutations, primarily K250A and R255A when associated with E251A, partially uncoupled TSH binding and function. These data suggest that these three residues, spatially very close to each other at the LRD base, interact with the hinge region. Unexpectedly and most important, monoclonal antibody CS-17, a TSHR inverse agonist whose epitope straddles the LRD-hinge, was found to interact with residues K244 and E247 at the base of the convex LRD surface. These observations, together with the functional data, exclude residues K244 and E247 from the TSHR LRD-hinge interface. Further, for CS-17 accessibility to K244 and E247, the concave surface of the TSHR LRD must be tilted forwards towards the hinge region and plasma membrane. Overall, these data provide insight into the mechanism by which ligands either activate the TSHR or suppress its constitutive activity."
