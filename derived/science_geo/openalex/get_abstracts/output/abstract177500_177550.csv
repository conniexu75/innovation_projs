https://openalex.org/W2050066317,"In animals, the double-stranded RNA-specific endonuclease Dicer produces two classes of functionally distinct, tiny RNAs: microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). miRNAs regulate mRNA translation, whereas siRNAs direct RNA destruction via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Here we show that, in human cell extracts, the miRNA let-7 naturally enters the RNAi pathway, which suggests that only the degree of complementarity between a miRNA and its RNA target determines its function. Human let-7 is a component of a previously identified, miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein particle, which we show is an RNAi enzyme complex. Each let-7-containing complex directs multiple rounds of RNA cleavage, which explains the remarkable efficiency of the RNAi pathway in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2145633813,"Cooperation based on reciprocal altruism has evolved in only a small number of species, yet it constitutes the core behavioral principle of human social life. The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game has been used to model this form of cooperation. We used fMRI to scan 36 women as they played an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with another woman to investigate the neurobiological basis of cooperative social behavior. Mutual cooperation was associated with consistent activation in brain areas that have been linked with reward processing: nucleus accumbens, the caudate nucleus, ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and rostral anterior cingulate cortex. We propose that activation of this neural network positively reinforces reciprocal altruism, thereby motivating subjects to resist the temptation to selfishly accept but not reciprocate favors."
https://openalex.org/W2033609439,"Mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the loss of language and motor skills during early childhood. We generated mice with a truncating mutation similar to those found in RTT patients. These mice appeared normal and exhibited normal motor function for about 6 weeks, but then developed a progressive neurological disease that includes many features of RTT: tremors, motor impairments, hypoactivity, increased anxiety-related behavior, seizures, kyphosis, and stereotypic forelimb motions. Additionally, we show that although the truncated MeCP2 protein in these mice localizes normally to heterochromatic domains in vivo, histone H3 is hyperacetylated, providing evidence that the chromatin architecture is abnormal and that gene expression may be misregulated in this model of Rett syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1991024347,"Myelin inhibitors of axonal regeneration, like Nogo and MAG, block regrowth after injury to the adult CNS. While a GPI-linked receptor for Nogo (NgR) has been identified, MAG's receptor is unknown. We show that MAG inhibits regeneration by interaction with NgR. Binding of and inhibition by MAG are lost if neuronal GPI-linked proteins are cleaved. Binding of MAG to NgR-expressing cells is GPI dependent and sialic acid independent. Conversely, NgR binds to MAG-expressing cells. MAG, but not a truncated MAG that binds neurons but does not inhibit regeneration, precipitates NgR from NgR-expressing cells, DRG, and cerebellar neurons. Importantly, NgR antibody, soluble NgR, or dominant-negative NgR each prevent inhibition of neurite outgrowth by MAG. Also, MAG and Nogo66 compete for binding to NgR. These results suggest redundancy in myelin inhibitors and indicate therapies for CNS injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2030377743,"To elucidate mechanisms controlling the number and subunit composition of synaptic NMDA-Rs in hippocampal slice neurons, the NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits were optically and electrophysiologically tagged. The NR2 subunit directs delivery of receptors to synapses with different rules controlling NR2A and NR2B. Synaptic incorporation of NR2B-containing receptors is not limited by synaptic transmission nor enhanced by increased subunit expression. NR2A-containing receptors whose expression normally increases with age replace synaptic NR2B-containing receptors. Replacement is enhanced by increased NR2A expression and requires synaptic activity. Surprisingly, spontaneously released transmitter acting on synaptic NMDA-Rs is sufficient for replacement and reduces NMDA-R responses. Thus, as with AMPA-Rs, synaptic trafficking of NMDA-Rs is tightly regulated and has subunit-specific rules with functionally important consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2171489970,"C. elegans OSM-9 is a TRPV channel protein involved in sensory transduction and adaptation. Here, we show that distinct sensory functions arise from different combinations of OSM-9 and related OCR TRPV proteins. Both OSM-9 and OCR-2 are essential for several forms of sensory transduction, including olfaction, osmosensation, mechanosensation, and chemosensation. In neurons that express both OSM-9 and OCR-2, tagged OCR-2 and OSM-9 proteins reside in sensory cilia and promote each other's localization to cilia. In neurons that express only OSM-9, tagged OSM-9 protein resides in the cell body and acts in sensory adaptation rather than sensory transduction. Thus, alternative combinations of TRPV proteins may direct different functions in distinct subcellular locations. Animals expressing the mammalian TRPV1 (VR1) channel in ASH nociceptor neurons avoid the TRPV1 ligand capsaicin, allowing selective, drug-inducible activation of a specific behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1870193477,"We have determined the 2.6 angstrom crystal structure of the entire extracellular region of human HER3 (ErbB3), a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. The structure consists of four domains with structural homology to domains found in the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor. The HER3 structure reveals a contact between domains II and IV that constrains the relative orientations of ligand-binding domains and provides a structural basis for understanding both multiple-affinity forms of EGFRs and conformational changes induced in the receptor by ligand binding during signaling. These results also suggest new therapeutic approaches to modulating the behavior of members of the EGFR family."
https://openalex.org/W2023941922,"The attentional modulation of sensory information processing in the visual system is the result of top-down influences, which can cause a multiplicative modulation of the firing rate of sensory neurons in extrastriate visual cortex, an effect reminiscent of the bottom-up effect of changes in stimulus contrast. This similarity could simply reflect the multiplicity of both effects. But, here we show that in direction-selective neurons in monkey visual cortical area MT, stimulus and attentional effects share a nonlinearity. These neurons show higher response gain for both contrast and attentional changes for intermediate contrast stimuli and smaller gain for low- and high-contrast stimuli. This finding suggests a close relationship between the neural encoding of stimulus contrast and the modulating effect of the behavioral relevance of stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1977328014,"We reported that the generation of nitric oxide by mitochondria is catalyzed by a constitutive, mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase (mtNOS). Given that this production may establish the basis for a novel regulatory pathway of energy metabolism, oxygen consumption, and oxygen free radical production, it becomes imperative to identify unequivocally and characterize this enzyme to provide a basis for its regulation. The mitochondrial localization of mtNOS was supported by following the hepatic distribution of mtNOS, immunoblotting submitochondrial fractions, and immunohistochemistry of liver tissues. mtNOS was identified as brain NOSα by various methods (mass spectrometry of proteolytic fragments, amino acid analysis, molecular weight, pI, and analysis of PCR fragments), excluding the occurrence of a novel isoform or other splice variants. Distribution of mtNOS transcript indicated its occurrence in liver, brain, heart, muscle, kidney, lung, testis, and spleen. In contrast to brain NOS, mtNOS has two post-translational modifications: acylation with myristic acid and phosphorylation at the C terminus. The former modification is a reversible and post-translational process, which may serve for subcellular targeting or membrane anchoring. The latter modification could be linked to enzymatic regulation. These results are discussed in terms of the role that nitric oxide may have in cellular bioenergetics.

In our laboratory the production of NO⋅ by mitochondria was demonstrated by using two spectroscopic techniques,i.e. oxidation of oxymyoglobin inhibitable by a nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor and by electron paramagnetic resonance with a spin trapping technique (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 2Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol.

Sarkela T.M. Berthiaume J. Elfering S. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (abstr.): 1554Google Scholar). In other laboratories, the production of NO⋅ has been followed by the formation ofl-citrulline from radiolabeled l-arginine (8Kobzik L. Stringer B. Ballingand J.-L. Reid M.B. Stamler J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 9Ghafourifar P. Richter C.

These measurements along with the use of purified, intact mitochondria provided experimental support for production of NO⋅by these organelles. Later, we isolated and purified a protein with NOS activity localized mainly at the mitochondrial membranes (mtNOS; 2). This mtNOS has characteristics similar to the mac isoform (antigenic cross-reactivity and tight binding of calmodulin). In contrast, mtNOS is constitutively expressed and membrane-bound (2Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The identification of mtNOS is a required step to assign this protein to one of the known isoforms (brain NOS (bNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), or inducible NOS (iNOS)) or to depict it as a novel isoform. The relevance of this assignment resides on understanding the expression and regulation of mtNOS, considering the biochemical differences of NOSs. For example, the constitutive forms, i.e. bNOS and eNOS, account for the rapid, transient, Ca2+-dependent production of NO⋅(11Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar, 12Mayer B. John M. Bohme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt H.H.H.W. Pollock J.S.

Considering the relevant role that NO⋅ may have in modulating O2 consumption (3Giulivi C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and O2 free radical formation (5Sarkela T. Berthiaume J. Elfering S. Gybina A. Giulivi C. J. Biol.

The goals of this study are the following: first, to identify mtNOS; second, to study the molecular expression of mtNOS in different tissues; and third, to investigate putative post-translational modifications that may target this protein to mitochondria or may affect enzymatic activity. Liver mitochondria were isolated from adult Wistar rats (180–200 g) by differential centrifugation (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 17Chance, B., Hagihara, B., Proceedings of the Fifth International Congress on Biochemistry, Moscow, Slater, E. C., V, 1963, 3, 37, Pergamon Press, New York.Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria were obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1981; 209: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and other nonspecifically bound proteins. The preparations contained a contamination of non-mitochondrial origin of 1–4%, assessed by evaluating enzymatic markers of liver fractions (20 and references therein). The respiratory control ratio of these mitochondria was 8 ± 1, and the ADP:O ratio was 1.8 ± 0.2 with succinate. Mitoplasts were obtained from Percoll-purified mitochondria subjected to a controlled digitonin treatment. Mitoplasts, separated from outer membrane and inner membrane space by centrifugation, were sonicated, and this suspension was separated into two fractions by centrifugation: soluble (matrix) and particulate (inner membrane and contact sites). The inner membrane was purified using a sucrose gradient, sonicated in water, and washed twice with KCl to yield submitochondrial particles (21Pedersen P.L. Greenawalt J.W. Reynafarje B. Hullihen J. Decker G.L. Soper J.W. Bustamante E. Methods Cell Biol. 1979; 20: 411-481Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The recovery of cytochrome oxidase, a marker for mitochondrial inner membrane, was 43.5%. The resultant submitochondrial particles contained less than 0.06% of the outer membrane marker, monoamine oxidase, and the inner membrane marker, adenylate kinase, and about 2% of the matrix-specific marker enzyme Mn-superoxide dismutase. The recoveries were based on the total activity of the mitochondrial markers in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. mtNOS was isolated from purified mitochondria from six to eight rat livers, obtained as described before (2Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The reaction medium used to follow NO⋅ production by purified mtNOS or crude fractions contained 1 mml-Arg, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm NADPH, 20 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 10 mm CHAPS, 1–5 μg/ml calmodulin, in 0.1 mHepes buffer, pH 7.5 (22Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and 0.05–0.5 mg of protein. mtNOS activity was followed by absorption spectrophotometry by following the oxidation of oxymyoglobin. This assay is based on the oxidation of oxymyogloblin to metmyoglobin by NO⋅ (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 23Doyle M.P. Hoekstra J.W. J. Inorg.

This oxidation was followed at 581–592 nm in a double beam, dual wavelength Aminco DW-2C UV-visible spectrophotometer at 22 °C in the presence of 1-mm oxymyoglobin (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Although the detection limit of the oxymyoglobin assay is low (nm concentrations), its specificity could be rather broad. To overcome this shortcoming, the rate of oxymyoglobin oxidation sensitive toN G-monomethyl-l-arginine, an inhibitor of NOS, was considered representative of an enzymatic production of NO⋅ (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The identification of NO⋅ as a product was performed by electron paramagnetic resonance with a spin trapping technique as described before (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 25Kotake Y. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 222-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kotake Y. Tanigawa T. Tanigawa M. Ueno I. Allen D.R. Lai C.-S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the Lowry assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilized pH gradient strips were rehydrated overnight in rehydration buffer (6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% ampholytes, 0.1 m dithiothreitol) using the Immobiline DryStrip reswelling tray (Amersham Biosciences). One mg of crude fraction or 50 μg of purified mtNOS was solubilized in rehydration buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then applied to the strip during the first dimension run. The isoelectric focusing was performed using the Multiphor II and the Immobiline DryStrip kit for 14–17 kVh (depending on the length and pH range of the strip being used). After the first dimension run, the strips were equilibrated for the second dimension for 10 min in 0.05m Tris, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 25 mg/ml dithiothreitol. Subsequently, the immobilized pH gradient strips were laid atop a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and layered with 0.5% agarose in 1× Laemmli running buffer. The electrophoresis was performed using the Hoefer SE 600 at 50 V overnight at 4 °C. After electrophoresis, one of the gels was electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA) and incubated in blocking buffer (1% non-fat dry milk, 10% goat serum in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST; 0.3m NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20)) for 1 h. The blot was treated with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-iNOS monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1 h in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed three times with TBST and then anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugate antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was added in a 1:10,000 dilution. The blots were washed three times with TBST and were developed using ECL reagents. The blots were exposed to chemiluminescent-sensitive Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Eastman Kodak). The other gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes) and superimposed to the films to identify the spot(s) that cross-reacted with the antibodies to iNOS. Those spots were excised from the gels, and in-gel digestion was performed with either trypsin (sequencing grade bovine trypsin modified by reductive methylation, obtained from Promega, Madison, WI) or endoproteinase Glu-C (protease V8, sequencing grade from Staphylococcus aureus V8; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The eluted peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF. These analyses were performed at the University of Minnesota, Mass Spectrometry Facilities (Minneapolis). The mass fragments were analyzed using two programs are based on different algorithms: MS-Fit (ProteinProspector, version 3.4.1.) and ProFound (version 4.10.5). RNA was extracted from 1–2 g of freshly isolated rat liver by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (Trizol, Invitrogen) essentially as described before (28Tsukamoto H. Lin M. Ohata M. Giulivi C. French S.W. Brittenham G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1240-G1250PubMed Google Scholar, 29Liu R.-M. Shi M.M. Giulivi C. Forman H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L330-L336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enrichment of poly(A)+ RNA was performed by using oligo(dT) resin (MessageMaker, Invitrogen). The integrity of RNA or poly(A)+-enriched fractions was assessed by running a minigel and examining the ethidium bromide staining of 18 S and 28 S rRNA. To prevent the problem created by genomic DNA contamination, which may lead to false positives (30Minc-Golomb D. Schwartz J.P. Maines M.D. Nitric-oxide Synthase: Characterization and Functional Analysis. Academic Press, New York1996: 173-183Google Scholar), we used DNase-treated poly(A)+ RNA for reverse transcription. 0.5 μg of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 30 min and then heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the DNase. RT-PCR was performed using Superscript™ One-step RT-PCR with PLATINUM® Taq(Invitrogen). The reaction contained 1× reaction mix (containing 0.2 mm dNTP, 1.2 mm MgSO4), 0.5 mg of mRNA, 1 μl of RT/Taq mix, and 0.2 mm sense and antisense primers, 40 units of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen), and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated dideoxy-H2O to bring the final volume to 50 μl. No additional MgSO4 was required because of the residual salt carried over from the DNase treatment. The RT-PCRs and other PCRs were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amp 2400 PCR system. Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 60 min. PCR amplification followed a 2-min denaturation at 94 °C. 40 amplification cycles were performed as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30s, annealing at 55 °C for 30s, and elongation at 68 °C for 3 min. A final extension was performed at 72 °C for 7 min and then sustained at 4 °C. Parallel amplification of monocarboxylate transporter-1 was performed for reference and as a positive control. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel using TAE buffer containing ethidium bromide and visualized on a MultiImageFC using FluorChem 2.0 software (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). Nested PCRs contained 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1× PCR buffer II, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 200 mm dNTPs, 0.2 mm sense and antisense primers, and 1 μl of template from the RT-PCR in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were denatured at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 2 min. The final extension was held at 68 °C for 7 min, then set at 4 °C until analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described above. PCRs for Fig. 3 (A, lanes 6 and 7, andB and C) were performed using the Rat MTC™ panel I (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as the template and PCR Master Mix (Promega). The PCR conditions for the products obtained in Fig. 3 A (lanes 6 and 7) were performed using 1× Master mix (1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 200 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2), 0.5 mm sense and antisense primers, and 1 ng of template cDNA in a final volume of 50 μl. Initial denaturation was carried out for 2 min at 95 °C followed by PCR. The PCR conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of 30s denaturation at 95 °C, 30s annealing at 55 °C, and 3 min elongation at 72 °C. The final extension was performed at 72 °C for 5 min and maintained at 4 °C until analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Nested PCRs were carried out with the same reaction components and cycling conditions as the parent reactions, except the cDNA template replaced 1 μl of the parent reaction, and different sense and antisense primers were used as indicated in the figure legend. Although the PCR products depicted in Fig. 3, B and C, were also performed with cDNA from MTC™ panel, the experimental conditions were slightly different from those in Fig. 3 A with the following modifications. The parent PCRs contained 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold, 1× PCR buffer II, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 200 mm dNTPs, 0.2 mm sense and antisense primers, 1 ng of MTC™ panel cDNA in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were amplified under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 2 min. The final extension was held at 68 °C for 7 min and maintained at 4 °C. Purified mtNOS (about 1 mg of protein/ml), obtained after the isolation procedure, was precipitated with 5 V of cold acetone and kept for 30 min at –20 °C. The solution was centrifuged in a Dupont® centrifuge in a SS-34 rotor at 10,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 2% SDS w/v and precipitated again with 5 V of cold acetone. The solution was kept at –20 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. This latter procedure (SDS treatment, precipitation with acetone, and centrifugation) was repeated twice. The pellet was extracted with 2 ml of Cl3CH-methanol (2/1, v/v), washed with 2 ml of diethyl ether, and dried under a stream of N2. The delipidated protein pellet was treated with 2 ml of 0.1 m KOH and anhydrous methanol (less than 0.01% H2O), vortexed, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein pellet was saved for acid hydrolysis (see below). The supernatant was acidified with 6 m HCl and extracted three times with hexane. These extractions were combined and dried under N2. The residue, containing the methyl esters of fatty acids originally bound to the protein by oxy- or thioester linkages, was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. The protein pellet procured after the centrifugation at 3,000 × gwas washed three times with ethanol and dried under N2. This pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 3 m HCl in anhydrous methanol and incubated at 105 °C for 20 h in sealed tubes (earlier purged with a N2 stream) under N2 to release amide-linked fatty acids from the protein as the corresponding methyl esters. The tubes were cooled and extracted three times with hexane. The extracts were combined and dried under a stream of N2. The residue was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. NOS was immunolocalized in paraformaldehyde-fixed rat liver slices, essentially following the procedure described in Ref. 31Nakane P.K. Maines M.D. Nitric-oxide Synthase: Characterization and Functional Analysis. Academic Press, New York1996: 54-56Google Scholar with the following modifications. After fixation, the slices were permeabilized by incubating in ice-cold acetone for 5 min, then washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-T). The slices were blocked with 10% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations were performed using a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal antibodies to bNOS (Transduction Laboratories) and to subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in blocking solution. The bNOS antibody was labeled with Alexa Fluor™ 594 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). After labeling the antibody to bNOS, the specificity of these was confirmed by immunoblotting samples of rat liver and isolated mitochondria, using positive and negative controls. The antibody to cytochrome oxidase was commercially available as a conjugate with Alexa Fluor™ 488. Overnight incubation of the slices with primary antibodies was performed in the dark in moist chambers, at 4 °C. The slices were washed three times for 15 min each with PBS-T. In some experiments, instead of the antibody to cytochrome oxidase, mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Green FM (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's conditions. The slices were washed with PBS-T, the nuclei labeled with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole according to the manufacturer's conditions (Molecular Probes), air dried, and protected from light. The slides were mounted using ProLong Antifade medium (Molecular Probes). Rat liver slices were observed with epifluorescence microscopy using appropriate filters (Nikon E600) and photographed using a digital camera (Spot II). The digital images were acquired using Metamorph software. Brightness, contrast, and background (the last defined as areas without cells or with cells without antibody addition) were adjusted and the images were overlaid using Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA). The recovery of rat liver NOS activity (followed by either the oxidation of oxymyoglobin orl-[14C]citrulline, inhibitable byN G-monomethyl-l-arginine) was 70% in the mitochondrial fraction and 45–50% in Percoll-purified mitochondria, supporting the mitochondrial localization of this enzyme. The submitochondrial distribution of mtNOS indicated that inner membrane and contact sites were the only fractions that exhibited the presence of mtNOS by Western blotting. The almost complete recovery (60–70%) of mtNOS activity from mitochondria isolated from purified rat hepatocytes (>98% purity and >98% viability by trypan blue exclusion) indicated that this enzyme had originated from parenchymal cells, excluding contributions from other cell types. These observations were confirmed further by (i) immunoprobing formalin-fixed liver slices for cytochrome oxidase and NOS, resulting in the colocalization of these proteins in parenchymal mitochondria (Fig.1; similar results were obtained by using MitoTracker Green instead of antibodies to cytochrome oxidase) and (ii) considering the high contribution of hepatocytes to liver cellular composition (92.5%; 33) and mitochondrial volume (98.4%; 33). As reported before, isolated rat liver mtNOS shared certain properties with macNOS (antigenic cross-reactivity, V max of the purified form), whereas the constitutive expression of mtNOS, requirement of cofactors, and the main membrane localization suggested the presence of either a novel isoform or one of the well characterized isoforms with co- or post-translational modifications. To gain insight into the protein sequence, microsequencing of purified mtNOS from blots was attempted; however, the finding of a blocked N-terminal residue precluded a direct Edman degradation because the chemistry requires a free NH2 group (or imino for Pro; Ref. 34Geisow M.J. Aitken A. Findlay J.B.C. Giesow M.J. Protein Sequencing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 85-99Google Scholar). Thus, mtNOS was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, followed by in-gel digestion with either trypsin or endoproteinase V8. MALDI-TOF and/or Q-TOF analyses were performed on the eluted fragments. The resulting peptide masses and sequences were blasted against in silicotrypsin- or V8-digested proteins from the PDB to permit the identification of mtNOS based on the digest profile (MALDI-TOF) and amino acid sequences (Q-TOF). The peptidic fragments from both treatments (i.e. trypsin and endoproteinase) matched sequences of constitutive rat bNOS (Fig.2). All fragments had a 100% homology to bNOS and only between 21 and 78% to macNOS and eNOS, precluding these isoforms as mtNOS. A minor percentage of fragments (5–10%) matched those from mature carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2Although carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I is present in the mitochondrial matrix (35Gamble J.G. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 610-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contamination with this protein is not unexpected given its high concentration (estimated to represent between 13 and 17% of total mitochondrial protein, 0.4–0.5 mm (36Raijman L. Jones M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or 1–1.5 mm (37Lusty C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)). Assuming that contamination with this enzyme resulted from its entrapment in membrane vesicles during the sonication procedure, the latter procedure was performed in water, followed by washes with 0.15 m KCl. The resulting preparation resulted in undetectable activity of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, without affecting the MS profile of bNOS. and iNOS. The amino acid composition of mtNOS, obtained after acid hydrolysis of the protein, closely matched that of bNOS (TableI). The amino acid analysis combined with pI (7.0 ± 0.5) and molecular weight (130,000 ± 26,000) extracted from two-dimensional gels, in addition to the peptide mass fingerprinting and amino acid sequences, were used to perform a protein identification search using the MultiIdent protein identification on the ExPASy server.

https://openalex.org/W1969449517,"Artemin (ARTN) is a member of the GDNF family of ligands and signals through the Ret/GFRalpha3 receptor complex. Characterization of ARTN- and GFRalpha3-deficient mice revealed similar abnormalities in the migration and axonal projection pattern of the entire sympathetic nervous system. This resulted in abnormal innervation of target tissues and consequent cell death due to deficiencies of target-derived neurotrophic support. ARTN is expressed along blood vessels and in cells nearby to sympathetic axonal projections. In the developing vasculature, ARTN is expressed in smooth muscle cells of the vessels, and it acts as a guidance factor that encourages sympathetic fibers to follow blood vessels as they project toward their final target tissues. The chemoattractive properties of ARTN were confirmed by the demonstration that sympathetic neuroblasts migrate and project axons toward ARTN-soaked beads implanted into mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2019122545,"Cells at the anterior boundary of the neural plate (ANB) can induce telencephalic gene expression when transplanted to more posterior regions. Here, we identify a secreted Frizzled-related Wnt antagonist, Tlc, that is expressed in ANB cells and can cell nonautonomously promote telencephalic gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, abrogation of Tlc function compromises telencephalic development. We also identify Wnt8b as a locally acting modulator of regional fate in the anterior neural plate and a likely target for antagonism by Tlc. Finally, we show that tlc expression is regulated by signals that establish early antero-posterior and dorso-ventral ectodermal pattern. From these studies, we propose that local antagonism of Wnt activity within the anterior ectoderm is required to establish the telencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W2093805100,"A high throughput screen for neutral, magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase (SMase) was performed. One inhibitor discovered in the screen, GW4869, functioned as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme in vitro with an IC50 of 1 μm. It did not inhibit acid SMase at up to at least 150 μm. The compound was then evaluated for its ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of neutral SMase (N-SMase) in MCF7 cells. GW4869 (10 μm) partially inhibited TNF-induced sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis, and 20 μm of the compound was protected completely from the loss of SM. The addition of 10–20 μmGW4869 completely inhibited the initial accumulation of ceramide, whereas this effect was partially lost at later time points (24 h). These data therefore support the inhibitory action of GW4869 on N-SMase not only in vitro but also in a cellular model. The addition of GW4869 at both 10 and 20 μm did not modify cellular glutathione levels in response to TNF, suggesting that the action of GW4869 occurred downstream of the drop in glutathione, which was shown previously to occur upstream of the activation of N-SMase. Further, whereas TNF treatment also caused a 75% increase ofde novo synthesized ceramide after 20 h of incubation, GW4869, at either 10 or 20 μm, had no effect on this pathway of ceramide generation. In addition, GW4869 did not significantly impair TNF-induced NF-κB translocation to nuclei. Therefore, GW4869 does not interfere with other key TNF-mediated signaling effects. GW4869 was able, in a dose-dependent manner, to significantly protect from cell death as measured by nuclear condensation, caspase activation, PARP degradation, and trypan blue uptake. These protective effects were accompanied by significant inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase 9 activation, therefore localizing N-SMase activation upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. In conclusion, our results indicate that N-SMase activation is a necessary step for the full development of the cytotoxic program induced by TNF.

In conclusion, our results indicate that N-SMase activation is a necessary step for the full development of the cytotoxic program induced by TNF. Programmed cell death is a necessary requirement during development, and an altered regulation of this process is also thought to contribute to the occurrence of serious illnesses such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Significant progress has been made in the identification of crucial events that contribute to defining this process (mitochondrial dysfunction, chromatin fragmentation, and membrane blebbing) as well as in the identification of molecular mechanisms and effectors that regulate and/or execute these events (exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane, depolarization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, formation of permeability transition pores in the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome crelease, caspase activation, and alteration of calcium homeostasis, Bcl2 family members, apoptosis-inducing factor, apoptosis activating factor-1, Smac/Diablo, IAPs, and others). The sphingolipid ceramide has been shown to induce cellular features characteristic of programmed cell death (membrane blebbing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and nuclear fragmentation). Moreover, many agents known to cause apoptosis (such as TNF, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor α; SMase, sphingomyelinase; N-SMase, neutral sphingomyelinase; A-SMase, acid sphigomyelinase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PS, phosphatidylserine; SM, sphingomyelin; PAF, platelet-activating factor; PLC, phospholipase C; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MSA, methane sulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. CD95 cross-linking, daunorubicin, heat stress, growth factor withdrawal, UV-B and γ-radiation, bacterial infections, and others) have also been found to increase the intracellular levels of ceramide, with emerging evidence suggesting an important role for ceramide in regulating/mediating the apoptotic response to these agents (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hannun Y. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Google Scholar, 2Levade T. Jaffrezou J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 1-17Google Scholar, 3Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Google Scholar). A major current challenge is to define the role of the pathway promoted by ceramide and integrate it with other molecular mechanisms that lead to cell death. Two main routes have been defined for the generation of ceramide: hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and de novo biosynthesis. The first occurs by the action of sphingomyelinases (SMases), which operate at different pH optima (acid or neutral SMase) and have different metal requirements (magnesium dependence) (2Levade T.

The de novo pathway is regulated primarily by the action of serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme along the biosynthetic pathway. Accumulation of ceramide via de novobiosynthesis was originally shown after treatment with retinoic acid in GH4C1 (18Kalen A. Borchardt R.A. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The study of the de novo pathway has benefited tremendously from the availability of highly specific inhibitors: fumonisin B1 for ceramide synthase (25Merrill Jr., A.H. Sullards M.C. Wang E. Voss K.A. Riley R.T. Environ. Health Perspect. 2001; 109: 283-289Google Scholar) and myriocin/ISP1 for serine palmitoyltransferase (26Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Google Scholar). On the other hand, very few tools have been available to dissect the neutral sphingomyelinase pathway. One molecule, scyphostatin, has been previously described to exert inhibitory activity versus a N-SMase (27Nara F. Tanaka M. Hosoya T. Suzuki-Konagai K. Ogita T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1999; 52: 525-530Google Scholar, 28Bernardo K. Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kreder D. Micheli M. Schafer R. Sickman A. Schmidt W.E. Schroder J.M. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7641-7647Google Scholar), and it has been used to implicate N-SMase in the outgrowth process of hippocampal neurons in response to nerve growth factor (29Brann A.B. Scott R. Neuberger Y. Abulafia D. Boldin S. Fainzilber M. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8199-8206Google Scholar). We set out to develop specific inhibitors of N-SMase and to determine the role of N-SMase in apoptosis and how it interacts with other key regulators of apoptosis. A high throughput assay was developed for N-SMase, and we successfully identified a molecule, GW4869 (Fig. 1), that exhibited significant and specific inhibitory activity on N-SMase. We provide evidence of the specificity of GW4869 in vitro. Next, the effects of this inhibitor were determined in MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with TNF, which has emerged as one of the best characterized models of cytokine-induced cell death and of ceramide function. It has been previously shown that TNF induces activation of N-SMase in these cells and that this activation is a consequence of the drop of glutathione that follows the activation of the death receptor and caspase 8 (13Liu B. Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Zhang P. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11313-11320Google Scholar). Also, this activation couples to processing of effector caspases (30Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Google Scholar). Using this newly characterized inhibitor, we were able to confirm N-SMase activation upon TNF treatment of MCF7 and its effects on effector caspases and cell death. Second, we provide evidence for the first time of the participation of N-SMase in the processes that lead to cytochrome c release and mitochondrial dysfunction, indicating the requirement for N-SMase activation as a necessary step for the complete development of the cytotoxic program induced by TNF. RPMI 1640 medium was from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Summit Technology. TNF was from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ).

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 176-184Google Scholar) with variable amounts of SM or PS incorporated into the assay via solubilization into Triton X-100 micelles. Human acid sphingomyelinase, overexpressed in SF-9 insect cells using a baculoviral system, was similarly assayed in a final reaction volume of 50 μl containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5), 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 0.13% Triton X-100 and lacking PS or dithiothreitol. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10, 30, and 150 min at room temperature. At the appropriate time, the reaction was quenched with 75 μl of 5% bovine serum albumin followed by 75 μl of 8% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, 100 μl of supernatant were counted for 14C with 150 μl of Optiphase Supermix. All rate measurements obtained were in the linear range and represented conversion of less than 20% of substrate to product. HEK293, expressing the lyso-PAF PLC (32Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Google Scholar), were lysed in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A in the absence of detergents, and the postnuclear extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C. The pellet, containing the total membranes, was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated on a rotating platform for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged for 1h at 100,000 × gat 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a HiTrap Q column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA. The lyso-PAF PLC was then eluted with a linear salt gradient (1.5 m NaCl). Fractions were collected, N-SMase activity was measured as previously indicated (33Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Google Scholar), and the protein level was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-His6 monoclonal antibodies against the histidine-FLAG of the protein. The fraction containing peak activity (which also showed most of the protein by western) was used for determining the effect of GW4869 in vitro. Partially purified rat brain N-SMase and lyso-PAF PLC were incubated in the absence or presence of GW4869 and PS (100 μm), and SM hydrolysis was determined as previously described (30Dbaibo G.S.

In the case ofBacillus cereus N-SMase (Sigma), PS was not included in the reaction mixture, since it does not affect the bacterial enzymatic activity. B. cereus phosphatidylcholine-PLC (Sigma) was incubated in the presence or absence of GW4869 in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 25% glycerol, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl/phosphorylcholine, and production of p-nitrophenol was quantified spectrophotometrically at 410 nm.

Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15530-15538Google Scholar). In all assays, 10 μm GW4869 was used, and 30-min preincubation with the enzymes preceded the addition of the substrate. MCF7 human breast cancer cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Unless otherwise indicated, for treatment, cells were seeded at 1.7 × 106 cells/10-cm culture dish in 10 ml of complete medium; after 24 h, the medium was replaced with 7 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and the cells were rested for 2 h prior to treatment. GW4869 was routinely stored at −80 °C as a 1.5 mm stock suspension in Me2SO. Right before use, the suspension was solubilized by the addition of 5% methane sulfonic acid (MSA) (2.5 μl of 5% MSA in sterile double-distilled H2O were added to 50 μl of GW4869 stock suspension; therefore, the concentration of the GW4869 stock solution at the time of the experiments was 1.43 mm). The suspension was mixed and warmed up at 37 °C until clear. Cells were preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 min prior to treatment with TNF. Control cells were treated with Me2SO containing 5% MSA, similarly to the samples receiving the GW4869 solution. When different doses of GW4869 were tested, amounts of vehicle solution were added in order to equal the volume of GW4869 used for the highest dose. Cells were seeded at 0.1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish in 8 ml of complete growth medium. After 48 h, the cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (1 μCi/ml final concentration in 10 ml of growth medium/plate). After ∼60 h, the cells were chased with 10 ml of complete medium for 90 min. Then the cells were washed once with 5 ml of PBS, and 7 ml of medium containing 2% FBS and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, were added. After resting the cells for approximately 1 h, preincubation for 30 min with GW4869 was started, and TNF treatment followed. At the appropriate time points, the medium from each plate was collected, and the cells were washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were scraped on ice in 2 ml of PBS, and each plate was washed with an additional 2 ml of PBS. Cells and washes were pooled with the medium and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g (4 °C). The cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. On the day of the measurement, the pellets were resuspended in 600 μl of double-distilled H2O by vortexing and sonication. Aliquots of cell lysates were used for protein determination, and 250 μl in duplicate were used for SM determination as described by Andrieu et al. (35Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in methanol, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The chloroform organic phase was divided into aliquots (in duplicates) and dried down for ceramide and phosphate measurements. Ceramide levels were evaluated using the Escherichia colidiacylglycerol kinase assay. Ceramide was quantitated by using external standards and normalized to phosphate content (37Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 1.7 × 106cells/plate in complete growth medium. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 6 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 2% FBS and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Right before the addition of GW4869, [3H]palmitate was added to the cells in 1 ml of the same medium to a final activity of 1 μCi/ml. After ∼21 h of treatment with TNF, the medium was collected, and the plates were washed once with PBS that was combined with the medium and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to collect floating cells. Cells were scraped off the plate with methanol and combined with the floaters. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). One ml of the organic phase was used for ceramide determination by separation of lipids through thin layer chromatography (chloroform, methanol, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide; 4:1:0.1; v/v/v), and 0.35 ml in duplicates were used for determination of inorganic phosphate used to normalize the ceramide values. The ceramide band was identified by comparison with an authentic standard, and radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. The assay was performed as previously described (38Luberto C. Yoo D.S. Suidan H.S. Bartoli G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14760-14766Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatments, cells were washed and harvested by scraping in PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Just prior to centrifugation, 20 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the suspension was mixed by pipetting up and down three times. Nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifugation at 1300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclei were resuspended in 20 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4m NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was mixed gently for 30 min and pelleted at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated in HDKE buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of poly(dN6), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. One μl of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (60,000–100,000 cpm) was added to each reaction and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 15% Ficoll solution containing indicator dyes (bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). Equal amounts (20 μl) of reaction mixture were loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE and run at 200 V. Gels were placed onto Whatman filter paper, dried, and autoradiographed. The specificity of NF-κB activation upon TNF stimulation in the absence and in the presence of GW6948 was assayed as previously described (34Jones J.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15530-15538Google Scholar). For immunocytochemical analysis, cells were plated at a density of 1.7 × 106 cells/100-mm plate that contained 22-mm glass coverslips. Following treatment, cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently permeabilized during a 15-min incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed, blocked and treated for 4 h with a rabbit anti-p65 NF-κB antibody (1:200) or a mouse anti-cytochromec antibody (1:200). The coverslips were then washed and incubated for 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch) or a rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch), respectively. Nuclei were visualized by a 5-min incubation with Hoechst dye (5 μg/ml bisbenzimide; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and stored protected from light at −20 °C. The cells stained for NF-κB were photographed with a Dage-MTI 100 video camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with fluorescence optics, using a video digitizer (Snappy Video Snapshot, Play Inc., Rancho Cordova) operated through Adobe Photoshop. The cells stained for cytochrome c were observed with a confocal microscope (Olympus IX 70), PerkinElmer Biosciences Ultraview software, spinning disk, using an Olympus ×40, 1.4 numerical aperture, oil immersion lens. Fluorescence signals were collected after single line excitation at 543 nm (red). At the indicated time points, adherent cells were collected by trypsinization and combined with floaters in the medium. After centrifugation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold double-distilled H2O. The following steps were performed at 4 °C using a modified procedure from Tietze F (39Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Google Scholar, 40Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 ml of lysate were used for protein determination using the Bio-Rad assay, and the remaining 0.3 ml of lysate were added to 75 μl of 10% (v/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid, mixed, and incubated on ice for 10 min to allow protein precipitation. Samples were then centrifuged, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. For determination of the total glutathione content, 5 μl from the supernatants were added to 35 μl of a buffer containing 6.3 mm EDTA in 125 mmsodium phosphate (GAB). Then 200 μl of 0.315 mm NADPH solution prepared in GAB (final concentration, 0.21 mm), 0.55 units of glutathione reductase, and 50 μl of 12 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution prepared in GAB (final concentration, 2 mm) were added, and the reaction was followed for 5 min by reading the OD at 412 nm. Concentration values were obtained using a standard curve with known glutathione values (0.1–100 nm) from a stock solution prepared in GAB, and they were normalized to protein concentrations. Caspase activity was analyzed with the ApoAlert CPP32/caspase 3 assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). At the indicated time points, adherent cells were collected by trypsinization and combined with floaters in the medium. After centrifugation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and stored as a pellet at −80 °C. On the day of the analysis, cell pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer and centrifuged to remove debris, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with 50 μm N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AFC (7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin) for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader with excitation of 360 ± 40 and emission of 530 ± 25. 5 × 103 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well plate in 75 μl of RPMI containing 2% FBS and 25 mmHepes, pH 7.5. After 24 h, first GW4869 was added in 15 μl of medium/well and incubated for 30 min and then TNF was added in 10 μl/well (total volume of 100 μl/well). At the indicated time points, 25 μl of MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h. Subsequently, cells were solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (20% SDS (w/v), 50%N,N-dimethylformamide (v/v), 0.8% acetic acid (v/v), pH 4.6–4.8) to each well. The production of the formazan dye was quantitated by measuring the OD at 595 nm with a multiwell plate reader. We have noticed that the efficacy of TNF to induce morphological changes was significantly slower in experiments carried out in the 96-well plates (as for the MTT) compared with those performed in 10-cm Petri dishes (all other experiments). At the indicated time points, plates were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and floaters in the medium and from the washes were collected by centrifugation. Adherent cells were scraped in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml each of chymotrypsin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). After combining with floaters, cells were incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, and supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosolic fractions that were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations from postnuclear lysates and cytosols were determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Equal amounts of protein, usually 80 μg, were resolved by 7, 12, and 15% SDS-PAGE for analysis of PARP and caspases 6 and 9, respectively. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the proteins were incubated with anti-PARP rabbit polyclonal IgG (1:2500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-human caspase 6 monoclonal IgG (2 μg/ml; Pharmingen), or anti-caspase 9 rabbit polyclonal IgG (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondary anti-rabbi"
https://openalex.org/W2048870960,"Binary supermassive black holes are produced by galactic mergers as the black holes from the two galaxies fall to the center of the merged system and form a bound pair. The two black holes will eventually coalesce in an enormous burst of gravitational radiation. Here we show that the orientation of a black hole's spin axis would change dramatically even in a minor merger, leading to a sudden flip in the direction of any associated jet. We identify the winged or X-type radio sources with galaxies in which this has occurred. The inferred coalescence rate is similar to the overall galaxy merger rate, implying that of the order of one merger event per year could be detected by gravitational wave interferometers."
https://openalex.org/W2036265947,"Methylation of the N-terminal region of histones was first described more than 35 years ago, but its biological significance has remained unclear. Proposed functions range from transcriptional regulation to the higher order packing of chromatin in progress of mitotic condensation. Primarily because of the recent discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and Suv39h1, which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus, this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest. In the past, investigations concerning the biological significance of histone methylation were largely limited because of a lack of simple and sensitive analytical procedures for detecting this modification. The present work investigated the methylation pattern of histone H4 both in different mammalian organs of various ages and in cell lines by applying mass spectrometric analysis and a newly developed hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatographic method enabling the simultaneous separation of methylated and acetylated forms, which obviates the need to work with radioactive materials. In rat kidney and liver the dimethylated lysine 20 was found to be the main methylation product, whereas the monomethyl derivative was present in much smaller amounts. In addition, for the first time a trimethylated form of lysine 20 of H4 was found in mammalian tissue. A significant increase in this trimethylated histone H4 was detected in organs of animals older than 30 days, whereas the amounts of mono- and dimethylated forms did not essentially change in organs from young (10 days old) or old animals (30 and 450 days old). Trimethylated H4 was also detected in transformed cells; although it was present in only trace amounts in logarithmically growing cells, we found an increase in trimethylated lysine 20 in cells in the stationary phase.

Paik K.S. Protein Methylation. John Wiley & Sons, New York1980Google Scholar, 2Wold F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 783-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). During the last several years, studies on the methylation of proteins have yielded many important observations. While these studies were under way, it was generally realized that protein methylation is far more complex and has more ramifications than originally assumed. Methylation is also a well known posttranslational modification reaction of histone proteins on lysine and/or arginine residues with a site selectivity for lysine methylation at specific positions in the N termini of histones H3 and H4. In combination with other posttranslational modifications, i.e. acetylation and phosphorylation, methylation seems to play a significant role in regulating nuclear functions. Thus, it has been suggested that distinct combinations of covalent histone modifications, also referred to as “histone code,” provide a specific mark on the hydrophilic histone tails, which, when read by other proteins, cause specific downstream events finally inducing transitions in chromatin structure (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6532) Google Scholar, 4Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). These chromatin changes are essential prerequisites for important cellular processes such as transcription, replication, recombination, etc. In contrast to acetylation and phosphorylation, which represent short term signals of the histone code, histone methylation is regarded as a more long term epigenetic mark with a relatively low turnover of the methyl group (5Jenuwein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 266-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Histone H3 is typically methylated in vivo at lysines 4, 9, and 27 (6) and most probably also at arginine 17 (7). Concerning the biological significance of H3 methylation, recent papers have shown that methylation of lysine 4 and arginine 17 is correlated with active gene expression, whereas lysine 9 methylation is linked to gene silencing (7Bauer U.M. Daujat S. Nielsen S.J. Nightingale K. Kouzarides T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Boggs B.A. Cheung P. Heard E. Spector D.L. Chinault A.C. Allis C.D. Nat.

Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Each of the lysine residues can accept up to three methyl groups forming mono-, di-, and trimethylated derivatives, thus adding a further potential complexity to the posttranslational status of histone H3 (12Wu R.S. Panusz H.T. Hatch C.L. Bonner W.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 201-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 13Sung M.T. Harford J. Bundman M. Vidalakis G. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The detailed biological role of mono-, di-, and trimethylation, however, is completely unknown to date. Histone H4, also a major acceptor of methyl groups, was found to be methylated at positions 3 (arginine) (14Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Koh S.S., Ma, H. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J.

A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In contrast to histone H3 lysine methylation, H4 lysine 20 is described as being maximally dimethylated in mammals (16Annunziato A.T. Eason M.B. Perry C.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2916-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To date, very little is known about the biological outcome of methylated H4. An increase in H4 methylation has been linked to the termination of liver growth in rats, and when methylated H4 was found to be present in low amounts in active chromatin it was proposed that this covalent modification may not be associated with transcription. A recent paper (17Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) reported arginine 3 of H4 as the target for methyltransferase PRMT1 in vivo andin vitro and assigned this specific site an important function in transcriptional regulation. To elucidate the biological importance of histone H4 methylation, the methylation pattern of this core histone was investigated in cells of various origins. Unlike histone modification by acetylation or phosphorylation, histone methylation does not greatly influence the charge of individual amino acids, thus making the electrophoretic separation of distinct methylated proteins from each other and from the unmethylated parent proteins a problematic part in histone analysis. Until now, methylated amino acids have often been determined in protein and tissue hydrolysates using amino acid analyzers and through cells radiolabeled with [methyl-3H]methionine. To avoid these labor-intensive and time-consuming methods as well as the use of radioactivity, a high resolving chromatographic method was developed for separation and precise quantification of mono-, di-, and trimethylated H4 histones, including their distinct acetylated forms. Applying this procedure, we found for the first time in vivoevidence that lysine 20 of histone H4 is not only mono- and dimethylated but also trimethylated. A significant increase in this trimethylated form was observed in rat kidney and liver during aging. Trimethylated H4 was also detected in small amounts in logarithmically growing human tumor cells, i.e. Raji and K562. The proportion of trimethylated histone H4 increased when the cells were accumulated in the stationary phase. The possible biological significance of age-related accumulation of trimethylated forms of histone H4 is discussed in the light of our results. Sodium perchlorate, triethylamine (TEA),1 acetonitrile (ACN), and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck. Rat kidney and liver were obtained from several Sprague-Dawley rats aged 10, 30, 300, and 450 days. Raji and K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in the presence of 5% CO2. The cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 104 cells/ml and harvested after 3 days in the log phase or after 7 days to accumulate the cells in stationary phase. The core histones were extracted from organs and cells with sulfuric acid (0.2 m) according to the procedure of Lindner et al. (18Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The nuclear pellet was extracted in a first step with 5% HClO4 (v/v) to remove the H1 histones. In a second step the pellet was extracted with 1 volume of 0.4 mH2SO4 and 4 volumes of 0.2 mH2SO4 for 1 h with occasional vortexing. H2SO4-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and soluble proteins were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a 20% (w/v) final concentration. The precipitated core histones were left on ice for 60 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, washed with cold acidified acetone and with pure acetone, dissolved in 1 ml of water containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until used for HPLC. The equipment used consisted of a 127 Solvent Module and a model 166 UV-visible region detector (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The effluent was monitored at 210 nm, and the peaks were recorded using Beckman System Gold software. The solvent compositions are expressed as v/v throughout this text. The separation of core histones was performed on an Ultrapore RPSC C3 column (250 × 10-mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; 30-nm pore size; end-capped; Beckman Instruments). The lyophilized proteins were dissolved in water containing 0.2 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and samples of ∼600 μg were injected onto the column. The histone sample was chromatographed within 60 min at a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A-solvent B (60:40) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 40 to 55% B during 40 min and from 55% to 100% B during 20 min. The histone H4 fraction was collected and, after adding 50 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m), lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The peptide samples obtained after digestion of H4 histones by endoproteinase Glu-C were separated using a Nucleosil 300–5 C18 column (150 × 2-mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle pore size; end-capped; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Samples of ∼100 μg were injected onto the column. Chromatography was performed within 65 min at a constant flow of 0.15 ml/min with an acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A-solvent B (75:25) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 85% acetonitrile and 0.093% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 25 to 50% during 65 min. The fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m), lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Histone H4 peptide fractions obtained by endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage were injected onto a PepMap C18 column (150 × 1-mm inner diameter; 3-μm particle size; ICT, Vienna, Austria). Samples of ∼3 μg were chromatographed within 55 min at a constant flow of 35 μl/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A-solvent B (90:10) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 85% acetonitrile and 0.093% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 10 to 40% during 45 min and from 40 to 100% during 20 min. The fractions were collected and, after adding 10 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2m), lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The histone fraction H4 (150 μg) isolated by RP-HPLC was further separated on a SynChropak CM300 column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter; 6.5-μm particle size; 30 nm pore size; Agilent Technologies, Vienna, Austria) at 30 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a multi-step gradient starting at solvent A-solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0; solvent B: 65% acetonitrile, 0.015 mTEA/H3PO4, pH 3.0 and 0.68 mNaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 10% B during 2 min, from 10 to 40% during 30 min, and then maintained at 40% during 10 min. The isolated protein fractions were desalted using RP-HPLC. The histone fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after adding 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2m), lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The peptide fraction I (∼120 μg) obtained by RP-HPLC of endoproteinase Glu-C- digested H4 histone was further separated by HILIC using the separation conditions described above. Whole histone H4 (∼100 μg) obtained by RP-HPLC fractionation was digested withStaphylococcus aureus V8 Protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:20 w/w) in 50 μl of 25 mmNH4HCO3 buffer (pH 4.0) for 1 h at room temperature. The digest was subjected to RP-HPLC. N-terminal peptides obtained by Glu-C digestion were further cleaved with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:5 w/w) in 15 μl of 25 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) for 2 h at 37 °C. The digest was subjected to RP-HPLC. Peptide sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Inc. model 492 Procise protein sequenator. Determination of the molecular masses of individual histone H4 peptides obtained after protease digest was carried out with an electrospray ion-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) technique using a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA). The samples (5–10 μg) were dissolved in 50% aqueous methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and injected into the ion source. Sulfuric acid-extracted core histones were fractionated using RP-HPLC with a semi-preparative Ultrapore 300–5 C3 column and a two-step water/acetonitrile gradient. An example, the separation of core histones from rat kidney, is given in Fig.1 A. The identity and purity of the fractions obtained were checked by means of SDS- and acid-urea-PAGE (data not shown). The histone H4 fraction eluted at about 41 min as a single peak despite the presence of a number of distinctly modified forms. The fact that various posttranslationally modified forms of one and the same protein coelute in RP-HPLC with its unmodified parent protein has previously been demonstrated for several histone proteins (18Lindner H.

Chromatogr. 2000; 744: 33-46Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using hydrophilic interaction chromatography, prompted us to also evaluate the potential utility of this technique for the separation of methylated proteins. Therefore, the histone H4 fraction obtained in the RP-HPLC run (Fig. 1 A) was subjected to HILIC. Under optimized conditions (pH 3.0 and 30 °C) using a SynChropak CM 300 column with a triethylammonium phosphate buffer system, a linear sodium perchlorate (0–0.68 m), and an inverse acetonitrile gradient (70–65%), the H4 fraction was separated into two major and some minor peaks (Fig. 1 B). In a first attempt the H4 histone fraction obtained after the initial RP chromatography (Fig. 1 A) was used to localize the domain responsible for the occurrence of multiple H4 forms in HILIC. For this purpose the H4 fraction was treated with endoproteinase Glu-C, an enzyme specifically cleaving proteins under appropriate conditions C-terminally of glutamic acid. As expected, the fragmentation yielded several peptides that were separated and isolated by RP-HPLC (Fig.2). To identify these peptide fractions, amino acid sequencing and ESI-MS analyses were performed. As illustrated in Table I, fraction I-II (eluting at about 60 min) consisted of an H4 peptide ranging from residues 1 to 63. Fraction III-IV (eluting at 48 min) and fraction IV (42 min) consisted of C-terminal fragments (residues 64–102 and 75–102, respectively). Fraction II (30 min) was a pure fraction (residues 54–63), whereas fraction I consisted of two N-terminal fragments (residues 1–52 and 1–53, respectively). Although the peptide containing residues 64–74 (designated as peptide III in TableI) should also be present, it could not be detected. The subsequent HILIC analysis of the peptide fraction II and fractions III and IV revealed that both fragments were homogeneous and, consequentially, excluded as possible sites for H4 modification (data not shown). Fraction I, however, analyzed by HILIC was heterogeneous and consisted of several subfractions (Fig. 3; designated 1′–6′); this chromatogram closely resembled that obtained by HILIC analysis of undigested H4 shown in Fig. 1 B. To verify that fractions 1′–6′ in Fig. 3 indeed correspond to the same intact forms of the molecule, ESI-MS analyses of peaks 1–6 (TableII) and fractions 1′-6-′ (TableIII) were performed. As can be seen from Tables II and III, similar mass differences were obtained. This result clearly indicated that under these chromatographic conditions the same modifications cause separation of multiple forms and that, furthermore, the structural alterations must take place in the N-terminal region of the H4 protein. Identification of peptide fractions 1′–6′ is shown in Table III. Whereas the mass of the blocked N-terminal peptide 1–52 of histone H4 was calculated to be 5636.7 Da, we found for fractions 6′, 5′, and 4′ significantly higher masses of roughly 14, 28, and 42 Da, respectively. Because a mass difference of 14 Da corresponds to a methyl group, we conclude that H4 peptide fragments 6′, 5′, and 4′ represent mono-, di-, and trimethylated forms, which were clearly separated under HILIC conditions. Fractions 3′, 2′, and 1′ differed from 6′, 5′, and 4′ by about 43 Da each, which very well matches with the mass of an acetyl group. Fractions 1′, 2′, and 3′, therefore, are the corresponding monoacetylated forms of fractions 4′, 5′, and 6′. Furthermore, it should be noted that ESI-MS analysis obviously revealed a contamination of fractions 3′ and 6′ with another peptide fragment (Table III). Whereas fraction 6′ was contaminated by the prolonged unacetylated but dimethylated N-terminal peptide 1–53, fraction 3′ was a mixture of the monoacetylated fragments 1–52 (monomethylated) and 1–53 (dimethylated). This finding also easily explains the slight differences in the relative amounts of HILIC fractions 1′–6′ (Fig. 3) as compared with that of the corresponding undigested H4 fractions (Fig. 1 B).Table IPeptide patterns obtained after endoproteinase Glu-C and Lys-C digestion of rat kidney histone H4 Open table in a new tab Figure 3HILIC separation of peptide fraction I obtained with RP-HPLC of endoproteinase Glu-C-digested rat H4 histone.

To precisely determine the methylation sites in histone H4, the HILIC fractions (designated 4′–6′) shown in Fig. 3 were isolated and desalted using RP-HPLC. To localize the exact position of the methyl groups, the N-terminal peptides were further cleaved with endoproteinase Lys-C. The digests were analyzed by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS using a 150 × 1.0-mm inner diameter microbore column. In each case, seven peptide fragments were detected (Table I). However, only the three fragments 17–31 revealed the mass differences expected. The peptide derived from fraction 4′ exhibited a molecular mass of 1876.0 Da, that from fraction 5′ exhibited a molecular mass of 1861.7 Da, and that from fraction 6′ exhibited a molecular mass of 1847.9 Da, indicating that the analyzed fragments were tri-, di-, and monomethylated. From these data, therefore, a methylation of arginine 3, which is known from the literature (14Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Brame C.J. Caldwell J.A. Koh S.S., Ma, H. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F.

To prove our assumption that lysine 20 is trimethylated and also to eliminate other arginine and lysine residues present at positions 17, 19, 23, and 31 as possible candidates for methylation, Edman degradation of the three peptides was carried out (data not shown). Sequence analysis confirmed that HILIC fraction 6′ contained monomethyllysine, fraction 5′ contained dimethyllysine, and fraction 4′ contained trimethyllysine at position 20 of histone H4. Peptide fragments 3′, 2′, and 1′ are the analogously methylated peptides, however, bearing an acetyl group. It must be mentioned that in the case of digestion of the monoacetylated fragments 1–52 (53) the acetyl group bound to lysine 16 inhibits cleavage at that position. The cleavage occurs N-terminally of lysine 12, yielding peptides 13–31 having an acetyl group at lysine 16. It should be noted that the appearance of a trimethylated lysine at position 20 was unexpected, because in contrast to histone H3, no evidence for a trimethylation of mammalian H4 has been found to date (24Duerre J.A.

Preliminary data of H4 from very young rats, however, indicated a separation pattern (Fig. 4 B) different from the one shown in Fig. 1 B.

Here, we show that heat allodynia is functionally and neuroanatomically distinct from normal heat pain. We subtracted positron emission tomography scans obtained during painful heating of normal skin from scans during equally intense but normally innocuous heating of capsaicin-treated skin. This comparison reveals the specific activation of a medial thalamic pathway to the frontal lobe during heat allodynia. The results suggest that different central pathways mediate the intensity and certain qualitative aspects of pain. In making this differentiation, the brain recognizes unique physiological features of different painful conditions, thus permitting adaptive responses to different pain states."

In addition to playing a key role in adipogenesis, Wnt signaling protects against apoptosis in cells exposed to cellular or chemical stress (12Bournat J.C. Brown A.M. Soler A.P. J. Neurosci.

For example, ectopic expression of Wnt-1 in Rat-1 cells inhibits apoptosis in response to vincristine or vinblastine through a PKB/Akt-independent mechanism (13Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Furthermore, low serum conditions fail to induce apoptosis in PC-12 cells that express Wnt-1 (12Bournat J.C. Brown A.M. Soler A.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of GSK-3 and PI3K each partially reversed this effect, suggesting that the cytoprotective effects of Wnt-1 are mediated through direct Wnt signaling and Wnt-induced gene expression (12Bournat J.C.

Serum-starved 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo apoptosis, but fully differentiated adipocytes are resistant, perhaps because of increased expression of Bcl-2 and neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (15Magun R. Boone D.L. Tsang B.K. Sorisky A. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1998; 22: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Supplementation of serum-free medium with IGF-I protects preadipocytes against apoptosis, indicating that this growth factor impacts this process (16Gagnon A. Dods P. Roustan-Delatour N. Chen C.S.

Recently, it has been shown that this signaling pathway has an important antiapoptotic function. However, the molecular mechanism for the protective effects of Wnt have only been partially characterized. Herein, we demonstrate that Wnt-1 induces expression of antiapoptotic genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes such as IGF-I and IGF-II, which allows these cells to resist apoptosis in response to serum deprivation. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% calf serum (Sigma) (17Green H.

Dominant negative TCF-4 (ΔN31 TCF-4) and dominant stable β-catenin (S33Y β-cat), each in the neomycin-resistant vector, pPGS, were provided by Eric Fearon (University of Michigan). Mouse recombinant IGF-I and IGF-II and human recombinant IGFBP-4 were purchased from R&D Systems. Wortmannin (Calbiochem) and LY294002 (New England Biolabs) were used to inhibit PI3K. Cells analyzed for apoptosis by TUNEL were grown on 18-m-square glass coverslips. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% sodium citrate, 1% Triton X-100, and nicked DNA was end-labeled with fluorescein-conjugated dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then counter-stained with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted on slides, and six random fields for each treatment were analyzed using a Nikon TE200 fluorescent microscope. The total cell number (Hoechst 33342-labeled nuclei) and apoptotic cell number (fluorescein-labeled nuclei) from each field were used to calculate the apoptotic index for each treatment, which is defined as: (no. of fluorescein-labeled nuclei)/(no. of Hoechst-labeled nuclei) × 100. Following TUNEL, 6–12 random microscopic fields/treatment were photographed digitally, and image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Differences between treatment groups were evaluated with Student's t test and were considered statistically significant at p < 0.01. The use of DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression in 3T3-L1 cells has been described elsewhere (11Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Gerin I. DeRose P.M. Bajnok L. Longo K.A. Misek D.E. Kuick R. Hanash S.M.

Total RNA was isolated with RNA Stat60 (Tel-Test “B”, Inc.) from 3T3-L1 cells infected with either pLNCX or pLNCX-Wnt-1. RNA was further purified with RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). Preparation of cRNA and hybridization and scanning of the mouse genome U74A arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). Arrays were scanned at 3 mm using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). Expression levels for ∼10,000 genes were given as arbitrary units, and the unit ratio of Wnt-1 to pLNCX was regarded as the Wnt-1-mediated fold induction for each gene. Total RNA was isolated from confluent 3T3-L1 control cells (infected with pLNCX) or Wnt-1 expressing cells (infected with pLNCX-Wnt-1), and reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was performed for IGF-I (forward primer, 5′-aaatgaccgcacctgcaataaaga-3′; reverse primer, 5′-atcctgcggtgatgtggcattttc-3′), IGF-II (forward primer, 5′-tcgggcaaggggatctcagcagttcta-3′; reverse primer, 5′-agtttgggcggctattgttgttctcag-3′), and GAPDH (forward primer, 5′-tgtgtccgtcgtggatctga-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cctgcttcaccaccttcttgat-3′) using Amplitaq (Applera Corp). Conditions for PCR were: an initial denaturation step (96 °C, 4 min) followed by 30 amplification steps (96 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min) and a final elongation (72 °C, 10 min). Cloned PCR products were sequenced to confirm the specificity of these primers. PCR products were separated by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide and UV excitation. Cells were washed with ice cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in the following lysis buffer: 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin-A (Sigma)). Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblots were performed with antibodies specific for Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and phospho-Forkhead (Ser-256) according to manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Several cell types that normally undergo apoptosis in response to cellular stress are protected by ectopic expression of Wnt-1 (12Bournat J.C. Brown A.M. Soler A.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To determine whether Wnt-1 signaling protects 3T3-L1 preadipocytes from apoptosis, stable cell lines that expressed Wnt-1 or empty vector (pLNCX) were cultured in serum or serum-free media for 24 h, and subsequently evaluated for apoptosis with TUNEL. Control and Wnt-1 cells incubated in the presence of serum showed very low rates of apoptosis (<1%; Fig.1). Although control cells incubated in the absence of serum had a high rate of apoptosis (∼20%), apoptosis in response to serum deprivation was largely blocked by Wnt-1 (∼3.5%). Thus, Wnt-1 signaling inhibits apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes under serum-free conditions. Although Wnt proteins can signal through numerous pathways (6Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), we assessed whether the canonical Wnt signaling pathway mediates the antiapoptotic response. Wnt-1 signaling negatively regulates the activity of the enzyme GSK-3. To test whether the antiapoptotic effect of Wnt-1 is mediated through inhibition of GSK-3, cells were serum-deprived in the presence of the GSK-3 inhibitor lithium. Inhibition of GSK-3 caused a profound reduction in the level of apoptosis in serum-deprived cells compared with controls (Fig.2), suggesting that Wnt-1 inhibits apoptosis through activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Given that GSK-3 mediates the effects of Wnt-1 on apoptosis, we investigated whether proteins downstream of GSK-3, such as β-catenin and TCF-4, were also involved. We hypothesized that a stable mutant of β-catenin, which cannot be phosphorylated and degraded by the proteasomal complex, would block apoptosis. Conversely, we hypothesized that a dominant negative form of TCF-4, capable of interacting with β-catenin but incapable of binding DNA, would promote apoptosis. To test these hypotheses, we ectopically expressed, in 3T3-L1 cells, a dominant stable form of β-catenin (S33Y) or a dominant negative form of the transcription factor TCF-4. In response to serum deprivation, both Wnt-1 and S33Y-β-catenin protected cells from apoptosis, whereas dnTCF-4 promoted the effects of serum deprivation on apoptosis (Fig. 3). Regulation of apoptosis by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway raises the possibility that the effects of Wnt-1 on apoptosis are mediated through the transcription of antiapoptotic genes. To test the hypothesis that Wnt-1 promotes the expression of genes that are themselves antiapoptotic, we performed microarray analyses on RNA from 3T3-L1 cells infected with control retrovirus or a retrovirus that contains Wnt-1. Of the ∼10,000 genes that were screened, those genes in which the mRNA level was increased as a result of ectopic Wnt-1 expression were scrutinized further. Table I contains genes that were positively regulated by Wnt-1 expression and have demonstrated antiapoptotic effects in the literature. BothIGF-I and IGF-II were elevated by Wnt-1, and this was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (Fig.4). IGF-I is antiapoptotic in 3T3-L1 cells (16Gagnon A. Dods P. Roustan-Delatour N. Chen C.S. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas IGF-II is an autocrine survival factor for myoblasts (18Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Microarray data for genes up-regulated by Wnt-1 and involved in apoptosis. Each gene is accompanied by its GenBank™ accession number, its fold induction by Wnt-1, and pertinent references. In addition to the IGFs, several other regulators of apoptosis were induced (Table I), including the multidrug resistance protein (MDR1), Wnt-induced secreted protein-1 and -2 (WISP-1, -2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and proliferins-2 and -3. The ability of Wnt-1 to protect against apoptosis may be through induction of one or more genes involved in cellular growth, differentiation, and survival. IGF-I protects 3T3-L1 cells against apoptosis during serum deprivation (16Gagnon A. Dods P. Roustan-Delatour N. Chen C.S. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Niesler C.U. Urso B. Prins J.B. Siddle K. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and Wnt-1 induces expression of IGF-I and IGF-II (Table I, Fig. 4). Thus, we hypothesized that Wnt-1 inhibits apoptosis by inducing expression and secretion of IGFs, which act through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism to activate the antiapoptotic PKB/Akt pathway. Conditioned media from Wnt-1 cells strongly stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and its downstream target, Forkhead (Fig.5 A). Phosphorylation of Forkhead inhibits the activity of this proapoptotic transcription factor (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P., Hu, L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). The ability of conditioned media from Wnt-1 cells to stimulate phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, and Forkhead was inhibited after preincubation of conditioned media with IGF-binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4), indicating that IGFs mediate the effects of Wnt-1 on PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Consistent with this observation, the level of phosphorylation stimulated by Wnt-1 conditioned media was similar to that induced by 1.34 nm IGF-I (Fig. 5, A andB). Furthermore, IGF-II also stimulates PKB/Akt phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 5 B). Our examination of PKB/Akt in control and Wnt-1 cells indicates that phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in serum-free medium is recovered more rapidly in Wnt-1-expressing preadipocytes, with substantial phosphorylation observed as early as 3 h (Fig. 5 C). Binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to the IGF-I receptor triggers a signaling cascade that includes activation of PI3K, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), and ultimately PKB/Akt (21Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Active PKB/Akt phosphorylates several target proteins whose activation (e.g. Iκ-B kinase) or inactivation (e.g. Bcl-2-antagonist of cell death, Forkhead, caspase 9) promotes cell survival (21Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Given the potent IGF activity in conditioned media of 3T3-L1 cells that ectopically express Wnt-1, we hypothesized that the survival of these cells during serum starvation might be PI3K-dependent. Consistent with this hypothesis, 3T3-L1 cells that ectopically express Wnt-1 have elevated levels of apoptosis in the presence of the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 6). However, the intermediate levels of apoptosis in the PI3K inhibitor-treated cells suggests that other mechanisms, perhaps direct activation of antiapoptotic signaling pathways by Wnt-1, may also be involved. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Wnt-1 and activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway promotes the survival of 3T3-L1 cells during serum deprivation. Our experimental approach to elucidate the mechanism of this antiapoptotic response was to 1) ectopically express different components of the Wnt-1 signaling pathway in order to recapitulate or block the effects of Wnt-1 signaling on apoptosis, 2) perform DNA microarray analyses to establish whether the expression of antiapoptotic genes is increased by Wnt-1 signaling, and 3) assess the ability of target genes to activate antiapoptotic pathways in 3T3-L1 cells. We found that activation of Wnt signaling by inhibition of GSK-3 or expression of a gain-of-function mutant of β-catenin inhibited apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of Wnt signaling with a dominant negative TCF-4 potentiated apoptosis. These results highlight the importance of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the regulation of preadipocyte apoptosis. Microarray analysis identified several candidate genes induced by Wnt-1 and that have known effects on antiapoptosis. Two of these genes, IGF-I andIGF-II, were characterized further. The secretion of IGFs by 3T3-L1 cells that ectopically express Wnt-1, and the ability of IGFs to activate the PKB/Akt pathway was confirmed using the IGF-neutralizing protein, IGFBP-4. Finally, a role for the IGF-I signaling pathway in the ability of Wnt-1 to inhibit apoptosis was established using PI3K inhibitors. The ability of Wnt-1 to inhibit apoptosis has been explored in several cell types (12Bournat J.C. Brown A.M. Soler A.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 13Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of either dominant negative TCF-4, or a gain-of-function mutant of β-catenin, has profound effects on the survival of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3) and Rat-1 cells (13Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) consistent with their roles as downstream effectors of Wnt-1. Another member of the TCF family of transcription factors, LEF-1, is involved in antiapoptosis and Wnt-mediated proliferation in B-lymphocytes. In LEF-1 nullizygous mice, B-lymphocytes have increased apoptosis, perhaps as a result of increased Fas and c-Myc expression (22Reya T. O'Riordan M. Okamura R. Devaney E. Willert K. Nusse R. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 2000; 13: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Treatment with lithium increased proliferation of wild type B-lymphocytes, whereas Wnt-3a was unable to induce cell proliferation in B-lymphocytes from LEF-1 nullizygous animals (22Reya T. O'Riordan M. Okamura R. Devaney E. Willert K. Nusse R. Grosschedl R. Immunity. 2000; 13: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data define a universal mechanism by which Wnt-mediated gene expression influences both antiapoptosis and proliferation in a variety of cell types. Through DNA microarray analysis, we have identified several candidate genes that are induced by Wnt-1 and are antiapoptotic (Table I). We focused our efforts on two of these genes, IGF-I andIGF-II. In particular, IGF-I acts through a PI3K-dependent mechanism to protect 3T3-L1 cells from apoptosis during serum deprivation (16Gagnon A. Dods P. Roustan-Delatour N. Chen C.S. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). IGFs activate antiapoptotic pathways in a number of cell types and tissues. The antiapoptotic kinase PKB/Akt is phosphorylated and activated in response to IGF-I in a PI3K-dependent manner, suggesting that PKB/Akt may be central to IGF-I-mediated survival in 3T3-L1 cells (16Gagnon A. Dods P. Roustan-Delatour N. Chen C.S. Sorisky A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that IGF-II also stimulates PKB/Akt phosphorylation at concentrations similar to those of IGF-I. Interestingly, both IGF-I and IGF-II have been shown to influence β-catenin stability through inhibition of its phosphorylation and can therefore influence β-catenin-dependent gene expression (23Morali O.G. Delmas V. Moore R. Jeanney C. Thiery J.P. Larue L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4942-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Playford M.P. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Macaulay V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggesting that Wnt-1 might have both primary effects and secondary effects (through IGF signaling) on gene expression. Another Wnt-1-inducible gene, COX-2 (Table I), is an isoform of prostaglandin synthase that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonate to prostaglandin E2 (25Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of COX-2 is associated with tumor promotion through several mechanisms, including inhibition of apoptosis (26Dempke W. Rie C. Grothey A. Schmoll H.J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The regulation of COX-2expression by Wnt signaling was first described in Wnt-1-transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells (27Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Wnt-1 in mammary epithelial cells was associated with stabilization of β-catenin, increased transcription of COX-2 mRNA, and increased synthesis of PGE2 (27Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of Wnt-1 on COX-2 expression is likely to be mediated by the transcription factor PEA3, which is positively regulated by ectopic Wnt-1 expression and transactivates the COX-2 promoter (28Howe L.R. Crawford H.C. Subbaramaiah K. Hassell J.A. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20108-20115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two members of the Wnt-1-induced secreted protein family, WISP-1 and WISP-2, were also identified in our screen. WISP-1 is known to activate the PKB/Akt pathway and block apoptosis (29Su F. Overholtzer M. Besser D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the aberrant expression of WISPs may influence the growth of certain tumors (30Pennica D. Swanson T.A. Welsh J.W. Roy M.A. Lawrence D.A. Lee J. Brush J. Taneyhill L.A. Deuel B. Lew M. Watanabe C. Cohen R.L. Melhem M.F. Finley G.G. Quirke P. Goddard A.D. Hillan K.J. Gurney A.L. Botstein D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14717-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that both COX-2 and WISP-1 are strong effectors of Wnt-1-mediated antiapoptosis (14You Z. Saims D. Chen S. Zhang Z. Guttridge D.C. Guan K.L. MacDougald O.A. Brown A.M. Evan G. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), strengthening the hypothesis that Wnt-1 can induce the expression of several proteins that collectively promote cell survival through the suppression of multiple apoptotic signaling pathways. MDR1, also induced by Wnt-1, is a glycoprotein that was first identified in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Its expression is associated with the ability of these cells to survive treatment with colchicine (31Juliano R.L. Ling V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 455: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2884) Google Scholar). Since that early discovery, increased MDR1expression has been recognized as a hallmark of chemotherapy resistance in transformed cells (32Persidis A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 94-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Appropriately, the regulation ofMDR1 expression has immense clinical relevance in the field of cancer treatment. The fact that Wnt-1 confers cellular resistance and survival in response to the chemotoxic drugs vincristine and vinblastine has been reported elsewhere (13Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this resistance is TCF-4-dependent, suggesting that it is linked to Wnt-1-induced gene expression rather than the direct activation of antiapoptotic pathways by Wnt-1 signaling (13Chen S. Guttridge D.C. You Z. Zhang Z. Fribley A. Mayo M.W. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The possibility that at least some of the effects of Wnt-1 on antiapoptosis in response to chemotherapy may be related to increased MDR1 expression and active efflux of toxic compounds from cells warrants further investigation. It has been long recognized that Wnt-1 is a proto-oncogene activated in mouse mammary tissue following infection with mouse mammary tumor virus (5Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and also that Wnt-1 has potent effects on other oncogenes to induce transformation of breast tissue (14You Z.

Although c-Myc expression can transform cells and enhance cell growth, it also promotes apoptosis in these cells. Expression of Wnt-1 alleviates the effects of c-Myc on apoptosis (14You Z. Saims D. Chen S. Zhang Z. Guttridge D.C. Guan K.L. MacDougald O.A. Brown A.M. Evan G. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Wnt-1 induced genes,COX-2 and WISP-1, are both able to mimic the effects of Wnt-1 on antiapoptosis (14You Z. Saims D. Chen S. Zhang Z. Guttridge D.C. Guan K.L. MacDougald O.A.

Saims D. Chen S. Zhang Z. Guttridge D.C. Guan K.L. MacDougald O.A. Brown A.M. Evan G. Kitajewski J. Wang C.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A disruption of this balance, leading to either hyperplasia or a loss of programmed cell death, or a combination of the two, is a key step leading to oncogenesis. One focus of cancer research for the last several years has been the discovery of genes that impact normal tissue development and apoptosis. We have presented novel and previously reported genes in which expression is increased by Wnt-1 and which may mediate antiapoptosis in both normal tissue and tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2048443355,"Aplysia VAP-33 (VAMP-associated protein) has been previously proposed to be involved in the control of neurotransmitter release. Here, we show that a Drosophila homolog of VAP-33, DVAP-33A, is localized to neuromuscular junctions. Loss of DVAP-33A causes a severe decrease in the number of boutons and a corresponding increase in bouton size. Conversely, presynaptic overexpression of DVAP-33A induces an increase in the number of boutons and a decrease in their size. Gain-of-function experiments show that the presynaptic dose of DVAP-33A tightly modulates the number of synaptic boutons. Our data also indicate that the presynaptic microtubule architecture is severely compromised in DVAP-33A mutants. We propose that a DVAP-33A-mediated interaction between microtubules and presynaptic membrane plays a pivotal role during bouton budding."

This change in iron metabolism contributes to the development of the anemia of inflammation. MTP1, the duodenal enterocyte basolateral iron exporter, is also expressed in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and is likely to be involved in iron recycling of these cells. In this study, we use a lipopolysaccharide model of the acute inflammation in the mouse and demonstrate that MTP1 expression in RES cells of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow is down-regulated by inflammation. The down-regulation of splenic expression of MTP1 by inflammation was also observed in a Leishmania donovani model of chronic infection. The response of MTP1 to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) requires signaling through the LPS receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). In mice lacking TLR4, MTP1 expression is not altered in response to LPS. In addition, mice lacking tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1a respond appropriately to LPS with down-regulation of MTP1, despite hyporesponsiveness to tumor necrosis factor-α signaling, suggesting that this cytokine may not be required for the LPS effect.

A normal individual will absorb ∼1 mg of elemental iron a day through the duodenum, to match an equivalent daily physiologic loss. The plasma turnover of iron is ∼10–20 mg a day and one source of this pool is iron released from the reticuloendothelial system (RES).1 Macrophages of the RES release iron from phagocytosed erythrocytes and return it to the circulation for reuse by the erythroid compartment of the body. Difficulties in environmental iron acquisition limit the growth of microorganisms and some of the major virulence factors associated with bacterial infections are genes encoding more efficient means for acquiring iron from the host. One defense against invading microorganisms involves the sequestration of iron in body compartments not readily accessible to these invaders. The acute phase response to infection is characterized by a number of changes in iron metabolism including acute declines in serum iron, increases in the rate of serum iron disappearance, a decline in serum iron turnover, sequestration of the metal in the RES, and a decline in intestinal iron absorption (reviewed in Refs. 1Patruta S.I.

In this paper we report that MTP1 expression in the cells of the RES is regulated by acute inflammation. This inflammation-mediated control of MTP1 expression in the RES may be one component responsible for iron sequestration in the RES in both acute and chronic inflammatory states. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5, iron-dextran, and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were purchased from Sigma and resuspended in saline. Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Rat anti-mouse F4/80 antigen antibody was obtained from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). The production of the rabbit anti-MTP1 polyclonal antibody has been previously described (31Abboud S. Haile D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Alexa dye-conjugated goat anti-rat and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Goat anti-rat/mouse TNF-α was from Calbiochem(La Jolla, CA). For in vivo work anti-TNF-α (clone MP3-XT6) was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Unless otherwise indicated C57/BL6 mice aged 8–12 weeks of either sex were used for the experiments described. LPS, PDTC, and all cytokines were prepared in a 100-μl volume of saline and given intraperitoneally. Iron-dextran was given in 50–100 μl of saline in one or two thigh muscles. Turpentine was administered to anesthetized animals as a 50–100-μl subcutaneous injection into the back between the scapulas. Unless noted otherwise, a minimum of 4 animals were used per experimental condition. Low iron mouse chow was purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Six-week-old male BALB/c mice were infected intravenously with 1 × 106 Leishmania donovani (MHOM/S.D./001S-2D) amastigotes in Hanks' balanced salt solution as previously described (32Melby P.C. Yang Y.Z. Cheng J. Zhao W. Infect. Immun. 1998; 6: 18-27Crossref Google Scholar). Age-matched control mice received the same volume of Hanks' balanced salt solution by the same route of inoculation. At 56 days post-infection, mice were killed and the spleen sections were prepared in paraffin. Samples were immunostained with anti-MTP1 antibody as described below. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded mouse organ sections using an affinity purified rabbit anti-MTP1 polyclonal antibody using the Envision+ (Dako Corp., Carpenteria, CA) staining kit with Vector VIP or AEC as chromogen (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (31Abboud S. Haile D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed using the affinity purified rabbit anti-MTP1 polyclonal antibody at 4 μg/ml, and a rat anti-mouse F4/80 antigen antibody (Serotec, Raleigh, NC) at 1:20. Secondary reagents were Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and Alexa 594 goat anti-rat IgG antibody at 1:500 dilution. Sections used for immunofluorescence were fixed with a 50:50 mixture of acetone and methanol for 20 min at −20 °C. Pictures were obtained on color slide film using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope. Liver and spleen lysates were prepared by homogenization of tissue in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin hydrochloride, and 2 μg/ml peptostatin A. After Dounce homogenization of tissue pieces, the nuclei and insoluble debris was spun down in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min in the cold and the supernatant was removed. For the immunoprecipitation, 15 μl of Protein A/G slurry (Calbiochem) was incubated for 1 h with 1 μg of affinity purified rabbit anti-MTP1 polyclonal antibody or a similar amount of control normal rabbit IgG in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100 and washed extensively. Two hundred micrograms of total protein from the organ lysates was added to the Protein A/G slurry bound to the anti-MTP1 antibody and tumbled for 2 h in the cold. Subsequently, the slurry was washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100 and then boiled in SDS sample buffer prior to electrophoresis using the Laemmli gel system. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blotting was done using the affinity purified rabbit anti-MTP1 polyclonal antibody or control IgG (400 ng/ml antibody concentration). Peptide blocking experiments were done by preincubating the diluted anti-MTP1 antibody with 2 μg of specific peptide prior to addition of the antibody to the membrane. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) was used as a secondary reagent at 1:2000–1:5000 dilution and signal detected on radiographic film using commercially available chemluminescent substrates. Total splenocytes from C57/Bl6 mice were prepared by manual crushing of the spleen using the back of a 10-ml syringe in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The spleen cell suspension was filtered through a nylon mesh and the cells were resuspended at 2–5 million mononuclear cells per milliliter and plated into 12-well plates. An aliquot of the cell suspension was treated with ammonium sulfate to lyse the red blood cells to determine the mononuclear cell number. The cells were incubated in plastic dishes at 37 °C for 2 h and then washed four times with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to remove nonadherent cells. The plates were then returned to the incubator and 2 h later LPS was added at 5 μg/ml concentration. PDTC was added at a concentration of 100 μm and a goat anti-rat/mouse TNF-α was used at 1 μg/ml. TNF-α was added to cultures at 10 ng/ml. After overnight incubation, total RNA was isolated using a commercially available RNA isolation kit (RNA-4-PCR, Ambion. One-fifth of the RNA was transcribed into cDNA using a commercially available kit (Retroscript Kit, Ambion). Quantitative PCR was performed using TaqMan polymerase with detection of SYBR Green fluorescence on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence detector (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). MTP1 mRNA levels were normalized using the expression of GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. Relative quantitation of both MTP1 and GAPDH mRNA was based on standard curves prepared from serially diluted mouse mast cell cDNA. The following sense and antisense sequences were employed: mouse MTP1, sense, CTACCATTAGAAGGATTGACCAGCTA, antisense, ACTGGAGAACCAAATGTCATAATCTG; mouse GAPDH, sense, CATGGCCTTCCGTGTTCCTA, antisense, TGT CATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTCT. Iron was reduced and released from serum transferrin by addition of an equal volume of 0.2 nHCl containing 0.05% ascorbic acid. Subsequently the sample was deproteinated by addition of an equal volume trichloroacetic acid (11%). The sample was then centrifuged and iron in the supernatant was measured using a commercially available ferrozine-based Total Iron Measurement Kit (Sigma). Previous work had indicated that MTP1 is primarily expressed in the Kupffer cells of the liver and red pulp of the spleen and had a distribution similar to that seen with the F4/80, a macrophage-specific cell surface antigen (31Abboud S. Haile D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The identification of MTP1 staining cells in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow as macrophages was confirmed by two-color double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies to MTP1 and F4/80 antigen in frozen liver, spleen, and bone marrow cell sections (Fig.1). In the red pulp of the spleen, there was great overlap between distribution of MTP1 and F4/80 staining cells. Interestingly, there were F4/80 positive cells in the white pulp of the spleen that do not stain with the MTP1 antibody, indicating that not all macrophages express MTP1. In the liver, as reported previously, MTP1 immunostaining was apparent on the surface of hepatocytes and in Kupffer cells. The MTP1 immunofluorescence of the Kupffer cells co-localized to the immunostaining with the F4/80 antigen. In bone marrow cell cytospins, there were many MTP1 positive cells, and immunostaining also co-localized with F4/80 in most of the cells. A murine LPS model of the acute phase reaction was used to examine the connection between MTP1 expression in the RES compartment of the body and inflammation. Experimental mice were treated with 100 μg of LPS and changes in MTP1 expression were assessed 16–18 h later (Fig.2 A). Immunohistochemical staining using an anti-MTP1 antibody of sections of spleen from LPS-treated mice demonstrated diminished MTP1 staining of spleen macrophages compared with control mice. To study the response of Kupffer cell MTP1 expression to LPS administration, mice were treated with 1–2 mg of iron-dextran to induce Kupffer cell MTP1 expression (31Abboud S. Haile D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar) and 7–10 days later treated with LPS. In iron-treated mice, LPS injection resulted in down-regulation of MTP1 in the Kupffer cells. Additionally, MTP1 was also down-regulated in bone marrow cells with LPS treatment. Last, duodenal MTP1 expression was induced with feeding of a low iron diet to mice and subsequent LPS administration to these iron-deficient mice also resulted in down-regulation of duodenal MTP1 expression compared with controls. The regulation of MTP1 in the spleen in a mouse model of a more chronic infectious disease was examined. The spleens of mice infected withL. donovani for 8 weeks were examined for MTP1 expression by immunohistochemistry using paraffin-embedded tissue and the anti-MTP1 antibody. Infected mice demonstrated diminished MTP1 staining in the spleen in comparison to control mice (Fig. 2 B). Tissues from two infected and two control animals were examined. These data demonstrate that MTP1 was also down-regulated in a more chronic inflammatory state induced by an infection. Western blotting of liver and spleen samples from LPS-treated and control mice confirmed the decreased tissue expression of MTP1 secondary to LPS administration (Fig. 3). The down-regulation of MTP1 expression by LPS was apparent in Western blots of immunoprecipitated MTP1 from spleen (Fig. 3, left panel) and liver lysates (Fig. 3, right panel). In most, but not all experiments at least two or more distinct bands were apparent in the immunoblots of spleen and liver lysates. The first was a smear occurring at 60,000–65,000 and the second was of higher molecular weight appearing at 110,000–130,000. The appearance of the 60,000–65,000 and the higher molecular weight bands were specific to immunoprecipitation with the anti-MTP1 antibody and blotting with the anti-MTP1 antibody. The peptide used to purify the anti-MTP1 antiserum blocked the appearance of the bands. The higher molecular weight bands were present in most experiments and the ratio of these bands to the 60,000–65,000-band varied from experiment to experiment. The 60–65-kDa-band is most likely MTP1. Preliminary data indicates that the larger bands do not represent either glycosylation or ubiquitination intermediates of MTP1. Anti-ubiquitin antibodies do not recognize the higher molecular weight bands by Western blotting and treatment with N-linked carbohydrate endoglycosidases does not alter the mobility of these higher molecular weight bands (data not shown). The larger bands probably represent a fraction of MTP1 that is modified, aggregated, or exhibits an aberrant migration. In LPS-treated mice, hypoferraemia was induced more rapidly than changes in splenic MTP1 protein expression. Serum iron was diminished as early as 2 h after LPS administration (Fig.4 A); whereas, there was no change in MTP1 expression at this time point (Fig. 4 B). Diminished MTP1 expression was noted at 6 h after LPS administration and this declined persisted as long as 72 h (data not shown). These data indicate that the early hypoferraemia because of LPS administration precedes MTP1 protein down-regulation and is not likely to be caused by changes in MTP1 expression. Other mechanisms, such as an increased clearance of blood iron may be more important in the development of the initial hypoferraemia. Mice lacking a functional LPS receptor, the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), such as the C3H/HeJ mouse strain are resistant to the lethal effects of LPS and fail to mount an acute phase response to LPS challenge and do not demonstrate a decline in serum iron (33Kampschmidt R.F. Pulliam L.A. Upchurch H.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1980; 95: 616-623PubMed Google Scholar, 34Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6401) Google Scholar). Although C3H/HeJ mice are resistant to induction of the acute phase response with LPS, they are known to be sensitive to other inflammatory mediators. We examined the response of splenic MTP1 to LPS in the C3H/HeJ mouse strain (Fig. 5). LPS-mediated down-regulation of MTP1 in the spleen was abrogated in the C3H/HeJ compared with the LPS-sensitive C3H/HeJ-FeB strain. A turpentine injection model of acute inflammation (23Hershko C. Cook J.D. Finch C.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1974; 28: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Raja K.B. Duane P. Peters T.J. Int. J. Exp.

Haematol. 1977; 37: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine whether MTP1 down-regulation was specific for TLR4 or could be achieved by other stimuli in the C3H/HeJ mice. Turpentine injection of C3H/HeJ mice results in sterile inflammation and the response has been associated with a decline in serum iron and induction of the acute phase response (33Kampschmidt R.F. Pulliam L.A. Upchurch H.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1980; 95: 616-623PubMed Google Scholar, 34Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6401) Google Scholar). C3H/HeJ mice treated with turpentine demonstrated marked down-regulation of MTP1 expression in the spleen compared with untreated controls. These results indicate that inflammatory stimuli other than LPS can induce down-regulation of MTP1 in the spleen by a non-TLR4 dependent mechanism. Many of the acute effects of LPS are mediated by induction of expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, interferon-γ, IL-6, and IL-1. The response of MTP1 in spleens was assessed in C57/Bl6 mice administered TNF-α. Intraperitoneal injection of mice with 1 μg of rTNF-α had no effect on MTP1 expression assessed by IHC on spleen sections using an anti-MTP1 antibody (Fig. 6). In addition, the response of MTP1 in the spleen to LPS was assessed in B6.129-Tnfrsf1atm1Mak mice, which lack expression of TNF-α receptor type 1a and are hyporesponsive to TNF-α stimulation (36Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Kronke M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The mice that were treated with LPS and a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody responded to LPS by down-regulation of splenic MTP1 indicating that TNF-α stimulation is not required for this effect (Fig. 6). Furthermore, administration of PDTC, a well characterized inhibitor of NF-κB activation and TNF-α production (37Lauzurica P. Martinez-Martinez S. Marazuela M. Gomez del Arco P. Martinez C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Redondo J.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1890-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), to mice prior to treatment with LPS did not alter the change in MTP1 expression induced by LPS (data not shown). To determine the mechanism of regulation of MTP1 expression by LPS, spleen and liver MTP1 mRNA expression was examined by real-time RT-PCR of total RNA from animals treated with LPS and untreated controls. There was a 2–3-fold down-regulation of MTP1-specific PCR product in spleen and liver samples from LPS-treated animals compared with control mice (Fig.7 A). To better determine whether there may be a change in macrophage-specific MTP1 mRNA secondary to LPS treatment (as opposed to total spleen MTP1 mRNA), splenic macrophages were enriched by adherence to plastic and these cells were treated with LPS, PDTC, or rTNF-α. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and MTP1 and GAPDH mRNA levels were assessed using RT-PCR. In vitro LPS treatment resulted in down-regulation of MTP1 mRNA expression relative to GAPDH expression in the splenic adherent cells (Fig. 7 B). The addition of PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-κΒ, did not abrogate the effect of LPS. In addition, direct addition of TNF-α to the adherent cells did not result in down-regulation of MTP1 mRNA. The data indicate that LPS results in down-regulation of MTP1 mRNA in adherent mouse spleen cells and that this action of LPS is probably independent of NF-κΒ activation and TNF-α synthesis. MTP1 is a metal transporter that exports iron from the cytosol to the outside of cells and was initially identified as the duodenal epithelial basolateral iron transporter (29McKie A.T. Marciani P.

MTP1 has also been demonstrated to export iron when expressed in tissue culture cells andXenopus oocytes. In addition, there is genetic evidence that MTP1 is involved in iron export from the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos. The recent identification of MTP1 mutation leading to hemochromatosis in man adds further weight to the hypothesis that MTP1 is involved in iron homeostasis (38Montosi G. Donovan A. Totaro A.

RES cells are responsible for the recycling of iron from the breakdown of heme from senescent erythrocytes and MTP1 has been hypothesized to be the key iron exporter in these cells. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that MTP1 is expressed in the RES macrophages of the spleen (29McKie A.T. Marciani P. Rolfs A. Brennan K. Wehr K. Barrow D. Miret S. Bomford A.

https://openalex.org/W2014884007,"The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, generating new cells throughout life, is essential for normal recognition memory performance. Reduction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in this structure impairs its functions. To elucidate the association between BDNF levels and hippocampal neurogenesis, we first conducted a search for compounds that stimulate endogenous BDNF production in hippocampal granule neurons. Among ion channel modulators tested, riluzole, a neuroprotective agent with anticonvulsant properties that is approved for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, was highly effective as a single dose by an intraperitoneal injection, causing a rise in BDNF localized in dentate granule neurons, the hilus, and the stratum radiatum of the CA3 region. Repeated, but not single, injections resulted in prolonged elevation of hippocampal BDNF and were associated with increased numbers of newly generated cells in the granule cell layer. This appeared due to promoted proliferation rather than survival of precursor cells, many of which differentiated into neurons. Intraventricular administration of BDNF-specific antibodies blocked such riluzole effects, suggesting that BDNF increase is necessary for the promotion of precursor proliferation. Our results suggest the basis for a new strategy for treatment of memory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2094893738,"Spatiotemporally resolved functional MRI (fMRI) in animals can reveal how wide-spread neural networks are organized and accompanying electrophysiological recordings can show how small neural assemblies contribute to this organization. Here we present a novel technique that yields high-resolution structural and functional images of the monkey brain with small, tissue-compatible, intraosteally implantable radiofrequency coils. Voxel sizes as small as 0.0113 μl with high signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were obtained, revealing both structural and functional cortical architecture in great detail. Up to a certain point, contrast sensitivity increased with decreasing voxel size, probably because of the decreased partial volume effects. Spatial specificity was demonstrated by the lamina-specific activation in experiments comparing responses to moving and flickering stimuli. The implications of this technique for combined fMRI/electrophysiology experiments and its limitations in terms of spatial coverage are discussed."

To clarify the role of ATF3 in determining cell fate, we overexpressed it in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. ATF3 protected these cells from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced apoptosis, as measured by flow cytometric analysis, trypan blue exclusion assay, and cleavage of procaspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Northern blot and nuclear run on assay showed that the transcription of tumor suppressor gene p53 was down-regulated in the ATF3-overexpressing cells.

Furthermore, the cell-protecting effect of ATF3 was remarkably reduced inp53-deficient cells. These results demonstrate that overexpression of ATF3 suppresses TNF-α-induced cell death of HUVECs, at least in part, through down-regulating the transcription ofp53 gene.

When this function is perturbed, a cascade of thrombogenic and atherogenic reaction may occur. Injured endothelial cells become procoagulant and promote the formation of thrombi. They also attract phagocytes and produce cytokines and growth factors that act on adjacent vascular cells to promote their growth. Thus, endothelial cell death may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as vascular inflammation, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis (1Karsan A. Harlan J.M. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1996; 3: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-α is a cytokine produced by many cell types, including macrophages, monocytes, lymphoid cells, and fibroblasts, in response to inflammation, infection, and various environmental stimuli (2Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 3Vandenabeele P. Declercg W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). This cytokine is associated with a variety of cellular defense responses and activation of beneficial and cell-protecting genes. Simultaneously, TNF-α also causes a myriad of lethal effects such as septic shock, tissue injury, inflammation, and cachexia, and these effects may be associated with apoptosis in susceptible cells. Although intact endothelial cells are rather resistant to TNF-α, they clearly undergo apoptotic cell death when exposed to TNF-α (4Robaye B. Mosselmans R. Fiers W. Dumont J.E. Galand P. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 447-453PubMed Google Scholar, 5Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp.

This becomes more significant in the presence of a low amount of RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D (5Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol.

In TNF-α-induced apoptosis, factors such as TRADD, FADD/MORT, RIP, FLICE/MACH, and TRAFs associate with cell surface receptor TNFR1 in initiating the TNF-α-induced signaling pathway (7Liu Z-g. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 8Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). In contrast, downstream events connecting the initial receptor binding and the final apoptotic process are relatively unknown, although the sphingomyelin pathway and ceramide are reported to be involved. Tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated in response to DNA damage or a wide range of stress stimuli. This leads to growth arrest and provides sufficient time for cells to repair damage. Alternatively, p53 can trigger apoptosis and thus eliminate cells that have been damaged beyond repair. In TNF-α-induced apoptosis, p53 is also implicated in the death process. For instance, p53 is involved in cytotoxic activity of TNF-α in c-Myc-expressing cells (9Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7382-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and its loss of function is associated with resistance of MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells to TNF-α (10Cai Z. Capoulade C. Moyret-Lalle C. Amor-Gueret M. Feunteun J. Larsen A.K. Bressac-de Paillerets B. Chouaib S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2817-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 is activated in TNF-induced apoptosis of human promonocytic cells (11Yeung M.C. Lau A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25198-25202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or ME-180 cells (12Donato N.J. Perez M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5067-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Many studies show that translational and post-translational events are major regulatory steps in p53 activation (13Ewen M. Miller S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1242: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, it has been shown that c-jun null cells express elevated levels ofp53 mRNA, and reintroduction of a constitutive c-jun allele represses p53 transcription (14Schreiber M. Kolbus A.

Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, AP-1 repressor protein JDP-2 inhibits UV-mediated apoptosis through down-regulation of p53 (16Piu F. Aronheim A. Katz S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3012-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transcriptional regulation of p53 also contributes to its accumulation in response to stress. However, at this moment, our knowledge regarding one or more transcription factors that control the expression of p53 gene in response to stress stimuli is rather limited. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the ATF/CREB subfamily, is a bZip transcription factor (17Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol.

Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4654-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). ATF3 therefore can repress or activate target genes by forming homo- or heteromeric complexes. ATF3 is rapidly induced by ischemia-coupled reperfusion in heart and kidney (22Chen B.P.C. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3666-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), which can all induce cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. We previously reported that ATF3 is rapidly induced in human vascular endothelial cells in response to TNF-α, oxidized low density lipoprotein, and homocysteine (26Nawa T. Nawa T.M. Adachi T.M.

However, it remains unclear whether ATF3 functions as proapoptotic or antiapoptotic factor or which one or more target genes are regulated by ATF3 in this process. In this study, we overexpressed ATF3 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and found that ATF3 protected them from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ATF3 was shown to repress the transcription of thep53 gene. This suggests that ATF3 functions as a cell-survival factor through down-regulation of p53 at the transcriptional level. ATF3 could be a novel therapeutic target in preventing pathogenesis and progression of vascular diseases. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), and actinomycin D was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Rabbit anti-ATF3 (C-19), monoclonal anti-p53, and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-CPP32 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and monoclonal anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibody was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Expression plasmid for human ATF3, pCI-ATF3, was as described previously (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S.

HUVECs were obtained and grown in EGM-2 medium (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) as described (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells of passages 2–3 were used in this study to minimize age-dependent variation in the level of apoptosis. For transient expression, plasmid DNA was vortex-mixed with SuperFect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and transfected into cells as previously described (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S.

Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells with p53null allele and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells with wild typep53 allele were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Adenovirus vector encoding the human ATF3 gene (AdATF3) was constructed by using an Adenovirus Expression Vector kit obtained from Takara (Otsu, Japan). Briefly, a blunt-ended cDNA fragment encoding ATF3 was subcloned into theSwaI site of the E1-deleted region of cassette cosmid vector pAxCAwt, and co-transfected into 293 cells with DNA-terminal protein complex (28Miyake S.

Recombinant virus positive for ATF3 was screened by immunoblot analysis using anti-ATF3 antibody and cloned by limiting dilution. Adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) was a generous gift from Dr. Saito of Tokyo University, Japan. These adenoviruses were plaque-purified, and their titers were determined by titration in 293 cells. For adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, HUVECs were exposed to adenoviral vectors at the indicated of multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) and cultured for the indicated time. HUVECs (3 × 105 cells) were infected with AdATF3 or AdLacZ viruses for 48 h and treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D. Both floating and attached cells were combined, washed once with PBS, and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol. After staining with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, the DNA content of the cells was analyzed by using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Apoptotic cells were quantitated by the percentage of cells with a subG1 DNA content. HUVECs were infected with AdATF3 or AdLacZ viruses for 48 h and treated with the indicated concentration of TNF-α in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D for 18 h. Both attached and floating cells were combined and stained with 0.2% trypan blue. Viable cells were counted and expressed as a proportion of cells treated with actinomycin D alone. HUVECs (3 × 105 cells) treated as indicated were washed in PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 0. 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 100 mmNaF, and 10% glycerol), and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was taken as whole cell extract. The amounts of protein were measured by Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were separated on an SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western blot using the protocol of ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium method using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Japan), fractionated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N membrane, and hybridized to random-primed cDNA probe for the human p53 gene as described (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was exposed and analyzed by Bas 2500 Bio-image analyzer (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan). DNA fragment for the human p53 cDNA, 2.0 kb, was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol,Amersham Biosciences) using a random primer-labeling kit from Takara and used as probe. HUVECs (1 × 107cells) were infected with AdATF3 or AdLacZ viruses for 48 h, and their nuclei were prepared and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (30Noda A. Toma-Aiba Y. Fujiwara Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Elongation of nascent RNA chains was initiated by mixing the nuclei with 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5 mm MgCl2; 300 mm KCl; 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP; and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences) and incubating at 30 °C for 30 min. RNA synthesis was terminated by incubating with 5 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 30 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then digested with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS at 50 °C for 1 h, and radiolabeled nuclear transcripts were separated from unincorporated nucleotides on Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. The labeled RNA was boiled for 3 min, chilled on ice, and hybridized to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, humanp53 cDNA, and plasmid pBR322 (10 μg each) immobilized on a Hybond-N membrane at 42 °C for 48 h. The membrane filters were analyzed by Bas 2500 Bio-image analyzer (Fujifilm). Reporter plasmid containing a 2.4-kb fragment of the human p53 gene promoter, pLuc-2400, was as described (30Noda A. Toma-Aiba Y. Fujiwara Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 5′-deletion mutants of reporter genes were prepared by PCR-amplifying and subcloning of DNA fragments from −460, −290, and −110 to +6 into the XhoI and BglII sites of PicaGene pGVB2 (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), to produce pLuc-460, -290, and -110, respectively. pLuc-460mPF-1 and pLuc-460mCRE-BP1 containing the mutant PF-1 site from −184 to −177 and the mutant CRE-BP1 site from −402 to −395, respectively, were prepared from pLuc-460 using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The mutant PF-1 and CRE-BP1 sites contained the sequence of 5′-TGAATTC-3′ and 5′-TTTGGGAA-3′ (mutated nucleotides underlined) compared with wild type PF-1 sequence, 5′-TGACTCT-3′, and CRE-BP1 sequence, 5′-TTACGGAA-3′, respectively. HUVECs (3 × 105 cells in a 35-mm dish) were transfected with 1 μg of human p53 reporter plasmid along with pCIATF3 as described (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell extracts were assayed for basal p53 promoter activity. For the activated p53 promoter activity, cells were further stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF-α in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D for another 10 h. Both firefly and sea pansy luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacture's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). pRL-TK (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) containing the sea pansy luciferase gene was used as an internal control of transfection and expression. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the AdATF3 or AdLacZ-infected HUVECs (2 × 107 cells) as described (27Cai Y. Zhang C. Nawa T. Aso T. Tanaka M. Oshiro S. Ichijo H. Kitajima S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2140-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-ATF3 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclear extract protein (2 μg) or GST-ATF3 protein (0.5 μg) were incubated in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 ng of radiolabeled DNA probe at room temperature for 30 min. For supershift assays, anti-ATF3 antibody (0.1 μg) was added and incubated for another 30 min. DNA probe was obtained by annealing 0.1 μg each of sense and antisense oligonucleotides for PF-1 site, 5′-GCGAGAATCCTGACTCTGCACC-3′ (31Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reisman D. Loging W.T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and radiolabeled with 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase. Mutant oligonucleotide used for the competition experiment contained substitutions in the normal sequence of 5′-TGACTCT-3′ to 5′-TGAATTC-3′. Binding mixture was applied onto a 5% non-denatured polyacrylamide slab gel in Tris borate EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried on a 3MM Whatman paper and visualized by Fuji Bas 2500 image analyzer. Multiple comparisons were evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's post hoc test. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assigned at the level of p < 0.05. To study the functional role of ATF3 in endothelial cell apoptosis, we expressed ATF3 in HUVECs by infecting cells with adenoviral expression vector AdATF3. Fig. 1 showed that the increasing titer of AdATF3 expressed ATF3 protein in a dose-dependent manner, while AdLacZ, which encoded β-galactosidase, did not express ATF3 and served as control. The expression of ATF3 did not change the cell viability for at least 4 days after infection, suggesting that overexpression of ATF3 by itself was not capable of causing apoptosis. We then treated HUVECs by TNF-α in the presence of actinomycin D, under which HUVECs undergo significant apoptotic cell death (5Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This treatment caused a rapid induction of ATF3 expression as significantly as AdATF3 (Fig. 1 and Ref. 26Nawa T. Nawa T.M. Adachi T.M. Uchimura I. Shimokawa R. Fujisawa K. Tanaka A. Numano F. Kitajima S. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 161: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Next, the effect of ATF3 expression on TNF-α-induced apoptosis was examined. As shown in theupper panel of Fig.2 A, FACS analysis revealed that the number of cells at the subG1 region, i.e.hypodiploid, increased after treatment with TNF-α for 6 and 18 h in the AdLacZ-infected cells. Under this condition, overexpression of ATF3 remarkably suppressed the number of subG1 cells (Fig.2 A, lower panel). This inhibition of apoptosis was observed by ∼3 times higher level of ATF3 than in the TNF-treated HUVECs (compare the ATF3 expression at m.o.i. of 50 with that at 6 h of TNF-treated cells in Fig. 1). These data indicate that ATF3 may protect HUVECs from TNF-α-induced cell death.Figure 2TNF-α-induced cell death is inhibited in AdATF3-infected HUVECs. A, HUVECs were infected with AdLacZ (upper panel) or AdATF3 (lower panel) at an m.o.i. of 50. At 48 h post-infection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D. After further incubation for 6 and 18 h, cells were subjected to FACS analysis as under “Experimental Procedures.”B, cell viability was assayed by trypan blue dye exclusion method. HUVECs infected with AdATF3 (○), AdLacZ (■), or uninfected control (▵), were stimulated by increasing amounts of TNF-α in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D, and cell viability was expressed as a percentage to that treated with actinomycin D only. Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. C, HUVECs treated as in A were examined by phase contrast microscopy. Cells uninfected (panels a and d) or infected with AdLacZ (panels c and f) became round and detached from the dish after treatment with 10 ng/ml TNF-α in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D for 18 h. In contrast, most of cells that were infected with AdATF3 appeared normal and remained attached to dish (panels b ande).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we further examined the effect of ATF3 on cell viability in the TNF-α-treated HUVECs. For this purpose, HUVECs infected with AdATF3 or AdLacZ were treated with TNF-α, and their viability was determined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, treatment with increasing amounts of TNF-α decreased cell viability of the control and AdLacZ-infected HUVECs, as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. On the other hand, overexpression of ATF3 significantly prevented the decrease of cell viability. These cells were also examined on microscopy. Most of the uninfected control and AdLacZ-infected HUVECs exhibited a round shape change and became detached from the dish (Fig. 2 C, panels d andf), indicative of cell death. In contrast, the AdATF3 cells retained the normal shape and remained attached to the dish (Fig.2 C, panel e). Thus, it is indicated that ATF3 prevents the decrease of cell viability of HUVECs induced by TNF-α. The caspase family of cysteine proteases is implicated in the apoptotic process of numerous cells, and its target substrate such as PARP is proteolytically cleaved. To obtain biochemical evidence for the protective effect of ATF3 in the TNF-α-induced apoptosis, we examined the activation and cleavage of procaspase 3 and PARP in HUVECs that overexpressed ATF3. Fig.3 (upper panel) showed that procaspase 3 was activated to yield a 16-kDa fragment in the uninfected control and AdLacZ-infected cells after exposure to TNF-α, whereas its activation was suppressed in the AdATF3-infected cells (upper panel). PARP was cleaved after TNF-α treatment in the control and AdLacZ cells and this cleavage was also suppressed in the ATF3-expressing cells (Fig. 3, lower panel). These data indicate that ATF3 suppresses the activation and cleavage of procaspase 3 and PARP in the TNF-α-stimulated HUVECs. The data above suggested that the expression of proapoptotic or antiapoptotic genes may be affected by ATF3, which leads to suppression of endothelial cell death in response to TNF-α. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism of action of ATF3, we examined for such genes whose regulation is correlated with inhibition of apoptosis. Fig.4 A showed that p53mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the AdATF3-infected HUVECs, although it was not affected in the AdLacZ cells. In Fig.4 B, we performed nuclear run-on assay to determine whether the reduced level of p53 mRNA was due to the decreased transcription. Results showed that the p53 transcription was significantly suppressed in the AdATF3-infected cells. This effect appeared to be specific, because AdLacZ cells showed no such suppression and the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene transcription was comparable between these cells. These data clearly shows that overexpression of ATF3 down-regulatesp53 mRNA at the level of transcription. We next studied the expression ofp53 mRNA of the AdATF3-infected HUVECs in response to TNF-α. Fig. 5 A showed thatp53 mRNA was induced by ∼2.3-fold in the AdLacZ cells at 2 h post-stimulation by TNF-α. In the AdATF3-cells, basal level of p53 mRNA was remarkably reduced, and its activation was almost abolished at 2 h post-stimulation, although it appeared to slightly increase at 24 h post-stimulation. The activation of p53 protein of these cells was also examined. As shown in Fig. 5 B, p53 protein was rapidly accumulated in the AdLacZ cells in response to TNF-α. In the AdATF3 cells, both basal and stimulated level of p53 protein was significantly reduced compared with that of AdLacZ cells. However, the extent of activation by TNF-α appeared comparable between AdLacZ and AdATF3 cells, 2.98- and 2.85-fold, respectively, suggesting that stability of p53 protein was not affected by ATF3. These data together indicate that the expression of ATF3 down-regulates both basal and stimulated level ofp53 mRNA and this leads to decreased activation of p53 protein. Transcriptional regulation of p53 gene contributes to its activation in response to stress stimuli (14Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P.

In this study, we examined the role of CCR4 in the chronic allergic airway response to live Aspergillus fumigatus spores, or conidia, in A. fumigatus-sensitized mice. After the conidia challenge, mice lacking CCR4 (CCR4-/- mice) exhibited significantly increased numbers of airway neutrophils and macrophages, and conidia were more rapidly eliminated from these mice compared with control CCR4 wild-type (CCR4+/+) mice. Significant airway hyperresponsiveness to intravenous methacholine was observed at day 3 in CCR4-/- mice, whereas at days 7 and 30, airway hyperresponsiveness was attenuated in these mice compared with control mice. A major reduction in peribronchial and airway eosinophilia was observed in CCR4-/- mice at all times after conidia challenge in contrast to CCR4+/+ mice. Further, whole lung levels of interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5 were significantly increased in CCR4-/- mice at day 3, whereas these Th2 cytokines and IL-13 were significantly decreased at day 30 in CCR4-/- mice compared with their wild-type counterparts. Peribronchial fibrosis and goblet cell hyperplasia were similar in both groups of mice throughout the course of this model. In summary, CCR4 modulates both innate and acquired immune responses associated with chronic fungal asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1997707992,"We have examined the role of the superior colliculus (SC) in choosing targets for pursuit and saccades by comparing neuronal activity at sites representing the possible choices. After recording during a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, we measured the difference in activity of the populations representing the two choices by computing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on a millisecond timescale. A signal indicating the correct choice emerged from noise over time, forming a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. The observed performance corresponded to particular points along the predicted speed-accuracy curves-pursuit emphasizing speed and saccades emphasizing accuracy. These results show that activity from the same set of neurons in the superior colliculus can predict target choices for both pursuit and saccades."

The functional topographies of the proteins corresponding to the longest ORFs1 of PDE3A and PDE3B cDNAs are similar and include a C-terminal catalytic region (“CCR”) of ≈280 amino acids and two N-terminal hydrophobic regions (“NHRs”) that are involved in intracellular targeting (Fig.1). NHR1 (aa ≈60–255) contains transmembrane helices, whereas NHR2 (aa ≈340–400) appears to be involved in the binding of PDE3 to as yet unidentified membrane proteins. rtPDE3As containing NHR1 localize exclusively to intracellular membranes in transfected cells, whereas rtPDE3As containing NHR2 but not NHR1 are found in both the cytosol and intracellular membranes of transfected cells (3Kenan Y.

PDE3 inhibitors (e.g. milrinone and enoximone) have inotropic effects attributable to the elevation of cAMP content in cardiac myocytes and vasodilatory effects attributable to the elevation of cAMP and/or cGMP content in vascular myocytes, and have been used to augment contractility and reduce afterload in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (14Movsesian M.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1999; 34: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas the use of these drugs results in hemodynamic benefits in the short term, long-term use increases mortality. These biphasic actions probably reflect the broad range of proteins phosphorylated by PK-A in cardiac myocytes and the diverse cellular responses that are elicited. Our previous studies indicated that multiple isoforms of PDE3A are present in cardiac and vascular myocytes and are localized to different intracellular compartments. One protein, with an apparent molecular weight (“M r”) of ≈136,000, was recovered exclusively in microsomal fractions; the other two, with lower molecular weights, were present in both cytosolic and microsomal fractions (15Smith C.J. Krall J. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We subsequently identified two PDE3A mRNAs in cardiac and vascular myocytes: PDE3A1, whose cDNA was cloned from myocardium, contains an ORF of 1141 nt. PDE3A2, whose cDNA was cloned from aortic myocytes, shares the sequence of PDE3A1 starting ≈300 nt downstream from the latter's start site but lacks the sequence upstream of this site (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The PDE3A isoform translated from PDE3A2 in vascular myocytes had an apparent M rof only ≈118,000, comparable with one of the lower molecular weight bands identified in human myocardium. The 136,000-M r PDE3 band was not present in cultured aortic myocytes. The presence of different PDE3A isoforms in cytosolic and microsomal fractions of cardiac myocytes is especially interesting in view of the facts that cAMP metabolism in these compartments can be regulated with some independence in cardiac muscle and that changes in cAMP content in these compartments have different effects on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and contractility (17Hayes J.S.

In the experiments described below, we have identified three PDE3A isoforms in subcellular fractions of cardiac myocytes whose N-terminal amino acid sequence differences suggest that they differ with respect to mechanisms of intracellular targeting and that their activities may be regulated via different signaling pathways. A human myocardial PDE3A construct was generated by inserting an 8-amino acid Flag epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) immediately upstream from the stop codon of the PDE3A1. Using 50 ng of PDE3A1 cDNA (20Meacci E. Taira M. Moos Jr., M. Smith C.J. Movsesian M.A. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting PCR product contained the unique PDE3 DraIII site at the 5′ end and a stop codon at the 3′ end; the stop codon is flanked upstream by a FLAG epitope-coding sequence and downstream by anXhoI site. The PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and isolated from this vector asDraIII/XhoI fragments.XhoI/DraIII fragments containing the ORF sequence of PDE3A1 upstream from the unique DraIII site were restricted from pBluescript. In a three-way ligation, these 5′XhoI/DraIII fragments were ligated via theDraIII site to the 3′ DraIII/XhoI FLAG epitope-containing fragments and to XhoI-cut pZero vector (Invitrogen), to give PDE3A1 Flag-pZero.

For amplification, 100–500 μl of medium was collected after 72–96 h and used to infect fresh cultures, after which viral titers were determined by a 12-well end point dilution assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells from 75 cm2 flasks, usually 10–20 × 106 cells per flask, were sedimented for 10 min at 1000 × g, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 10 mmHEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Lysates were prepared by sonication on ice (two 20-s pulses, output 2, 40% of cycle) with a Sonifier cell disruptor 350 (Branson Sonic Power, Danbury, CT). Lysates were sedimented for 10 min at 12,000 × g; supernatant fractions were used for Western blotting. Cytosolic and KCl-washed microsomal fractions, from the left ventricular myocardium of the explanted hearts of cardiac transplant recipients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, were prepared by homogenization, differential sedimentation, and high-salt washing as described previously (21Krall J.

Lysates of Sf21 cells expressing rtPDE3A1 and subcellular fractions of human myocardium and aortic myocytes were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 50%), dissolved in SDS buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide), and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blotting was performed with antibodies that were raised against peptides corresponding to aa 29–42, 424–460, and 1125–1141 of the ORF of PDE3A1 as described previously (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D.

PCR amplification was performed on Marathon RACE-Ready cDNA from human myocardium (Clontech) using 1 pmol of gene-specific antisense primer and 1 pmol of sense primer corresponding to the 5′ end of the manufacturer's 5′ tag. A second round of PCR was performed for 35 cycles using 1 pmol of nested gene-specific primer and 1 pmol of nested sense primer corresponding to a second sequence within the manufacturer's tag. RACE products were purified on agarose gels and ligated into pCR2.1 vector with T4 ligase (14 °C, overnight) using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Competent cells (INVαF′) were transformed using a One Shot Kit (Invitrogen) and plated on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) LB-ampicillin plates (100 μg/ml ampicillin). Positive colonies were grown overnight in LB-ampicillin medium. Plasmids were purified using the Mini- or Midiprep Plasmid purification systems (Qiagen) and inserts were excised with EcoRI. Insert sizes were estimated by electrophoresis through agarose gels. DNA probes were prepared from PDE3A1 plasmid by PCR using region-specific primers. PCR products were purified using QIA Quick kits (Qiagen). DNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) using a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Sephadex G-50 (fine) columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For Southern blotting, linear DNA corresponding to nt −268 to nt 2610 of PDE3A1 ORF was prepared from PDE3A1 template by PCR and purified as described above. The PCR product was quantified by measurement of theA 260/A 280 ratio and its purity confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR product samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels, transferred to Gene Screen Plus Nylon Membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cross-linked, and pre-hybridized for 2–3 h in QuikHyb (Stratagene). Labeled DNA probes were hybridized with DNA blots at 65 °C for 3–4 h using 1.25 × 106 cpm/ml of probe and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Following hybridization, excess radiolabeled probe was removed by rinsing in SSC, 0.1% SDS and autoradiography was performed at −80 °C. For Northern blotting, RNA was extracted from human left ventricular myocardium from the excised hearts of transplant recipients with dilated cardiomyopathy using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Poly(A) RNA was prepared from total RNA using a Message Maker kit (Invitrogen). RNA was quantified and its purify confirmed as described above. Poly(A) RNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose, 0.5 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to GeneScreen Plus Nylon membranes, cross-linked, and pre-hybridized for 2–3 h in QuikHyb. Labeled DNA probes were hybridized with RNA blots, excess radiolabeled probe was removed, and autoradiography performed as described for Southern blotting. Polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides whose sequences correspond to selected regions of PDE3A1 ORF, including aa 29–42 (N-terminal, or “NT”), aa 424–460 (“MID”), and aa 1125–1141 (C-terminal, or “CT”), the extreme C terminus (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), were used for Western blotting of lysates of Sf21 cells expressing rtPDE3A1 and of cytosolic and microsomal fractions of human myocardium (Fig. 2). All three antibodies reacted with rtPDE3A1 bands in Sf21 lysates. Anti-CT reacted with proteins in cytosolic and microsomal fractions of human myocardium with apparent M r of 94,000 and 118,000 and with a protein with an apparent M r of 136,000 seen only in microsomal fractions. Anti-MID reacted with the 118- and 136-kDa proteins but not with the 94-kDa protein. Anti-PDE3-NT did not react with any protein bands in these fractions. The presence of multiple immunoreactive PDE3A bands might have resulted from the activation of tissue proteases during the preparation of subcellular fractions of human myocardium. To examine this possibility, we added 35S-labeled rtPDE3A to a fresh homogenate of human myocardium, prepared cytosolic and microsomal fractions, and subjected these fractions to SDS-PAGE. Autoradiograms showed the same35S-labeled proteins bands in tissue fractions as in original Sf21 lysates (Fig. 3), compatible with the notion that the three PDE3 bands identified in subcellular fractions of cardiac myocytes are not the result of proteolysis during the preparation of subcellular fractions. These results suggested that the isoforms of PDE3A in cardiac muscle, which we have designated PDE3A-136, PDE3A-118, and PDE3A-94, the numbers corresponding to their apparent M r on SDS-PAGE, all contain the same C-terminal amino acid sequences downstream of different N-terminal starting points. Unexpectedly, the N terminus predicted by the PDE3A1 ORF was absent from PDE3A-136, the longest PDE3A isoform we identified, despite the fact that the apparentM r of this isoform on SDS-PAGE is greater than the M r predicted by the amino acid sequence of the PDE3A1 ORF. To gain insight into this apparent discrepancy, we compared the migration of native PDE3 isoforms on SDS-PAGE to the migration of rtPDE3As generated by in vitrotranscription/translation from constructs with 5′ deletions designed to result in translation from different in-frame AUGs (Fig.4). All rtPDE3A isoforms migrated with apparent M r ∼20,000 higher than predicted by their amino acid sequences. The apparent M r of PDE3A-136 (lane 6) was slightly higher than the apparentM r of 131,000 for the rtPDE3A translated from AUG2 in the PDE3A1 ORF (lane 2), implying that PDE3A-136 contains part of NHR1 (consistent with its recovery only in microsomal fractions), all of NHR2, and the sites for phosphorylation and activation by PK-B and PK-A. The apparent M r of PDE3A-118 (lanes 7 and 8) was indistinguishable from that of the rtPDE3A translated from AUG4 (lane 4), implying that PDE3A-118 lacks NHR1 and the PK-B site but includes NHR2 and the PK-A sites. The apparent M r of PDE3A-94 (lanes 7 and 8) was slightly lower than the apparent M r of 95,000 for the rtPDE3A translated from AUG7/8 (lane 5), implying that PDE3A-94 contains neither of the membrane-association domains nor any of the three phosphorylation sites. The absence of NHR1 from PDE3A-118, the isoform we originally identified in vascular myocytes, contradicts our predicted amino acid sequence for this isoform, which included NHR1 (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This earlier prediction was based on the assumption that the apparent molecular weights of PDE3s on SDS-PAGE correspond to the molecular weights derived from their amino acid sequences, which our current results demonstrate to be incorrect. The absence of NHR1 from PDE3A-118 is consistent with its presence in both cytosolic and microsomal fractions. In addition to the higher molecular weight bands discussed above, transcription/translation in vitro from every rtPDE3A construct generated a rtPDE3A isoform with an apparentM r of 95,000, similar to that of the AUG7/8 translation product. To examine the possibility that this 95,000M r rtPDE3A might be generated from larger constructs by translation from AUG7/8, we prepared a construct starting from ATG1 in which ATG7/8 was mutated to CTGCTG (Met-Met → Leu-Leu). Expression of the mutated construct resulted in the disappearance of the 95,000 M r rtPDE3A (Fig.5), consistent with its generation from the longer mRNA by translation from AUG7/8. We turned our attention to identifying the mRNAs from which these three PDE3A protein isoforms are translated. Our previous studies (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) had shown that a PDE3A2 mRNA, whose sequence is identical to that of the PDE3A1 cDNA downstream of nt ≈300 in the latter's ORF but which lacks the latter's upstream sequence, is present in both cardiac and vascular myocytes, although PDE3A1 mRNA is present in cardiac but not in vascular myocytes. Whether PDE3A2 mRNA contained an alternative 5′ sequence upstream of nt ≈300 remained unknown. To search for any such sequence, we performed 5′-RACE of a human myocardial cDNA library using three pairs of antisense primers derived from the shared sequence of PDE3A1 and PDE3A2 (TableII). Subcloning and sequencing of multiple 5′-RACE products yielded no alternative upstream sequence. These results are similar to those obtained when 5′-RACE was performed with comparable primers in a human aortic cDNA library (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem.

Three cDNA probes were used. The first, derived from nt −268–189, corresponds to a region predicted to be present in PDE3A1 but not PDE3A2; the other two cDNA probes correspond to nt 517–957 and 2248–2610 of PDE3A1, regions predicted to be present in both PDE3A1 and PDE3A2. All three probes bound to an 8.2-kb band. The two downstream probes also bound to a 6.9-kb band to which the upstream probe did not bind. These results are consistent with the 8.2-kb band being PDE3A1 and the 6.9-kb band being PDE3A2. Their size differences can be accounted for by the absence of the first ≈300 nt of the ORF of PDE3A1 from PDE3A2, consistent with the generation of the latter by alternative transcription or splicing within exon 1. This absence of ≈300 nt of PDE3A1 in PDE3A2 was previously predicted by ribonuclease protection assays of RNA prepared from human myocardium and cultured human aortic myocytes with antisense probes spanning nt 208–537 and 2248–2610 of PDE3A1 (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The fact that PDE3A1 mRNA and PDE3A-136 are present only in cardiac myocytes while PDE3A2 mRNA and PDE3A-118 and PDE3A-94 are present in both cardiac and vascular myocytes is consistent with PDE3A1 mRNA giving rise to PDE3A-136 and PDE3A2 mRNA giving rise to both PDE3A-118 and PDE3A-94 (Fig.7).Figure 7Hypothesis for generation of cardiac and aortic isoforms of PDE3A. PDE3A1 and PDE3A2 mRNAs are generated by alternative transcription. Exons of the PDE3Agene are depicted at the top. Transcription from alternative sites or alternative mRNA splicing yields PDE3A1 mRNA in cardiac myocytes and PDE3A2 mRNA in cardiac and aortic myocytes. PDE3A-136 is translated from PDE3A1; PDE3A-118 and PDE3A-94 are translated from alternative sites in PDE3A2. Numbers in “mRNA” refer to AUGs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An important feature of cAMP-mediated signaling in cardiac myocytes is its intracellular compartmentation. cAMP content in cytosolic and microsomal fractions of cardiac myocytes is affected differently depending on whether cAMP formation is stimulated via β1-adrenergic, β2-adrenergic, or PGE1 receptor agonists. These compartment-selective changes in cAMP content are accompanied by different effects on the phosphorylation of individual substrates of PK-A, intracellular Ca2+homeostasis, and contractility (17Hayes J.S. Brunton L.L. Mayer S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5113-5119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xiao R.P. Lakatta E.G. Circ.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19151-19156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increases in the phosphorylation of different PK-A substrates occur when intracellular cAMP content is increased by phosphodiesterase inhibition rather than by stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and different cellular responses are elicited (22Rapundalo S.T. Solaro R.J. Kranias E.G. Circulation Res. 1989; 64: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Jurevicius J. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). This compartmentation of cAMP-mediated signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, where the reduction in cAMP content in failing myocardium is far greater in microsomal fractions than in cytosolic fractions (24Böhm M. Reiger B. Schwinger R.H.G. Erdmann E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1994; 28: 1713-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrating differences in the spatial distribution of subtypes of β-adrenergic receptors in cardiac myocyte membranes have offered one mechanism through which compartment-selective regulation may occur (25Rybin V.O., Xu, X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Our identification of three isoforms of PDE3A with N-terminal differences involving membrane-association domains and sites for phosphorylation by activating protein kinases in cardiac myocytes offers an additional mechanism, for it suggests that these isoforms are likely to regulate cAMP content in functionally distinct intracellular compartments, and hence to regulate the phosphorylation of different substrates of PK-A, in response to different upstream signals. Our findings may have important ramifications regarding the therapy of dilated cardiomyopathy, in which competitive inhibitors of PDE3 confer short term hemodynamic benefits but adversely affect long term survival (14Movsesian M.A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1999; 34: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This biphasic response is likely to result from an increase in the phosphorylation of a large number of PK-A substrates, some of which may contribute to the beneficial effects whereas others contribute to the adverse effects. Phosphorylation of phospholamban, for example, relieves its inhibition of SERCA2, the Ca2+-transporting ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (26Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 27Fentzke R.C. Korcarz C.E. Lang R.M. Lin H. Leiden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Ablation of phospholamban in cardiac myocytes of MLP−/−mice with dilated cardiomyopathy restores normal chamber size and contractility, whereas decreasing phospholamban expression in myocytes from failing hearts improves contractility (28Minamisawa S. Hoshijima M. Chu G. Ward C.A. Frank K., Gu, Y. Martone M.E. Wang Y. Ross Jr., J. Kranias E.G. Giles W.R. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 29del Monte F. Harding S.E. Dec G.W. Gwathmey J.K. Hajjar R.J. Circulation. 2002; 105: 904-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that increased phosphorylation of phospholamban is beneficial. In contrast, phosphorylation of L-type Ca2+ channels increases their open probability and may be arrhythmogenic (30Fischmeister R. Hartzell H.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 426-433PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade may alter myocardial gene transcription so as to speed the progression of the disease (31Lazou A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circulation Res. 1994; 75: 932-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). If different isoforms of PDE3A regulate the phosphorylation of different proteins in response to different signals, the beneficial and adverse effects of PDE3 inhibition may result from the inhibition of different PDE3A isoforms. A logical corollary is that agents capable of selectively activating or inhibiting individual PDE3 isoforms may have advantages over currently available nonselective PDE3 inhibitors in therapeutic applications. An agent that selectively inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum-associated PDE3A-136, for example, might preserve intracellular Ca2+cycling and contractility in patients taking β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, without concomitant arrhythmogenic effects. On the other hand, PDE3A-136 is the only isoform containing the site for phosphorylation and activation by PK-B, an anti-apoptotic effector in cardiac myocytes (32Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 33Wu W. Lee W.L., Wu, Y.Y. Chen D. Liu T.J. Jang A. Sharma P.M. Wang P.H. J. Biol.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation and stimulation of PDE3A-136 by PK-B may therefore be an anti-apoptotic event, and deleterious long term effects of PDE3 inhibition in dilated cardiomyopathy might be related specifically to inhibition of this isoform. If so, selective PDE3A-136 activators might be useful therapeutic agents. Experiments designed to identify the specific PK-A substrates whose phosphorylation is regulated by individual PDE3A isoforms are a logical next step in extending our observations. At a more basic level, our observations regarding the two PDE3A mRNAs in cardiac and vascular myocytes and the N-terminal deletions in the three PDE3A protein isoforms indicate that the specific mechanisms by which the latter are generated from their cognate mRNAs are complex. PDE3A-136 migrates on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight higher than that of the rtPDE3A generated from ATG2 but lower than that of the rtPDE3A generated from ATG1. PDE3A-136 may therefore be generated from PDE3A1 either by translation from AUG1 followed by targeted N-terminal proteolysis or by translation from AUG2 followed by some post-translational modification that reduces its electrophoretic mobility. Similarly, PDE3A-118 might be generated from PDE3A2 mRNA by translation from AUG4, the third AUG in the ORF predicted by the cloned cDNA (16Choi Y.-H. Ekholm D. Krall J. Ahmad F. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. Movsesian M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), or by translation from AUG2 or AUG3 followed by targeted N-terminal proteolysis, whereas PDE3A-94 could be generated from PDE3A2 mRNA either by translation from AUG7/8 or by translation from a more upstream AUG followed by proteolytic removal of a more extensive length of N-terminal sequence. The possibility that PDE3A-118 and PDE3A-94 are generated from the same mRNA by alternative translational processing in vivoseems plausible given our observation that a PDE3A-94-like protein is generated from longer constructs by translation from downstream AUGsin vitro. Furthermore, a paradigm exists in the case of the PDE4 family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases: these enzymes have structurally similar C-terminal catalytic regions, but differences in their N-terminal sequences resulting from alternative splicing result in differences in intracellular targeting, regulation by phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions (35McPhee I. Yarwood S.J. Scotland G. Huston E. Beard M.B. Ross A.H. Houslay E.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

On the other hand, proteolysis of the N terminus of PDE4A5 by caspase-3 during apoptosis removes an Src homology 3-binding domain and alters its intracellular distribution, and this example may be a paradigm for the generation of PDE3A isoforms by targeted proteolysis (39Huston E.

Other investigators have identified a protein resembling PDE3A-94 in placenta that is translated from a third PDE3A mRNA, PDE3A3, that is generated from the PDE3A gene by transcription from a site downstream from the PDE3A2 start site (40Kasuya J. Goko H. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14305-14312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our data do not indicate that this mRNA, which is ∼4.4 kb in length, is present in cardiac myocytes. These considerations are of therapeutic interest because agents capable of altering the transcription or translation of individual PDE3A isoforms may have the same advantages as agents capable of selectively activating or inhibiting their activities. For this reason, further delineation of the transcriptional, translational, and/or post-translational mechanisms through which the generation of PDE3A mRNAs and proteins are regulated is an important future direction. We are indebted to Todd Peterson and Mary Scriven for assistance in preparing the figures and to Mark L. Entman and Feraydoon Niroomand for their advice."
https://openalex.org/W1991927235,"After synaptic vesicles (SVs) undergo exocytosis, SV pools are replenished by recycling SVs at nerve terminals. At Drosophila neuromuscular synapses, there are two distinct SV pools (i.e., the exo/endo cycling pool (ECP), which primarily maintains synaptic transmission, and the reserve pool (RP), which participates in synaptic transmission only during tetanic stimulation). Labeling endocytosed vesicular structures with a fluorescent styryl dye, FM1-43, and measuring intracellular Ca2+ concentrations with a Ca2+ indicator, rhod-2, we show here that the ECP is replenished by SVs endocytosed during stimulation, and this process depends on external Ca2+. In contrast, the RP is refilled after cessation of tetanus by a process mediated by Ca2+ released from internal stores."
https://openalex.org/W2048750292,"The anterior medial prefrontal cortex (AMPC) in humans is involved in affect and in regulating goal-directed behaviors. The precise function of the AMPC, however, is poorly understood. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we found that bilateral regions in the AMPC were selectively recruited to compute the reliability of subjects' expectations that developed when subjects were learning sequences of cognitive tasks. In contrast, regions similarly recruited in learning sequences of motor acts were found in the ventral striatum. Our results show that beyond the execution of motor acts, the AMPC is selectively engaged in computing the relevance of cognitive goals that subjects intend to achieve. This indicates that the fronto-striatal circuit, including the ventral striatum and AMPC, subserves hierarchically distinct evaluative processes mediating the human ability to build behavioral plans, ranging from motor to cognitive action plans."

In this study, we have cloned a second isoform named SREC-II and shown that there is a heterophilic interaction between SREC-I and -II at their extracellular domains. The cDNA for murine SREC-II encodes an 834-amino acid protein with 35% homology to SREC-I.

There are several different classes of scavenger receptors in mammalian cells, and their relative contributions to lipid metabolism in pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis have been the subject of intense investigation (2Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The first scavenger receptors to be purified and cloned were class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) expressed in macrophages (3Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M.

This demonstrates the involvement of SR-A in in vivoatherosclerosis. SR-A also participates in host defense activities by recognizing and mediating the endocytosis of pathogenic substances (7Krieger M. Trends Biochem.

Some forms of bacterial endotoxin are SR-A ligands, and SR-A-mediated uptake of endotoxin in vivo can play a significant role in endotoxin clearance (10Hampton R.Y. Golenbock D.T. Penman M. Krieger M. Raetz C.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Therefore, SR-A-deficient mice exhibit an enhanced susceptibility to pathogens (5Suzuki H. Kurihara Y.

Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) was initially identified in an expression cloning study that used AcLDL as the ligand (11Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and now is recognized as a physiologically relevant HDL receptor (12Acton S.L. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1997; 271: 518-520Crossref Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). SR-BI facilitates the cellular uptake of cholesteryl esters from the hydrophobic cores of HDL by a mechanism that markedly differs from that of other lipoprotein receptors. It does not involve the internalization of the intact lipoprotein particle and its subsequent degradation. SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from the hydrophobic core of the lipoprotein into the cell but not the apoprotein at the surface of the HDL. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SR-BI in the liver leads to reduced plasma HDL levels and increased cholesterol secretion into bile (13Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). SR-BI-null knockout mice (14Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc.

Most recently, it has also been demonstrated that SR-BI expressed on the surface of endothelial cells mediates endothelial nitric oxide synthase, resulting in increased nitric oxide production that may be essential for the athero-protective properties of HDL (15Yuhanna I.S.

These and other findings demonstrate that scavenger receptors, in addition to having a role in the metabolism of modified LDLs, have a plurifunctional pathophysiology. Endothelial cells express several distinct scavenger receptors. In our previous work, we cloned a novel scavenger receptor from cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, termed SREC (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells) (17Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which have been renamed SREC-I here. SREC-I has no significant homology to other types of scavenger receptors but has unique domain structures. It contains 10 repeats of EGF-like cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain. Recently, the structure of SREC-I was shown to be similar to that of a transmembrane protein with 16 EGF-like repeats encoded by theCaenorhabditis elegans gene ced-I, which functions as a cell surface phagocytic receptor that recognizes apoptotic cells (18Zhou Z. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In the course of study elucidating the functional characteristics of SREC-I, we have cloned a novel gene that shows significant homology to SREC-I by searching the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. In this paper, we describe the sequence and functional characterization of this unique protein termed SREC-II. Our results suggest that although SREC-II has little scavenger receptor activity, it undergoes a heterophilic trans-interaction with SREC-I in which the interaction takes place at the extracellular domains of these two proteins. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Murine fibroblast cell line L cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. LDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) was isolated from fresh human plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation (19Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). AcLDL and OxLDL were then prepared as described (20Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Human AcLDL labeled with the fluorescent probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchrate (DiI-AcLDL) was obtained from Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA. DiI-labeled OxLDL (DiI-OxLDL) was a kind gift from Dr. T. Sawamura of the National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute (Osaka, Japan). The nucleotide sequence of human SREC-I was used as a probe to search the GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ data base of bacterial artificial chromosome(BAC) using the TBLASTN program. Using the BAC clone of bd3–6 (accession number AC000096) as a probe, the partial nucleotide sequences of cDNA encoding peptides with homology to SREC-I were found in the EST data base of GenBankTM. Then, the EST clone, AA266135, was used as a probe to screen a murine lung Lambda cDNA library (Stratagene). LambdaZAPII bacteriophages were plated at a density of ∼5 × 104 plaque forming unit/100-mm plate. They were transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne A, Pall) and then hybridized using a 32P-labeled probe as described. The DNA sequence was determined using the method of Sanger et al. (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) using Big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencer. TheEcoRI/NotI fragment of the SREC-I cDNA and the EcoRI/XbaX fragment of the SREC-II cDNA were subcloned into the pcDNA3, and expression plasmids termed pcDNA3-SREC-I and pcDNA3-SREC-II, respectively, were obtained. CHO and L cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA-SREC-I or -II using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CHO cells grown near to confluent in 24-well plates were mock transfected or transfected with either pcDNA3-SREC-I or pcDNA3-SREC-II and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Then, cells were further incubated with 2 mg/ml DiI-AcLDL or DiI-OxLDL for 4 h. After washing and cell solubilization by SDS, cell-associated fluorescence was measured by a spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-2000) at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm and an emission of 550 nm. The data are shown as the means ± S.D. of four independent experiments. L cells (4 × 105cells/well) in 6-well plates were mock transfected or transfected with either pcDNA3-SREC-I or -II and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. Cell aggregation assay was performed essentially as described (see Ref. 22Aoki J. Koike S. Asou H. Ise I. Suwa H. Tanaka T. Miysaka M. Nomoto A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured L cells were released from the plates with trypsin (0.25%)-EDTA (1 mm) treatment and were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 1 × 106 cells/ml in polystyrene tubes. Then, tubes were gently rotated at 37 °C for 1 h. The extent of cell aggregation was viewed microscopically and photographed. For quantitation, cell clusters of more than four cells were considered as aggregated ones. The data are shown as the means ± S.D. of four independent experiments. To identify sequences similar to the human SREC-I gene, we examined the human and murine genome databases prepared in BAC. We identified the BAC clone of b562f10 (accession number AC007731) and bd3–6 (AC000096) on human chromosome 22 and murine chromosome 16, respectively, as sequences showing significant similarity to the extracellular domain of SREC-I. We further searched the EST data base for tags that are homologous to these two fragments, and we found two human (AI401171 andAA234558) and three murine (AA245496, AA266135 and AA024015) ESTs that encode novel peptides with significant amino acid homology to SREC-I. Several clones were isolated from a murine lung cDNA library usingAA245496 as a probe. Sequence analysis of the longest cDNA demonstrated that three of the murine EST clones were fragments of the same gene. The murine cDNA comprising 3,310 base pairs consists of an open reading frame of 2,502 base pairs, ending with a TAA stop codon at nucleotides 2,598–2,600, followed by a 3′-poly(A) tail. The first ATG triplet was determined by alignment with SREC-I, and the putative signal peptide was detected by hydropathy analysis (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17216) Google Scholar). Because the protein encoded by the cDNA showed 35% overall homology to SREC, we have termed it SREC-II, and thereafter SREC was renamed SREC-I. Subsequently, the human SREC-II sequence was determined by searching the vicinity of the human chromosome 22q11 containing sequences homologous to murine SREC-II. Considering the GT-AG rule, we estimated the exon-intron junctions, and in analogy with the murine sequence the amino acid sequence of human SREC-II was determined. The homology between murine and human SREC-II, as revealed by the GENETYX-MAC program, is 81.6%. Fig.1 A shows the amino acid sequences deduced from murine and human SREC-I and -II cDNA. The predicted translation product of murine SREC-II encodes a protein of 834 amino acids. It has two hydrophobic regions located at the N terminus and in the middle of the protein, which may serve as a signal sequence and a transmembrane domain, respectively, suggesting that SREC-II is a type I transmembrane protein. Indeed, the N-terminal half of the molecule has two potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 B). As in the case of SREC-I, this putative extracellular domain is composed of 10 EGF-like repeats, five of which (segments 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9) fit the consensus sequence for the EGF-like domain (CXCXXXXXGXXC) exactly (17Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The putative transmembrane domain located at the middle of the protein is followed by a cytoplasmic domain rich in serine (12.6%) and proline (12.6%). Moreover, the intracellular portion contains 13 potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A, C, or G, suggesting that some biological signals are delivered viathis domain. It is noteworthy that the intracellular domain of SREC-II is rich in positively charged residues (i.e. arginine and lysine). The arginine + lysine content is 14.7% in murine SREC-II and 16.4% in human SREC-II. Considering these structural similarities, we suggest here that both SREC-I and -II are members of the type F scavenger receptor family (2Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A high degree of homology (about 50%) was observed between the extracellular domains of SREC-I and -II. On the other hand, the intracellular domains were less homologous, and only about 20% homology was revealed by the GENETYX-MAC program. These results suggest that although the extracellular domains share some biological functions, different signals are delivered by the intracellular domains. The tissue distribution of human SREC-II was compared with that of human SREC-I by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, transcripts of SREC-I and -II were both detected at around 3.5 kb and exhibited similar tissue distributions. Both receptors were expressed predominantly in heart, placenta, lung, kidney, spleen, small intestine, and ovary. To verify the biological functions of SREC-II, we first compared the ability of modified LDL uptake between SREC-I and -II. The expression plasmid containing either murine SREC-I or murine SREC-II cDNA (pcDNA3-SREC-I or pcDNA3-SREC-II) was transfected into CHO cells, and the transfectants were incubated with DiI-AcLDL (Fig.3 A). As a positive control, SR-BI was also transfected. As reported previously, expression of SREC-I in CHO cells caused approximately a 24-fold increase in DiI uptake measured by fluorescence intensity. In contrast, little increase was detected when SREC-II was expressed in the cells. The expression levels of SREC-I and -II were approximately the same as verified by Myc-tagged receptors followed by Myc antibody staining (data not shown). We also measured the uptake of DiI-OxLDL and found that although there was a 12-fold increase in the uptake of DiI in SREC-I-expressing cells, no increase was detected in SREC-II-expressing cells (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that whereas SREC-I bound to and internalized modified LDL efficiently, SREC-II-mediated uptake was marginal, implying that SREC-II had little scavenger receptor activity. Because certain EGF-like repeats have been shown to mediate homo- or heterophilic protein-protein interactions (24Bromquist M.C. Hunt L.T. Barker W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7363-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we next examined the effects of SREC-I on cell-cell interaction employing the cell aggregation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Monolayer cultures of L cells transfected with or without pcDNA-SREC-I were dissociated into single cells. When the suspensions were gently shaken, L cells expressing SREC-I tended to aggregate. In this assay system, about 30% of the cells were microscopically aggregated after an hour of shaking (Fig. 4 b). Remarkably, only cells taking up DiI formed large aggregations when the assay was performed after incubation with DiI-AcLDL (Fig. 4 b′), suggesting that the aggregation occurred by a homophilic interaction between SREC-I on the respective L cell surface. In control L cells that were transfected with the pcDNA plasmid alone, about 10% spontaneous aggregation was microscopically observed, and the aggregates usually contained only 2–5 cells (Fig.4 a). SREC-I contains a large cytoplasmic domain consisting of about 400 amino acids. The following investigation was performed to determine the influence of this domain on AcLDL uptake and L cell aggregation (Fig. 5). Deletions of SREC-1 with missing C-terminal fragments of 170 and 370 amino acids (corresponding to deletions of about half and almost all of the cytoplasmic domain) were created, and their functions were determined. The results showed that the cytoplasmic domain has practically no effect on either assessed function, indicating that the intracellular domain has no major effect on the described functions of SREC-I. Fig. 6 A shows the homo- and heterophilic interaction of SRECs visualized by an aggregation assay. The extent of the SREC-II-mediated aggregation was significantly less than that of SREC-I. Only about 15% of L cells were aggregated under the same conditions as shown in Fig. 6 B. To our surprise, intensive aggregation was observed when SREC-I-expressing cells were mixed with those expressing SREC-II, with about 70% of the cells forming relatively large aggregates. About half of the cells in aggregated cell clusters showed DiI fluorescence after incubation with DiI-AcLDL (note identical cell clusters with and without fluorescence in Fig. 6 C). Because SREC-I-expressing cells fluoresced when treated with DiI-AcLDL and SREC-II-expressing cells did not, this experiment showed that both SREC-I- and SREC-II-expressing cells are involved in the formation of these cell clusters. The heterophilic interaction between SREC-I and -II was therefore far more intensive than the homophilic interaction and thus mediated the drastic increase in cell-cell association. Because AcLDL and OxLDL are well known ligands of SREC-I (17Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of these ligands on cell aggregation induced by the heterophilic interaction between SREC-I and -II. Cell aggregation was nearly completely inhibited in the presence of either AcLDL (Fig. 7 b) or OxLDL (Fig. 7 c), suggesting that the binding sites for modified LDL on SREC-I (and similar binding sites on SREC-II if any are present), were identical to or overlapping with those responsible for the homophilic and heterophilic interactions. In this paper, we have isolated a new member of the type F scavenger receptor family, named SREC-II. By definition, SREC-II may not belong to the scavenger receptor family because of the fact that unlike SREC I, SREC-II does not recognize AcLDL or OxLDL, which are typical ligands for scavenger receptors. We propose that SREC-I is a probable natural ligand for SREC-II and vice versa. L cells are commonly used in experiments demonstrating trans-receptor/receptor interactions, i.e. cadherins (26Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M.

Chem. 1992; 90: 55-62Google Scholar). Employing this system, we have demonstrated that the SREC-I/II heterophilic trans-interaction is more intense than the SREC-I/I homophilic trans-interaction. SREC-I and -II are coexpressed in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) (data not shown). The similar tissue distribution patterns of SREC-I and -II provide some support for the existence of a SREC-I and -II heterophilic interaction in vivo. It is not surprising that scavenger receptors function as adhesion molecules. Gordon and colleagues (30Fraser I. Hughes D. Gordon S.

SR-A also mediates macrophage association to activated lymphocytes (31Yokota T. Ehlin-Henriksson B. Hansson G.K. Exp.

LOX-1, another member of the scavenger receptors expressed by endothelial cells, can support rolling and adhesion of leukocytes at later stages of leukocyte-endothelium interaction (37Hayashida K. Kume N. Minami M. Kita T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SREC-I and -II, which belong to the same class F SR family, may be an example exhibiting direct receptor-receptor trans-interaction between separate cells through extracellular domains. The SR-F receptor family is also characterized by the presence of extremely large cytoplasmic domains when compared with other scavenger receptor families. A computer analysis revealed that some of these serine residues are potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinases A, C, and G. These structural features indicate that the cytoplasmic domains play a role in transducing intracellular signals other than receptor endocytosis. Indeed, we have preliminary observations that certain serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I are phosphorylated when expressed in L cells (data not shown). Moreover, when SREC-I is overexpressed in L cells, the cells form long processes 2 days after transfection. This effect only occurs when the cytoplasmic domain is present. These observations suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-I is involved in the regulation of intracellular cytoskeletal organization (data not shown). SREC-I and -II may transduce different signals due to low sequence similarity and different potential phosphorylation sites. It should also be noted that the cytoplasmic domain of SREC-II, unlike that of SREC-I, is rich in positively charged residues such as arginine and lysine. This may indicate that the cytoplasmic domains of SREC-I and -II interact with different cellular proteins. The physiological function of the trans-interaction of SREC-I and -II are totally unknown at present. It is possible that homo- and heterophilic interactions between SREC-I and -II play a role in the adherence of endothelial cells and the adhesion of circulating monocytes to endothelial cells in some inflammatory conditions (38Wahl S.M. Feldman G.M. McCarthy J.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the cytoplasmic domain is not required for SREC-mediated cell-cell interactions, it is possible that formation and dissociation of the trans-interaction between SREC-I and -II delivers a signal to the cytoplasmic domains and transduces this signal to intracellular components such as the cytoskeletal system. Further studies are needed for elucidating the pathophysiological function, inter-, and intracellular signaling mediated by SRECs. OxLDL promotes atherogenesis by supplying cholesterol and by generating agents that activate macrophages, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Moreover, it is well known that OxLDL induces a variety of cellular responses in vascular wall cells and circulating cells. For example, OxLDL is a chemoattractant for endothelial cells and T-lymphocytes (39Murugesan G. Chisolm G.M. Fox P.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,40McMurray H.F. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It increases the expression of VCAM-1 and P-selectin and the release of endothelin and interleukin-8 (41Khan B.V.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it potentiates the growth of macrophages and smooth muscle cells (45Yui S. Sasaki T. Miyazaki A. Horiuchi S. Yamazaki M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 46Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin.

Biol. 1997; 17: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that OxLDL effectively dissociates the heterophilic trans-interaction of SREC-I and -II. We therefore propose that another pathological function of OxLDL is the ability to disrupt intercellular receptor/receptor interactions, as was shown to be the case with SREC in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2113788562,"The importance of voltage-activated calcium channels in pain processing has been suggested by the spinal antinociceptive action of blockers of N- and P/Q-type calcium channels as well as by gene targeting of the α1B subunit (N-type). The accessory β3 subunits of calcium channels are preferentially associated with the α1B subunit in neurones. Here we show that deletion of the β3 subunit by gene targeting affects strongly the pain processing of mutant mice. We pinpoint this defect in the pain-related behavior and ascending pain pathways of the spinal cordin vivo and at the level of calcium channel currents and proteins in single dorsal root ganglion neurones in vitro. The pain induced by chemical inflammation is preferentially damped by deletion of β3 subunits, whereas responses to acute thermal and mechanical harmful stimuli are reduced moderately or not at all, respectively. The defect results in a weak wind-up of spinal cord activity during intense afferent nerve stimulation. The molecular mechanism responsible for the phenotype was traced to low expression of N-type calcium channels (α1B) and functional alterations of calcium channel currents in neurones projecting to the spinal cord.

Voltage-activated calcium channels represent a family of ionic channels that play a crucial role in the nervous system by controlling membrane excitability and neurotransmitter release. Neurones express L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-type calcium channels, which are composed of the pore-forming subunit α1 and the accessory subunits β, α2δ, (1Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Google Scholar,2Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Google Scholar) and probably γ (3Kang M.G. Chen C.C. Felix R. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32917-32924Google Scholar). The importance of α1D (L-type), α1B (N-type), α1A (P/Q-type), and α1E (probably R-type) for the function of the nervous system in vivo is underlined by recent studies with genetically engineered mice (4Muth J.N. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Science. 2001; 22: 526-532Google Scholar). By contrast, thein vivo function of the four known β subunits (β1, β2, β3, β4) of calcium channels is less understood. In heterologous expression systems, β subunits are required for the functional expression of α1 subunits (5Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27975-27978Google Scholar, 6Brice N.L.

Additionally, β subunits have been implicated in the modulation of calcium channels by G proteins (12Schneider T. Igelmund P. Hescheler J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 8-11Google Scholar, 13Dolphin A.C. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1998; 506: 3-11Google Scholar, 14Dascal N. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 391-398Google Scholar). In vivo, the expression of β subunits is modified in pathological states such as cardiac dysfunction (15Hullin R. Asmus F. Ludwig A. Hersel J. Boekstegers P. Circulation. 1999; 100: 155-163Google Scholar) and diabetes (16Iwashima Y. Abiko A. Ushikubi F. Hata A. Kaku K. Sano H. Eto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 923-932Google Scholar). A natural occurring mutation of β4 is associated with ataxia and absence seizures in lethargic (lh/lh) mice, and this mutation modifies N- and P/Q-type calcium channels in the brain (17Burgess D.L. Biddlecome G.H. McDonough S.I. Diaz M.E. Zilinski C.A. Bean B.P. Campbell K.P. Noebels J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 293-311Google Scholar). The targeted disruption of β1 is lethal (18Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13961-13966Google Scholar). In sympathetic neurones of β3-deficient mice, N- and L-type calcium channel currents are reduced, the activation of P/Q type calcium channels is altered, and no difference appears concerning inhibitory effects of norepinephrine on calcium channel currents (19Namkung Y. Smith S.M. Lee S.B. Skrypnyk N.V. Kim H.-L. Chin H. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12010-12015Google Scholar). Such alterations of calcium channel currents in sympathetic neurones might be related to the cardiovascular phenotype of mice lacking the β3 subunit (20Murakami M. Yamamura H. Murakami A. Okamura T. Nunoki K. Mitui-Saito M. Muraki K. Hano T. Imaizumi Y. Flockerzi T. Yanagisawa T. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 36: S69-S73Google Scholar). Yet, the in vivo functions of the β3 subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels are not well established. As the α1B subunit of N-type calcium channels is primarily associated with the β3 subunit in neurones (21Scott V.E. DeWaard M. Liu H. Gurnett C.A. Venzke D.P. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3207-3212Google Scholar, 22Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Google Scholar), an altered neurotransmitter release at synaptic sites may be expected in the β3-deficient mice. Specifically, blockade of N-type calcium channels inhibits tachykinin release from afferent sensory nerves (23Morimoto H. Matsuda A. Ohori M. Fujii T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 71: 161-166Google Scholar). Within the spinal cord, N-type calcium channels show the highest density in the superficial laminae (24Kerr L.M. Filloux F. Olivera B.M. Jackson H. Wamsley J.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 146: 181-183Google Scholar, 25Gohil K. Bell J.R. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G.P. Brain Res. 1994; 653: 258-266Google Scholar). Accordingly, deletion of the α1B subunit (Cav 2.2) (26Saegusa H. Kurihara T. Zong S. Kazuno A. Matsuda Y. Nonaka T. Han W. Toriyama H. Tanabe T.

Neurosci. 2001; 18: 235-245Google Scholar) and intrathecal injection of the N-type channel blocker, ω-conotoxin GVIA (29Vanegas H. Schaible H. Pain. 2000; 85: 9-18Google Scholar), reduce the behavior associated with pain in rodents. Furthermore, the β3 subunit might also associate with α1A subunits to form P/Q-type calcium channels, which are present in the deeper laminae of the spinal cord (30Westenbroek R.E. Hoskins L. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6319-6330Google Scholar) and might be involved in nociceptive processing (29Vanegas H. Schaible H. Pain. 2000; 85: 9-18Google Scholar). In the present study, we examine the possible function of β3 subunits in nociception and sensory processing using a mouse model in which the β3 subunit has genetically been deleted. Because dorsal root ganglions (DRG) 1The abbreviations used are: DRG, dorsal root ganglions; ES, embryonic stem; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CFA, Freund's adjuvant; pps, pulses per second; N, newton. 1The abbreviations used are: DRG, dorsal root ganglions; ES, embryonic stem; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CFA, Freund's adjuvant; pps, pulses per second; N, newton. contain the cell bodies of afferent sensory fibers and predominantly express N-type calcium channel currents (31Carbone E. Lux H.D. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1987; 386: 547-570Google Scholar), binding assays, and pharmacological testing on DRG neurones with the selective marker of N-type channels, ω-conotoxin GVIA, were used to determine the expression of α1B in DRG neurones. We have also explored for changes in the voltage dependence and G protein modulation of calcium channel currents in isolated DRG neurones. In vivo, we analyzed the pain-related behavior and the spinal cord response to an intense and persistent barrage of afferent nociceptive impulses (wind-up). The organization of the β3 gene (32Murakami M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 138-143Google Scholar) and the targeting vector used to generate null mutations of the β3 gene are shown in Fig. 1. Linearized targeting constructs were electroporated into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells, and the cells were selected with G418 and ganciclovir. We identified 3 of 470 ES cell clones with predicted genomic structures for the targeting vector IIMB. Selected ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and transferred into the uteri of pseudopregnant recipient females. Two independent ES cell clones were transmitted through the germ line. Mice were kept in essentially specific pathogen-free environment. Nucleotides 1269–1857 (aa 403–597) of β1b (33Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-cgg gat ccg agt act tgg aag cct act g, and the reverse primer, 5′-cgg aat tct cag cgg atg tag acg cct t. The amplified cDNA was ligated into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T2 (AmershamBiosciences). The accuracy was confirmed by sequencing both strands. BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli were transformed with pGEX-4AT2-β1b, and protein expression was carried out as previously described (34Marquart A. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 137-140Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (584KNELEGWGQGVYIR597) of β1b (33Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Google Scholar) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for injection into rabbit 234. Antibody 234 recognizes the GST-β1b fusion protein (M r ∼59,000) and native β1b in brain and skeletal muscle (M r ∼72,000). It does not recognize a GST-β1a fusion protein (M r∼33,000) or native β1a (M r ∼52,000), which is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Other antibodies have been described previously (22Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Google Scholar). Immunoblots were repeated up to six times. Pooled tissue from up to three animals (brain microsomes) and up to 20 animals (DRGs) per genotype, respectively, were processed. The data shown (Fig. 1, D–E) represent independent, non-stripped, and non-reused blots. The test for nociception were performed as described (35De Felipe C. Herrero J.F. O'Brien J.A. Palmer J.A. Doyle C.A. Smith A.J.H. Laird J.M.A. Belmonte C. Cervero F. Hunt S.P. Nature. 1998; 392: 394-397Google Scholar). The tail flick response was evoked by a light beam (irradiated heat) or by immersing two thirds of the tail in water at 52 °C. In the hot plate test, mice were placed on a plate (56 °C), and responses were counted when the mouse first licked the hind paws and jumped from the plate (cut-off time, 30 and 60s, respectively). Formalin (25 μl; 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) was injected into the plantar surface of the left hind paw. The time spent licking or biting the injected paw was recorded as the nociceptive score. Inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of 10 μl of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA, 0.5 mg/ml Mycobacterium butyricum in paraffin oil and emulsifying agent) into the plantar surface of the left hind paw under short anesthesia with diethyl ether. Before and 60 h after the CFA injection, the animals were placed on a raised grid, and mechanical thresholds were measured using calibrated von Frey hairs. In the rotorod test, mice were trained on the rod for 1 min at rest and 5 min at 16 rpm, and 1 min at rest and 5 min at 24 rpm. For the test, mice were placed on the apparatus facing away from the experimenter and in the direction opposite to the rotating rod while it was moving at 32 rpm (cut off time 5 min). The tests were performed with adult male mice. The genotype of the animals was unknown to the investigator during the tests. Adult male mice (30–40 g) of both genotypes were used for extracellular unit recordings. The anesthesia was induced with diethyl ether and subsequently with pentobarbital (intraperitoneal 0.5 mg/10 g of body weight). To control the deep of anesthesia, the tail vein was canulated, and pentobarbital was given in the form of intravenous bolus (0.05 mg/10 g of body weight) every 20–25 min during the experiment. A laminectomy was performed to expose the spinal segments Th8-Th10, and the thoraxic vertebras were fixed with spinal hooks in a stereotaxic frame. The left sural nerve was exposed and placed on a bipolar electrode for stimulation (Grass). The experiments were started after a recovery period of 30–45 min. Extracellular recordings were made with tungsten microelectrodes of 5 megohms resistance (WPI, Berlin, Germany) contralateral to the stimulated nerve (i.e. in the right spinal cord). Initially, the microelectrode was placed 350–500 μm lateral to the median dorsal spinal vein in the spinal segment Th8 and carefully inserted just under the surface. To search for responsive units, the electrode was driven from this zero point deep through the spinal cord and trains of 50-V pulses (5 ms long) were regularly delivered to the sural nerve. We used a frequency of 0.2 pulses per second (pps) in this searching phase to prevent wind-up. If the test pulses did not evoke spikes within driving distances of maximally 250 μm, the electrode was removed and the searching phase was reinitiated from a new zero point caudal to a previous one. When the test pulses evoked spikes, we first rule out the contribution of receptive fields by stimulating mechanically (brush, pinch) the skin of the back and hind paws on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides of recording. Because the sural nerve was cut distal to the bipolar electrode, responsive units were used for further analysis when no response to cutaneous stimulation was observed. The thresholds were determined with a series of 12 pulses of amplitudes between 10 V and 100 V (5 ms long, 0.2 pps). The wind-up was finally evoked with 50-V pulses (5 ms long) delivered for 16 s at 1 pps. Data were collected and analyzed using the Chart software for the PowerLab system (ADInstruments). DRGs were obtained from adult wild type and β3−/− mice, and neurons were dissociated by incubation in the presence of trypsin type I (0.67 mg/ml medium; Sigma) and collagenase type II (4 mg/ml medium; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) for 20 min. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min, the supernatant withdrawn, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by 10% fetal calf serum was added. Isolated neurones were plated onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass cover slips and kept in an incubator. Electrophysiological experiments were performed within 4–16 h after dissociation. For electrophysiological recordings glass cover slips were placed into a recording chamber and mounted on an inverted microscope. Cells were perfused with extracellular solution, and electrophysiological recordings were started after 10 min. DRG neurons were identified based on their typical morphology using a 40× phase contrast objective. Ba2+ currents (IBa) from wild type and β3−/− DRG neurons were recorded using standard whole cell recording techniques (36Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). IBa was recorded with an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA). Upon establishment of the whole cell configuration, series resistance, fast and slow capacitance components were compensated using the internal circuit of the EPC-9 amplifier. The currents were leak-subtracted by applying n/4 correction mode. Data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 3.3 kHz. Data were analyzed off line using the Pulse-Fit (HEKA) software package. For further analysis, current traces were imported into Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific). For display current traces were transferred to CorelDraw (Corel Graphics). All patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature. Pipettes of 2–3 megohms resistance were prepared on a DMZ Universal Puller from 1.5 mm borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical Instruments). The composition of the recording solutions used was the following (in mm): intracellular solution, CsCl 95, CsSO4 40, tetraethylammonium chloride 20, CaCl2 1, EGTA 10, Mg-ATP 3, Hepes 10 pH 7.3 (CsOH); extracellular solution, tetraethylammonium hydroxide 135, BaCl2 10, MgCl2 1.2, Hepes 10, pH 7.4 (tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Whole dorsal root ganglions were isolated and homogenized in 5 volumes of 5 mmTRIS-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mix (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmphenanthroline, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Equilibrium binding of 125I-labeled ω-conotoxin GVIA (Amersham Biosciences) in the absence and presence of 10 nm unlabeled ω-conotoxin GVIA was performed in duplicate at a total incubation volume of 500 μl containing 10 μg of protein. Binding to isolated DRG neurones was performed as follows: intact neurones were incubated in the presence of 50 pm125I-labeled ω-conotoxin GVIA for 2 h and then washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding measured in the presence of 200 nm unlabeled ω-conotoxin GVIA was less than 20% of total binding. ω-Conotoxin GVIA binding has been quantified by non-linear regression analysis using the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software. The β3 gene (Fig. 1 A) was mutated by replacing part of its exon 3 and the complete exon 4 (32Murakami M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 138-143Google Scholar) with a neomycin resistance gene (neo r). Breeding of heterozygous mice generated β3 homozygous (β3−/−) mice at the rate expected from the Mendelian frequency (160 +/+, 307 +/− and 144 −/−). The β3−/− mice grew normally, lived longer than one year, were fertile, and had no obvious symptoms. Offspring were genotyped for the β3 mutation by Southern blot analysis. Wild type and mutant alleles were indicated by the presence of a 12- and 8-kbEcoRI fragment, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The deletion of the β3 gene was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig.1 C) and immunoblotting of brain extracts (Fig.1 D). Additionally, we found no significant differences between wild type and β3−/− mice in the expression levels of β1, β2, and β4 proteins in whole brain (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that there was no apparent compensatory increase of the expression of other β subunits. Furthermore, it is likely that β3 subunits are also expressed in other parts of the nervous system. The DRGs contain cell bodies of primary afferent sensory fibers, including myelinated A fibers and unmyelinated C fibers, which project into the spinal cord. Thus, DRG neurones represent a central component of pain pathways, and additionally, isolated DRG neurones represent a well known cell system in studies of neuronal calcium channels (31Carbone E. Lux H.D. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1987; 386: 547-570Google Scholar). Because the expression pattern of β subunits in DRG neurones is not known, we analyzed extracts of isolated DRGs using specific antibodies. Western blot analysis detected the β3 protein in DRGs from control animals but not from β3−/− mice (Fig. 1 E). These results indicate that the gene targeting strategy used in the present study results in suppression of β3 protein expression in the DRGs of the adult animals that were selected for further experiments. The protein level of the β1, β2, and β4 subunits was very low but detectable (Fig.1 E). As in brain extracts, no significant change in the expression level of β1, β2, and β4 was apparent in extracts of DRGs isolated from β3−/− mice. Because ablation of β3 suppresses the expression of β3 subunits in the brain and sensory neurones (Fig. 1), it is likely that the deletion of the β3 subunit might have an impact on neuronal functioning in various regions of the nervous system and, thus, at different levels of pain processing pathways. It is known that blockers of N-type calcium channels exert spinal antinociceptive actions (37Malmberg A.B. Yaksh T.L. Pain. 1995; 60: 83-90Google Scholar, 38Diaz A. Dickenson A.H. Pain. 1997; 69: 93-100Google Scholar, 39Murakami M. Nakagawasai O. Fujii S. Kameyama K. Murakami S. Hozumi S. Esashi A. Taniguchi R. Yanagisawa T. Tan-no K. Tadano T. Kitamura K. Kisara K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 419: 175-181Google Scholar). Additionally, P/Q-type calcium channels may be also involved in nociceptive processes at the spinal level (38Diaz A. Dickenson A.H. Pain. 1997; 69: 93-100Google Scholar, 40Malmberg A.B. Yaksh T.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4882-4890Google Scholar). Because β3 subunits associate to form N- and P/Q-type calcium channels (21Scott V.E. DeWaard M. Liu H. Gurnett C.A. Venzke D.P. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3207-3212Google Scholar, 22Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Google Scholar, 41Moreno H. Rudy B. Llinas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14042-14047Google Scholar), the suppression of β3 subunit expression (Fig. 1) likely produces major defects in the nociceptive pathway, and therefore, we analyzed the pain-related phenotype of the β3−/− mice in behavioral test for thermal, mechanical, and chemical nociception (42Wilson S.G. Mogil J.S. Behav. Brain. Res. 2001; 125: 65-73Google Scholar). Responses to acute thermal stimuli were studied using the tail flick (Fig. 2 A) and hot plate tests (Fig. 2 B). Tail flick is primarily a spinal reflex, whereas a substantial supraspinal component, which involves lifting and licking of the hind paw, is required in the hot plate assay (35De Felipe C. Herrero J.F. O'Brien J.A. Palmer J.A. Doyle C.A. Smith A.J.H. Laird J.M.A. Belmonte C. Cervero F. Hunt S.P. Nature. 1998; 392: 394-397Google Scholar). Tail flick latencies were longer in the β3−/− mice both when the tail was exposed to heat by irradiation and by immersion in water at 52 °C (Fig. 2 A). In the hot plate test, the latencies for licking were also increased and the delay for escape jumping was almost doubled in the β3−/− mice (Fig. 2 B). Thus, independent of whether spinal or supraspinal components are engaged in the nociceptive response, the thresholds for thermal stimuli appear to be higher in the β3−/− mice. By contrast, the responses to acute mechanical stimuli appear to be normal in the β3−/− mice since the mechanical thresholds measured with von Frey filaments were similar to the thresholds of wild type mice (Fig. 2 C; wild type, 8.12 ± 1.6 mN, n = 10; β3−/−, 6.15 ± 0.7 mN, n = 10). To study the role of the β3 subunit in persistent pain, we examine the behavior of β3−/− mice employing CFA and formalin. CFA was injected in the foot pad of the left hind paw and, within 24–60 h, induced swelling in the injected paw in wild type mice (injected paw, 2.35 ± 0.07 mm, contralateral side, 2.02 ± 0.07 mm, p < 0.05,n = 10) and β3−/− mice (injected paw, 2.47 ± 0.09 mm, contralateral side, 2.17 ± 0.06 mm, p < 0.05, n = 10). The degree of swelling of the injected paw was similar in both groups of mice. After 60 h, the mechanical thresholds measured on the ipsilateral injected paw (Fig.2 C; wild type, 1.65 ± 0.4 mN, n = 10; β3−/−, 1.40 ± 0.4 mN, n = 10) and on the contralateral paw (wild type, 5.21 ± 0.5 mN, n = 10; β3−/−, 3.87 ± 0.6 mN, n = 10) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in wild type and β3−/− mice when comparing them to the respective thresholds measured before the CFA injection (Fig. 2 C; wild type, 8.12 ± 1.6 mN, n = 10; β3−/−, 6.15 ± 0.7 mN, n = 10). Thus, CFA induced hyperalgesia on the ipsilateral and contralateral side of injection in both groups of animals. However, no difference between wild type and β3−/− mice was detected in the mechanical thresholds measured after CFA induced swelling. It appears, therefore, that β3 subunits are not critical for the development of hyperalgesia in the CFA-induced inflammatory pain. The neurochemical signature of the CFA-induced pain is the internalization of substance P receptors in laminae I, II-IV of the spinal cord (43Honoré P. Menning P.M. Rogers S.D. Nichols M.L. Basbaum A.I. Besson J.M. Mantyh P.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7670-7678Google Scholar). Considering that N-type calcium channels are primarily restricted to laminae I-II (24Kerr L.M. Filloux F. Olivera B.M. Jackson H. Wamsley J.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 146: 181-183Google Scholar, 25Gohil K. Bell J.R. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G.P. Brain Res. 1994; 653: 258-266Google Scholar) and P type channels are localized in deeper laminae (30Westenbroek R.E. Hoskins L. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6319-6330Google Scholar), it is likely that alterations of N-type channels in the β3−/− mice become more evident in specific assays of nociception, like the formalin-induced inflammation that is associated with internalization of substance P receptors in lamina I (43Honoré P. Menning P.M. Rogers S.D. Nichols M.L. Basbaum A.I. Besson J.M. Mantyh P.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7670-7678Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the responses of the β3−/− mice to chemical stimuli in the formalin test, which is also a well established model to study central sensitization events at the spinal level after peripheral inflammatory states (35De Felipe C. Herrero J.F. O'Brien J.A. Palmer J.A. Doyle C.A. Smith A.J.H. Laird J.M.A. Belmonte C. Cervero F. Hunt S.P. Nature. 1998; 392: 394-397Google Scholar). Subcutaneous injection of formalin in the hind paw elicits biphasic pain responses in wild type and β3−/− mice (Fig. 3 A). In phase 1, formalin stimulates the nociceptors generating acute pain, and in phase 2 the inflammation induced by formalin elicits persistent pain. Both, wild type and β3−/− mice behaved similarly in phase 1 but the nociceptive behavior during phase 2 was attenuated by 43% in β3−/− mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Because the tests for thermal, chemical, and mechanical nociception measure motor responses as end point, we examined possible motor/sedative defects in the β3−/− mice. In the rotorod test, the performance of wild type and β3−/− mice were indistinguishable (time on the rod: wild type, 64.62 ± 17.0 s, n = 8; β3−/−, 41.86 ± 9.8 s, n = 8), indicating that locomotor functions are not altered in the β3−/− mice, and thus, the behavioral tests used in the present study delineate the profile of nociception in the β3−/− mice. In summary, the β3−/− mice showed higher thresholds for acute thermal stimuli, but the responses to mechanical stimuli were not altered either before or after induction of inflammatory pain with CFA. The acute pain induced by formalin was not altered but the persistent pain observed in phase 2 of the formalin test was markedly reduced in the β3−/− mice.Figure 3Nociceptive behavior of wild type (+/+) and β3-deficient mice (−/−) after subcutaneous injection of formalin into the hind paw.

Among the multiple nociceptive pathways, the spinothalamic pathway originates primarily from neurones in the neck of the dorsal horn and terminates in the ventroposterior and ventrobasal thalamus (44Hunt S.P. Mantyh P.W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 83-91Google Scholar). Within the spinal cord, L-type calcium channels are present in the dorsal horn with a density comparable to brain areas. N-type calcium channels show the highest densities in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord (24Kerr L.M. Filloux F. Olivera B.M. Jackson H. Wamsley J.K. Eur. J.

The open reading frame encoded a hypothetical protein of 294 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 31,933, hence referred to as connexin-31.9 (Cx31.9) or α11 connexin. A clone in GenBankTM containing theCx31.9 gene localized to chromosome 17q21.2. Northern analysis of Cx31.9 showed a major 4.4-kilobase transcript, which was expressed at varying levels in all tissues analyzed. Two monoclonal antibodies generated against different domains of Cx31.9 recognized a 30–33-kDa protein from cells overexpressing Cx31.9. Immunofluorescence of overexpressing cells indicated the presence of Cx31.9 between adjacent cells, consistent with its localization to gap junctions. Double voltage clamp analyses of Cx31.9-overexpressing cells, and of paired Xenopus oocytes injected with Cx31.9 cRNA, demonstrated junctional currents indicative of gap junction channel formation. In contrast to previously characterized connexins, Cx31.9 showed no voltage-dependent gating within a physiologically relevant range. Cx31.9 was detected in human tissues by immunoblot analysis, and immunofluorescence localized Cx31.9 expression to vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Cx31.9 interacted with ZO-1. Thus, Cx31.9 represents a novel connexin gene that in vivo generates a protein with unique voltage gating properties.

The ability of cells to communicate in this manner is thought to be important for coordinating tissue growth, development, and physiological activities. Connexins are the sole proteins required for the formation of gap junctions (1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Six connexin monomers form a hemichannel (connexon) on the cell surface, which can interact with a connexon from a neighboring cell, thus forming a channel linking the cytoplasm of the two cells. A number of different connexin isoforms are found in vertebrates. The connexins characterized to date have distinct channel permeabilities and gating properties (2Elfgang C. Eckert R.

Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), as well as distinct cell and tissue expression patterns, which is presumed to orchestrate a spatially and temporally regulated diffusion of small molecules between cells. This has recently been demonstrated by studies of genetically altered mice, in which the expression of Cx431 was replaced by expression of Cx40 or Cx32. These mice differed functionally and morphologically from wild type mice, demonstrating that one connexin isoform cannot fully substitute for another (4Plum A. Hallas G. Magin T. Dombrowski F. Hagendorff A. Schumacher B. Wolpert C. Kim J. Lamers W.H. Evert M. Meda P. Traub O. Willecke K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1083-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Regulation of the diffusion of small molecules can be further modulated by combining different connexin isoforms in each hemichannel (heteromeric gap junctions) and by combining different hemichannels (heterotypic gap junctions), thus creating channels with highly specific permeability and gating properties. All connexin isoforms are presumed to have a similar topology, which has been deduced from limited proteolysis and site-directed antibodies (5Milks L.C. Kumar N.M. Houghten R. Unwin N. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1998; 7: 2967-2975Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains are localized in the cytoplasm, and are connected by four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic loop. The major diversity between different connexin isoforms is found in the length and amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic loop and COOH-terminal domains. Two nomenclature systems are in use to designate members of the connexin family; one is based on the theoretical molecular mass of the proteins preceded by “Cx” (6Beyer E.C. Reed K.E. Westphale E.M. Kanter H.L. Larson D.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the other is based on sequence similarity analysis, in which clustering groups of connexins are designated by Greek letters, and individual connexins in each group by the order in which they were cloned (7Gimlich R.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Most of the human connexins characterized so far have orthologues in mice (the organism with the most well characterized connexin expression), and presumably in all vertebrates. Other proteins have been reported to interact with connexins,e.g. v-Src and c-Src (8Loo L.W. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol.

ZO-1 is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase family member, which was first found associated with tight junctions, and later shown to bind directly to the tight junction components occludin (15Furuse M.

Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated guanylate kinase proteins are thought to be involved in localizing cell surface proteins to specialized membrane domains (17Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). They contain a varying number of PDZ (PSD-95, DLG, ZO-1) domains, a Src homology 3 domain, and an inactive guanylate kinase domain. PDZ domains bind to other proteins, mainly to the most COOH-terminal residues of the cell membrane proteins they recognize, although internal binding sequences have also been identified (18Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The second PDZ domain of ZO-1 has been shown to bind the COOH terminus of Cx43 (14Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Recently, Cx45 was also shown to interact with ZO-1, although it is not clear which domains are involved in this interaction (19Laing J.G. Manley-Markowski R.N. Koval M. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H.

Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Güldenagel M. Deutsch U. Söhl G. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). 2V. B. Hua, P. A. Nielsen, N. M. Kumar, and M. Saier, manuscript in preparation. However, at present it cannot be excluded that some of these sequences represent pseudogenes. Either the human genes themselves or their rodent homologues have been shown to encode proteins for 17 of the 20 genes. The characterization of these proteins, and especially their homozygous deletions in mice, has provided valuable understanding of several human diseases caused by mutations in connexin genes, such as congenital deafness, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, erythrokeratodermia viabilis, congenital cataracts, and congenital heart malformations (22Willecke K. Kirchhoff S. Plum A. Temme A. Thonnissen E. Ott T. Novartis Found. Symp. 1999; 219: 76-88PubMed Google Scholar). With the purpose of understanding connexin function in further detail, we here report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel human connexin, Cx31.9, which we found expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, we present data suggesting that Cx31.9 interacts with ZO-1. The human EST data base at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched using the BLAST algorithm (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59923) Google Scholar) with published connexin sequences. An EST clone (accession number AA915885) with similarity to connexins was obtained (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) and plasmid DNA isolated (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The plasmid was sequenced with T3, T7, and gene-specific primers (Invitrogen and MWG Biotech (High Point, NC)) on both strands. The insert of clone AA915885 was excised using EcoRI and NotI and used as a probe to screen 1 × 106 clones from a human genomic liver λgt-10 library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Four genomic clones hybridized with the probe, and λ DNA was isolated from two of these. The DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes and used for Southern analysis with the AA915885 fragment probe. A 1949-bpBamHI hybridization-positive fragment was subcloned in pGEM7 (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced on both strands. Human testis cDNA containing 5′ and 3′ adaptors (Marathon cDNA, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a template in PCR with the primer PN115 (5′-TCAGCATGACCACCAGCCAG-3′) from nucleotides 91–72 of the Cx31.9 sequence and primer AP1 from the cDNA adaptors, with Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR products were cloned into pGEM and sequenced on both strands. A probe encompassing nucleotides 619–885 of the coding sequence of Cx31.9 was generated by PCR using the primers P32 (5′-ATCGAATTCGCCGAGCTGGGCCACCTGC-3′) and P33 (5′-ATCCTCGAGCTAGATGGCCAGATCTCGGC-3′). Human MTN (multiple tissue Northern) blot I containing poly(A+) RNA (CLONTECH) was probed at 68 °C using ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH) according to the instructions from the manufacturer, and the blot was washed to a stringency of 0.1× SSC, 65 °C. The blot was exposed to BioMax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 48 h at −80 °C. The 1949-bp genomicBamHI Cx31.9 fragment was used as a template in PCR with the primers P32 (5′-ATCGAATTCGCCGAGCTGGGCCACCTGC-3′) and P33 (5′-ATCCTCGAGCTAGATGGCCAGATCTCGGC-3′), using Pfu Turbo (Invitrogen). The resultant 284-bp fragment wasEcoRI/XhoI cloned into pGEX4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences, Stockholm, Sweden). The sequence was verified by sequencing. Using the BamHI genomic fragment as a template for a PCR reaction with Expand High Fidelity PCR system, with the primers P113 (5′-ATCGGATCCTACTCCATGCACCGGGCAGG-3′) and P114 (5′-ATCGAATTCGTAGCAGCGGCGCGCGCG-3′), a product of 142 bp was generated. This fragment was BamHI/EcoRI cloned into pGEX2-TK (Amersham Biosciences), and the sequence verified. The genomic 1949-bpBamHI fragment was cloned into BamHI-linearized pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen). This expression vector contains a cytomegalovirus promotor and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. ASmaI/BglII genomic fragment containing the coding region of Cx31.9 except the most 3′ 11 nucleotides was cloned in SmaI/KpnI-linearized pBluescript KS+/− (Stratagene) by the use of 5′-phosphorylated (5′P) oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′P-GATCTGGCCATCGGGGTAC-3′ and 5′P-CCCGATGGCCA-3′ to link the BglII andKpnI sites. This construct was excised from pBluescript using SacI and KpnI and cloned intoSacI/KpnI-linearized eGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), to generate an open reading frame encoding Cx31.9 with a COOH-terminal eGFP tag. The vector, eGFP-N1, contains a cytomegalovirus promotor and a SV40 polyadenylation signal. PDZ domains were amplified by PCR using human ZO-1 cDNA and the following primers: PDZ-1F (5′-GGGGGTCGACAATGGAGGAAACAGCTATATGG-3′), PDZ-1R (5′-CCCCGAATTCCTAACGACTTACTGGTATGTT-3′), PDZ-2F (5′-GGGGGTCGCAGTGGTCTCCAGCCAGCTT-3′), PDZ-2R (5′-CCCCGAATTCCTAATCAAGGACATTCAATAG-3′), PDZ-3F (5′-GGGGGTCGACAATGAAGATGGGATTTCTTCGG-3′), and PDZ-3F (5′-CCCCGAATTCCTATTCTACAATGCGACGATA-3′). PCR products were digested with SalI and EcoRI, subcloned and sequenced, followed by ligation intoBamHI/EcoRI-linearized pGEX-3X (AmershamBiosciences). The 1949-bpBamHI fragment containing Cx31.9 was cloned intoBamHI-linearized pXLII (paw2pla). This vector was derived from pXBG-ev1, a derivative of pBS KS− containing the 5′- and 3′-UTR regions of the Xenopus laevis β-globin gene with an internal multiple cloning site. The correct orientation of the insert was verified by sequencing. GST fusion proteins were obtained using standard procedures. Aliquots (50 μg) were used to immunize female BALB/C mice intraperitoneally with Freund's complete adjuvant for the first immunization, and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) for the following three immunizations. Three days after the final boost, mice were sacrificed, and spleen cells fused to mouse myeloma cell line X63Ag. Supernatants from the resultant hybridomas were screened against the GST fusion proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive wells were cloned and rescreened till monoclonality. Hybridomas were expanded in Hybridoma-SFM (serum-free medium; Invitrogen), and antibodies isolated with HiTrap Protein G columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The use of mice for these experiments was approved by the Scripps Research Institute Animal Committee. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with a moist atmosphere of 4% CO2. The cells were transfected with the Cx31.9 untagged expression construct using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. After 24 h, the medium was exchanged to selective medium (0.8 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen)) for 10 days. Surviving clones were then picked, expanded, and lysates screened by immunoblot with mAb 7G6 for expression of the connexin. Positive clones were reseeded, repicked and rescreened three or four times to obtain stable expression. Cell lines were metabolically labeled overnight by incubation with 100 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in 5 ml of DMEM without l-methionine andl-cysteine/l-cystine (ICN), supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS. Cells were then washed with PBS, and lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, pH 8.0) or RIPA buffer (1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Following incubation on ice for 15 min, lysates were clarified and incubated with primary antibodies bound to Protein A/G beads (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) (5 μg of antibody/IP) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed extensively in IP buffer and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with GelCode (Pierce) to visualize the amount of antibody. Gels were dried and exposed to BioMax MS film at −80 °C for 12 h. Samples were separated on 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels in Hoefer vertical gel apparatuses, followed by transfer to Protran 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were stained with 0.2% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid, blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder in TBST, and incubated with purified primary antibody (5–10 μg/ml) in blocking buffer. Membranes were then washed in TBST, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). The antibodies were detected with chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) by exposure to Biomax ML film (Eastman Kodak). Human tissues were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Cooperative Human Tissue Network and from the National Disease Research Interchange. Surgical specimens of human brain, large intestine, heart, skeletal muscle, and aorta were homogenized in buffer containing 150 mm sucrose, 15 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.9, and protease inhibitors. Following homogenization, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the homogenate incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysate was then centrifuged at 18,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The use of human material for these studies was approved by the Scripps Clinic, Scripps Green Hospital, and the Scripps Research Institute Human Subjects Committee. Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-treated glass coverslips, washed in PBS, and fixed in −20 °C acetone or methanol for 6 min. Coverslips were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS (blocking buffer), followed by incubations with primary antibodies overnight in blocking buffer at 4 °C. mAbs 7G6 and 5G11 were used at 5–10 μg/ml, and a commercial anti-ZO-1 polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) was used at 5 μg/ml. Following washing with PBS, coverslips were incubated with fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies (Southern Biotech Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL), diluted 1:100, together with 50 nm To-Pro-3 to stain nuclei (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), in blocking buffer for 1 h. Washed slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Sigma), and images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope. Surgical human tissue samples were frozen and imbedded in O.C.T. Four-μm sections were cut on a cryostat and attached to Superfrost slides at −20 °C. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Blocking, antibody incubations, and imaging were as described above. mAb 1E12 (IgM) against smooth muscle α-actinin was developed by Dr. Charles D. Little and co-workers, and mAb P2B2 (IgG1) against PECAM was developed by Drs. Elizabeth A. Wayner and Gregory Vercellotti. These mAbs were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). For the co-localization studies, mAb 7G6 was detected with an anti-mouse γ chain-specific secondary antibody, which was cross-absorbed on mouse IgM, whereas mAb 1E12 was detected with a mouse IgM-specific antibody, which was cross-absorbed on mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Glass pipettes containing a capillary filament were pulled on a Brown-Flaming micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., San Francisco, CA). Overnight cultures of Cx31.9-HEK cells and wt HEK cells were microinjected (Transjector 5246, Eppendorf, Madison, WI) with 4% Lucifer yellow, carboxyfluorescein, cascade blue (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), or 5% ethidium bromide (Sigma) in 1 m LiCl, including 2% Texas Red or FITC-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to visualize the injected cell. The spread of dyes was monitored in a Zeiss Axiovert 100 fluorescent microscope. The Xenopus expression construct was linearized withSacI, and cRNA was generated by in vitrotranscription with AmpliScripe T3 transcription kit in conjunction with a monomethylated cap analog m7G[5′]ppp[5′]G (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The size of the transcript was verified, and the cRNA concentration estimated, by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocytes were isolated from X. laevis(Pacific Biological, Sherman Oaks, CA) ovaries by collagenase treatment. Stage V–VI oocytes were selected and manually defolliculated if necessary. After a 24-h incubation in ND-96 medium to ensure viability, a Nanoject apparatus (Drummond, Broomall, PA) was used to inject oocytes with 46 nl of 0.05–0.5 μg/μl Cx31.9 cRNA and 5 ng of Cx38 antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCTTTAGTAATTCCCATCCTGCCATGTTTC-3′) to block endogenous connexin synthesis (24Barrio L.C. Suchyna T. Bargiello T., Xu, L.X. Roginski R.S. Bennett M.V. Nicholson B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8410-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Injected oocytes were incubated for 48 h, followed by manual removal of the vitelline layers. Oocytes were paired at their vegetal poles for 2–6 h, and junctional conductance between oocytes was measured with the dual voltage clamp technique as previously described (25Beahm D.L. Hall J.E. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2016-2031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), using dual Gene Clamp 500Bs driven by a D/A board under the control of Pclamp 8.0 data acquisition software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Each oocyte in a pair was initially clamped to a potential equal to the average of the two resting potentials, and one oocyte was stepped to a series of voltages to generate a series of transjunctional potentials. Junctional currents were recorded as the currents induced in the non-driven oocyte. A dual cell voltage clamp method was used (26Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 27Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J.

Poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips containing cells were mounted on the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot fluorescent microscope equipped with Hoffman modulation optics. The cells were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2) at room temperature immediately prior to each experiment. Patch pipettes were pulled from glass capillary tubes with filaments to a resistance of 1–2 megohms. The pipettes were filled with solution containing 160 mmpotassium aspartate, 1.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Data were collected using an ADLab D/A board driving two Axopatch (1B and C) patch clamps (Axon Instruments) in voltage-clamp mode. Voltage protocols and data collection were controlled by home-made software. For evaluation of junctional conductance, both cells were held at −40 mV, and 50-ms pulses to −20 mV were alternately applied to each cell. Cells examined were generally in contact only with each other, but occasionally two adjacent cells in a chain were selected. The electrical conductance was calculated as the junctional current divided by the potential difference between the two cells. In some cases, IV curves were generated by stepping the voltage in one cell while holding the other cell at a fixed value. Cx31.9-HEK and wt HEK cells were treated as above (immunoprecipitation analysis), without the radiolabel. The IP buffer has been optimized by Giepmans and co-workers (14Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) to retain the interaction of Cx43 and ZO-1, while minimizing nonspecific interactions. Following immunoblot transfer, ZO-1 was detected using a commercial polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories). For the detection of immunoprecipitated Cx31.9, mAb 7G6 was biotinylated using NHS-PEO4-Biotin (Pierce) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The biotinylation was done to avoid reactivity of secondary anti-mouse antibody with the light chains of antibodies used for the immunoprecipitation. Biotinylated 7G6 was detected using Vectastain Elite ABC kit with peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and chemiluminescence, according to the instructions from the manufacturer. PDZ-GST fusion proteins were prepared using standard procedures and bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma). The agarose beads containing fusion proteins were then incubated with IP buffer lysates from a confluent 85-mm dish of Cx31.9-HEK cells overnight. After washing in IP buffer, the beads were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Cx31.9 was detected with mAb 7G6. The human GenBankTMEST data base was searched with connexin motifs using the BLAST algorithm, and a number of clones encoding partial, putative novel connexins were identified. One of these clones, accession numberAA915885 (derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma library), was purchased and fully sequenced in both directions by primer walking. The insert contained a sequence of 1499 bp, which consisted of a putative 5′-UTR (659 bp), an ATG codon flanked by G in position +4 and A in −3, which was predicted to be a strong initiator of translation (29Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), and an open reading frame (840 bp). However, the open reading frame was not complete, but was followed by a NotI site, indicating that this was a partial clone formed by restriction digestion of the cDNA during library synthesis. The sequence of clone AA915885 was also similar to human EST clone AI142991 (from a human senescent fibroblast library). Clone AA915885 was used to screen a human λ genomic library, and four λ clones were identified. Restriction digests from these clones were analyzed by Southern blots, and a 1949-bp BamHI fragment was subcloned and fully sequenced in both directions. This genomic fragment contained an open reading frame identical to clone AA915885 and additional coding sequence including a stop codon (Fig.1). The open reading frame encoded a putative 294-amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 31,933. This protein will be referred to as Cx31.9 in accordance with the nomenclature previously proposed for connexins (6Beyer E.C. Reed K.E. Westphale E.M. Kanter H.L. Larson D.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 127: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A comparison of the Cx31.9 genomic and EST clone revealed that no introns were present in the coding sequence of Cx31.9, as is the case for all connexins except Cx36 (30Condorelli D.F. Parenti R. Spinella F. Trovato Salinaro A. Belluardo N. Cardile V. Cicirata F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1202-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and Cx40.1. 3P. A. Nielsen and N. M. Kumar, unpublished observation. Furthermore, no introns were found in the 249 bp upstream of the initiating ATG codon contained in the genomic clone. This was surprising, because all mammalian connexins characterized to date contain one, or two (Cx45, Ref. 31Jacob A. Beyer E.C. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), intron(s) in the 5′-UTR in close proximity to the initiating ATG codon. To verify that clone AA915885 had been properly spliced, testis cDNA was used for 5′-RACE. The major PCR product contained 859 bp upstream of the initiating ATG codon of Cx31.9. This sequence also ali"

We hypothesize that antibodies functionally distinguish the serum of one patient from another. However, pooled normal polyclonal human IgM antibodies also induce remyelination. Definitive proof that specific antibodies are the biologically active components of serum is missing because unquestionably pure preparations of antibody molecules cannot be generated by fractionation. To demonstrate definitively that antibody is the biologically active component of patient serum, recombinant antibody was generated for evaluation in bioassays. The induction of remyelination in vivo requires milligram quantities of antibody. Consequently, an expression system was engineered to express high-titer, recombinant human IgM antibodies in vitro. A resulting recombinant antibody (rHIgM22) was evaluated for its ability to induce remyelination in the Theiler's virus mouse model of chronic-progressive demyelinating disease. We demonstrate that a single recombinant monoclonal antibody recapitulates the key characteristics of patient serum, including binding specificity, the induction of calcium signals in oligodendrocytes in vitro, and the induction of myelin repair within demyelinated plaques in vivo. The rHIgM22 antibody provides a new venue for the analysis of mechanisms governing remyelination and may prove useful in the treatment of demyelinating diseases."

Here, we have identified new members of the mammalian NIMA family of kinases, termed Nek11L and Nek11S (NIMA-related kinase11Long and Short isoform) as novel DNA replication/damage stresses-responsive kinases. Molecular cloning and biochemical studies showed that the catalytic domain of Nek11 is most similar to Nek4 and Nek3, and substrate specificity of Nek11L is distinguishable from those of NIMA and Nek2. The expression ofnek11L mRNA increased through S to G2/M phase, and subcellular localization of Nek11 protein altered between interphase and prometaphase, suggesting multiple roles of Nek11. We found an activation of Nek11 kinase activity when cells were treated with various DNA-damaging agents and replication inhibitors, and this activation of Nek11 was suppressed by caffeine in HeLaS3 cells. The transient expression of wild-type Nek11L enhanced the aphidicolin-induced S-phase arrest, whereas the aphidicolin-induced S-phase arrest was reduced in the U2OS cell lines expressing kinase-negative Nek11L (K61R), and these cells were more sensitive to aphidicolin-induced cell lethality. Collectively, these results suggest that Nek11 has a role in the S-phase checkpoint downstream of the caffeine-sensitive pathway.

Cell. 2000; 100: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Correct DNA replication and segregation of sister chromatids and cytokinesis are critical for proper duplication of cells, and genomic stability depends on the appropriate responses to various types of DNA damage. Two related protein kinases, ATM1 (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), mediate cellular responses to DNA damages, and they are master controllers that orchestrate the complex signaling network in mammalian cell cycle checkpoint machinery (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Cell cycle checkpoints typically delay or arrest cell cycle progression, and various protein kinases are regulated by complicated checkpoint pathways (3Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 4Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The NIMA (Never-In Mitosis, geneA) kinase, the founding member of the NIMA family, was isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans by genetic complementation of the nimA mutation and is required for G2/M transition (5Osmani S.A., Pu, R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In addition, the NIMA kinase is negatively regulated by the DNA replication inhibitor-induced S-phase checkpoints, albeit not by the genotoxic agents-induced G2/M checkpoints (6Ye X.S. Fincher R.R.

All of the NIMA-related kinases share considerable primary sequence similarity with NIMA over the N-terminal catalytic domain. However, they show little similarity over the C-terminal non-catalytic region, although the C-terminal non-catalytic domain of fungal NIMA is presumed to have important functions for cell cycle control (22Lu K.P. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The existence of the NIMA-related pathway has been speculated in higher eukaryotes (23Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nek2 is closely related to fungal NIMA in the mammalian NIMA family, functioning in the centrosome cycle through phosphorylation of a physiological substrate c-Nap1 during cell cycle (24Fry A.M.

Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13491-13497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutation in murine nek1 is involved in the Kat phenotype, including polycystic kidneys, dwarfism, male sterility, and facial dysmorphism (26Upadhya P. Birkenmeier E.H. Birkenmeier C.S. Barker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and nek4 is highly expressed in germinal cells similar to nek1 and nek2 (16Chen A. Yanai A. Arama E.

Nek6 and Nek7 are cytoplasmic proteins lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain (18Kandli M. Feige E. Chen A. Kilfin G. Motro B.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently Nek8/Nercc1 has been identified as a β-casein kinase or a Nek6-binding protein harboring an RCC1-like motif uniquely in the NIMA family (20Holland P.M. Milne A. Garka K. Johnson R.S.

Nek8/Nercc1 associates with putative substrates Bicd2 and Ran GTPase and appears to have a role in microtubule dynamics (20Holland P.M. Milne A. Garka K. Johnson R.S. Willis C.R. Sims J.E. Rauch C.T.

These studies suggest that each of the mammalian Neks is developed evolutionarily to play a selective role, and unfortunately, functional involvement of the mammalian Neks has not been studied during the cell cycle checkpoints. In this study, we have identified two types of full-length cDNAs encoding novel NIMA-related protein kinases, designated Nek11L and Nek11S, and examined biochemical and functional properties of Nek11. The catalytic domain of Nek11 at the N terminus is most closely related to Nek4 and Nek3, but the C-terminal non-catalytic region of Nek11 is predicted to contain coiled-coil- and PEST-like motifs like fungal NIMA. The expression level of Nek11L increased through S to G2/M phase, whereas subcellular localization of Nek11 changed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, especially during interphase and prometaphase. Our explorations revealed that Nek11 is a novel DNA replication/damage stresses-responsive kinase and appears to have a role in the S-phase checkpoint pathway. Overall, we have demonstrated that Nek11, a new member of the mammalian NIMA family of kinases, is regulated by the cell cycle checkpoints. The EST data base at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was searched for novel protein kinases using the TBLASTN program and the ATP interaction motif of known protein kinases (30Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). One putative amino acid sequence of an EST clone (GenBankTM accession numberBE388672) was found to show significant similarity to STK2/Nek4. Molecular cloning of full-length cDNA was performed using a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) according to the user manual. cDNA was synthesized from poly(A) RNA of HeLaS3 cells, and synthetic primers (5′-AGGGAGAGAAGGTGTGTCACCTTCAACGAT-3′ for 5′-end RACE and 5′-TTGGAAGCCCAACTCCTCTCCAAGCTGGAC-3′ for 3′-end RACE) were used for first PCR amplification. A nested second PCR was employed with nested primers (5′-CACAGGATCCCATTAGAAGTCGAG-3′ for 5′-end nested RACE and 5′-GCTGCATGAATCATGCATTCGCTGGC-3′ for 3′-end nested RACE). RACE products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen, CH Groningen, The Netherlands), and sequencing was performed on both strands using an ABI model 373 automated sequencer. To determine the consensus sequence of the target gene, each of 10 independent RACE clones was sequenced, and the intron-exon structure of confirmed cDNA sequences was predicted by BLAST analysis on the human genome data base. The complete open reading frame containing cDNAs were obtained from HeLaS3 cells cDNA by PCR using pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan) with synthetic primers (5′-CGAATTCCATGCTGAAATTCCAAGAGGCAGC-3′ for 5′-end, 5′-CTAGAGATGGTTCTGGAGAGTAGG-3′ for 3′-end ofnek11L and 5′-CTGAAAGTCAGCTGTGAGTTGCATG-3′ for 3′-end ofnek11S), and subcloned into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). Both strands of PCR product sequences were completely verified, and these plasmids were termed pCR/nek11L and pCR/nek11S, respectively. Intron-exon nucleotide structures of nek11L and nek11S genes were deduced from the human genome BLAST analysis. Profilescan (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html), PSORT (psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), PESTfind (www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/) and Coils (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) programs were used to predict the secondary motifs of the NIMA family kinases. The phylogenetic tree was based on comparison of amino acid sequences at the N-terminal catalytic domain. A. nidulans NIMA (amino acids 11–295), N. crassa Nim-1 (amino acids 7–290),S. pombe Fin1 (amino acids 4–281), S. cerevisiae Kin 3 (amino acids 25–343), Drosophila melanogaster CG17256 (amino acids 19–281), murine Nek2 (amino acids 8–271), Caenorhabditis elegans F19H6.1 (amino acids 23–248), murine Nek6 (amino acids 45–301), murine Nek7 (amino acids 34–285), C. elegans ZC581.1 (amino acids 4–267), murine Nek8 (amino acids 4–258), C. elegans Y39G10AR (amino acids 171–424), D. melanogaster CG10951 (amino acids 105–354), human Nek8/Nercc1 (amino acids 52–308), murine Nek1 (amino acids 4–258), murine Nek3 (amino acids 4–255), murine Nek4 (amino acids 6–261), and human Nek11 (amino acids 29–287) were aligned using ClustalW (v1.8) (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/E-mail/clustalw-j.html). The method calculated for tree construction was the neighbor-joining method with Kimura's correction using ClustalW (v1.8), and the tree was created by TreeView software (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). To generate kinase-inactive Nek11, lysine residue at position 61 in Nek11 was replaced by arginine with site-directed mutagenesis using a PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. Synthetic DNA primers (5′-GGAGAGGAATTAAAGGTACTTAGGGAAATATCTGTTGGAGAACTA-3′ and 5′-TAGTTCTCCAACAGATATTTCCCTAAGTACCTTTAATTCCTCTCC-3′) were used in the PCR reaction with template pCR/nek11 plasmid. All mutated Nek11L and Nek11S cDNA clones were fully sequenced and termed Nek11 (K61R). Nek11L and Nek11S cDNAs containing open reading frame were isolated from pCR/nek11L and pCR/nek11S byEcoRI digestion, and subcloned into pFLAG CMV2 (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) plasmids to generate FLAG-tagged and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Nek11, termed pFLAG-Nek11L, pFLAG-Nek11L (K61R), pFLAG-Nek11S, pFLAG-Nek11S (K61R), pGFP-Nek11L, pGFP-Nek11L (K61R), pGFP-Nek11S, and pGFP-Nek11S (K61R), respectively. pGFP-Nek11L plasmid was digested by PstI to remove amino acids at position 330–645 of Nek11L, and EGFP-Nek11 (amino acids 1–329) expressing plasmid was obtained by the subsequent self-ligation, termed pGFP-Nek11-(1–329). To obtain EGFP-Nek11 C-terminal domain expressing plasmid, pGFP-Nek11L and pGFP-Nek11S plasmids were digested by BglII to remove amino acids at position 1–378 in Nek11. After self-ligation, EGFP-Nek11L (amino acids 379–645) and EGFP-Nek11S (amino acids 379–470) expressing plasmid were obtained, and termed pGFP-Nek11L-(379–645) and pGFP-Nek11S-(379–470), respectively. To prepare recombinant antigen, Nek11S cDNA was subcloned into pTrcHisC plasmid (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI site to obtain poly histidine-tagged (His tag) Nek11-expressing plasmid, termed pTrcHis-Nek11S. cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids at position 1–326 was removed by PstI digestion, and plasmid expressing His-tagged Nek11S (amino acids 327–470), termed pTrcHis-S-C-ter, was obtained. His-tagged Nek11S-(327–470) was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 by isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 2 h, and cell lysate was prepared in denatured buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8). Bacterial expressed His-tagged Nek11S-(327–470) protein was collected with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) under denatured conditions, eluted by denatured buffer (pH 4), and dialyzed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Most of the recombinant His-tagged Nek11S-(327–470) protein recovered from undissolved deposition was used in the re-purification of antigen for immunization, and that recovered from soluble fraction after dialysis was used for affinity column preparation of antiserum. Undissolved His-tagged Nek11S-(327–470) protein was solved by the denatured buffer, re-purified with Ni-NTA-agarose under the denatured conditions, and dialyzed in the urea containing buffer (2 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7). Purified His-tagged Nek11S-(327–470) protein was used for rabbit immunization (100 μg × 6) under the denatured conditions. For affinity purification of antiserum, recombinant His-tagged Nek11S-(327–470) protein recovered from soluble fraction after dialysis was coupled to HiTrap N-hydroxy succinimide-activated column as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England). This affinity column was used to purify anti-Nek11 polyclonal antibodies from antiserum after pre-absorption by E. coli lysate bound Ni-NTA-agarose. Purified polyclonal antibodies were diluted in 50% glycerol with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and stored at −20 °C. For immunoprecipitation in the transient transfection, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmid (106 cells/2 μg of plasmid/60-mm dish; 2 × 105 cells/0.5 μg of plasmid/12-well plate) using FuGENE 6 reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) according to the instruction manual. After 38–44 h, cells were suspended in Nek lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmPMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml heparin, 1 μm okadaic acid) on ice for 10 min. For endogenous Nek11 protein, HeLaS3 cells were lysed in Nek11 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 420 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmPMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml heparin, 1 μm okadaic acid) on ice for 30 min. Cell lysates were frozen once by liquid nitrogen, and soluble cell extracts were obtained by centrifugation (×12,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. HeLaS3 extracts were diluted with equal volume of dilution buffer (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml heparin, 1 μmokadaic acid). Subsequently, cell extracts were pre-cleared by immunocomplex of normal rabbit IgG/protein G 4FF-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min on a rotating wheel. Pre-cleared cell extracts were incubated with antibodies (4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 2 × 106 HEK293T cells, and 3 μg of anti-Nek11 polyclonal antibody or normal rabbit IgG for 1–2 mg of HeLaS3 cell extract) on ice for 60 min, followed by addition of protein G 4FF-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Immunocomplexes for in vitro kinase assay were washed by HS buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1m NaCl) (1 ml × 5) and 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5 (1 ml × 1). Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min in 20–30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 μg/ml heparin, 5 mmMnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 0.2 mg/ml substrate). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× Laemmli SDS sample buffer (7–10 μl) and heated to 95 °C. Denatured samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a BAS 1800 bio-image analyzer (Fujifilm, Japan). For preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were lysed by urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and sonicated. Other soluble cell extracts were prepared using Nek or Nek11 lysis buffer as described above and protein concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples containing equal amounts of protein or equal number of cells were mixed with 4× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, heat-denatured, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in 5% low fat milk/TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). All antibodies were diluted with blocking buffer and were incubated with membranes at room temperature. After incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL detection reagent (AmershamBiosciences). Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and poly(A) RNA was collected by Oligotex-dT30-Super (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo). Poly(A) RNA from various cell lines was electrophoresed (1 μg/lane) in 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). Human multiple tissue expression array was purchased from Clontech. Filters were hybridized with the 32P-labeled full-lengthnek11L cDNA and analyzed using the BAS 1800 Bioimage analyzer. For cell synchronization, HeLa and HeLaS3 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. On the following day, cells were pre-synchronized by treatment with 2.5 mmthymidine for 14 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). They were then incubated in normal growth medium for 11 h followed by aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) treatment for an additional 14 h to arrest cells at the G1/S phase. For G2/M arrest, cells after thymidine treatment were cultured in normal growth medium for 5 h before nocodazole (0.5 μm) treatment for an additional 19 h, washed three times with PBS and the medium was then changed to normal growth medium. This time point was designated time zero, and cells were harvested at each subsequent time point. To detect the expression of nek11 mRNA, poly(A) RNA (1 μg/lane) was purified and Northern blot analysis was performed. Equal amounts of protein (25 μg/lane) from whole cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis to detect the expression of Nek11 protein. Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were cotransfected with pCEP4 and pFLAG-Nek11 (K61R) by Effectene reagents (Qiagen). Cells were cultured in hygromycin B (400 μg/ml)-containing medium and hygromycin-resistant transfectants were isolated. FLAG-tagged Nek11 (K61R)-expressing cell clones were screened by Western blotting, and two independent clones KR1 and KR19 were established. Sample cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol over 24 h at −20 °C. Fixed cells were washed once with PBS, treated with RNase (0.1 mg/ml), and stained by propidium iodide (40 μg/ml). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur device (Becton Dickinson), and the cell cycle was analyzed with CellQuest and ModFit software. Cells (300 cells/35-mm dish) were treated with aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) for 24 h, washed three times by PBS, and then cultured in the normal growth medium for 10 days. Control cells were not treated with aphidicolin. Surviving colonies were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and stained by 0.1% crystal violet. For immunofluorescence microscopic studies of endogenous Nek11 protein, HeLaS3 cells were seeded on multichamber slides (5 × 104 per well on four-well multichamber slides, Asahi Techno Glass, Japan). The next day, cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PBS buffer for 10 min, and permeated with 70% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature. The permeabilized cells were washed once with PBS. The primary antibodies (anti-Nek11 (1 μg/ml) and anti-β-tubulin (×200)) were diluted in PBS, placed in a multichamber, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed three times with PBS and covered with PBS solution containing secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit-IgG AlexaFluor594-conjugated (×300), goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor488-conjugated (×300); Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 1 h in a dark box at room temperature. Slides were again washed three times with PBS and mounted with DAPI-containing Antifade (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Inc). Immunostained cells were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 system. Human embryonic kidney-transformed fibroblast HEK293T cells, cervical epithelioid carcinoma HeLa and HeLaS3 cells, and osteosarcoma U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). Anti-β-tubulin and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Nek2 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Nocodazole, aphidicolin, thymidine, hydroxyurea, Adriamycin, and caffeine were purchased from Sigma and okadaic acid, cisplatin, camptothecin, and etoposide were fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). Dephosphorylated casein and myelin basic protein were purchased from Sigma and histone proteins were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. In our screening of the EST data base, one putative amino acid sequence of an EST clone (GenBankTM accession numberBE388672) showed significant similarity to STK2/Nek4, but frameshifts were observed at the 5′- and 3′-end in this cDNA sequence. Because the expression level of the target gene was found to be low during molecular cloning, we employed 5′- and 3′-end nested RACE PCR cloning to identify the full-length cDNA sequence. Two types of full-length cDNA encoding 645- and 470-amino acid proteins (calculated molecular weights were 74,162 and 54,006) were discovered (Fig.1 A). Both types of cDNA are mapped to chromosome 3q21-q22 by the genome BLAST analysis and are probably generated by alternative splicing where different 3′-end exons are used (nek11L andnek11S genes consist of 18 and 15 exons, respectively, and 5′-end 14 exons are identical) (data not shown). Deduced proteins have conserved subdomains typical of serine/threonine kinases related to the NIMA family, and the catalytic domain is closely related to Nek3 and Nek4/STK2 proteins (43% identity with each) and shows 33% identity with A. nidulans NIMA. Phylogenetic analysis of catalytic domains of the NIMA family kinases indicates that the identified protein is a novel member of the NIMA family, especially a new member of a subfamily, including Nek1, Nek3, and Nek4 (Fig. 1 B). We therefore termed these proteins Nek11L and Nek11S (NIMA-related kinase 11Long and Short isoform), respectively. Although the catalytic domain of Nek11 was classified in a branch containing Nek1, Nek3, and Nek4, multiple sequence alignment showed recognizable similarities among the C-terminal non-catalytic regions of human Nek11L-(327–457), human Nek2-(279–370), and D. melanogaster CG17256-(349–535) (Fig. 1 C). Secondary motif prediction indicated that Nek11L protein has putative coiled-coil (289–310 and 340–380) and PEST-like (410–422, 427–449, and 466–500) motifs at the C-terminal non-catalytic region (Fig.1 D). The coiled-coil motif at the C-terminal region is also predicted in NIMA (300–360 and 360–400), Nek2 (300–370 and 400–440), and CG17256 (387–415 and 435–487), albeit not in Nek3 and Nek4. The predicted coiled-coil motifs containing regions of Nek2, CG17256, and Nek11 show significant similarity to each other, suggesting an important role of these regions for their physiological functions. These analyses indicate that the catalytic domain of Nek11 is closely related to those of Nek4 and Nek3 than that of Nek2, but the C-terminal non-catalytic region shows similarity with that of Nek2. We did not identify any other Nek4/11-related kinase in C. elegans and D. melanogaster genome databases (data not shown), suggesting that the Nek11-containing subfamily has developed specifically in mammals. FLAG-tagged wild-type Nek11L, Nek11S, and their kinase-negative mutants Nek11 (K61R) in which an ATP-interacting lysine residue at position 61 was replaced by arginine were constructed to examine their catalytic activity.

Here we observed the effects of acidic pH and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on the physicochemical and structural properties of PrPC derived from normal human brain and determined the ability of the acid/GdnHCl-treated PrP to form a proteinase K (PK)-resistant species in the absence and presence of PrPSc template. After treatment with 1.5 mGdnHCl at pH 3.5, PrPC from normal brain homogenates was converted into a detergent-insoluble form similar to PrPSc. Unlike PrPSc, however, the treated brain PrPC was protease-sensitive and retained epitope accessibility to monoclonal antibodies 3F4 and 6H4. Brain PrPC treated with acidic pH/GdnHCl acquired partial PK resistance upon further treatment with low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Formation of this PrPSc-like isoform was greatly enhanced by incubation with trace quantities of PrPSc from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brain. Acid/GdnHCl-treated brain PrP may constitute a “recruitable intermediate” in PrPSc formation. Further structural rearrangement seems essential for this species to acquire PK resistance, which can be promoted by the presence of a PrPSc template.

An insoluble, β-sheet-rich isoform of the prion protein (herein generically designated PrPSc) 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, pathogenic prion protein; PrPC, cellular prion protein; PK, proteinase K; rPrP, recombinant prion protein; hurPrP, recombinant human PrP; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PMCA, protein misfolding cyclic amplification; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin is the only known component of the infectious prion particle associated with the prion diseases, which are a group of transmissible, fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. PrPSc is derived from its normal cellular isoform (PrPC), which is rich in α-helical structure, by a posttranslational process involving a conformational transition (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). While the primary structure of PrPC is identical to that of PrPSc, secondary and tertiary structural changes are responsible for the distinct physicochemical properties of the two isoforms. PrPC exists as a detergent-soluble monomer and is readily degraded by protease K (PK), whereas the infectious isoform PrPSc forms detergent-insoluble aggregates and shows high resistance to PK digestion and to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-mediated release (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). According to the “protein only” theory of prion infectivity, PrPC is converted to PrPSc by a template-directed process catalyzed by PrPSc. This disease-related in vivo transition has been modeled in vitro, in which PrPC can be converted to a protease-resistant form by contact with PrPSc (3Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that this conversion can be promoted by protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), a process analogous to the polymerase chain reaction for nucleic acids (5Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Studies using recombinant PrP (rPrP) have indicated that the structural transition of α-helix to β-sheet and concomitant self-association can be triggered by acidic pH combined with detergents in vitro (6Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7Jackson G.S. Hill A.F. Joseph C. Hosszu L. Power A.

A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that acid-induced conformational transition and aggregation may be associated with protonation of the acidic amino acids aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) using a peptide (195–213) corresponding to the C-terminal region of PrP (9Zou W.Q. Yang D.S. Fraser P.E. Cashman N.R. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4885-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PrP in acidic organelles may participate in specific folding pathways, forming molecular species structurally and physicochemically distinct from PrPC. Although studies using rPrP have provided important information about PrP structural transition, three-dimensional structure, thermodynamic stability, and folding pathways, the absence of co-factor molecules and posttranslational modifications, such as N-linked glycans and the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, may confound attempts to model faithfully in vivo PrP conversion events. In the present study, we have observed the effect of acidic pH and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on the physicochemical and structural properties of cellular PrP derived from normal human brain. Importantly, we find that acid/GdnHCl-treated human brain PrP is a superior substrate for in vitro conversion than untreated PrP. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and proteinase K were purchased from Sigma. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 Tosylactivated) were from Dynal Co. (Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway). Mouse monoclonal antibody 6H4 from Prionics Co. (Zürich, Switzerland) recognizes the sequence DYEDRYYRE in the prion protein (human PrP residues 144–152). Mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 from Signet Laboratories, Inc. (Dedham, MA) recognizes an epitope of human PrP residues 109–112 including residues MKHV. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody was purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. Necropsied human brain tissue was collected within 24 h of death. The normal human brain was obtained from an individual determined by histology to be free of neurological disorders, and a prion-infected brain was from an individual with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) confirmed by histological examination and Western blot analysis to show the presence of PrPSc. Both samples were homozygous for Met/Met at codon 129. Mouse brains were from wild-type and PrP−/− mice. All tissues were frozen immediately after collection and stored at −80 °C. 10% (w/v) brain homogenates were prepared in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P 40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× electrophoresis loading buffer (6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 125 mA for 2 h. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at 37 °C prior to incubation with antibodies. Membrane-bound proteins were probed with 6H4 antibody at 1:5,000 or with 3F4 antibody at 1:50,000. Washing with TBST, the blot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody at 1:3,000. After washing with TBST, the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence + plus (ECL + Plus, Amersham Biosciences). 100 μl of 10% brain homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of 3.0m GdnHCl (final concentration 1.5 m) in PBS at pH 7.4 or pH 3.5 adjusted with 1 n HCl, followed by incubation at room temperature with shaking. After 5 h, samples were mixed with 5 volumes of prechilled methanol and incubated at −20 °C for 2 h to precipitate the proteins. The samples were subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove the acidic buffer and GdnHCl, and pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer or in 100 μl of 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, according to the experimental design. The samples treated at pH 7.4 were designated as mock-treated samples. 100 μl of the treated or mock-treated sample in lysis buffer was centrifuged at 100,000 × g (Beckman, TL-100 Ultracentrifuge) at 4 °C for 1 h. Supernatants (containing detergent-soluble PrP) were transferred to clean tubes and pellets (containing detergent-insoluble PrP) were resuspended in an equal volume of lysis buffer. The distribution of detergent-soluble PrP or detergent-insoluble PrP was determined by immunblotting. To determine the PK-resistance of the treated PrP, 20 μl of sample was incubated with PK at 100 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, and the digestion reaction was terminated by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 2 mm final concentration. The sample was mixed with equal volumes of loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (6H4 and 3F4) at 30 μg/ml were coupled to magnetic Dynabeads in PBS at 37 °C for 20 h and washed twice with washing buffer (0.1% BSA/PBS). The antibody-conjugated beads were incubated with 0.1% BSA, 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 at 37 °C for 4 h to block nonspecific binding sites and then washed twice with 0.1% BSA/PBS. The antibody-conjugated beads were stored in PBS at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of PrP, 50 μl of antibody-conjugated beads was incubated with 945 μl of lysis buffer in the presence of 5 μl of 10% (w/v) brain homogenate (mock-treated, acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated, or CJD brain) at room temperature for 3 h. The immune complex-containing beads were washed three times with washing buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 2% Tween 20, PBS, pH 7.4). After the last wash, all liquids were removed and 30 μl of loading buffer was added (without reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol to prevent antibody fragments from eluting off the beads). The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To perform in vitro conversion of PrP, proteins precipitated by prechilled methanol were resuspended in equal volumes of 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, rather than in lysis buffer. This buffer has been used in PMCA of PrPSc (5Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Conversion in vitro was performed in an 80-μl volume of the appropriate test substrate material (79.4 μl of sample and 0.6 μl of 10% CJD brain homogenate for the template-directed experiments), and the sample was incubated in a thermomixer at 37 °C for 12 h with shaking. After PK digestion at 37 °C for 1 h and boiling in loading buffer, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Consistent with the observations of other groups (6Swietnicki W.

A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we have found that recombinant mouse PrP-(23–231) undergoes an α-helix to β-sheet conformational transition upon treatment with 1.5 m GdnHCl in PBS at pH 3.5, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. 2W. Q. Zou and N. R. Cashman, unpublished data. We examined the effect of these conditions on the physicochemical properties of cellular PrP derived from normal human brain tissue. After removal of acidic buffer and detergent from normal human brain homogenates, the detergent-soluble (S) and insoluble fractions (P) of the samples in lysis buffer were separated by ultracentrifugation. The distribution of PrP in the supernatants and in the pellets was determined by immunoblotting. As shown inpanel a of Fig. 1, while PrPC in the mock-treated samples was predominantly found in the detergent-soluble fraction, PrP in the treated brain homogenates was recovered mostly in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Therefore, acidic pH and GdnHCl cannot only induce a conformational transition of the recombinant protein, but can also induce a physical conversion from detergent-soluble PrPC into detergent-insoluble PrPSc-like species in native, properly posttranslationally modified PrP from brain tissue. Interestingly, treated protein retained the property of insolubility even when returned to physiological pH for at least 7 days (Fig. 1 a and not shown). To further characterize the effect of pH and GdnHCl on the solubility of PrP in non-denaturing detergents, we performed titrations of these two treatments on human brain homogenates. Panel b of Fig. 1demonstrates the pH-dependent insolubility of PrP in the presence of low concentrations of GdnHCl. At pH less than or equal to 3.5, PrP from human brain became insoluble, while at pH equal to or greater than 4.5 PrP was soluble. This pH range corresponds to the pK a of the side chains of the Asp and Glu, suggesting that the pH-dependent change in solubility of PrP could be associated with the protonation of these acidic residues. To determine the effect of GdnHCl on the solubility of PrP at low pH, brain homogenates were incubated with various concentrations of GdnHCl at pH 3.5. As shown in panel c of Fig. 1, when the concentration of GdnHCl was increased to 2.5 m or higher, most of the brain PrP became soluble. However, PrP still remained insoluble at the concentration of GdnHCl less than and equal to 1.5m, a concentration of GdnHCl at which most other brain proteins were soluble on Coomassie Blue gel analysis (data not shown). Therefore, acidic pH-treated PrP may possess a unique structure at 1.5m GdnHCl, the physicochemical properties of which may not be shared by many other brain proteins. Partial protease resistance is a hallmark of the PrPSc isoform, presumably resulting from structural conversion of the protein. To determine whether brain PrP treated with acid/GdnHCl possesses this property, samples were incubated with PK at various concentrations at 37 °C for 1 h. As shown in Fig.2, both mock-treated and acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated PrP display an intrinsic PK resistance at low concentrations of PK (equal to or less than 1 μg/ml PK), which is consistent with the observations of Buschmann et al. (10Buschmann A. Kuczius T. Bodemer W. Groschup M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); however, there was no difference in PK sensitivity between the two, suggesting that despite acquiring PrPSc-like detergent insolubility, the new species of PrP is not identical to PrPSc. Monoclonal antibodies to diverse epitopes of PrP have been used to probe conformational rearrangement in PrP structural isoforms (11Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C.

(2001) 31st Annual Meeting of Neuroscience, November 10–15, San Diego, CA, Abstract 657.2 (www.sfn.org).Google Scholar). We used immunoprecipitations with 3F4 antibody (against residues 109–112) or 6H4 antibody (against residues 144–152) to identify differences in epitope accessibility between mock-treated and acid/GdnHCl-treated brain proteins. In lysis buffer containing low concentrations of non-denaturing detergents (0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), 6H4 and 3F4 antibodies precipitated PrP equally well from both mock-treated and acid/GdnHCl-treated brain homogenates (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that these two epitopes are not obscured in the structural changes induced by the treatment conditions. In contrast, the amount of PrP precipitated from CJD brain homogenates by the two antibodies was much less than that from normal brain homogenates (Fig. 3 b). Since 6H4 recognizes only native PrPC and not native PrPSc under these immunoprecipitation conditions (17Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and 3F4 is likewise poorly accessible in native PrPSc (11Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), the small amounts of PrP detected in the CJD brain homogenates could simply be residual PrPC. These data confirm that residues 109–112 and 144–152 are cryptic in PrPSc molecules (11Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L.

Moreover, acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated human brain PrP does not share the epitope obscuration properties of native PrPSc. Recently, SDS has been found to induce structural conversion of α-helices to β-sheets and aggregation of hamster rPrP (residues 23–231) (18Xiong L.W. Raymond L.D. Hayes S.F. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Jansen K. Schafer O. Birkmann E. Post K. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Riesner D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also, a low concentration of SDS is present in the PMCA protocol pioneered by Saborio et al.(5Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To determine whether acid/GdnHCl-treated protein can undergo further structural rearrangement upon treatment with SDS, treated and mock-treated brain samples were incubated in 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 12 h with shaking. As shown in Fig. 4, small amounts of a PK-resistant fragment were found in the acid/GdnHCl-treated PrP sample (Fig. 4 a, lane 4), while none was observed in mock-treated sample (Fig. 4 a, lane 3), suggesting that SDS and/or Triton X-100 may induce conformational change in treated brain PrP. Although SDS has been shown to induce aggregation and structural transition of recombinant hamster PrP, these preparations do not acquire PK resistant at pH 6.5 (18Xiong L.W. Raymond L.D. Hayes S.F. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our data generated with mock-treated PrPCfrom brain tissue. Remarkably, the formation of PK-resistant PrP from the treated PrP was greatly enhanced by incubation with trace quantities of PrPSc from CJD brain homogenate (Fig. 4 a,lane 2). Converted PrP displayed a protease-induced gel mobility shift similar to that displayed by CJD brain (Fig.4 b). Enhanced conversion of treated human brain PrP in the presence of a PrPSc template was confirmed in four independent experiments. Little or no PK-resistant PrP was derived from similar experiments with mock-treated brain PrP (the very faint PK-resistant fragments seen in lane 1 of Fig.4 a are protease-resistant fragments of the exogenous PrPSc template). Similarly, no amplification of PrPSc was observed when human template was incubated with brain homogenates from treated wild-type or PrP−/− mice (Fig. 4 c), although an input template of human PrPSc persisted in the wild-type brain incubations and did not persist in PrP−/− brain or PBS incubations. These mouse control experiments establish that the incubation conditions did not merely enhance the recovery and detection of the template PrPSc, but are consistent with authentic amplification of protease-resistant PrP in the test system. Moreover, a series of experiments with the mouse PrP-reactive 6H4 antibody revealed the lack of conversion of mouse PrP by human template (not shown), apparently recapitulating species barrier phenomena observed in prion protein conversion in vivo (1Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar) and in vitro (3Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the persistence of template PrPSc in wild-type mouse brain, but not PrP −/− brain or PBS (Fig.4 c), is reminiscent of the recent finding that persistencein vivo of hamster scrapie agent in mouse brain is dependent upon expression of endogenous PrP (20Race R. Chesebro B. Nature. 1998; 392: 770Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Race R. Raines A. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10106-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Notably, the acid-guanidine facilitated conversion reaction system detailed herein contained only 0.6 μl of 10% CJD brain homogenate in 79.4 μl of 10% normal brain homogenate, and each sample inlanes 1 and 2 of Fig. 4 a contained only 65 nl of CJD brain homogenate, representing a 3–10-fold template-driven signal enhancement with treated brain by gel densitometry (not shown). According to the method of Saborio and colleagues (5Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) ∼70–90% of the PK-resistant PrP in our human brain system was derived from substrate in treated brain homogenate, compared with 97% in their hamster brain PMCA system (5Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that acidic pH and GdnHCl induces a physical transition of cellular PrP derived from normal human brain homogenates. Treated PrP is detergent-insoluble, similar to PrPSc, but displays PrPC-like protease sensitivity and epitope accessibility. A small proportion of acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated human brain PrP, but not mock-treated PrP, acquires PK resistance upon further treatment with a low concentration of SDS. Trace quantities of PrPSc template greatly enhance conversion of acidic pH/GdnHCl/SDS-treated human brain PrP to a PrPSc-like PK-resistant species. Our data suggest that conversion of PrPC to PrPSc may progress through two discrete stages, which might be recapitulated in vitro. Low pH and denaturants may induce the first stage of structural rearrangement, in which treated PrP becomes more “recruitable” than native PrPC. The second stage is dependent upon further rearrangement that is driven by a PrPSc template, which is fostered in vitro by low concentrations of SDS, a denaturing anionic detergent. Low pH and denaturants can induce β-sheet conformational change and self-association in recombinant PrP from multiple species (6Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Cashman N.R. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4885-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The narrow pH range (pH 3.5–4.5) in which these transitions occur is consistent with protonation of acidic amino acids (9Zou W.Q. Yang D.S. Fraser P.E. Cashman N.R. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4885-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations of Syrian hamster rPrP reveals the importance of protonation of acidic amino acids in acid-induced structural changes of PrP species (22Alonso D.O. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2985-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). At neutral pH, Asp-178 forms a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond with Tyr-128 in molecular dynamics simulations; however, this interaction between Asp and Tyr is broken when Asp is protonated at low pH (22Alonso D.O. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2985-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recombinant human PrP (hurPrP) (90–231) showed a pH-dependent exposure of hydrophobic patches on the surface of the molecule, as evidenced by an increase in fluorescence intensity of bound 1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid at pH lower than 5.5 (6Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, acquisition of detergent insolubility of human brain PrP resulting from treatment with low pH and GdnHCl could be concomitant with conformational changes and associated aggregation, driven by hydrophobic interactions. Human brain PrP treated at acidic pH/GdnHCl acquires the insolubility of PrPSc, but does not display the protease resistance or epitope obscuration possessed by this isoform. Several lines of evidence indicate that β-structure formation in a region spanning residues ∼90–120 contributes to the acquisition of PK resistance of PrPSc (11Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 23Zhang H.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Using anti-PrP antibody-mediated structural mapping, Peretz et al. (11Peretz D. Williamson R.A. Matsunaga Y. Serban H. Pinilla C. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. James T.L. Houghten R.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) reported epitopes in this region (residues ∼90 to 120) were accessible in PrPCbut largely cryptic in PrP 27–30. The obscuration in PrPScof the 3F4 epitope (residues 109–112) is consistent with this hypothesis, although the decreased accessibility to the 6H4 epitope (residues 144–152) suggests that the final rearranged region extends C-terminal to residues 90 to 120. If PrPSc formation is dependent upon structural changes in codons ∼90–120, then structural changes in other regions of the molecule are responsible for the decreased solubility and enhanced recruitability of acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated human brain PrP. Precedents for structural rearrangements occurring outside residues 90–120 include: an acidic pH-induced α-β transition in a C-terminal domain of hamster rPrP-(121–231) (8Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and the acquisition of a novel binding site for Cu(II) in mouse rPrP-(121–231) treated at pH range 3–5 (25Cereghetti G.M. Schweiger A. Glockshuber R. Van Doorslaer S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 516-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), both of which are outside of the 90–120 region. Acidified, but not non-acidified, human brain PrP acquires some protease resistance characteristic of PrPSc in the presence of low concentration SDS and Triton X-100. The anionic detergent SDS may impact the hydrophobicity of treated rPrP molecules (18Xiong L.W. Raymond L.D. Hayes S.F. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and induce intermolecular interactions and further structural rearrangement. The PK-resistant conversion of acidified, but not non-acidified, human brain PrP was greatly enhanced by the presence trace amounts of native PrPSc. These data suggest that acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated PrP constitutes an acceptable substrate for the PrPC to PrPSc recruitment process. Moreover, the acquisition of PrPSc-like properties by acidic pH/GdnHCl brain PrP is template-directed, similar to the PrP conversion occurring in prion disease. PrPC is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transits through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, where it is attached to the outer leaflet by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor in lipid rafts or caveolae (26Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 27Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PrPC is internalized into endocytic compartments from which most of the molecules are recycled intact to the cell surface (28Harris D.A. Clin.

Our finding that acidified PrP is an enhanced substrate for PrP conversion implicates an acidic environment for conversion in vivo.

However, in view of the endosomal recycling activity of PrPC, it is possible that cell surface PrPC may be composed of two populations: one directly from the Golgi and another recycled from the endosome as acidified PrP. The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate that, after acidification, PrP possesses properties physically distinct from the un-acidified molecules, which are retained even when the protein is returned to physiological pH. Consistent with the notion of recruitable and “non-recruitable” pools of PrPC is the finding that only ∼5–10% PrPC has been found to be converted into PrPScin scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells (37Taraboulos A.

In prion diseases, it is thought that PrPC is recruited to PrPSc by a template-directed process that can be mimicked in vitro(3Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J.

Our finding that acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated human brain PrP constitutes a superior substrate for this reaction might be exploited to detect PrPSc in tissues and fluids in which the template is present in extremely low concentrations. It is also possible that the conversion of acidified PrP into a PK-resistant form may more closely resemble PrPSc propagation in vivo, compared with two other in vitro PrP conversion systems previously reported (3Kocisko D.A.

However, the hamster brain PMCA system optimized by Saborio et al. (5Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) does not appear to support significant amplification of human PrPSc. Our data indicate that acidic/GdnHCl-treated PrPC is a superior substrate to untreated PrPCin amplification detection of human PrPSc and also obviates the requirement for lengthly incubation-sonication cycles. It is possible that acidic pH/GdnHCl-treated human brain PrP may be useful to determine the conformational events of underlying prion protein conversion in disease, the molecular co-factors and posttranslational modifications critical in conversion, and pharmaceutical agents that might prevent PrPSc formation in vitro andin vivo.

To elucidate the functional role of junctin in heart, transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing canine junctin (24-29 folds) under the control of mouse a-myosin heavy chain promoter were generated. Overexpression of the junctin in mouse heart was associated with heart enlargements, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and increased fibrosis. Many ultrastructural alterations were observed in TG atria. The junctional SR cisternae facing transverse-tubules contained a dense matrix of calsequestrin in TG heart. According to echocardiography, TG mice showed enlarged left ventricles, dilated right atriums, and ventricles with paradoxical septal motion and impaired left ventricular systolic function. Overexpression of junctin led to down-regulation of triadin and RyR but to up-regulation of dihydropyridine receptor. The L-type Ca2+ current density and action potential durations increased, which could be the cause for the bradycardia in TG heart. This study provides an important example of pathogenesis leading to substantial cardiac remodeling and atrial fibrillation, which was caused by overexpression of junctin in heart."

Our data also suggest that Arg662 contributes to the function of the proline-based signal. 667PXXP670was the dominant signal when both motifs were present and was more effective than 658LL659 at overriding strong apical sorting signals located in the same molecule.

Epithelial cell plasma membranes are organized into distinct apical and basolateral domains, which face the lumen or underlying cells and connective tissue, respectively. Each domain's unique molecular composition facilitates a wide variety of organ-specific functions, including vectorial transport and compartmentalized cell signaling (1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J.

Other basolateral sorting signals have been identified, however, that bear no relation to known clathrin-coated membrane localization motifs. Other than clusters of essential charged amino acids, most of the signals in this category are devoid of recognizable motifs that might offer clues regarding physiologically relevant protein-protein interactions (13Matter K.

Nowhere is the importance of restricted basolateral EGF receptor expression more apparent than in polycystic kidney disease (28Wilson P.D. Sherwood A.C.

We have shown previously that newly synthesized EGF receptors are delivered directly to the basolateral surface in the MDCK cell model (33Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Cell.

Importantly, this same sequence mediates basolateral targeting when transplanted to a heterologous reporter molecule, proof that is an autonomous, dominant signal (26Hobert M.E. Kil S. Carlin C.R. J.

In addition to MDCK cells, EGF receptors also exhibit a predominantly basolateral localization in LLC-PK1 cells (35Mullin J.M. McGinn M.T.

Hence, polarized EGF receptor sorting from internal compartments is likely mediated by novel protein-protein interactions. Data presented in this study show that the EGF receptor juxtamembrane domain has a hierarchy of functionally redundant basolateral membrane localization signals with distinct amino acid requirements.

Cytoplasmically truncated receptors are named based on the carboxyl-terminal amino acid in the EGF receptor-coding region (e.g. c′-674 has a P675STOP substitution).

When sequenced, the recombinant products had an internal deletion, due to a second previously unrecognized EcoNI site located 5′ to the nucleotide 1876 EcoNI site. To create full-length products, recombinant molecules were digested with BstXI andXbaI, liberating an 1836-nucleotide product encoding the carboxyl half of the full-length EGF receptor, including the mutation. These fragments were ligated to a 2100-nucleotideXhoI-BxtXI fragment encoding the amino half of the wild-type EGF receptor, including the sequence deleted in the initial recombinants, and pBK-CMVΔlacΔDraIII digested atXhoI and XbaI sites located at 5′ and 3′ sites, respectively, in the polylinker. An E673A substitution was made using a forward mutagenic primer 5′-CTCTTACACCCAGTGGAGCAGCACCCAACCAAGC-3′, designed to anneal to a DraIII site (underlined) located at EGF receptor nucleotide 2284 and to introduce the amino acid substitution (bold italics). The reverse primer, 5′-CAAACGGTCACCCCGTAGCTCCA GACGTC¯¯ACTCTCTGGT-3′, was designed to anneal to a BstEII site (underlined) located at EGF receptor nucleotide 2889, and to introduce a silentAatII site (double underlined) for recombinant screening. PCR products were digested with DraIII and BstEII and ligated to full-length EGF receptor sequences cloned in pBK-CMVΔlacΔDraIII digested with the same enzymes. cDNAs encoding the extracellular domain of decay accelerating factor (DAFex), and DAFex linked to EGF receptor transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences to residue 651 (DAF-651) and to residue 674 (DAF-674), cloned in pCB6+ have been described previously. DAF-663 was made using a forward primer 5′-GTATCTCGAGGGCTGTCCAAC-3′, designed to anneal at the 5′-end of sequences encoding the EGF receptor transmembrane domain, and to incorporate a silent XhoI site (underlined) without altering the amino acid coding sequence for EGF receptor residues Leu609 and Glu610 (bold italics); and a reverse mutagenic primer 5′-GTTCG TCTAGA¯¯ TCACTCCCTCTCCTG-3′, incorporating a stop code in place of the code for Glu-663 (bold) and an XbaI site (double underlined) compatible with the pCB6+ polylinker. DAF-674 with a P667A substitution was made using the same forward primer and a reverse mutagenic primer, 5′-GCGATATC TCAAGCTTCTCCACTGGGTGTAAGTGCCTC-3′, which was designed to introduce a P667A substitution (bold italics), a Pro675STOP (bold), and an EcoRV site (underlined) compatible with the pCB6+ polylinker. PCR products were digested withXhoI and XbaI or EcoRV and ligated directly to pCB6+/DAFex digested with the same restriction enzymes. PCR primers were designed using the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). PCR amplifications were carried out using a RoboCycler 40 temperature cycler (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). All PCR products and religated recombinant products were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing (Cleveland Genomics, Cleveland, OH). Sequences were verified by analysis of genomic DNA recovered from permanent clonal cell lines. CHO cells were seeded at a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish and transfected using DNA mixed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) 5 h later. Filter-grown MDCK cells were transfected using DNA mixed with Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) added to both sides of the filter. Both cell types were assayed for transient membrane domain-specific protein expression 40–48 h post-transfection. Exogenously expressed human EGF receptors are readily detected in both cell types in CHO cells, because they lack endogenous receptors (39Livneh E. Prywes R. Kashles O. Reiss N. Sasson I., Y. Mory A.U. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12490-12497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in MDCK cells, because exogenously expressed human receptors can be distinguished from endogenous canine receptors with species-specific antibodies (33Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To make permanent MDCK cell lines, cells seeded at a density of ∼7 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish were transfected with DNA-Lipofectin complexes as described previously (33Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells that had been grown in selection medium containing G418 (0.8 mg/ml Geneticin, Invitrogen) for 10–14 days were labeled with the monoclonal antibody EGF-R1, specific for an external human EGF receptor peptide epitope (40Waterfield M.D. Mayes E.L.V.

Chem. 1984; 259: 7902-7908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), for enrichment by sterile sorting on a flow cytometer (Cytofluorograph IIs, Ortho Instruments, Westwood, MA). Cells were rinsed twice and then preincubated in methionine and cysteine-free medium for up to 1 h, before metabolic labeling with [35S]Express Protein Labeling Mix (1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wilmington, DE) diluted in the amino acid-deficient medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS and 0.2% BSA. Filter-grown MDCK cells were labeled from the basolateral surface. Labeling medium was replaced with complete MEM supplemented with a 10-fold excess of non-radioactive methionine and cysteine (chase medium), and cells were incubated for additional periods of time. Cells were lysed with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm leupeptin, for immunoprecipitation with antibodies recognizing external epitopes in the human EGF receptor (EGF-R1) or DAF (gift of Ed Medof, Case Western Reserve University) absorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). After extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were solubilized with Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207084) Google Scholar), and fluorographic detection. Radioactive quantitation was carried out by Phosphorstorage autoradiography (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Filter-grown MDCK cells that had been metabolically labeled were rinsed twice with ice-cold MEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% BSA (M/H/B) and then incubated with EGF-R1 ascites (10 μl/ml) added to one side of the filter for 1 h on ice. Cells were rinsed four times with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and then lysed with 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 in 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, supplemented with 15% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were added directly to protein A-Sepharose beads to capture surface-exposed EGF receptors, and immunoprecipitates were washed, solubilized, and resolved by SDS-PAGE exactly as described in the previous section. Filter-grown cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold MEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA and then incubated with ∼10 nm125I-EGF for 2 h at 4 °C. Receptor-grade mouse EGF (Toyobo Biochemicals, Osaka, Japan) was labeled with 125I (carrier-free, >350 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using chloramine-T. Cells were rinsed three times with the MEM/BSA solution and then incubated with 2 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) in a solution of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 8 mm glucose, and 1.2 mm MgSO4 for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by a 5-min incubation with 0.05m Tris, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 exactly as described above, and equal aliquots of total cell protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. Filter-grown cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Some cells were stained with antibodies to external epitopes added to the apical or basolateral surface of non-permeabilized cells. Others were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then stained with the ZO-1-specific rat monoclonal R26.4C antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), or a β-catenin-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Secondary antibodies were fluorophore-conjugated, species-specific Fab fragments that had been solid-phase absorbed to prevent cross-reactivity with primary antibodies made in other species (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Fort Washington, PA). Cells were stained with primary or secondary antibodies for 1 h each at 37 °C. Antibodies were diluted in PBS supplemented with 3% radioimmunoassay-grade bovine serum albumin, and cells were blocked with a solution containing 5% normal serum from the host animal used to generate the secondary antibody between incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. Filters were excised from plastic inserts and placed cell-side up on a glass slide. Coverslips were mounted on the cells using SlowFade anti-fade solution from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 410 scanning laser confocal microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) using the 488/568-nm wavelength lines of an argon-krypton laser. Cells were optically sectioned every 0.5 μm. Image resolution using a Zeiss 100× Neofluor objective and Zeiss LSM software was 512 × 512 pixels. The amino acid sequence of the originally identified a 22-amino acid juxtamembrane domain necessary for basolateral localization of cytoplasmically truncated EGF receptors is shown in Fig.1 A (26Hobert M.E. Kil S. Carlin C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We sought to characterize the molecular basis of basolateral localization, by focusing on several consensus amino acid protein interaction motifs located in this region. Examination of the sequence revealed the existence of a two consensus leucine-based motifs, located at Leu658-Leu659 and Leu664-Val665 (Fig. 1 A). Although predominantly characterized in endocytic pathways (reviewed in Ref.18Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), leucine-based motifs are implicated in basolateral sorting of at least two other membrane proteins (15Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11757-11762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (also see TableI). Because leucine-based signals are impaired by dialanine substitution (18Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we changed each of the leucine-based signals to alanines, either individually (P675STOP-LL-2xA or P675STOP-LV-2xA) or"
https://openalex.org/W2034572103,"The interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase, PKR, plays an important role in messenger (m) RNA translation by phosphorylating the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2. Through this capacity PKR is thought to be a mediator of the antiviral and antiproliferative actions of interferon. In addition to translational function, PKR has been implicated in many signaling pathways to gene transcription by modulating the activities of a number of transcription factors, including NF-κB and STATs. However, experiments with two different PKR knockout (PKR−/−) mouse models have failed to verify many of the biological functions attributed to PKR. In addition, results with cells from the two PKR−/− mice have been contradictory and confusing. Here, we show that the first PKR−/− mouse with deletion of exons 2 and 3, corresponding to the N terminus domain of PKR (N-PKR−/−), expresses a truncated protein, resulting from the translation of the exon-skipped mouse PKR (ES-mPKR) mRNA. The ES-mPKR protein is defective in dsRNA binding but remains catalytically active bothin vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the second PKR−/− mouse with a targeted deletion of exon 12, which corresponds to the C terminus of the molecule (C-PKR−/−), expresses a truncated mPKR produced by alternative splicing of exon 12. Although the spliced form of mPKR (SF-mPKR) is catalytically inactive, it retains the dsRNA-binding properties of the wild type mPKR. Reverse transcription-PCRs demonstrate that SF-mPKR mRNA is expressed in several normal mouse tissues, and appears to be under developmental control during embryogenesis. Our data demonstrate that both PKR−/−models are incomplete knockouts, and expression of the PKR variants may account, at least in part, for the significant signaling differences between cells from the two PKR−/− mice.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). PKR is a 68-kDa protein in humans and a 65-kDa protein in mice that displays distinct activities: (i) autophosphorylation upon binding to dsRNA on multiple serine and threonine sites (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), and (ii) phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α) on serine 51, a modification that leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis (3Hershey J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Through this capacity, PKR is believed to be a mediator of the biological functions of IFN (4Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). In addition to translational control, PKR has been implicated in various signaling pathways leading to gene transcription by modulating the activities of various transcription factors including NF-κB, signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs), and the tumor suppressor p53 (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar).Work with cultured cells in many laboratories has assigned PKR antiviral, antiproliferative, and tumor suppressor functions in vitro (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These PKR functions were based on the observations that the overexpression of wild-type human PKR (hPKR) can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis, whereas the overexpression of hPKR mutants are capable of inducing malignant transformation when expressed in mouse NIH3T3 cells (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J.

However, the antiproliferative and tumor suppressor functions of PKR have not yet been verified in vivo. Specifically, two distinct PKR knockout mice, generated by either disruption of exons 2 and 3 of the pkr gene (herein referred as N-PKR−/− mice (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R.

In addition, both types of PKR−/− mice have not displayed any significant susceptibility to infections with a variety of viruses (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A.

The contradictory results obtained with cells expressing dominant negative PKR mutants and PKR−/− cells have been explained by the possible expression of other PKR-like molecules, whose function could be possibly blocked by the PKR mutants (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J.

In fact, the cloning and characterization of PKR-related genes, such as the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase/pancreatic eIF-2α kinase, which functions as an eIF-2α kinase (11Ron D. Harding H.P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 547-560Google Scholar), and the mouse homologue of the yeast eIF-2α kinase, general control nonderepressible 2 (12Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. De Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), have supported this notion. Thus, PKR appears to be the prototype of a family of kinases with overlapping biochemical and biological functions (13Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar).Concerning cell signaling, studies with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from the N-PKR−/− mouse were found to be defective in IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation by dsRNA (14Kumar A.

DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Moreover, N-PKR−/− MEFs are susceptible to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), dsRNA, or lipopolysaccharide treatment (17Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of the STAT-1α protein by phosphorylation on serine 727 is impaired in N-PKR−/− MEFs treated with IFNs (18Ramana C.V. Grammatikakis N.F. Chernov M.F. Nguyen H.F. Goh K.C. Williams B.R. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast to the N-PKR−/− cells, the C-PKR−/− cells respond normally to the above stimuli (7Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A.

For example, the susceptibility of C-PKR−/− MEFs to apoptotic death in response to dsRNA, virus infection, lipopolysaccharide, or TNF-α treatment is normal compared with genetically matched PKR+/+ MEFs (7Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A. McBurney M.W. Koromilas A.E. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).These striking signaling differences between the two types of PKR−/− cells prompted us to investigate the possible expression of truncated PKR proteins resulting from incomplete disruption of the pkr gene. Specifically, Yang et al. (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) initially hypothesized that the N-PKR−/−mice might express a truncated PKR, which is the product of translation of a PKR mRNA devoid of exons 2 and 3. Translation of this exon-skipped mRNA could initiate from an AUG that corresponds to methionine 136 producing a 382-amino acid C-terminal fragment of mPKR (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In fact, the 42–44-kDa exon-skipped mouse PKR (ES-mPKR) protein was detected in reticulocyte lysates programmed to translate the ES-mPKR mRNA from N-PKR−/− cells (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). However, Yanget al. (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) were not able to detect ES-mPKR expression in extracts from N-PKR−/− cells because of the unavailability of antibodies against the C terminus part of mPKR (6Yang Y.L.

Here, using antibodies specific to the C terminus of mPKR we demonstrate that ES-mPKR is indeed expressed in N-PKR−/−MEFs. We also show that the ES-mPKR is inducible by IFN-α/β and contains eIF-2α kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the C-PKR−/−mouse also contains a partial PKR product. Specifically, we show the expression of an alternatively spliced form of mPKR (SF-mPKR) in these cells, which is catalytically inactive but fully active for binding to dsRNA. Our data demonstrate the expression of partially functional products in both types of PKR−/− cells, thus providing an explanation for the striking signaling differences between cells from the two PKR−/− models.DISCUSSIONPKR was initially characterized as a protein kinase with an important role in the control of mRNA translation through its capacity to induce eIF-2α phosphorylation (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The transcriptional induction of the pkr gene by type I IFNs provided further evidence that PKR is a mediator of the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of IFN (4Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). The cloning of the human and mouse PKR cDNAs (25Icely P.L. Gros P.F.

To date, numerous reports have assigned PKR anti-proliferative and tumor suppressor functionsin vitro and have implicated it in many signaling pathways that control gene expression at both translational and transcriptional levels (1Kaufman R.J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 503-527Google Scholar, 2Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). However, the generation and characterization of two different PKR−/− mice did not yield the anticipated results, as many of the important in vitro functions of PKR have not been verified in vivo. In addition, experiments with cells from the two PKR−/− mice have led to contradictory and confusing results concerning the PKR functionsin vivo. Here, we demonstrate that neither of the two PKR−/− mice is completely devoid of PKR. The N-PKR−/− mouse (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) expresses a dsRNA-binding defective but catalytically active PKR protein, whereas the C-PKR−/− mouse (7Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A. McBurney M.W. Koromilas A.E. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5953-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) expresses an alternatively spliced form of the kinase with intact dsRNA-binding and impaired catalytic properties.In regard to cell signaling, it was previously shown that N-PKR−/− MEFs display an impaired NF-κB activation in response to dsRNA and this defect was restored after priming with IFN-α/β or IFN-γ possibly by the expression of a molecule that substitutes PKR function (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Subsequent work with the N-PKR−/− MEFs concluded that PKR functions as an important signal transducer for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes through pathways that implicate interferon regulatory factor-1 and NF-κB (14Kumar A. Yang Y.L. Flati V. Der S. Kadereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Moreover, N-PKR−/− MEFs were found to be resistant to apoptotic death in response to dsRNA, TNF-α, or lipopolysaccharide providing further evidence for the role of PKR in stress-induced apoptosis (17Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, work with the N-PKR−/− MEFs established a requirement of the kinase for p38 MAPK activation (36Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and for serine phosphorylation of STAT1α in response to IFNs (18Ramana C.V. Grammatikakis N.F. Chernov M.F. Nguyen H.F. Goh K.C. Williams B.R. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). More recent work with the N-PKR−/−MEFs showed that the defective NF-κB activation by dsRNA is because of the impaired IKK activation and phosphorylation of IκBα (15Chu W.M. Ostertag D., Li, Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar,16Zamanian-Daryoush M. Mogensen T.H. DiDonato J.A. Williams B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1278-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).The above signaling defects of N-PKR−/− cells were not found in C-PKR−/− cells (7Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A. McBurney M.W. Koromilas A.E. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5953-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Specifically, IFN signaling and transcriptional induction of IFN-inducible genes is normal in C-PKR−/− cells (7Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A. McBurney M.W. Koromilas A.E. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5953-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating that the lack of the catalytic activity of PKR does not interfere with the Jak-STAT pathway. In accord with this, we found that phosphorylation of STAT1 on serine 727 is not impaired in IFN-treated C-PKR−/− MEFs (data not shown) as opposed to N-PKR−/− MEFs (18Ramana C.V. Grammatikakis N.F. Chernov M.F. Nguyen H.F. Goh K.C. Williams B.R. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In regard to NF-κB activation, it has been documented that C-PKR−/−MEFs respond normally to dsRNA (19Iordanov M.S. Wong J.F. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or TNF-α (7Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C. Atkins H.L. Gray D.A. McBurney M.W. Koromilas A.E. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5953-5962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggesting that the catalytic activity of PKR is dispensable for NF-κB-mediated gene transcription. This is further supported by our data showing that induction of IκBα phosphorylation by dsRNA is normal in C-PKR−/− MEFs compared with isogenic PKR+/+MEFs (Fig. 7 A).The above striking differences between the two PKR−/−mice may be attributed to the expression of the PKR forms. It is possible that the N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain of PKR is essential for mediating some signaling properties of PKR, and therefore the lack of this domain in ES-mPKR may account for the signaling defects reported for N-PKR−/− MEFs. Specifically, PKR through its N terminus domain may participate in cell signaling as a scaffold protein by mediating protein-protein interactions and/or subcellular localization and compartmentalization of the molecule. This would explain the lack of the signaling defects that were reported for N-PKR−/− cells in C-PKR−/− MEFs, because the latter cell type expresses SF-mPKR with an intact dsRNA-binding domain. This would also imply that PKR may have the capacity to modulate cell signaling independently of its enzymatic activity. Interestingly, a kinase-independent role of PKR has been reported for signaling pathways leading to the transcriptional activation of NF-κB and STAT1 (31Bonnet M.C. Weil R. Dam E. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4532-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 32Ishii T.F. Kwon H.F. Hiscott J.F. Mosialos G.F. Koromilas A.E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Concerning viral infection, both PKR−/− mice exhibit a very modest susceptibility to viruses. Specifically, N-PKR−/− mice are susceptible to infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (6Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), whereas C-PKR−/− mice are susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus infection only after intranasal inoculation (8Balachandran S. Roberts P.C. Brown L.E. Truong H. Pattnaik A.K. Archer D.R. Barber G.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Stojdl D.F. Abraham N. Knowles S. Marius R. Brasey A. Lichty B.D. Brown E.G. Sonenberg N. Bell J.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9580-9585Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent report demonstrates that the increased susceptibility of C-PKR−/− mice to vesicular stomatitis virus is mouse strain-dependent because animals with BALB/c genetic background are 5 orders of magnitude more sensitive to infection than those with 129SvEv background (10Durbin R.K. Mertz S.E. Koromilas A.E. Durbin J.E. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PKR−/−mice bred onto resistant 129SvEv background still exhibited a 10-fold increased sensitivity compared with the strain-matched PKR+/+ mice (10Durbin R.K. Mertz S.E. Koromilas A.E. Durbin J.E. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that the signaling properties attributed to PKR may also be affected by mouse strain differences. We also found that eIF-2α phosphorylation in response to Sendai virus infection is not impaired in C-PKR−/− MEFs compared with isogenic PKR+/+MEFs (Fig. 7 B). This may indicate that the loss of the catalytic activity of PKR in C-PKR−/− cells could be compensated by another eIF-2α kinase activated by virus infection. This is consistent with our previous observations that expression of the vaccinia virus K3L protein, which functions as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR (38Kawagishi-Kobayashi M. Silverman J.B. Ung T.L. Dever T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4146-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was still capable of enhancing translation from reporter gene constructs in transiently transfected C-PKR−/− MEFs (21Li S. Koromilas A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13881-13890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The newly identified eIF-2α kinases, PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase and general control nonderepressible 2, might be implicated in this process although it is not yet known how these enzymes are regulated in virus-infected cells. In regard to an antiviral role of PKR independently of eIF2α, the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways have been recently implicated in virus replication (15Chu W.M. Ostertag D., Li, Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 39Iordanov M.S. Paranjape J.M. Zhou A.F. Wong J.F. Williams B.R. Meurs E.F. Silverman R.H. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although, activation of p38 MAPK was partially impaired in N-PKR−/− MEFs (36Goh K.C. deVeer M.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), our experiments with C-PKR−/− MEFs showed normal patterns of activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK pathways in response to vesicular stomatitis virus or Sendai virus infection (data not shown).The functional characterization of the ES-mPKR and SF1-mPKR proteins may provide some clues to molecular mechanisms of PKR action. For example, current models for PKR activation propose that dsRNA binding to the dsRBMs leads to structural rearrangement of PKR relieving an autoinhibitory interaction between the dsRNA-binding domain and the kinase domain (KD), and facilitating kinase activation (40Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,41Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5567-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Based on this model, autoinhibition of the KD by the dsRNA-binding domain in ES-mPKR is not possible, because this protein lacks the dsRBM1 and half of the dsRBM2. Thus, the lack of an autoinhibitory action may explain, at least in part, the constitutive activity of ES-mPKR in vitro and in vivo. In regard to SF1-mPKR, its expression in certain mouse tissues might be indicative of a specific function of this protein. Because induction of PKR activity proceeds through dsRNA binding, dimerization, and interphosphorylation, a predicted function of the SF1-mPKR protein is the inhibition of mPKR activity in a dominant negative fashion, as previously demonstrated for a similar catalytic inactive PKR form expressed in a mouse pre-B leukemia cell line (22Abraham N. Jaramillo M.L. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Icely P.L. Stojdl D.F. Barber G.N. Bell J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, expression of SF1-mPKR in normal tissues is very little compared with the full-length PKR suggesting that a dominant negative effect of this protein could possibly be local and/or RNA specific. Alternatively, SF1-mPKR could function as a RNA-binding protein independently of PKR by modulating, for example, RNA editing (42Bass B.L. Nishikura K.F. Keller W.F. Seeburg P.H. Emeson R.B. O'"

A homeodomain and a forkhead transcription factor, NKX2.1 and HNF-3, respectively, are known activators of Sp-B transcription. Because SMADs are the effectors of TGF-β−induced gene activation, we examined the possibility that gene repression by TGF-β may also occur through interactions of SMADs with NKX2.1 and HNF-3. We found that lung epithelial carcinoma H441 cells contain SMAD2/3 and -4, which localize to the nucleus in response to TGF-β treatment. The activity of a transfected Sp-B promoter/reporter construct was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by TGF-β. Cotransfection with a mutant, constitutively activated form of the Tgf-β type I receptor repressed Sp-B promoter activity in the absence of TGF-β ligand. Dominant negative mutants of Smads blocked the repressor activity of TGF-β. SMAD3, but not SMAD2, mediated the repressor activity of TGF-β on the Sp-B promoter. Mutations within a 70-base pair domain that includes binding sites for NKX2.1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3), or cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) eliminated SMAD3-dependent repression of Sp-B transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed no evidence for direct binding of SMAD3 to theSp-B promoter, and a DNA binding mutant of SMAD3 also repressed Sp-B, suggesting that direct DNA binding of SMAD3 may not be required. Using a mammalian two hybrid assay, we found physical and functional interactions between SMAD3 and both NKX2.1 and HNF-3. Also, a glutathione S-transferase-fused SMAD3 directly binds to in vitro synthesized NKX2.1 or HNF-3, demonstrating protein-protein interactions between SMAD3 and the two transcriptional factors. The DNA binding of NKX2.1 to Sp-Bpromoter was reduced in response to TGF-β treatment, although expression of Nkx2.1 was not affected. We conclude that SMAD3 interactions with the positive regulators NKX2.1 and HNF-3 underlie the molecular basis for TGF-β-induced repression ofSp-B gene transcription.

TGF-β exerts its function by interacting with a heteromeric complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I and type II receptors. Subsequent to TGF-β ligand-induced phosphorylation of the type I by the type II receptors, a family of transcriptional factors known as SMADs act as intracellular effectors of TGF-β signaling (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Kijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Homologues of SMADs are found in diverse eukaryotic organisms including Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans. SMAD2 and/or SMAD3 are phosphorylated in their carboxyl-terminal domain by the activated type I receptors upon stimulation by either activin or TGF-β (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Kijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 is accompanied by their association with a third member of this family, SMAD4, and translocation of the heteromeric complex to the nucleus where they affect transcription of target genes through interaction with promoter-specific transcriptional factors or by direct DNA binding (3Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2254-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 4Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

The mechanisms by which SMADs affect transcription can be direct or indirect. For example, in response to activin, SMAD2/4 complex can activate transcription from the Mix.2 andgoosecoid promoters by interaction with winged helix transcriptional factors FAST-1 or FAST-2 (9Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 435-451PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the TGF-β-responsive collagenase I promoter is the direct target of SMAD3 that interacts physically and functionally with its promoter elements (10Qing J. Zhang Y. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38802-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One important functional aspect of TGF-β activity is its role as a growth inhibitor (11Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 12Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Activation of genes is a part of the growth inhibitory functions of TGF-β. For example TGF-β-induced growth arrest of HaCaT and Mv1Lu epithelial cells is mediated by SMAD3-dependent induction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p15Ink4B, which inhibits the activities of cyclin-dependent CDK4 and CDK6. TGF-β is also known to inhibit differentiation of both mesenchymal and epithelial cells. The mechanisms underlying this mode of action of TGF-β is little understood. Recently, TGF-β inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and repression of the CBFA1 gene was shown to be mediated by SMAD3 (3Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2254-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Here SMAD3 interacts physically with CBFA1 at the CBFA1 binding OSE2 promoter sequence without direct interactions with DNA. Also, Liu et al. (38Liu D. Black B.L. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) found that TGF-β-induced inhibition of muscle cell differentiation occurs through functional repression of myogenic transcription factors by SMAD3. In this mode of SMAD3-mediated gene repression, SMAD3 interacts physically with MyoD both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction may underlie the ability of SMAD3 to inhibit the transactivation of E-box containing muscle enhancers by MyoD. Growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β have also been demonstrated in the lung. Ectopic overexpression of TGF-β1 in transgenic mice perturbs lung vascular development and inhibits pulmonary epithelial cell differentiation (13Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Treatment of human lung explants with TGF-β1 inhibits epithelial cell maturation and expression of lung-specific pulmonary surfactant protein genes, Sp-A, SP-B, and Sp-C (14Beers M.F. Solarin K.O. Guttentag S.H. Rosenbloom J. Kormilli A. Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L950-L960PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, targeted disruption ofTgf-β2 or Tgf-β3results in developmental defects and perinatal lethality.Tgf-β2(−/−) lungs are highly dysmorphic, whereas absence of Tgf-β3 causes delayed lung maturation in newborn mice (15Kaartinen V.

Sariola H. Friedman R. Boivin G.P. Cardell E.L. Doetschman T. Development. 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human neonates, TGF-β has been implicated in pathogenesis of chronic lung disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia, in which it is thought to interrupt normal late lung development by inhibition of alveologenesis (17Lecart C. Cayabyab R. Buckley S. Morrison J. Kwong K.Y Warburton D. Ramanathan R. Jones C.A. Minoo P. Biol. Neonate. 2000; 77: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which TGF-β interferes with lung morphogenesis and cell differentiation remain entirely unknown. Surfactant protein B is a necessary component for the function of pulmonary surfactant. In humans, mutations in the Sp-B gene that disrupt SP-B synthesis or processing are lethal (18Cole F.S. Hamvas A. Nogee L.M. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 50: 157-162Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Even partial SP-B deficiency causes respiratory distress and morbidity (19Dunbar III, A.E. Wert S.E.

TheSp-B gene has been shown to be regulated by key transcription factors, NKX2.1 and HNF-3 (20Bohinski R.J., Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 21Margana R.K. Boggaram V. J. Biol.

NKX2.1 is a homeodomain transcriptional regulator of both structural organization of the lung and differentiation of highly specialized epithelial cell types such as alveolar type II cells (22Minoo P., Su, G. Drum H. Bringas P. Kimura S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A member of the forkhead family of transcription factors, HNF-3, is critical to early embryonic development but also regulates lung-specific gene expression in cell culture studies (20Bohinski R.J., Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 21Margana R.K. Boggaram V. J. Biol.

Sci. 2000; 923: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Functional binding sites for both NKX2.1 and HNF-3 are clustered within a 40-bp element ∼120 nucleotides from the site of transcriptional initiation on the human Sp-Bgene. Within the latter element and juxtaposed to the HNF-3 binding site is localized a consensus binding site for the cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB (24Berhane Boggaram V. Gene. 2001; 268: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous transcription factors SP1 and the CREB-binding protein, CBP, have been implicated inSp-B gene transcription (21Margana R.K. Boggaram V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3083-3090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Berhane Boggaram V. Gene. 2001; 268: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Naltner A.

In human pulmonary adenocarcinoma H441 cells, TGF-β has a profound repressor effect onSp-B gene expression at the transcriptional level. The repressor effect of TGF-β was localized to the region of theSp-B promoter (−112/−72) containing the binding sites for NKX2.1 and HNF-3. The precise mechanism by which TGF-β repressesSp-B gene transcription remains unknown, although Kumaret al. (26Kumar A.S. Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggest that it could partly be explained by TGF-β-induced cytoplasmic trapping of NKX2.1 and HNF-3. In the current study, we have examined the mechanisms by which TGF-β represses the transcription of human Sp-B gene in H441 cells. The results provide evidence that SMAD3 repressesSp-B gene transcription by interacting with NKX2.1 and HNF-3, the positive transcriptional factors that bind to theSp-B proximal promoter. The human pulmonary epithelial cell lines NCI H441 and A549 (ATCC) and human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI medium 1640, F-12K nutrient mixture, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The mouse MLE15 cells were grown in culture according to the procedure described previously (27Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). All plasmids used in transfection studies were purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen). Transient transfection of H441 cells, A549 cells, and HeLa cells was performed with SuperFect or FuGENE 6 as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen and Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief, cells in 35-mm dishes at 60–80% confluence were transfected with 2.25 μg ofpSV-β-gal (Promega), 2.25 μg of test constructs, 2.25 μg of transactivator plasmids, and 15 μl of transfectant. Cells were cultured for 6 h and then changed into regular medium with 10% serum. Cells were cultured for an additional 42 h in the presence or absence of human recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) and collected as described (Promega). Supernatants of the cell extracts were used for the assay of β-galactosidase and either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase as described (Ref. 28Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar; Promega). A 1.4-kilobase fragment of the human Sp-B promoter region (−1040/+431) (29Pilot-Matias T.J. Kister S.E. Fox J.L. Kropp K. Glasser S.W. Whitsett J.A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was cloned into pGL2 basic (Promega) and named SpB(−1040/+431). The fragment –140/+431 was PCR amplified and cloned into SacI/HindIII sites of pGL2 basic and namedSpB(−140/+431). The 170-bp (−120/+50) fragment of the thymidine kinase ( TK) promoter was PCR-amplified and cloned into the BglII/HindIII of pGL2 basic and named pCL74. An oligonucleotide covering the region −140/−70 of the Sp-B promoter was synthesized and cloned upstream of the TK promoter of pCL74. This construct is designatedSpB(−140/−70)TK. A fragment of theSp-B gene from −641 to +431 was isolated by exonuclease digestion and ligated upstream of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as previously described and designatedSpB(−641/+431)CAT (28Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar). TheSmad dominant negative [pSMAD2(3S → A) and pCD-D4-N4(137–552)3′FLAG)] and wild type expression constructs, the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (TRI(act)) construct, and the PAIexpression constructs were as described (30de Caestecker M.P.

Constructs with mutations of NKX2.1, HNF-3, or CREB binding sites were made by synthesized oligos covering −140/−70 of the Sp-B promoter with corresponding mutations (Fig. 5) cloned into the pCL74. The Nkx2.1 expression construct was previously described (32Hamdan H. Liu H., Li, C Jones C Lee M. deLemos R. Minoo P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Hnf-3α expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Robert H. Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago). TheCREB expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Richard H. Goodman (Oregon Health and Science University). The pVP16 plasmid for making VP16 fusion protein was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed, diluted as described (20Bohinski R.J., Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and used directly in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as a cold competitor. For use as probe in EMSA reactions, the annealed oligonucleotides were purified by gel electrophoresis on 3% low melting agarose (Promega), excised, and then eluted using QIAEXII (Qiagen). Two picomoles of the purified annealed oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled probes were purified from unincorporated ]γ-32P]ATP using G-25 Sephadex column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA sequences of the oligos were GGGTGTCTAGACGGCC for SMAD3 oligo (33Denissova N.G. Pouponnot C. Long J., He, D. Liu F. Proc..Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6397-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), GCACCTGGAGGGCTCTTCAGAGC for NKX2.1 oligo, and ACCTGGAGGGCTCTTCAGAGCAAAGACAAACACTGAGGTCGCTGCCAC for NHC oligo. EMSA was performed as described previously (33Denissova N.G. Pouponnot C. Long J., He, D. Liu F. Proc..Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6397-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with specific modifications. In brief, nuclear extracts were prepared using a mini-extraction procedure (20Bohinski R.J., Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of the nuclear extract were incubated with 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe with or without cold competitor in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), 6 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol, in a total volume of 20 μl at 4 °C for 15 min. The antibodies were then added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for an additional 20 min. Bound and free probes were separated by gel electrophoresis on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The NKX2.1 and the FLAG antibodies were purchased from Lab Vision Corp. and Sigma, respectively. GST interaction assays were performed as described (3Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2254-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In brief, GST or GST-SMAD3 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences).35S-Labeled NKX2.1 or 35S-labeled HNF-3α was prepared by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT kit (Promega). After preincubation with glutathione-Sepharose, the translation mixture containing 35S-labeled NKX2.1 or 35S-labeled HNF-3α was incubated with GST, or GST-SMAD3 was adsorbed to the Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h in the binding solution (3Alliston T. Choy L. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2254-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The beads were then washed repeatedly, and the associated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then dried and exposed to the x-ray films. Expression constructs forGAL4-Smad3 were co-transfected with VP16-Nkx2.1or VP16-Hnf3α expression constructs and the target plasmid, GAL4-luciferase reporter construct, pFR-Luc(Stratagene), into A549 cells as specified in the legend for Fig. 8. Transactivation of the heterologous GAL4 promoter in response to protein-protein interactions between GAL4-SMAD3 and VP16 fusion proteins was quantified by measuring luciferase activity. H441 cells were cultured on coverslips with 50 nm dexamethasone (to induceSp-B) in the presence and absence of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, exposed to sodium borohydride to reduce autofluorescence, and treated with Triton-X-100 + bovine serum albumin plus goat serum to permeabilize and block nonspecific binding as described (34Gonzales L.W. Angampalli S. Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Solarin K.O. Feinstein S.I. Matlapudi A. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2001; 20: 387-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to anti-SMAD2/3 (rabbit anti-human polyclonal, E-20) or anti-SMAD4 antibody (goat anti-human polyclonal, H-552, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat secondary IgG (1:300), respectively, conjugated to Cy3. Fluorescence was examined with an Olympus 1X70 microscope and Metamorph imaging system. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (GIBCO) from H441 cells treated with or without 10 μg/μl TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) for 24 h. Twenty micrograms of the total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% RNA formaldehyde agarose gel and Northern-blotted. Blots were hybridized with probes specific forNkx2.1 or 18 S rRNA and then autoradiographed. The probe forNkx2.1 was a cDNA reported previously by Hamdan et al. (32Hamdan H. Liu H., Li, C Jones C Lee M. deLemos R. Minoo P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MLE15 cells were treated with 10 μg/μl TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) for 24 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described for EMSA. 25 μg of nuclear extract was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated in 1:200-diluted primary anti-TTF-1 antibody (Lab Vision Corp.) overnight. The secondary antibody, goat-anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Pierce), was applied at a 1:1000 dilution for 30 min. The membrane was reacted with chemiluminescence reagent ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to photographic film. Previously, it was shown that TGF-β treatment of H441 cells inhibits transcription ofSp-B gene with responsiveness localized to the proximal promoter region (26Kumar A.S. Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of intracellular signaling involved in repression of Sp-B transcription remains unknown. To determine whether the TGF-β-induced repression of theSp-B promoter/enhancer is mediated through activation of the TGF-β receptor and signal transduction pathway, we performed co-transfection studies in H441 cells. H441 is a highly characterized lung epithelial carcinoma cell line that has been widely used in the analysis of pulmonary surfactant protein gene regulation due to constitutive expression of positive transcriptional regulators such as NKX2.1 and HNF-3α, which are required for activation of their transcription. H441 cells were first transfected with a construct,SpB(−1040/+431), that contains 1.4 kilobases of the 5′ upstream region of the Sp-B promoter/enhancer sequences linked to luciferase (29Pilot-Matias T.J. Kister S.E. Fox J.L. Kropp K. Glasser S.W. Whitsett J.A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This fragment has been previously identified to direct measurable levels of transcription in H441 cells, as evidenced by reporter gene activity (28Venkatesh V.C. Planer B.C. Schwartz M. Vanderbilt J.N. White R.T. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L674-L682PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected H441 cells were then treated with different concentrations (0–45 ng/ml) of recombinant human TGF-β1. As shown in Fig.1 A the Sp-Bpromoter activity was repressed in the presence of TGF-β ligand. The maximum repression by TGF-β (30 ng/ml) caused ∼66% decrease of theSp-B promoter activity. To determine whether the TGF-β repression of Sp-B promoter is mediated through TGF-β receptor, we co-transfected a constitutively active mutant TGF-β type I receptor, TRI(act), which carries a mutation of threonine 202 to an aspartic acid (35Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31455-31462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) along withSpB(−1040/+431). As a positive control, we also utilized a PAI promoter that is a well characterized target of TGF-β-induced gene activation (36Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 B, the PAI promoter is activated by TRI(act) in the absence of TGF-β ligand treatment. In contrast, TRI(act) caused approximately a greater than 50% reduction in the Sp-Bpromoter/enhancer activity in H441 cells in parallel experiments. These observations indicate that TGF-β-induced repression of theSp-B promoter in H441 cells occurs in response to activation of the TGF-β receptor signal transduction pathway. In the TGF-β signal transduction pathway, activation of TGF-β type I receptor by phosphorylation is followed by phosphorylation of SMAD transcription factors. Phosphorylated SMAD2 or SMAD3, known to be specifically activated by TGF-β, subsequently forms complexes with SMAD4, which facilitates their entry into the nucleus wherein they mediate regulation of TGF-β-induced gene transcription. To determine whether repressor activity of TGF-β in H441 cells is mediated by SMADs, we first established the presence and responsiveness of SMADs in this cell line by immunostaining. As shown in Fig.2, antibodies to both SMAD2/3 and SMAD 4 produced cytoplasmic staining in H441 cells. After treatment of the cells with TGF-β, staining was localized to the nucleus. These results provide evidence for intact SMAD signaling in H441 cells comparable with that described for other cell lines. To examine the role of endogenous SMADs in TGF-β-mediated repression of the Sp-B promoter, we carried out co-transfection studies with dominant negative Smad 2 and 4 (30de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). SMAD2(3S → A) lacks the three highly conserved serines in the carboxyl terminus that are phosphorylated by activated type I receptors, and dominant negative SMAD4 is truncated in both the amino and carboxyl termini. Both constructs compete with endogenous SMADs and block translocation of the SMAD complex to the nucleus. In cells transfected with theSp-B promoter fragment −641/+431 alone (SpB(−641/+431)CAT), treatment with TGF-β reduced reporter gene activity by 65–70% (Fig.3 A, Control and+ TGF -β). In cells co-transfected with either dominant negative Smad2 or Smad4, inhibition of reporter gene expression by TGF-β was significantly less (26–39%, Fig.3 A, DN versus DN+ TGF -β). These results support a role for SMADs in TGF-β-induced repression ofSp-B promoter. Dominant negative SMAD4 blocks signaling by either SMAD2 or SMAD3, and dominant negative SMAD2 competes with both endogenous SMAD2 and SMAD3 for SMAD4. Thus, these data indicate a requirement for SMAD4 but do not identify whether SMAD2 or SMAD3 mediates TGF-β responsiveness in this system. To further investigate SMAD signaling, H441 cells were co-transfected with wild type Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4expression constructs and the Sp-B promoter/enhancer construct SpB(−1040/+431) in the absence of TGF-β ligand. As expected, transcriptional activity of the controlPAI plasmid increased severalfold by co-transfection with either Smad2 or Smad3 (data not shown). In contrast, the Sp-B promoter/enhancer activity decreased by nearly 70% in presence of overexpression of Smad3 alone or in combination with Smad4 (Fig. 3 B). Overexpression of Smad2 or Smad2 in combination with Smad4 had no measurable effect on the activity of theSp-B promoter (Fig. 3 B). A similar level of expression for Smad2 and Smad3 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Overexpression ofSmad4 alone, which i"

It converts pro-atrial natriuretic peptide to atrial natriuretic peptide, a cardiac hormone that regulates blood volume and pressure. Here we describe the genomic structures of the human and murine corin genes and functional analysis of their promoters. Both corin genes contain 22 exons and span >200 kb. Their intron/exon boundaries are well conserved, with most exons encoding distinct structural domains, supporting the idea that corin evolved as a result of exon duplication and rearrangement. Comparison of the 5′-flanking regions of the human and murine corin genes revealed several conserved sequences, including binding sites for TBX5, GATA, NKX2.5, and Krüppel-like transcription factors. Transfection experiments with reporter gene constructs driven by the human or murine corin 5′-flanking region indicated that the sequences from −405 to −15 in human and from −646 to −77 in mouse are sufficient to promote high levels of gene expression in murine cardiomyocytes. In contrast, these sequences produced only minimal levels of expression in HeLa cells. Within these sequences, we identified a conserved GATA element that bound to GATA-4.

In response to volume overload or a hypertrophic signal, the heart increases its release of these hormones, which in turn reduce blood volume and lower blood pressure. The increased release of ANP and BNP has been attributed to the increased synthesis of pro-ANP and pro-BNP (21McBride K. Nemer M. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In principle, the level of corin expression would also affect the circulating levels of ANP and BNP because overexpression of corin increases the conversion of pro-ANP to ANP (13Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is possible that the increased synthesis of pro-ANP and pro-BNP is coordinated with the up-regulation of corin expression. The molecular mechanisms for cardiac-specific expression of ANP and BNP and their up-regulation in response to volume overload or a hypertrophic signal have been characterized (22Durocher D. Nemer M. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Marttila M. Hautala N. Paradis P. Toth M. Vuolteenaho O. Nemer M. Ruskoaho H. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4693-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Strikingly, both genes share several common regulatory elements (such as the GATA element) in their promoters. It has been shown that the GATA element is the key regulatory element for cardiac-specific expression and possibly for their up-regulation (24Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, whether thecorin gene shares similar regulatory elements with the ANP and BNP genes. To understand the structural features of corin and its cardiac expression, we isolated the human and murine corin genes, determined their genomic structures, and analyzed the function of their 5′-flanking regions. The conserved feature of their genomic structures supports the concept that corin is assembled from exons encoding structurally distinct domains. The characterization of their promoter regions provides insights into the mechanism that regulates cardiac expression of corin. The murine cardiac myocytic cell line HL-5 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA). Human HeLa epitheloid cells (ATCC CCL2) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at the Berlex Biosciences Core Facility. Antibodies against mouse GATA-1 (sc-1234x), GATA-3 (sc-268x), GATA-4 (sc-1237x), and GATA-6 (sc-7244x) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other chemicals were from Sigma. HL-5 cells were cultured in Ex-Cell 320 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 1 μm retinoic acid, 0.1 mm norepinephrine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 0.1 mm minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids. HeLa cells were cultured in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 and 95% air. PCRs were performed using the PCR reagent system from Invitrogen with 30 cycles of amplification (1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 50 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C) and a final 7-min extension at 72 °C. DNA isolation from BAC clones (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Southern analysis was performed as described previously (26Johnston G.I. Cook R.G. McEver R.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 1033-1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To clone the human and murine corin genes and their 5′-flanking regions, we synthesized specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of corin cDNA sequences. These oligonucleotide primers were tested for amplification of specific products in PCR-based reactions using human or murine genomic DNA. The pairs of primers that successfully amplified specific PCR products were then used in a PCR-based screen to identify BAC clones containing the human and murine corin genes and/or their 5′-flanking regions. The identified positive BAC clones were further confirmed by Southern analysis using 32P-labeled human and murine corin cDNA probes. The BAC clones (see Fig. 1) were either directly sequenced by a shotgun strategy or subcloned into pUC118 (PanVera/Takara, Madison, WI) for sequencing. Assembly of the shotgun sequences was done using the Staden package (27Bonfield J.K. Smith K. Staden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4992-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The human corin promoter reporter constructs hCp1297LUC and hCp405LUC were generated in two steps: 1) PCR-based cloning of the 5′-flanking region of the human corin gene from −1297 or −405 to −15 (relative to the translation initiation codon ATG) using primers bearing SacI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively; and 2) inserting the respective PCR products into the SacI andHindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Similarly, the murine corin promoter constructs mCp1183LUC, mCp809LUC, and mCp646LUC were also made by the PCR-based cloning approach described above. The mutant constructs hCp405mutGATA and mCp646mutGATA, carrying a mutation in the conserved proximal GATA element (GATA to CTTA), were constructed by an overlap PCR protocol (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Briefly, two separate PCR products, one for each half of the hybrid product, were generated with either an antisense or sense mutated GATA oligonucleotide and one outside primer. The two products were purified and mixed. A second PCR was then performed using the two outside primers. The PCR product was digested with SacI andHindIII and ligated into SacI- andHindIII-digested pGL3-basic vector. All constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Plasmids were prepared using an EndoFree plasmid maxi kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Transfection of HL-5 cells was carried out using a Lipofectin (Invitrogen)-based method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of DNA of each of the corin reporter constructs plus 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40 (Promega) were mixed with 20 μg of Lipofectin in 1 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then added to ∼70% confluent HL-5 or HeLa cells cultured in one well of six-well plates. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with fresh Ex-Cell 320 medium; and 30 h later, the transfected cells were harvested and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. A dual-luciferase activity assay (Promega) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cell extracts were prepared by lysing the transfected cells with 250 μl of freshly diluted passive lysis buffer (Promega). The lysates were frozen and thawed once before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube, and a 20-μl aliquot of the supernatants was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. The luminescence of the samples was monitored by a Microplate Luminometer LB96 V (EG&G Berthold), which measured light production (relative light units) for a duration of 10 s. Each of the cell extracts was assayed in triplicate. Each transfection experiment for each construct was performed in triplicate. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renillaluciferase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from exponentially growing HL-5 cells (29Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing two consensus GATA sequences or mutated GATA sequences (GATA to CTTA) were originally derived from the T cell receptor enhancer (30Redondo J.M. Hata S. Brocklehurst C. Krangel M.S. Science. 1990; 247: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Ho I.C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Oakley B.K. Tsai S.F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The probes encompassing human or murine corin GATA or mutated GATA (GATA to CTTA) sequences were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The oligonucleotide probes were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (32Pan J. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22600-22608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies (at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml) at room temperature for 45 min before addition of labeled probes. Four BAC clones, two each containing the human and murine corin genes, were obtained by PCR-based screening. Three BAC clones were sequenced by a shotgun strategy using dye terminator chemistry. During the course of our studies, partial human and mouse corin genomic sequences became available. Upon combination of the shotgun data and the publicly available trace file information, 2Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/Traces/trace.cgi and trace.ensembl.org. we assembled a contiguous sequence of 340 kb containing the human corin gene and five contigs for the murine corin gene. The order of five contigs was confirmed by the existence of several mated reading pairs in respective neighboring contigs. The distance of those allowed us to determine the gap size to be <500 bp because the insert size of the public shotgun libraries was well defined. The structures of the human and murine corin genes were then analyzed. However, the 340-kb human genomic sequence did not contain the 5′-flanking region. We isolated an additional 4165-bp HindIII-EcoRI fragment from BAC 26540, which included the first 3919 bp of the 5′-flanking region, all of exon 1, and part of intron 1 (submitted to the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank with the accession number AF521006; Fig. 3 depicts a 1596-bp portion of the sequence).Figure 3Alignment of the 5′-flanking regions of the human and murine corin genes. The 5′-flanking regions, exon 1, and part of intron 1 of the human (h) and murine (m) corin genes are aligned. The numbering is relative to the translation initiation codon ATG (boldface italics). Of note, the numbers indicated are different between human and mouse because of the divergence in the first exons. Thearrowhead indicates the junction between the first exon and intron of the human corin gene, and the donor splice sequence of human intron 1 is underlined. The putative regulatory sequences are indicated in boldface (the Tbx5 site for binding to Tbx5, a T box-containing transcription factor; the NF-AT site for binding to the NF-AT transcription factor; GATA, an element for GATA proteins; the GT box for binding to the Krüppel-like factors; the TATA box for binding to basal transcription factor IID; and NKE, a binding motif for Nkx2.5). The NKE sequence, which overlaps with the proximal GATA sequence, is also underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 depicts the organization of the human and murine corin genes and the locations of BAC clones, contigs, and plasmid clones containing the corin genes and their promoter regions. TablesI andII indicate the sizes and locations of the exons and introns as well as the nucleotide sequences surrounding the splice donor and acceptor sites. The human and murine corin genes span ∼238 and 204 kb, respectively. They consist of 22 exons and 21 introns. The relative sizes of all corresponding exons and introns are very similar.

Codon phase: 0, no interruption of codon; 1, interruption after the first nucleotide; 2, interruption after the second nucleotide of the codon. Analysis of the genomic organization indicates that most intron/exon junctions are highly conserved between the human (Table I) and murine (Table II) corin genes. However, exon 1 diverges between human and mouse, which is consistent with the divergence in the cDNA sequences coding for the cytoplasmic tails of human and murine corin. Interestingly, the conjunction sequence (+62GGTAAGATC+70) between human exon 1 and intron 1 is identical to the mouse sequence (−223GGTAAGATC−215), indicating potential alternative RNA splicing in the murine corin gene. Thus, the divergence between the cytoplasmic tails of human and murine corin found in the cDNA sequences could arise from alternative RNA splicing. The corin cDNA sequence predicts a protein composed of a number of discrete domains. The boundaries between protein domains correspond mostly to the intron/exon boundaries of the genomic structure, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 2. The cytoplasmic tail at the N terminus is encoded by exon 1 and half of exon 2, followed by the transmembrane domain that is encoded by the other half of exon 2. The region between the transmembrane domain and the first frizzled domain is encoded by exon 3. Each of the frizzled domains is encoded by two exons, each of the eight low density lipoprotein receptors by a single exon, and the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain by three exons. The protease domain at the C terminus is encoded by exons 19–22, with exon 19 coding for the sequence that includes the proteolytic activation site and the catalytic histidine residue. Exons 20 and 22 code for the sequences that include the other two catalytic residues aspartic acid and serine, respectively. The intron/exon splice junctions are split between all of the three codon phases (phases 0, 1, and 2) (Tables I and II). This feature is conserved between human and mouse. Fig.3shows the alignment of the 5′-flanking sequences and the first exons of the human and murine corin genes. There is 62% sequence identity in the first 1 kb of the 5′-flanking regions. This degree of similarity is typical for the murine and human orthologs of a gene (34Koop B.F. Hood L. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both genes share several putative regulatory regions, including two TBX5-binding sites (35Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D.A. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 709-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), two GATA elements (24Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), two “GT” boxes for the Krüppel-like factors (36Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), an NKX2.5-binding site (NKE) (37Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15628-15633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and a TATA box (38Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). These elements are conserved not only in sequence, but also in relative spacing. We also found nonconserved putative binding sites for NF-AT (nuclear factor of activatedT cells) and TBX5 transcription factors in the human and murine corin genes. To test whether the 5′-flanking regions of the corin genes have promoter activity, we prepared reporter constructs in which serially truncated fragments of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human or murine corin gene were linked to a promoterless luciferase gene (Fig.4 A). These constructs were transiently transfected into murine cardiomyocytic HL-5 cells, which express corin mRNA and protein (13Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities of the transfected cells were then measured. As shown in Fig. 4 B, human constructs hCp1297LUC and hCp405LUC promoted luciferase activity that was significantly higher than the background in pGL3-basic-transfected cells. Similarly, murine reporter constructs mCp1183LUC, mCp809LUC, and mCp646LUC promoted significant luciferase activity, comparable to that promoted by the human constructs. These data suggest that the cis-sequences responsible for most of the promoter activity are located between −405 and −15 and between −646 and −77 in the human and murine corin genes, respectively. To determine whether the constructs mediate cardiac-specific expression, we transfected them into HeLa cells, which do not express corin mRNA. In contrast to their high activities in HL-5 cells, constructs hCp405LUC and mCp646LUC had only minimal promoter activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 5). As a control, simultaneously transfected pRL-SV40 promoted higher levels ofRenilla luciferase activity in HeLa cells than in HL-5 cells, indicating that HeLa cells were as readily transfected as HL-5 cells in these experiments. These results indicate that the 5′-flanking sequences from −405 to −15 in the human corin gene and from −646 to −77 in the murine corin gene contain elements that are sufficient for specific expression in cultured cardiomyocytes. The 5′-flanking regions from −405 to −15 in human and from −646 to −77 in mouse were sufficient to promote high levels of gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes, but not in HeLa cells. This suggests that these regions contain regulatory elements responsible for cardiomyocyte-specific expression. Inspection of these regions revealed a conserved consensus GATA sequence (designated as the proximal GATA sequence), and the GATA element has previously been implicated in cardiac-specific expression (24Charron F. Nemer M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To determine whether the proximal GATA sequences indeed bind to GATA proteins, we performed an EMSA using a well characterized consensus GATA oligonucleotide probe (30Redondo J.M. Hata S. Brocklehurst C. Krangel M.S. Science. 1990; 247: 1225-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Ho I.C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Oakley B.K. Tsai S.F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2004518330,"The structure of a peptide corresponding to residues 182-202 of the acetylcholine receptor alpha1 subunit in complex with alpha-bungarotoxin was solved using NMR spectroscopy. The peptide contains the complete sequence of the major determinant of AChR involved in alpha-bungarotoxin binding. One face of the long beta hairpin formed by the AChR peptide consists of exposed nonconserved residues, which interact extensively with the toxin. Mutations of these receptor residues confer resistance to the toxin. Conserved AChR residues form the opposite face of the beta hairpin, which creates the inner and partially hidden pocket for acetylcholine. An NMR-derived model for the receptor complex with two alpha-bungarotoxin molecules shows that this pocket is occupied by the conserved alpha-neurotoxin residue R36, which forms cation-pi interactions with both alphaW149 and gammaW55/deltaW57 of the receptor and mimics acetylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W2165677121,"We report the identification of a novel rat cDNA encoding a peptide homologous to Humanin, a secreted peptide that specifically protects against neuronal cell death induced by beta-amyloid peptide (Ab) or by mutations causing early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. The rat gene, which we termed Rattin, encodes a peptide of 38 residues (15 residues longer than Humanin) showing 73% identity in the conserved region to Humanin. The expression profile of the 1.6-kb Rattin transcript is comparable to that displayed by Humanin, with significant expression levels in the central nervous system and in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The full-length Rattin peptide and its 1-25 fragment were equally effective as Humanin in protecting rat- and mouse-cultured cortical neurons against Ab-induced toxicity. However, Rattin was much more effective than Humanin against excitotoxic neuronal death induced by a toxic pulse with NMDA. Rattin and its short fragment were protective against excitotoxic death not only when coapplied with NMDA, but also when added to the cultures after the NMDA pulse. Neither Rattin not Humanin could affect neuronal apoptosis by trophic deprivation induced in cultured cerebellar granule cells depleted of extracellular potassium. This suggests that Rattin is the prototype of a novel class of peptides, phylogenetically related to Humanin, endowed with protective activity not only against Ab but also toward excitotoxic neuronal death. The identification of Rattin may be instrumental for the development of novel pharmacological strategies aimed at enhancing the production of endogenous Humanin-like peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2069141682,"Dinoflagellates are marine unicellular eukaryotes that exhibit unique features including a very low level of basic proteins bound to the chromatin and the complete absence of histones and nucleosomal structure. A cDNA encoding a protein with a strong homology to the TATA box-binding proteins (TBP) has been isolated from an expressed sequence tag library of the dinoflagellateCrypthecodinium cohnii. The typical TBP repeat signature and the amino acid motives involved in TFIIA and TFIIB interactions were conserved in this new TBP-like protein. However, the four phenylalanines known to interact with the TATA box were substituted with hydrophilic residues (His77, Arg94, Tyr171, Thr188) as has been described for TBP-like factors (TLF)/TBP-related proteins (TRP). A phylogenetic analysis showed that cTBP is intermediate between TBP and TLF/TRP protein families, and the structural similarity of cTBP with TLF was confirmed by low affinity binding to a consensus' TATA box in an equivalent manner to that usually observed for TLFs. Six 5′-upstream gene regions of dinoflagellate genes have been analyzed and neither a TATA box nor a consensus-promoting element could be found within these different sequences. Our results showed that cTBP could bind stronger to a TTTT box sequence than to the canonical TATA box, especially at high salt concentration. Same binding results were obtained with a mutated cTBP (mcTBP), in which the four phenylalanines were restored. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a TBP-like protein in a unicellular organism, which also appears as the major form of TBP present in C. cohnii. Dinoflagellates are marine unicellular eukaryotes that exhibit unique features including a very low level of basic proteins bound to the chromatin and the complete absence of histones and nucleosomal structure. A cDNA encoding a protein with a strong homology to the TATA box-binding proteins (TBP) has been isolated from an expressed sequence tag library of the dinoflagellateCrypthecodinium cohnii. The typical TBP repeat signature and the amino acid motives involved in TFIIA and TFIIB interactions were conserved in this new TBP-like protein.

In higher eukaryotes, the regulation of transcription is intimately connected to the chromatin structure, and the accessibility of the transcription factors to their recognition elements is facilitated by the chromatin-remodeling processes involving a subset of modifying machines whose properties can alter the nucleosomal structure (1Armstrong J.A.

After the relief of repression of the chromatin, transcription is preinitiated by the interaction of the RNA polymerase and the general transcription factors with the promoter. In mRNA synthesis, the transcription initiation step begins with the recognition of the promoter by the TFIID complex containing the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA box-binding protein; TLF, TBP-like factor; TRP, TBP-related protein; TRP, TBP-related protein; PCP, peridinin chlorophyll-a-binding protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter; EST, expressed sequence tag; TF, transcription factor; cTBP, C. cohnii TBP; hsTBP, h. sapiens TBP. and several TBP-associated factors (11Berk A.J.

The TBP, which is highly conserved among eukaryotes, was considered until recently as the universal transcription initiator factor (16Bareket-Samish A. Cohen I. Haran T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 965-977Google Scholar, 17Burley S.K. Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 69-75Google Scholar, 18Rowlands T. Bauman P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Google Scholar). However, new members of the TBP family called TBP-like factors (TLF) or TBP-related proteins (TRP) were identified only in the metazoan. Many studies showed that these new factors could form a stable complex with TFIIA and TFIIB and substitute for TBP in directing transcription in vitro by RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Refs. 19Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Google Scholar, 20Berk A.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 5-8Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, promoters do not always contain a TATA box but show an initiator element, which is loosely conserved and encompasses the transcription start site (21Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Google Scholar, 22Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.-H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Google Scholar). In protists, the TATA box is found in amoebas (Acanthamoeba), in slime mold (Dictyostelium), in ciliates (Histriculus cavicola), and in apicomplexa (Plasmodium) (23Wong J.M. Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4817-4824Google Scholar, 24Huang W. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28839-28847Google Scholar, 25Cohen S.M. Knecht D. Lodish H.F. Loomis W.F.

In trypanosomatida (Kinetoplastidae) and trichomonadida (Parabasalia), neither the TATA box nor analogous sequences were detected among the few characterized genes. However, both showed an initiator element specific to each phylum (29Luo H. Gilinger G. Mukherjee D. Bellofatto V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31947-31954Google Scholar, 30Quon D.V.K. Delgadillo M.G.

Dinoflagellates are protists, which are widely distributed in the aquatic environment. These unicellular microorganisms can be free living or parasitic. Both toxic and non-toxic dinoflagellates can proliferate in seawater, causing important economic and health problems. The most prominent feature of dinoflagellate cell biology, unique among eukaryotic cells, is the lack of histones and nucleosomal organization (32Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Moreau H. Encyclopedia of Microbiology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2000: 42-54Google Scholar, 33Raikov I.B. Acta Protozool. 1995; 34: 239-247Google Scholar, 34Spector D.L. Dinoflagellates.

Cell Biol. 1982; 27: 151-155Google Scholar). Moreover, conversely to other eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate chromosomes remain highly condensed during the G1 phase, with DNA filaments protruding from the chromosome core where transcription takes place (37Bhaud Y. Guillebault D. Lennon J.F. Defacque H. Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Moreau H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1231-1239Google Scholar). The upstream gene organization is only known in the dinoflagellate speciesGonyaulax polyedra for two genes: the peridinin chlorophyll-a-binding protein (PCP) and the luciferase genes (38Le Q.H. Markovic P. Hastings J.W. Jovine R.V.M. Morse D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 595-604Google Scholar, 39Li L. Hastings J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 275-284Google Scholar). These two genes exhibited a tandem repeat spaced by an intergenic region of about 1000 bp that contains a common 13-bp sequence, but no TATA box or other known regulatory elements have been found. To date, only two proteins involved in transcription have been described in dinoflagellate (40Guillebault D. Derelle E. Bhaud Y. Moreau H. Protist. 2001; 152: 127-138Google Scholar). The elucidation of their transcription machinery could allow these organisms to be used as powerful models for the study of eukaryotic transcription in an environment devoid of nucleosomes and provide a better understanding of the transcription network in other eukaryotes. In this work, we identified for the first time in a unicellular organism a cDNA encoding a novel TBP-like protein containing mutated key amino acids involved in DNA binding. We also analyzed the 5′-upstream part of four genes of the dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii and of two genes of the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra without any evidence of any known regulatory elements. We compared the binding of the cTBP and of a mutated form (mcTBP) to a TTTT box and to a canonical TATA box in various salt concentrations. The TBP cDNA was inserted into a pBlueScript vector and was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the NdeI restriction site containing primer 5′-TCA CAA TGT CAT ATG GCG GAT ATC TTG GAA-3′ and theXhoI restriction site containing primer 5′-TAG ATT ATA CTC GAG GGT CTT GAA CTC CGC-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into the pGEX4T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein GST-cTBP was produced in the Escherichia coli strain after 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described elsewhere (41Moore P.A. Ozer J. Salunek M. Jan G. Zerby D. Campbell S. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7610-7620Google Scholar). The clones producing recombinant proteins were sequenced to check the absence of mutation. The C. cohniicDNA λ zap expression library was plated in N-Z-amine yeast extract medium Top agar media on NZY agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Plates were covered by nitrocellulose membranes for 2 min (Gelman, Champs sur Marne, France). The membranes were denatured for 2 min in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m NaOH, neutralized for 5 min in 1.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and finally rinsed for 30 s in 2× SCC, 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After fixation for 1 h at 80 °C, the membranes were prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in a solution containing 5× SCC, 5× Denhardt, 0.5% SDS, and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and were then hybridized in the same solution with a denatured 32P-radiolabeled cTBP probe overnight at 45 °C (permissive temperature). After successive washings with the solutions 1× SSC/0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS, and 0.1X SSC/0.1% SDS, the nitrocellulose filters were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. Screening was repeated until the positive clones were isolated. They were then excised from the phage, and the open reading frames were sequenced. Sequences were retrieved with Ballast (42Plewniak F. Thompson J.D. Poch O. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 750-759Google Scholar) generated, aligned using ClustalX (43Thompson J.D. Gibson T.F. Plewniak K. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Google Scholar), and the figure generated with Alscript 2.04 (44Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was generated using the Neighbor-joining method with the software phylowin (45Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548Google Scholar). The 5′-upstream sequences of β-tubulin (AF417567), Dip5 (AF417570), DapC (AF417569), and P80 (AF417568)C. cohnii genes were amplified by RACE-PCR using the universal genome walker kit (Clontech), and specific nested primers designed at the 5′-extremities of the corresponding cDNAs (40Guillebault D. Derelle E. Bhaud Y. Moreau H. Protist. 2001; 152: 127-138Google Scholar, 46Ausseil J. Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Géraud M.-L. Bhaud Y. Baines I. Preston T. Moreau H. Protist. 2000; 150: 197-211Google Scholar). After purification and sequencing of the amplified DNA fragments, overlapping regions were used to make contigs with the 5′-untranslated regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out with purified GST fusion proteins and double-stranded DNA. The adenovirus major late promoter sequence from –40 to –11 (respective to the start site) or the mutated AdMLP sequence in which the TATAAAA box is substituted with thymines was labeled by phosphorylation of the 5′ ends using [γ-32P]ATP (DNA 5′ end-labeling system, Promega). DNA binding reactions were performed with 20 μl of mixtures as follows: ∼60 or 600 ng of GST-cTBP or GST-mcTBP, or 66 ng of human TBP were pre-incubated for 15 min at 27 °C with either buffer or human endogenous TFIIA. 20,000 cpm of probe in a solution containing 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 25 ng/ml BSA, 25 ng/μl poly(dG-dC), and 12 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, was added and incubated for a further 15 min at 27 °C. hsTBP and TFIIA were purified as described in Refs. 47Brou C. Chaudray S. Davidson I. Lutz Y., Wu, J. Egly J.M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Google Scholar and 48Lescure A. Lutz Y. Eberhard D. Jacq X. Krom A. Grummt I. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1166-1175Google Scholar. The study of the salt influence on the DNA binding of GST-cTBP was carried out in the same conditions but with an increase in the KCl concentration from 60 mm up to 800 mm. The reactions were resolved on a 4% acrylamide gel at 4 °C in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer at 160 V for the appropriate time. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The cTBP cDNA cloned in pBlueScript vector was successively mutated to a phenylalanine at the residues His77, Arg94, Tyr171, and Thr188 by PCR mutagenesis using the following four sets of primers, respectively, for each of the four residues: FF1 5′-aatccgcgaaaatttagcagccttacg-3′, RF1 5′-atactctgcgtgtcccagagcaaacgc-3′; FF2 5′-actgcgatggtgttctcatcgggggtc-3′, RF2 5′-agctcggggttccactagcctcaacgt-3′, FF3 5′-gagcctgaacttttctgcggctgcatc-3′, RF3 5′-atacagagcattcctacgccactttgc-3′, FF4 5′-cgtacctcttgttctctggcggaaaag-3′; RF4 5′-tgcatttcggcctcgttgtgcgaaaga-3′. The cDNA was amplified withPfu polymerase. The linear PCR products were ligated overnight at 4 °C and transformed in the DH5α E. colistrain. The open reading frames and mutations were checked by sequencing. A 5′-oriented C. cohnii EST library was analyzed and an EST related to the TBP family was identified using the Blast WWW-based program. The corresponding cDNA clone was completely sequenced and showed an open reading frame of 663 bp encoding for a 221-residue protein. The Blast and Prodom searches revealed that this novel protein showed the typical two-repeat signature of TBP encompassing the first 180 amino acids of the C-terminal domain (Fig.1). This domain showed 37% identity with the C-terminal region ofAspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiaeTBPs. The C-terminal domain encompassed two directly repeated regions, each around 80 amino acids in length, which is the typical TBP signature. The identity between these two fragments (31%) was similar to that seen in TBPs of other organisms (e.g. human, 31%; yeast 33%). The N-terminal region of the cTBP (44 amino acids) presented no homology as is usually described in other eukaryotic TBPs. Furthermore, key amino acids known to be involved in protein-protein interactions, notably with TFIIA and TFIIB, were also conserved (41Moore P.A. Ozer J. Salunek M. Jan G. Zerby D. Campbell S. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7610-7620Google Scholar). The most striking difference between cTBP and the TBPs was the replacement of the two pairs of the highly conserved phenylalanines, which are known to play a key role in the DNA kinking by minor groove intercalation, by the His77-Arg94 and Tyr171-Thr188 pairs in the first and the second repeat of cTBP (Fig. 1, red arrows). Such a drastic amino acid substitution was also observed in the TLF family. This particular feature could result in the recognition of a DNA element different from a TATA box (19Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Google Scholar). Considering the sequence information, cTBP appeared closer to the TBPs (47% similarity with hsTBP) than to the TLFs (32% with hsTLF). Furthermore, the interaction surfaces between TBP and the transcription factors TFIIA (70AEYN73 motif) and TFIIB (166YEPE169 motif) were highly conserved both in cTBP and TBPs (50Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Lee S. Sigler P.B. Sciences. 1996; 272: 830-836Google Scholar, 51Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggested that cTBP was the closest resemblance to TBPs than to any TBP-like protein identified up to now. This proximity to TBP members was also revealed by phylogenetic tree analysis where cTBP clustered in a separate branch in the TBP sub-tree and was clearly distant from the TLF sub-group as revealed by bootstrap calculation (Fig.2). In this analysis, cTBP clearly emerged as a member of a new family of transcription factors, which cannot be classified in either the TBP or TLF/TRF family. cTBP was isolated after systematic sequencing of an EST library. The possibility that a more canonical TBP could exist cannot be excluded. To ensure that this new cTBP was not a minor form of TBP, 2× 105 plaques from a λ Zap cDNA library of C. cohnii were screened at low stringency (45 °C) using a probe encompassing the first C-terminal repeat of the cTBP sequence. To check if the screening conditions were optimal for the isolation of TBP as well as TLF or TRP, a hybridization of the yeast genomic DNA was carried out as its genome contains only a TBP gene (20Berk A.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 5-8Google Scholar). A signal was detected, indicating that the screening conditions allowed the detection of TBP from the C. cohnii cDNA library. Six positive independent clones were isolated, and after sequencing, they appeared entirely identical to the whole cTBP sequence, including the substituted residues that might be involved in DNA binding. These results clearly indicated that the identified cTBP was the major form of a potential TBP family in C. cohnii. The alignment of TBP, TLF, and TRF sequences shown in Fig. 1 is a subset of a much larger alignment comprising 94 sequences retrieved with Ballast and aligned with ClustalX (data not shown) (42Plewniak F. Thompson J.D. Poch O. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 750-759Google Scholar, 43Thompson J.D. Gibson T.F. Plewniak K. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Google Scholar, 44Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence conservation with the TBP members, cTBP exhibited a few remarkable amino acid conservations, and a three-dimensional homology model has been generated taking the human TBP crystal structure as a reference (Fig. 3) (19Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Google Scholar, 51Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Google Scholar) using the software Modeler 4.0 (52Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar). The glycine residues in the N- and C-terminal repeats of cTBP (Gly97, Gly103, and Gly191, Gly197) were strictly conserved (Fig. 1). These residues, especially Gly97 and Gly191, are found in all eukaryotic TBPs and are required to accommodate a particular three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3, green spheres), permitting a short turn between β-strands 4 and 5 in each repeat. In addition, a few other residues were highly conserved at the same positions as in the other TBPs, both in the N- and C-terminal repeat of cTBP (Leu60/Leu153, Try72/Try166, Val93/Leu187) (Fig. 1). These buried residues belong to the core of the TBP-fold and form a hydrophobic core in each repeat (Fig. 3, blue spheres). Whereas all TBPs presented a conserved salt bridge between residues Glu227 and Arg318 for the hTBP (Fig. 1), which links the two repeats, cTBP exhibits two hydrophobic amino acids (Leu107 and Met201), which generated a hydrophobic cluster instead (Fig. 3, blue spheres). However, the secondary structure prediction of cTBP, calculated by the Profile network prediction of Heidelberg (PHD) (53Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60Google Scholar) revealed the same organization as the one derived for the human TBP crystal structure. Altogether, these data indicated that cTBP most likely adopts a saddle-like structure similar to TBP despite some major amino acid substitutions. In the first repeat, the two usual phenylalanine residues (Phe197 and Phe214 in human) are replaced by a histidine and an arginine in cTBP (His77 and Arg94), which together with Ser79 and Ser99, form a hydrogen bond network (Fig. 1, red arrows and circles). A similar pattern of interaction has already been observed in the second repeat of Caenorhabditis briggsae TLF with the same amino acids, which are, however, arranged differently in the structure (19Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Google Scholar). In the second repeat, the actual aromatic residues (Phe288 and Phe305) are replaced by Tyr170 and Thr188 (Fig. 1,red arrows), and to partially compensate the space left by the missing phenylalanine, a few other mutations occurred conferring a configuration that would be able to stabilize the kink through van der Waals contacts with DNA (Fig. 1, red circles). Despite some major residue substitutions within the cTBP/DNA interface, the present data argue in favor of the formation of a similar complex to the one observed in the human TBP/TATA box crystal structure. However, the DNA kinking induced by this novel pattern of polar residue interactions indicates that the DNA element recognized by cTBP would probably be different from the TATA box as has already been suggested for TLFs. The characterization in C. cohnii of a major TBP factor exhibiting substitutions at the key amino acids involved in the TATA box binding prompted us to study the structure of the promoter region of new genes in this microorganism. We amplified and sequenced the 5′-flanking region of four new genes by RACE-PCR. One of these genes encoded the highly expressed protein β-tubulin (accession numberAY117680), and the three others nuclear proteins P80, Dip5, and DapC (accession numbers AY117682, AY117683, and AY117681, respectively) (40Guillebault D. Derelle E. Bhaud Y. Moreau H. Protist. 2001; 152: 127-138Google Scholar,46Ausseil J. Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Géraud M.-L. Bhaud Y. Baines I. Preston T. Moreau H. Protist. 2000; 150: 197-211Google Scholar). The upstream sequences were aligned with those of the PCP and luciferase genes already published from the dinoflagellate speciesG. polyedra. Neither a TATA box nor any other known consensus promoter element could be found within the first 1000 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon (data not shown). This confirms previous observations made for the two dinoflagellate upstream coding sequences of the PCP and the luciferase already known in G. polyedra, where no TATA box nor any consensus promoter element could be identified (38Le Q.H. Markovic P. Hastings J.W. Jovine R.V.M. Morse D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 595-604Google Scholar, 39Li L. Hastings J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 275-284Google Scholar). The transcription initiation site has already been identified in the luciferase gene; however, its surrounding sequences could not be found in the promoters of the genes identified here (39Li L. Hastings J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 275-284Google Scholar). cTBP was produced solubly as a GST-recombinant protein in E. coli (Fig.4). To study in detail its DNA binding, a mutant protein (mcTBP), in which the four amino acids known to correspond to the positions of the four phenylalanines involved in the DNA binding were replaced by phenylalanines, was also produced (Fig.4). The cTBP-GST, mcTBP-GST, and the human TBP were incubated with the [γ-32P]-labeled consensus (TATAAAAA) or mutated (TTTTTTTT) AdMLP oligonucleotides and subjected to polyacrylamide gel shift electrophoresis. A clear shift of the TATA fragment was observed with the hsTBP (Fig 5 A,lane 3), whereas only a very low binding was obtained in the presence of a comparable concentration of cTBP (Fig. 5 A,lane 5). The presence of TFIIA in the incubation did not change significantly the mobility of the cTBP/DNA complex (Fig. 5 A, lane 6). The shift observed by incubating the cTBP with the mutated TATA was clearly stronger (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7–8), compared with the shift induced by the hsTBP incubated with the same oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 A, lanes 10). Interestingly the mutant mcTBP also bound to the mutated TATA (Fig.5 B, lanes 5–6 for the TATA and 7–8 for the mutated TATA) and in general showed a similar binding pattern to the wild type cTBP. However, in the presence of TFIIA, an increase in the binding to the canonical TATA box by mcTBP was observed (Fig.5 B, lane 6). Controls with the GST tag alone and the TFIIA were conducted to ensure that no significant binding of these components to the DNA was obtained (Fig. 5, A andB). Moreover, as described previously, hsTBP did not bind to the mutated TATA box, even in the presence of TFIIA (Fig. 5,A and B, lane 10). As cTBP is characterized by particular amino acid residues in the DNA binding site, we tested if a high salt concentration could increase its DNA binding, as reported for archaebacteria (54O'Brien R. DeDecker B. Fleming K.G. Sigler P.B. Ladbury J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 117-125Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, the binding of the cTBP to the TATA box dramatically increased with the KCl concentration, with an optimal concentration around 300 mm. However, the high KCl concentration did not change the cTBP binding specificity. In a similar fashion to what was seen at low salt conditions, the binding was more important on the mutated than on the canonical TATA element (data not shown). In this work we describe for the first time in a unicellular eukaryotic organism a new class of transcription initiation factors that show intermediate structural features between the TBP and TLF/TRP family of proteins. However, our DNA binding results indicated that this novel protein behaves more like TLF/TRF proteins than classical TBPs because cTBP does not bind to the classical AdMLP TATA box. Dinoflagellates are true eukaryotes presenting the unique feature of a very low level of basic proteins linked to their chromatin and a complete absence of nucleosomal structure (32Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Moreau H. Encyclopedia of Microbiology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2000: 42-54Google Scholar, 55Rizzo P.J. J. Protozool. 1991; 38: 246-252Google Scholar). Very little is known about the molecular processes of dinoflagellate transcription, and although a RNA polymerase II activity has been described in the species C. cohnii, the enzyme itself has not been isolated (56Rizzo P.J. J. Protozool. 1979; 26: 290-294Google Scholar). The chromosomes are highly condensed during the G1phase and it has been shown that transcription occurred at the periphery of the chromosomes (37Bhaud Y. Guillebault D. Lennon J.F. Defacque H. Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Moreau H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1231-1239Google Scholar, 57Sigee D.C. Biosystem. 1984; 16: 203-210Google Scholar). Although some nuclear proteins were isolated and characterized their function in transcription inC. cohnii remains unclear, and the cTBP is the first transcriptional dinoflagellate homologue reported (40Guillebault D. Derelle E. Bhaud Y. Moreau H. Protist. 2001; 152: 127-138Google Scholar, 58Bhaud Y. Géraud M.L. Ausseil J. Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Moreau H. J. Euk. Microbiol. 1998; 46: 259-267Google Scholar). The determination of the 5′ upstream sequence of four C. cohnii genes confirmed the absence of a consensus TATA element as already described in two genes of another dinoflagellate species,G. polyedra. The six dinoflagellate promoter gene sequences showed a high variation in their global composition for each of the four nucleotides, and no potential transcription initiation motif was found from the sequence analysis. A 13-bp sequence identified in the two G. polyedra genes was not found in the new sequences. This 13-bp sequence is either specific to G. polyedra or to the highly expressed PCP and luciferase genes or more likely is not a transcription initiating sequence. In the luciferase gene this 13-bp sequence is located about 110 bp upstream of the transcription initiation start, far from the usual distance encountered for the TATA element (about 30 bp) (38Le Q.H. Markovic P. Hastings J.W. Jovine R.V.M. Morse D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 595-604Google Scholar, 39Li L. Hastings J.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 275-284Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of cTBP with TBPs and TLF/TRPs revealed a probable saddle-like shape structure described in proteins belonging to the TBP family and also emphasized the probable difference in the DNA sequence recognition. These findings correlate well with our biochemical results in which the low binding of cTBP to the TATA box in standard DNA binding conditions shows that it is functionally similar to a TLF/TRP (59Rabenstein M.D. Zhou S. Lis J.T. Tijian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4791-4796Google Scholar, 60Ohbayashi T Makino Y. Tamura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 750-755Google Scholar). A low binding to the TATA box was already observed for the TLF/TRPs, and currently no consensus sequence specifically recognized by these proteins is known (19Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Google Scholar). The effect of the increase of salt concentration on the cTBP interaction with DNA suggests a hypothetical pathway where its DNA binding would be favored by mechanisms depending on salts concentration, allowing the DNA sequences to be released in a highly condensed nuclear environment. Little is known about how the mutation of the four phenylalanines may affect the TATA box binding. Intuitively, it would be expected that the restoration of the phenylalanines would enable the mcTBP to bind the TATA box more efficiently, but this was not observed. This can be explained by a particular structure of the cTBP in which the mutations could induce a whole conformation change rendering the protein unable to bind DNA. However, in the presence of the human TFIIA, cTBP containing the four phenylalanine changes showed a significant binding to the AdMLP TATA box, suggesting that the four conventional phenylalanines may be involved in the TATA box binding specificity. The discovery of the TLF/TRP proteins in metazoan a few years ago revealed that the initiation of transcription was more complex than initially thought. These proteins are thought to be active on genes involved in specific developmental stages in several metazoan organisms (61Dantonel J.-C. Quintin S. Lakatos L. Labouesse M. Tora L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 715-722Google Scholar, 62Holmes M.C. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 867-870Google Scholar, 63Kaltenbach L. Horner M.A. Rothman J.H. Mango S.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 705-713Google Scholar, 64Veenstra G.J.C. Weeks D.L. Wolffe A.P. Science. 2000; 290: 2312-2315Google Scholar, 65Müller F. Lakatos L. Dantonel J.-C. Strähle U. Tora L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 282-287Google Scholar). TLFs and/or TRPs have only been reported in metazoan and not in unicellular organisms, even in S. cerevisiae, for which the genome is entirely sequenced and well annotated (19Dantonel J.C. Wurtz J.M. Poch O. Moras D. Tora L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 335-339Google Scholar, 20Berk A.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 5-8Google Scholar). The expression of the cTBP as the major TBP-related protein in the unicellular organism C. cohnii, which does not have developmental stages, suggests that alternative mechanisms to initiate transcription can exist. This emphasizes the possibility that, as the original TBP found in dinoflagellates, the TLF/TRPs could recognize different initiation sequences that fulfill different roles in other organisms. It is tempting to propose a link between the unique structure of dinoflagellate chromatin, the absence of TATA or any consensus upstream element, and the presence of the cTBP as the major TBP protein (32Soyer-Gobillard M.O. Moreau H. Encyclopedia of Microbiology. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2000: 42-54Google Scholar). Further investigations for the presence of such unique transcription initiation factors in other dinoflagellate species and/or in other unicellular eukaryotes will be necessary to study this functional and evolutionary diversity.

https://openalex.org/W2033341558,"Depolarization of pancreatic β-cells is critical for stimulation of insulin secretion by acetylcholine but remains unexplained. Using voltage-clamped β-cells, we identified a small inward current produced by acetylcholine, which was suppressed by atropine or external Na+ omission, but was not mimicked by nicotine, and was insensitive to nicotinic antagonists, tetrodotoxin, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DiDS), thapsigargin pretreatment, and external Ca2+and K+ removal. This suggests that muscarinic receptor stimulation activates voltage-insensitive Na+ channels distinct from store-operated channels. No outward Na+current was produced by acetylcholine when the electrochemical Na+ gradient was reversed, indicating that the channels are inward rectifiers. No outward K+ current occurred either, and the reversal potential of the current activated by acetylcholine in the presence of Na+ and K+ was close to that expected for a Na+-selective membrane, suggesting that the channels opened by acetylcholine are specific for Na+. Overnight pretreatment with pertussis toxin or the addition of guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-γ-S) or guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-β-S) instead of GTP to the pipette solution did not alter this current, excluding involvement of G proteins. Injection of a current of a similar amplitude to that induced by acetylcholine elicited electrical activity in β-cells perifused with a subthreshold glucose concentration. These results demonstrate that muscarinic receptor activation in pancreatic β-cells triggers, by a G protein-independent mechanism, a selective Na+ current that explains the plasma membrane depolarization.

Blood glucose itself is the main stimulator of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells. This stimulation involves two complementary pathways. Glucose generates a triggering signal, a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c),1through the following sequence of events: the acceleration of cell metabolism increases the ATP/ADP ratio, which closes ATP-sensitive K+ (K+-ATP) channels in the plasma membrane; the resulting decrease in K+ conductance leads to membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+ influx (1Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 2Gilon P. Ravier M.A. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C.

Glucose also produces amplifying signals that increase the efficacy of Ca2+ on exocytosis (6Aizawa T. Komatsu M. Asanuma N. Sato Y. Sharp G.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Besides glucose, physiological agents such as hormones and neurotransmitters also modulate insulin secretion. A rich parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation enters the islets and ends close to the endocrine cells, allowing a fine neural tuning of the islet function (8Ahren B. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 9Brunicardi F.C. Sun Y.S. Druck P. Goulet R.J. Elahi D. Andersen D.K. Am. J. Surg. 1987; 153: 34-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine (ACh) is released by parasympathetic nerve endings during the preabsorptive phase of feeding to enhance insulin secretion prior to the rise in plasma glucose and during the absorptive phase (10Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). By binding to muscarinic receptors of the M3 type, ACh triggers changes in phospholipid metabolism leading to formation of diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. The resulting fall of the Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum activates a modest Ca2+ influx, through voltage-independent Ca2+ channels, which is commonly referred to as a capacitative Ca2+ entry. In addition, ACh depolarizes the plasma membrane of β-cells. This depolarization is small and does not cause Ca2+ influx in unstimulated β-cells. However, in the presence of stimulatory (depolarizing) concentrations of glucose, this additional depolarization by ACh enhances Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, leading to a sustained [Ca2+]c elevation (10Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Although central for the increase in insulin secretion by ACh (10Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 11Satin L.S. Kinard T.A. Endocrine. 1998; 8: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the depolarization has never been conclusively explained. Several observations suggest that a Na+ current is involved. Thus, the depolarization of β-cells by ACh is abrogated by omission of extracellular Na+ (12Henquin J.C. Garcia M.C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and accompanied by increases in total Na+ content (13Saha S. Hellman B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 204: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), 22Na+uptake (12Henquin J.C. Garcia M.C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Gagerman E. Sehlin J. Taljedal I.B. J. Physiol. 1980; 300: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and free cytosolic Na+ concentration ([Na+]c) (15Gilon P. Henquin J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These arguments, however, remain indirect and conflict with the general concept that nicotinic rather than muscarinic receptors mediate cholinergic effects on Na+ conductance. In the present study, we used membrane potential recordings with microelectrode and both conventional and perforated whole cell modes of the patch-clamp technique to identify and characterize the current by which ACh depolarizes the plasma membrane of mouse β-cells. Our study provides the first direct electrophysiological evidence for muscarinic, G protein-independent stimulation of an inward Na+ current in pancreatic β-cells. The pancreas from NMRI mice killed by cervical dislocation was aseptically digested with collagenase in a bicarbonate-buffered solution containing 120 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter Hepes, 10 mmol/liter glucose, and 1 mmol/liter mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and gassed with O2/CO2 (94:6%) to have a pH of 7.4. The islets were handpicked under a stereomicroscope. Single cells were obtained by incubating the islets for 5 min in a Ca2+-free medium containing 138 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.6 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter Hepes, 3 mmol/liter glucose, and 1 mmol/liter EGTA (pH 7.4). After a brief centrifugation, this solution was replaced by culture medium, and the islets were disrupted by gentle pipetting through a siliconized glass pipette. The cells were plated on 22-mm-diameter glass coverslips. Intact islets and single islet cells were cultured for, respectively, 1 and 1–3 days in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 mmol/liter glucose. All of the solutions for tissue preparation and culture medium were supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The membrane potential of a single β-cell within an islet was continuously recorded at 37 °C with a high resistance (∼200 MΩ) intracellular microelectrode (16Meissner H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). β-Cells were identified by the typical electrical activity that they display in the presence of 10 mmol/liter glucose. Two criteria defined previously (17Rolland J.F. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were used to identify single β-cells: a cell capacitance above 5 pF and the presence of a voltage-dependent Na+ current that is inactivated at a holding potential of −70 mV but can be activated after a hyperpolarizing pulse to −140 mV. Patch-clamp measurements were carried out in both conventional and perforated whole cell modes, using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (Heka Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) and the software Pulsefit or an Axopatch 200 B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and the software pClamp 8. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Hertfordshire, UK) to give a resistance of 4–5 MΩ. Except for the experiments performed to obtain the I-V curve, INa-ACh was measured in cells kept hyperpolarized at −80 mV. ICa was measured by applying 25-ms depolarizations from −80 mV to +10 mV every 5 s. Voltage-clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C), whereas current-clamp experiments were carried out at 34–36 °C. The standard extracellular solution used for membrane potential recordings with intracellular microelectrodes contained 122 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.7 mmol/liter KCl, 2.6 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 20 mmol/liter NaHCO3, and 10 mmol/liter glucose. It was gassed with O2/CO2 (95%:5%) to maintain pH at 7.4. Various solutions were used for patch-clamp recordings. In the perforated mode, the pipette solution contained 70 mmol/liter K2SO4, 10 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 3.7 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.1) (Int Sol A). The electrical contact was established by adding a pore-forming antibiotic, amphotericin B or nystatin, to the pipette solution. Amphotericin (stock solution of 60 mg/ml in Me2SO) was used at a final concentration of 300 μg/ml. Nystatin (stock solution of 10 mg/ml in Me2SO) was used at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The tip of the pipette was back-filled with antibiotic-free solution, and the pipette was then filled with the amphotericin- or nystatin-containing solution. The voltage clamp was considered satisfactory when the series conductance was >35–40 nS. In conventional whole cell recordings of INa-ACh, the pipette solution contained 112 mmol/liter KCl, 5 mmol/liter KOH, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 3 mmol/liter MgATP, 0.1 mmol/liter Na2GTP, and 10 mmol/liter Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.15 with 1 mmol/liter HCl) (Int Sol B). When needed, 10 mmol/liter EGTA was added to internal solution B (Int Sol C). Na+-rich/K+-free solution was prepared by substituting NaCl for KCl and NaOH for KOH of internal solution B (Int Sol D). Na+-free/K+-rich solution was prepared by increasing KCl and KOH concentrations of internal solution B to 125 and 30, respectively (pH adjusted to 7.15 with 18 mmol/liter HCl) (Int Sol E). For experiments during which the equilibrium potential for Na+ was fixed at −60 or −20 mV, the pipette solution contained 107 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter NaOH, 3 mmol/liter MgATP, 0.1 mmol/liter Na2GTP, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 10 mmol/liter Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.15 with 7 mmol/liter HCl) (Int Sol F). For conventional whole cell recordings of ICa, the pipette solution contained 125 mmol/liter CsCl, 30 mmol/liter KOH, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 3 mmol/liter MgATP, 0.1 mmol/liter Na2GTP, and 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.15) (Int Sol G). When specified, GTP-γ-S or GDP-β-S was substituted for GTP in the pipette solution. When the conventional whole cell mode was used, ACh was applied 5 min after the rupture of the plasma membrane. The standard extracellular solution used to monitor INa-AChcontained 120 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4), and 10 mmol/liter glucose (Ext Sol A). Ca2+-free solution was prepared by substituting MgCl2 for CaCl2 of external solution A and was supplemented with 2 mmol/liter EGTA (Ext Sol B). When needed, Na+145/K+-free solution was prepared by substituting NaCl for KCl of external solution A (Ext Sol C). Na+-free/K+ 4.8 solution contained 135 mmol/liter N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.4 with 131 mmol/liter HCl), and 10 mmol/liter glucose (Ext Sol D). When needed, Na+-K+-free solution was prepared by substituting N-methyl-d-glucamine for KCl of external solution D (pH adjusted to 7.4 with 136 mmol/liter HCl) (Ext Sol E). For experiments during which the equilibrium potential for Na+ was fixed at −60 mV, the external solution contained 11 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 180 mmol/liter N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mmol/liter CdCl2, 0.25 mmol/liter tolbutamide (pH adjusted to 7.4 with 172 mmol/liter HCl), and 10 mmol/liter glucose (Ext Sol F). For experiments during which the equilibrium potential for Na+ was fixed at −20 mV, the external solution contained 53 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter KCl, 100 mmol/liter N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1 mmol/liter CdCl2, 0.25 mmol/liter tolbutamide (pH adjusted to 7.4 with 96 mmol/liter HCl), and 10 mmol/liter glucose (Ext Sol G). For recordings of ICa, the external solution contained 125 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.8 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter tetraethylammonium-Cl, 5 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4), and 10 mmol/liter glucose (Ext Sol H). Thapsigargin was obtained from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Unless otherwise stated, all of the other chemicals were from Sigma. The experiments are illustrated by means or representative traces of results obtained with the indicated number of cells from at least three different cultures. The statistical significance of differences between means was assessed by unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. In the presence of 10 mmol/liter glucose, β-cells within an islet display a rhythmic electrical activity characterized by alternating polarized silent phases and depolarized phases with bursts of action potentials (Fig. 1). The addition of 1 μmol/liter ACh induced a sustained and persistent depolarization with continuous spike activity in two of six islets. In the other islets, the initial period of sustained activity was followed by rapid oscillations of the membrane potential (Fig. 1). Similar effects of ACh on the β-cell electrical activity have previously been observed in noncultured islets and are blocked by atropine (12Henquin J.C. Garcia M.C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,18Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The effect of ACh on the whole cell current was first studied in single β-cells held hyperpolarized at −80 mV by the conventional whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Addition of ACh induced a sustained and reversible inward current, the amplitude of which increased with the concentration of the neurotransmitter (Fig. 2,A–D) to reach a maximum of 0.77 ± 0.15 pA/pF (n = 5) at 100 μmol/liter ACh. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) estimated after fitting the data to a sigmoidal function was at 2.5 μmol/liter ACh (Fig.2 D). The kinetics of activation of the current by ACh could not be established reliably because the characteristics of our perifusion system (chamber volume of ∼0.8 ml and flow rate of ∼0.5 ml/min) preclude fast solution exchange. However, it was repeatedly noted that the current activated by ACh developed rapidly, within ∼1 s (Figs. 2 B and3 G), in cells that were located very close to the inflow of solution and more slowly (Fig. 3,B and D) in cells that were located at some distance of this inflow.Figure 3Characteristics of the inward current activated by ACh in mouse β-cells. Single β-cells were voltage-clamped at −80 mV using the conventional whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique. The composition of the external (Ext Sol) and pipette solutions (Int Sol) used for these experiments is described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the sake of clarity, their main characteristics are summarized on the left side of each panel. ACh (100 μmol/liter) was applied when indicated by the arrows. A andB, ACh induced an inward current in the absence of Ca2+ in the external and pipette solutions (Caout 0, Cain 0) (A) or when the Na+/K+ pump was blocked by removal of K+ from the external solution (Kout 0) (B). C and D, the inward current activated by ACh was abrogated by Na+ omission from the medium (Naout 0) (C) but unaffected by inhibition of voltage-dependent Na+ channels with 2 μmol/liter tetrodotoxin (D). E andF, ACh failed to induce an outward current when the driving force for Na+ was directed outwardly (Naout 0; Nain-rich) (E) or when the driving force for K+ was directed outwardly (Kout 0; Kin-rich) and, simultaneously, no Na+ current could occur (Naout 0; Nain 0) (F).G, 100 μmol/liter DIDS did not affect the inward current elicited by ACh. The traces are representative of at least five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The current elicited by ACh was completely suppressed or prevented by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (Fig. 2, A–C), but was not mimicked by 10 μmol/liter nicotine (n = 5, not shown), and was insensitive to nicotine or nicotinic antagonists. Thus, in the presence of 10 μmol/liter nicotine, 0.1 μmol/liter α-bungarotoxin, or 100 μmol/liter hexamethonium, 100 μmol/liter ACh elicited a current that was, respectively, 90 ± 8% (n = 11), 111 ± 11% (n = 6), or 107 ± 6% (n = 7) of the current activated by ACh in the absence of nicotinic agents. These experiments show that the ACh-induced inward current in β-cells results from activation of muscarinic, but not nicotinic, receptors. In another series of experiments, β-cells were voltage-clamped in the perforated whole cell mode and treated with 1 μmol/liter thapsigargin, which completely emptied the endoplasmic reticulum in Ca2+, as indicated by the suppression of Ca2+mobilization by ACh (n = 5; not shown). Subsequent application of ACh elicited a current of the same amplitude (0.77 ± 0.09 pA/pF, n = 11) as that measured in the whole cell configuration (Fig. 2 E). The ACh-induced inward current, therefore, is not a store-operated current. The ionic specificity of the current was first evaluated in the standard whole cell mode by removing Ca2+, Na+, or K+ from the bath or pipette solutions. Addition of ACh to a Ca2+-free medium elicited an inward current, indicating that the latter was not carried by Ca2+(Fig. 3 A). Omission of K+ from the perifusion medium did not prevent the current elicited by ACh, indicating that the current does not involve changes in Na+ pump activity (Fig.3 B). By contrast, omission of extracellular Na+abrogated the current, which suggests that it is carried by Na+ (Fig. 3 C). The current was nevertheless insensitive to tetrodotoxin, indicating that voltage-gated Na+ channels are not involved (Fig. 3 D). When the electrochemical gradient for Na+ was reversed (Na+-rich pipette solution and Na+-free bath medium) to permit an outward current, ACh was ineffective (Fig.3 E), suggesting that Na+ flows only in the inward direction. A nonspecific cationic current carrying both Na+ and K+ could also depolarize the plasma membrane because it usually has a reversal potential close to 0 mV. The experiments performed above did not allow us to exclude the possibility that ACh activates such a current because either the membrane was clamped close to the equilibrium potential of K+ (Fig. 3 C) or no K+ was present in the pipette and bath solutions (Fig.3 E). To address that question, two series of experiments were thus performed. In the first series, Na+ was omitted from both pipette and bath solutions, whereas K+ was present at a high concentration in the pipette solution only (Fig.3 F). Under these conditions where the equilibrium potential for K+ was infinitely negative and no Na+current could occur, ACh did not activate any outward current. In the second series of experiments, the Na+ versusK+ specificity of the current activated by ACh was evaluated by measuring its reversal potential with pipette and external solutions selected to have very different equilibrium potentials for Na+ and K+, i.e. −60 or −20 mV for Na+, and infinitely positive potentials for K+. These experiments were performed in the presence of Cd2+ to block voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (and avoid [Ca2+]c overload or activation of Ca2+-dependent currents) and tolbutamide to block K+-ATP channels (and avoid a large outward current through these channels). However, even under these conditions, the reversal potential could not be reliably estimated by voltage ramp protocols because of the smallness of the current. Therefore, the effect of ACh was tested in separate β-cells held at selected fixed potentials between −130 and 0 mV (Fig.4). Experiments at potentials more negative than −130 mV or more positive than 0 mV could not be performed because of instability of the seal. Pipette and external solutions were first selected to have an equilibrium potential for Na+ at −60 mV. At potentials more negative than −60 mV, the amplitude of the inward current induced by ACh increased with the driving force for Na+ (larger at −130 than −100 mV) and displayed a slope conductance of 6.6 pS/pF (Fig. 4, open squares). At the set equilibrium potential for Na+(−60 mV), ACh did not induce any current. To test whether the reversal potential of the current activated by ACh strictly followed the equilibrium potential of Na+, the equilibrium potential of Na+ was then fixed at −20 mV. At this potential, ACh failed to activate any current. However, at potentials more negative than −20 mV, ACh induced an inward current with an amplitude proportional to the driving force for Na+ and with a slope conductance of 5.3 pS/pF (Fig. 4, filled circles). All these results clearly indicate selectivity for Na+ without contribution of K+. Because of this ionic characteristic, the current will be referred to as INa-ACh. At potentials less negative than the set equilibrium potential for Na+(−30 and 0 mV when ENa was fixed at −60 mV; 0 mV when ENa was fixed at −20 mV), ACh did not activate any outward current (Fig. 4), which, together with the results of Fig.3 E, suggests that the channels responsible for INa-ACh are inward rectifiers. An increase in Cl− permeability is expected to depolarize the plasma membrane because the equilibrium potential for Cl− in β-cells has been estimated to be above the threshold for activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (19Eberhardson M. Patterson S. Grapengiesser E. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Sehlin J. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E501-E508PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of a Cl−current by ACh has not been directly tested by omitting Cl− from the medium. However, this possibility can also be discarded for two reasons. First, ACh did not elicit any current when the membrane was clamped at a potential different from the equilibrium potential of Cl− and under conditions where no Na+ current occurred (e.g. at holding potentials of −80, −80, and −60 mV in Figs. 3 (C and F) and 4 (open squares), when ECl was at, −6, 0, and −14 mV, respectively). Second, INa-ACh was unaffected by DIDS, a blocker of the volume-activated current (21Best L. Brown P.D. Sheader E.A. Yates A.P. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 177: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that carries Cl− and possibly other ions in β-cells (22Kinard T.A. Satin L.S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of 100 μmol/liter DIDS, 100 μmol/liter ACh elicited a current that was 112 ± 10% (n = 14) of the current activated by ACh in the absence of the blocker (Fig. 3 G). Muscarinic effects of ACh in β-cells are known or assumed to be transduced by a G protein, and it has been reported that in neurons and cardiomyocytes, several muscarinic receptor subtypes modulate ionic channels, such as Ca2+ and K+channels, through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins of the Gi or Go class (10Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, after permanent inactivation of Gi or Go proteins by overnight pretreatment of β-cells with pertussis toxin (250 ng/ml), the amplitude of INa-ACh was 109 ± 7% (n= 6) of that observed in untreated cells. To test the possible involvement of all kinds of G proteins in the activation of INa-ACh, GTP in the pipette solution (control conditions) was replaced by GTP-γ-S or GDP-β-S, which are, respectively, nonhydrolyzable activator and inhibitor of G proteins. Fig.5 shows the maximum inward current (INa-ACh) elicited by a 1-min application of 100 μmol/liter ACh to β-cells voltage-clamped at −80 mV and dialyzed for 5 min with a solution containing 100 μmol/liter GTP, 10 μmol/liter GTP-γ-S, or 4 mmol/liter GDP-β-S. In all conditions, INa-ACh was reversible upon washout of the neurotransmitter, and its amplitude was similar with the three nucleotides, suggesting that activation of INa-ACh does not involve G proteins. To ascertain that our experimental conditions were adequate to identify the involvement of a G protein, we tested the GTP analogues on the ACh-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ current in pancreatic β-cells (23Gilon P. Yakel J. Gromada J. Zhu Y. Henquin J.C. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig.6 A shows representative whole cell Ca2+ current traces recorded with a pipette solution containing 100 μmol/liter GTP. The current (ICa) was evoked by 25-ms depolarizing pulses from −80 to 10 mV before (control), during (ACh), and after (wash) application of 100 μmol/liter ACh to the bath. Fig. 6 B summarizes the changes of the normalized peak Ca2+ current produced by ACh in the presence of different guanine nucleotides in the pipette solution. With 100 μmol/liter GTP in the pipette solution (control), ACh reversibly inhibited the current. This inhibitory effect was abolished when the pipette solution contained 4 mmol/liter GDP-β-S and became irreversible when 10 μmol/liter GTP-γ-S was included in the pipette. The spontaneous decrease in the current amplitude recorded with GDP-β-S reflects rundown (23Gilon P. Yakel J. Gromada J. Zhu Y. Henquin J.C. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These control experiments thus show that the guanine nucleotides were effective in our recording conditions. Because INa-ACh is small, it was important to verify that a current of a similar amplitude was sufficient to elicit electrical activity. These experiments were performed in β-cells perifused at 34–36 °C with 6 mmol/liter glucose, a concentration that is subthreshold in islets (24Henquin J.C. Meissner H.P. J. Physiol. 1982; 332: 529-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A depolarizing current corresponding to the average INa-AChinduced by 100 μmol/liter ACh (0.77 pA/"

Here we analyzed the role of serine phosphorylation in regulation of STAT6-mediated transcription. Optimal transcriptional response of IL-4-inducible promoters requires costimulatory signals through CD40-stimulated intracellular kinases such as p38 MAPK. We found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 as well as the dominant negative p38 MAPK inhibited interleukin (IL)-4 regulated expression of CD23 in Ramos B cells. IL-4 stimulation did not stimulate p38 MAPK activity, but inhibition of p38 MAPK activity directly correlated with inhibition of IL-4-induced gene activation. Dissection of individual response elements on IL-4-regulated promoter showed that C/EBPβ-mediated transcription was insensitive to SB202190 treatment in B cells whereas STAT6-mediated transcription was regulated by p38 MAPK. The IL-4-induced immediate activation events of STAT6 were not affected by p38 MAPK activity. Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping indicated that STAT6 is not a direct substrate for p38 MAPK. Instead, p38 MAPK was found to directly regulate the activity of the transactivation domain of STAT6. These results show that, in addition to the well established proinflammatory effects, p38 MAPK also provides a costimulatory signal for IL-4-induced gene responses by directly stimulating the transcriptional activation of STAT6.

Optimal activation of B cells is dependent on two Th2-mediated stimuli, IL-4 and a second signal provided by CD40 ligand (CD40L) (1Noelle R.J. Roy M. Shepherd D.M. Stamenkovic I. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6550-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). IL-4, together with CD40-mediated signals, stimulate the proliferation of B cells, and induce the expression of the low-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (CD23), major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and stimulate the transcription of unrearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain germline Igε and Igγ1 genes leading to class switching and IgE and IgG1 synthesis (2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 3Warren W.D. Berton M.T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5637-5646PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of IL-4 are mediated through the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) complex that activates the Jak1 and Jak3 tyrosine kinases leading to intracellular signal transduction (2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). STAT6 functions as a crucial mediator of IL-4-specific gene responses, as attested by the similar phenotypes of the STAT6 and IL-4 knock-out mice presenting deficient Th2 differentiation and absence of IgE responses (4Kuhn R. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Science. 1991; 254: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 5Shimoda K. van Deursen J. Sangster M.Y. Sarawar S.R. Carson R.T. Tripp R.A. Chu C. Quelle F.W. Nosaka T. Vignali D.A. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Recruitment of STAT6 to the tyrosine-phosphorylated IL-4 receptor α-chain initiates the activation cascade, and in the receptor complex STAT6 becomes phosphorylated on its C-terminal tyrosine residue by the Jak kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation causes STAT6 to dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA elements on IL-4 responsive genes (2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The promoter regions of IL-4 inducible genes contain severalcis-acting elements and the cooperation between different transcription factors is critical for efficient regulation of gene transcription. For example, the promoters of human CD23 and Igε genes contain in addition to STAT6-binding sites, also response elements for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) NF-κB, interferon regulatory factor-4, and B cell-specific activator protein (Pax5) (6Richards M.L. Katz D.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar,7Gupta S. Jiang M. Anthony A. Pernis A.B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). STAT6 appears to be the only transcription factor that is functionally regulated by IL-4, whereas the other factors are either regulated by costimulatory signals as exemplified by CD40-mediated regulation of NF-κB or through transcriptional regulation (8Brady K. Fitzgerald S. Ingvarsson S. Borrebaeck C.A. Moynagh P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Iciek L.A. Delphin S.A. Stavnezer J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4769-4779PubMed Google Scholar). STAT6 has been shown to cooperate with several transcription factors, but the mechanisms of cooperation between various transcription factors differ significantly. For example, C/EBPβ stabilizes the DNA binding of STAT6, whereas the effects of interferon regulatory factor-4 and NF-κB are directed to transcriptional activation and involve physical interaction with STAT6 (7Gupta S. Jiang M. Anthony A. Pernis A.B. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1837-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Shen C.H. Stavnezer J. Mol. Cell.

STAT-mediated gene responses are modulated by additional signaling pathways, which provide important diversity and additional regulation to the biological effects of cytokines. It has become evident that STATs are subject to post-translational modification through serine phosphorylation. STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5, and STAT6 have been shown to be phosphorylated on serine residues in their transactivation domain (TAD) in response to various stimuli (12Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 13Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomaki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O.

The functional consequence of the serine phosphorylation modification is best characterized in STAT1 where phosphorylation of Ser-727 regulates the interaction with BRCA1 and mini-chromosome maintenance 5 coactivator and affects the specificity of target gene expression (15Zhang J.J.

A. 2000; 97: 5208-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The serine-phosphorylation sites of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT4 contain a conserved PMSP or PSP motif that confers the consensus mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation site, and thereby the role of MAP family kinases in regulation of STAT phosphorylation has been extensively studied. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) are mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 upon epidermal growth factor stimulation but ERKs are not involved in cytokine-induced phosphorylation of STATs (18Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Recently, much attention has been focused on the role of p38 MAPK in the regulation of STATs. p38 MAPK has been shown to mediate the lipopolysaccharide and cellular stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 in STAT1, and the IL-12-induced phosphorylation of Ser-721 of STAT4 (19Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 20Visconti R. Gadina M.

Furthermore, p38 MAPK kinase activity is required for optimal STAT1-mediated transactivation of interferon γ-activated site and interferon-stimulated response element promoters without an effect on IFNα-induced phosphorylation of Ser-727 of STAT1 (21Uddin S.

The IL-6-induced transcriptional activation of STAT3 has also been shown to be dependent on IL-6-stimulated p38 MAPK activity in hepatocytes (23Zauberman A. Zipori D. Krupsky M. Ben-Levy R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3886-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that STAT6-mediated gene activation is regulated through as yet unidentified serine kinase(s) (13Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomaki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Engagement of CD40 surface antigen leads to rapid activation of several tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases (24Faris M. Gaskin F. Parsons J.T. Fu S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Hanissian S.H. Geha R.S.

Our results indicate a direct role for p38 MAPK in regulation of STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation. All the cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA.

Han. pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid for HepG2 cells and elongation factor promoter-driven pEBB-β-galactosidase plasmid (47Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) for Daudi cells were used to monitor transfection efficiency. HepG2 cells were transfected on 6-well plates by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method and Daudi cells by DEAE-dextran or by electroporation as described above. Cells were grown for 24–48 h and starved overnight in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. After starvation the concentration of Daudi cells was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4 (PeproTech EC Ltd., London, United Kingdom) or 1 μg/ml α-human CD40-antibody (Immunotech). p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) (Sigma) was added to the cultures 60 min before stimuli when indicated. After stimulation for 6–16 h cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase values were normalized against measured β-galactosidase activities or against total protein concentration in Daudi cells when the DEAE-dextran method was used for transfection. Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide maps were done as described earlier (32Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Briefly, Daudi cells were starved overnight and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (AmershamBiosciences) in phosphate-free medium (Sigma) for 3 h. Cells were stimulated as indicated and lysed in Triton lysis buffer, and STAT6 was immunoprecipitated. Immunocomplexes were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography and bands corresponding to STAT6 were excised for further analysis. For the phosphopeptide map, proteins were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega). Washed fragments were applied to thin layer cellulose plates, separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 and in the second dimension by ascending chromatography using isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid:1-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water, 1250:38:96:58:558, v/v/v/v/v/v). Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. For the phosphoamino acid analysis ∼10% of the digested proteins were hydrolyzed in HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. Lysates were lyophilized and resolved in pH 1.9 buffer containing standard phosphoamino acids (o-phospho-dl-serine,o-phospho-dl-threonine,o-phospho-dl-tyrosine from Sigma). Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Standard amino acids were visualized by ninhydrin staining and autoradiography was used to detect phosphorylated amino acids. Ramos B cells were suspended in RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum and stained for 30 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse α-human-CD23 antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or with 20 μl of PE-conjugated mouse α-human-CD23 antibody (BD Biosciences). Unspecific staining was monitored with isotype-matched control antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse α-human-CD64 antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and PE-conjugated mouse α-human-CD13 antibody (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed with FACScan (BD Biosciences). We have previously shown that STAT6-mediated transcription is regulated by Ser/Thr kinases (13Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomaki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD40 cell surface molecules mediate important costimulatory signals for IL-4-induced gene responses (33Jabara H.H., Fu, S.M. Geha R.S.

These findings together with recent results about the role of p38 MAPK in regulation of cytokine signaling led us to investigate the role of p38 MAPK in IL-4-induced gene activation. We first tested the effect of p38 MAPK inhibitors on IL-4/CD40-induced expression of CD23 on highly IL-4-responsive Ramos 2g6 B cells. Cell-permeable pyridinyl imidazole compounds SB202190 and SB203580 are specific inhibitors of α and β isoforms of p38 MAPK and they do not inhibit kinase activity of other mitogen-activated protein kinases such as ERKs and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (35Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). Ramos B cells were stimulated for 20 h with IL-4 in the presence or absence of different concentrations of SB202190, and the surface expression of CD23 was measured with FACScan. IL-4 stimulation resulted in robust induction of CD23 expression (TableI, A). α-CD40 treatment alone did not increase CD23 expression, but further enhanced the IL-4-induced CD23 expression. B cells express low levels of CD23 without any apparent stimulation, and SB202190 inhibited both the basal and the induced expression of CD23 in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition was evident already at 1 μm concentration of SB202190. The inhibitor did not affect the viability of Ramos B cells at any concentration used.Table Ip38 MAPK kinase activity is required for CD23 expression in Ramos 2g6 B cellsASB2021901510μmNo stimulation29.417.510.49.8IL-4189.468.514.912.0α-CD4029.718.410.510.1IL-4 + α-CD40211.075.016.711.7BpSG5p38AFNo stimulation37.929.7IL-4214.8144.6IL-4 + α-CD40218.7149.2(A) Ramos B cells were left untreated or treated with IL-4 (10 ng/mL) and/or α-CD40 antibody (1 mg/ml) for 20 h in the absence or presence of different concentrations of p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190.

Fluorescence intensity was determined using FACScan, and the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) are shown.

Experiments were repeated three times with identical results.

MFI for isotype matched fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated negative control antibody was 5.6 and for PE-conjugated negative control antibody 4.0. Experiments were repeated three times with identical results. The role of p38 MAPK in regulation of CD23 expression was further investigated by using the dominant negative form of p38 MAPKα. Ramos B cells were transfected with the dominant negative p38 MAPKα (p38AF) or empty vector (pSG5), and the CD23 expression was analyzed by FACScan using PE-conjugated α-CD23 antibody. Despite the low transfection efficiency in Ramos cells, the ectopic expression of p38AF resulted in 25–35% inhibition of CD23 expression in three independent experiments (Table I, B). These results suggested that p38 MAPK activity is regulating CD23 expression. However, the enhancing effect of CD40 ligation on IL-4-induced CD23 expression was rather modest, and next we analyzed the effect of IL-4 stimulation and CD40 engagement on p38 MAPK activation in B cells directly. Ramos 2g6 and Daudi B cells were pretreated with SB202190 or with vehicle before IL-4 and/or α-CD40 were added to the cultures for different times. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with α-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody, which is specific for the Thr180/Tyr182-phosphorylated catalytically active form of p38 MAPK. Constitutive phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was readily detected in both Daudi and Ramos cells (Fig.1). IL-4 stimulation (5 min to 24 h) did not activate p38 MAPK in any of the cell lines tested (Daudi, Ramos, HepG2, HeLa, and 293T) (Fig. 1 , and data not shown). In Daudi cells cross-linking of CD40 resulted in rapid induction and prolonged activation (at least up to 6 h, Fig. 1 B) of p38 MAPK, whereas in Ramos cells CD40 engagement only slightly increased (10–20%) p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 1 B). SB202190 pretreatment markedly diminished the basal phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as well as the CD40-induced phosphorylation in both cell lines. Thus, in Ramos cells, CD23 expression directly correlated with the level of p38 MAPK activation (high basal activity, low α-CD40 induction). The IL-4-responsive promoter regions of human Igε and CD23 genes contain binding elements for several transcription factors such as C/EBPβ, STAT6, NF-κB, and B cell-specific activator protein (6Richards M.L. Katz D.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar). To define the target element for p38 MAPK activity, we created reporter constructs from human Igε promoter encompassing different response elements (RE) (C/EBPβ-RE, STAT6-RE, C/EBPβ-STAT6-RE, C/EBPβ-STAT6-NF-κB-RE, and STAT6-NF-κB-RE). The effect of SB202190 treatment on various reporter constructs was analyzed in Daudi B cells after IL-4/CD40 stimulation. Daudi cells do not express CD23 but they were chosen for reporter gene studies because of their CD40-regulated p38 MAPK activation and relatively good transfection efficiency. Previously CD40 has been shown to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcriptional responses through p38 MAPK activation (8Brady K. Fitzgerald S. Ingvarsson S. Borrebaeck C.A. Moynagh P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our experiments SB202190 inhibited the IL-4-induced reporter activity also in the absence of the NF-κB response element (data not shown). Thereby we wanted to investigate in more detail the role of p38 MAPK in activation of the minimal IL-4 response element. IL-4 induced the activity of the C/EBPβ-STAT6-RE reporter in Daudi cells (Fig. 2 A). The IL-4-induced activity was further stimulated via CD40 antigen, but CD40 signal alone did not induce any reporter activity. Pretreatment of Daudi cells with SB202190 inhibited both IL-4 and IL-4+α-CD40 enhanced reporter activities to the same extent. Similar inhibition was observed with another p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (data not shown). Furthermore, the p38 MAPK inhibitor was found to decrease the IL-4-induced C/EBPβ-STAT6-RE reporter activity also in nonhematopoietic HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that SB202190 would inhibit the IL-4-stimulated transcription by an unspecific, p38 MAPK-independent way, we studied the effect of overexpression of both dominant negative and wild type p38 MAPKα (p38AF and p38wt, respectively) in Daudi cells (Fig. 2, B and C). Overexpression of p38 MAPKα resulted in activation of the kinase as detected by Western blotting with phospho-p38 MAPK-specific antibody and in autokinase assay (data not shown). As expected, the ectopic expression of p38AF reduced and p38wt enhanced both IL-4- and IL-4+α-CD40-induced gene activation in Daudi cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The inhibitory effect of SB202190 (10 μm) was observed also in the p38wt-transfected Daudi B cells (Fig. 2 C). In HepG2 cells the C/EBPβ-STAT6 region in the human Igε promoter has been shown to be the minimal IL-4 response element (37Mikita T. Campbell D., Wu, P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To analyze the individual roles of these transcription factors, reporter constructs consisting of only C/EBPβ-RE or STAT6-RE were utilized. C/EBPβ-RE reporter was found to be constitutively active in both Daudi (Fig. 3 A) and HepG2 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of p38 MAPKα did not stimulate the activity of C/EBPβ-RE in HepG2 cells (data not shown), and in Daudi cells SB202190 treatment did not reduce the activity of the C/EBPβ-RE reporter construc"

To test hypothetical mechanisms of adhesion, we have constructed two mutants of the chicken E-cadherin protein, one with the highly conserved His-Ala-Val (HAV) sequence motif reversed to Val-Ala-His (VAH), the other lacking the first extracellular domain (EC1). The inversion of HAV to VAH has no effect on the capacity of E-cadherin to mediate adhesion. Deletion of EC1 completely eliminates the ability of E-cadherin to mediate homophilic adhesion, but the deletion mutant is capable of adhering heterophilically to both unmutated E-cadherin and to the HAV/VAH mutant. These results demonstrate that the conserved HAV sequence motif is not involved in cadherin-mediated adhesion as has been suggested previously and supports the idea that in the context of the cell surface, cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion involves an interaction of EC1 with other domains of the cadherin extracellular moiety and not the “linear zipper” model, which posits trans interactions only between EC1 on apposing cell surfaces.

Classical cadherin proteins at the cell surface consist of five extracellular domains (ECs),1a transmembrane sequence, and a cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1). Each cadherin extracellular domain shares a folding topology of seven β-strands arranged in two β-sheets forming a barrel with hydrophobic amino acid side chains largely sequestered within the interior (17Overduin M.

The amino and carboxyl termini emerge from opposite ends of each folded domain, maintaining an orientation with the amino terminus directed away from the cell.

Binding of calcium at these sites maintains the structural integrity of the cadherin ECs, giving the protein a rigid conformation that allows it to mediate cell-cell adhesion. A single amino acid substitution in a calcium binding site between EC1 and EC2 or between EC2 and EC3 can abolish adhesion and increase motility, whereas mutations in other calcium-binding elements do not affect these behaviors (21Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1033-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 22Handschuh G. Luber B. Hutzler P. Hofler H. Becker K.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cadherins expressed on adjacent cells homoassociate through an antiparallel, trans, interaction of their extracellular regions. The bonds that they form across the intercellular space hold the plasma membranes of adjacent cells in close proximity. Adhesive strength is also dependent on a cis interaction between cadherins of the same cell (23Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) mediated at least in part by the transmembrane domain (24Huber O. Kemler R. Langosch D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4415-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These stable interactions can be rapidly disassembled or reorganized in response to extracellular signals such as growth factors (25Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and can occur without extreme alterations in the makeup of the adhesive complex or the amount of complex at the junction (26Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the extracellular domains mediate adhesion is poorly understood. The amino acid residues responsible for thetrans interaction are currently unknown, although there is solid evidence that the first domain (EC1) is important in forming specific cadherin interactions (27Nose A.

Harvey T.S. Bagby S. Tong K.I. Yau P. Takeichi M. Ikura M. Science. 1995; 267: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the highly conserved His-Ala-Val motif (HAV) of the first domain is important for binding (30Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 31Blaschuk O.W. Pouliot Y. Holland P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). E-cadherin peptides containing the HAV sequence have been shown to induce epithelial cell invasion, implying that the adhesive region flanks the HAV sequence (32Noe V. Willems J. Vandekerckhove J. Roy F.V. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is doubt that this motif is crucial because many nonclassical cadherins, and some classical ones, do not have HAV but are still capable oftrans adhesion (33Tanihara H. Sano K. Heimark R.L., St. John T. Suzuki S. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Babb S.G. Barnett J. Doedens A.L. Cobb N. Liu Q. Sorkin B.C. Yelick P.C.

To characterize the role of the HAV motif and of the whole EC1 in adhesion we evaluated the capability of two mutant forms of E-cadherin to mediate adhesion in a set of well defined cell-cell aggregation assays. One mutant has had the conserved HAV motif reversed to VAH, and the other mutant has the entire EC1 domain deleted. The results of these experiments, taken in conjunction with recent reports on human cadherin 4 (R-cadherin) (28Kitagawa M. Natori M. Murase S. Hirano S. Taketani S. Suzuki S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Xenopus laevis C-cadherin (35Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J.

The S180 cell line was originally derived from the axial tip of a transplanted mouse sarcoma (39Dunham L.J. Stewart H.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1953; 13: 1299-1377PubMed Google Scholar). S180 cells are spindle-shaped, do not undergo calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, and do not express any known cadherin proteins, making them ideal for observing the effects of cadherin transfection. S180 cells and all transfectants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal calf serum in a 10% CO2incubator at 37 °C. For passaging, cells were released from the plate by incubation with PBS (150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) and 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for ∼15–25 min, which released them from the plates as single cells, counted using a Coulter counter, and replated in culture medium at desired cell densities, usually 105 cells/10-cm culture dish in 10 ml of medium. The 5′-end of the E-cadherin reading frame was amplified from chicken liver cDNA using primers WJG1003 and WJG1004 (TableI) and digested with NheI andXhoI. An XhoI/BamHI fragment containing the majority of the E-cadherin coding region was isolated from plasmid pEC320 (40Gallin W.J. Sorkin B.C. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting vector (pBK-CMV ·E/K) was digested with NheI and BamHI, and a three-fragment ligation was performed. The entire insert of the resulting plasmid was sequenced completely to confirm that the plasmid had the correct sequence.

Kemler R. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-89Google Scholar). Two fragments were amplified from unmutated plasmid template using primers WJG1034 and WJG1045, and primers WJG1058 and WJG1042 (Table I). The resulting PCR products were gel purified, and a mixture was used as a template, amplified with primers WJG1034 and WJG1042. The resulting PCR product was digested with XhoI and KpnI, ligated into the wild-type plasmid that had also been digested with XhoI andKpnI, and a cloned plasmid was isolated. The sequence of the resulting insert was determined to confirm that only the designed mutation, inversion of the HAV sequence to VAH, had been introduced into the E-cadherin sequence. A schematic drawing of the mature protein encoded by this plasmid is shown in Fig. 1 B. The ΔI mutation was created by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (41Stappert J. Kemler R. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-89Google Scholar). As described for the ΔI mutant, using primers WJG1034 and WJG1046 and primers WJG1047 and WJG1042. There were two undesigned mutations found, one converting an arginine to a proline in the propeptide sequence and the other converting valine to isoleucine in the second extracellular domain. A schematic drawing of the mature protein encoded by this plasmid is shown in Fig. 1 B. S180 cells were transfected with plasmids using an optimized calcium coprecipitation method (42Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and selected in medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). Two weeks after transfection, cells were selected for their abilities to express high levels of E-cadherin using magnetic activated cell sorting (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were released from the culture plate and incubated with rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibody (40 μg/ml) in PBS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, then with magnetic beads coupled to goat anti-rabbit antibody (20 μl of bead suspension/107 cells). Cells expressing E-cadherin were retained on a high gradient magnetic separation column and then rinsed from the column upon removal of the magnetic field. Clones were isolated from the separated cells by limiting dilution. Expression of E-cadherin was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining with a polyclonal rabbit anti-E-cadherin antibody. Only a single clone from each primary transfection plate was saved, ensuring that the clones are independently derived. Cultures of stable transfectants were maintained in 200 μg/ml G418 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Genomic DNA was isolated from confluent 10-cm dishes of S180, S180L-11, HAV/VAH-1, HAV/VAH-2, HAV/VAH-4, ΔI-1, and ΔI-2 cells. DNA was isolated from the cells (43Strauss W.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 2.2.1-2.2.3Google Scholar), and E-cadherin sequences were amplified from the DNA of each cell line by PCR, using primers WJG1034 and WJG1042. PCR products were purified and sequenced. Two unplanned mutations are present in the sequence of the ΔI construct. In the precursor sequence a Pro was substituted for an Arg residue. This may have an effect on processing of the protein and transport to the membrane. However, the mutant E-cadherin is expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1 E) and is largely correctly processed by cleavage of the precursor peptide (Fig.2 A). The second mutation is the 44th amino acid in the second domain in which Ile is substituted for Val. This mutation is unlikely to be significant because the residue that was replaced has properties similar to the one that was replaced (a large, branched, nonpolar side chain). The side chain faces outward from the domain, not into the hydrophobic interior of the globular domain, so there is no effect on side chain packing in the interior of the domain, and the mutated residue is at a site that is highly variable in other domains and other cadherins (alignment not shown) and which does not correlate with adhesive specificity or subfamily identity. Polyclonal goat antibody was raised against the trypsin-released extracellular fragment of chicken E-cadherin. Polyclonal rabbit antibody was raised against a fusion protein encompassing most of the E-cadherin extracellular region. Fab′ fragments were prepared by overnight digestion of the whole IgG with pepsin followed by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol and iodoacetamide (44Acheson A. Gallin W.J. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 31-54Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass coverslips. Confluent and subconfluent cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, at room temperature for 15–30 min and quenched with 0.1 m glycine in PBS. Cells were permeabilized and further blocked in Tris/PO4/carrageenan/Triton X-100 (41 mm Tris, 4.4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmNaH2PO4, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.7% (w/v) Lambda Carrageenan, 30 mmNaN3) (45Sofroniew M.V. Schrell U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), followed by incubation overnight with 4 μg/ml rabbit anti-E-cadherin IgG or 30 μg/ml goat anti-E-cadherin IgG in Tris/PO4/carrageenan/Triton X-100 solution, five 10-min washes with Tris/PO4, a 1-h incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or Texas Red-conjugated second antibodies, and five 10-min washes with Tris/PO4. Coverslips were mounted on slides with MOWIOL/DABCO (46Osborn M. Weber K. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 97-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and examined by epifluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy. Confluent cultures were rinsed with 10 ml of TBS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and extracted with 1 ml of 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; the extracts were scraped into 5-ml polypropylene tubes and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) to disperse the cells completely and shear the DNA. Extracts were then stored as frozen aliquots, and the protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Aliquots of the extracts were mixed 1:1 with 2× sample buffer (4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0002% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. 20 μl of each of the samples was resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose, blocked with 3% (w/v) crude ovalbumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS, and incubated with the rabbit anti-E-cadherin (IgG final concentration, 10 μg/ml) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin ascites (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5,000 in 3% (w/v) ovalbumin, 0.1% Tween 20, TBS overnight and washed five times with TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0). The blot was then incubated with IR800 dye-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and IR700 dye-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (LiCor) in 3% (w/v) ovalbumin, 0.1% Tween 20, TBS for 3 h, washed five times, and visualized using an Odyssey scanner (LiCor). The intensity of each band was determined by integrating pixel intensity over the full band with subtraction of background based on median pixel intensity along the band boundary. E-cadherin expression was normalized to the intensity of the β-tubulin band for each sample, and the level of E-cadherin expression was determined relative to the expression level of the S180L-11 sample. Confluent cultures were rinsed once with PBS, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 and then incubated with 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link biotinylation reagent (Pierce) in PBS, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. The culture was then rinsed once with TBS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and extracted with 1 ml of 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and the resulting extract was stored frozen at −20 °C. 200 μl of the SDS extract was mixed with 1 ml of HS buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA) and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. The clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube with 50 μl of 1:1 slurry of avidin-coupled agarose beads (Pierce). The samples were mixed by gentle rocking at 4 °C for 2 h, and then the beads were pelleted and washed once with HS buffer, once with high salt buffer (HS buffer with 1m NaCl), and once with low salt buffer (2 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The beads were then resuspended in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer, 100 mm dithiothreitol, heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and 20 μl of the resulting extract was resolved on a 6% Laemmli SDS gel and visualized by Western blotting. Aggregation assays were performed according to Hoffman (48Hoffman S. Stevenson B.R. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 1-30Google Scholar). Cells were released from dishes with PBS, 5 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum and incubated on ice in Eagle's Spinner medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h to allow full dissociation. Aliquots of 2 × 106 cells were incubated with anti-E-cadherin or nonimmune Fab′ fragments (300 μg of Fab′ fragments/2 × 106 cells) in HDF buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 4 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) for a minimum of 30 min on ice. The assay was initiated by suspending the cells to a final volume of 2 ml in prewarmed Eagle's medium, transferring them to glass scintillation vials, and shaking at ∼80 rpm at 37 °C. At 0, 20, 40, and 60 min after the start of incubation, aliquots of cell suspension were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the cell suspension were counted by diluting 1:20 into Isoton II (Beckman/Coulter Electronics) and counting particles within the range of single suspended S180 cell sizes (10–20 μm) with a Z2 Coulter counter. Percentage aggregation for each vial was calculated by the formula 100 × ((N 0 −Nt)/N 0), whereN 0 equals number of particles at time 0, andNt is the number of particles at the time the cells were sampled. Each point on each graph represents the average of three separate vials, treated with the same Fab′. Each assay was performed at least three times. Coaggregation was performed, with slight modifications, according to Friedlander et al. (49Friedlander D.R. Mege R.-M. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7043-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with a 3 mg/ml solution of either Texas Red-labeled fixable dextran or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fixable dextran using the Influx method (Molecular Probes). Cells were then maintained in normal medium until harvesting for the experiment (usually ∼8 h). Labeled cells were released from the culture dish with PBS and 5 mm EDTA. After counting, cells were diluted to 105 cells/50 μl in HDF with appropriate Fab′ fragments (20 μg/105 cells). The assay was initiated by combining both cell types in a final volume of 700 μl with minimum Eagle's medium and incubating in 24-well plates coated with PolyHEMA on a rotary shaker at ∼80 rpm. Cells were fixed after the 60-min incubation period by addition of the aliquots to 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde PBS, pH 7.5. To calculate overall levels of aggregation, aliquots were taken from each well at times 0 and 60 min and evaluated using a Coulter counter, as above. Preliminary experiments indicated that if the level of aggregation was low (less than 20%), then there were essentially no visible aggregates to score. Also, if S180 aggregation was high, it was attributable to excess cellular debris aggregating cells in a cadherin-independent manner. When the negative control was contaminated in this way, the experiment was abandoned because any of the other wells could be contaminated in the same way. The number of Texas Red-labeled cells in each cluster was counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells in that cluster. Comparisons of percentages of the three replicate wells were performed using single factor analysis of variance. Data from 20 coaggregates from three replicate wells were pooled and graphed on a histogram with bin sizes of 10%. Selected clusters were also photographed using confocal microscopy. S180 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding wild-type E-cadherin (S180L), the mutant with the His-Ala-Val sequence inverted to Val-Ala-His (HAV/VAH), and the mutant with deletion of EC1 (ΔI). Three clonal cultures of unmutated E-cadherin transfectants, three clonal cultures of HAV/VAH transfectants, and two clonal cultures of ΔI transfectants were isolated for study. PCR of genomic DNA from each line yielded the expected PCR product. The identity of the transfected construct was confirmed by direct sequencing of the PCR products (data not shown). S180 cells at low density appear spindle-shaped, usually with filopodia spreading on substrate. When the culture reaches confluence, the cells become packed together, forming more than one layer of cells. S180 cells transfected with E-cadherin (S180L) retain the tendency to form multiple layers, but the layers tend to be sheets of cells that are connected through cadherin-mediated adhesion. Immunofluorescence reveals that wild-type E-cadherin localizes to the plasma membrane at sites of cell-cell interaction (Fig. 1 C). Contact regions are somewhat flattened with distinctive spikes of concentrated staining that indicate deep intercalation of the apposing adhesive membranes, as described previously for another S180 E-cadherin-transfected cell line (13Mege R.M. Matsuzaki F. Gallin W.J. Goldberg J.I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S."
https://openalex.org/W2163035676,"The pattern of DNA methylation established during embryonic development is necessary for the control of gene expression and is preserved during the replicative process. DNA regions of about 1-2 kb in size, termed CpG islands and located mostly in the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, are protected from methylation, despite being about 6-10 times richer in the dinucleotide CpG than the rest of DNA. Their unmethylated state guarantees the expression of the corresponding housekeeping genes. At present, the mechanism by which CpG islands remain protected from methylation is not clear. However, some results suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, an enzymatic process that introduces a postsynthetic modification onto chromatin proteins, might be involved. Here we show in L929 mouse fibroblast cells that inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase(s) at different cell-cycle phases increases the mRNA and protein levels of the major maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) in G1/S border. Increase of DNMT1 results in a premature PCNA-DNMT1 complex formation, which facilitates robust maintenance, as well as de novo DNA methylation processes during the G1/S border, which leads to abnormal hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2106435904,"Understanding the basis for differences in nutrient requirements and for nutrient effects on health and performance requires an appreciation of the links between nutrition and gene expression. We developed and applied molecular probes to characterize diet-associated postabsorptive hepatic gene expression in growing pigs chronically fed protein-restricted diets based on either casein (CAS) or soy protein isolate (SPI). Eighty-eight expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were identified on the basis of diet-related changes in expression, by using an mRNA differential display method. Expression profiling based on transcription analysis by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that the SPI diet significantly changed the pattern of gene expression as compared with the CAS diet and allowed identification of coregulated genes. The expression of six genes involved in the metabolism of stress response (glutathione S-transferase, peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase, apolipoprotein A-I, organic anion transport polypeptide 2, calnexin, heat shock transcription factor 1) exhibited significant changes in the transcription level and indicated an increased oxidative stress response in pigs fed the SPI diet. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data of all 33 ESTs analyzed across 14 pigs fed the two different diets resulted in clustering of genes related to the oxidative stress response with genes related to the regulation of gene expression and neuronal signaling."

Clara cell secretory protein CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein surfactant protein hepatocyte nuclear factor Lung development is initiated when the lung bud evaginates from the ventral wall of the anterior foregut endoderm (1Ten Have-Opbroek A.A. Am. J. Anat. 1981; 162: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal tissue interaction with the lung bud induces a series of repeated branchings to establish the epithelially lined airways. As development proceeds, regional differentiation along the airway epithelium results in multiple cell types such as alveolar type I and type II cells and bronchiolar Clara cells. Differentiation is accompanied by expression of differentiation markers such as the pulmonary surfactant proteins-A, -B, and -D and the Clara cell secretory protein/secretoglobin 1a1 (CCSP/Scgb1a1).1 Regulation of lung gene expression is intricate and involves a complex interplay between different transcription factors to promote tissue and cell-specific gene expression. Increasing evidence suggests that members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family are important regulators of lung gene expression (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O.

All members of the C/EBP family have a similar basic region DNA-binding motif, whereas the NH2-terminal transactivation domain is more diverse. C/EBPα, the first cloned C/EBP family member, exhibits a tissue-specific expression pattern with the highest expression levels in liver, adipose tissue, and lung. In line with this pattern of expression, numerous studies have indicated a role for C/EBPα as an important regulator of adipose differentiation and liver-specific gene expression. Studies in mice lacking expression of C/EBPα revealed that C/EBPα is necessary to maintain normal cellular differentiation in the lung epithelium during embryogenesis (10Wang N.D. Finegold M.J.

In the lung, C/EBPα is expressed in the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and has been demonstrated to transactivate lung-expressed genes such as CCSP (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O.

During embryogenesis, the expression of C/EBPα is first detected in the later stages of lung development. In rat, C/EBPα is first detected around embryonic day (E) 18 (14), and studies in mouse have revealed a similar expression pattern. 2T. Berg and M. Nord, unpublished results. 2T. Berg and M. Nord, unpublished results. The temporal expression pattern of C/EBPα suggests that this transcription factor could be involved in the initiation of expression of lung-specific differentiation markers such as SP-A and CCSP. In addition to C/EBPα, several other transcription factors are involved in lung-specific gene expression including hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-3α and -3β, and the homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2.1 (also known as thyroid transcription factor-1 or T/EBP). Nkx2.1 is expressed throughout the lung epithelium (15Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is an important regulator of lung development as demonstrated in the Nkx2.1 (−/−) mice that exhibit a severely abnormal lung phenotype (16Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 17Minoo P., Su, G. Drum H. Bringas P. Kimura S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In line with these data, Nkx2.1 has been shown to activate transcription of most lung-specific genes, including the genes for SP-A, -B, and -C, and CCSP (18Bohinski R.J., Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 19Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2056-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse CCSP gene is specifically expressed in the lung epithelium at high levels. Its expression is controlled by multiple transcription factors including HNF-3, Nkx2.1, and C/EBP factors (22Nord M. Cassel T.N. Braun H. Suske G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).CCSP exhibits a differentiation-dependent expression pattern and is turned on late in lung development, in mouse around embryonic day E17 (23Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W. De Vries E.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1993; 26: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, CCSP provides a good model to study lung-specific gene expression and the interplay between lung-enriched transcription factors as well as the action of these transcription factors during lung morphogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα, but not the related family member C/EBPδ, synergistically transactivate the CCSP gene. We demonstrate that C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 act on cis-acting elements in the proximal CCSP promoter. The ability of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 to act synergistically is specified by transactivation domains in the NH2-terminal part of both factors. Our results suggest that the cooperative action of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 is a major determinant for the differentiation-dependent lung-specific expression of theCCSP gene. Plasmids were maintained in bacterial strains MC1061/P3 for all pcDNAI-based cytomegalovirus-driven expression vectors and XL-1-Blue for all other plasmids. The insect expression vectors pPAC-Nkx2.1 and pPAC-HNF-3α have been described previously (24Braun H. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9821-9828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The insect expression plasmid for wild-type C/EBPα, pGAC-C/EBPα, has been described previously (25Lee Y.H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalez F.J. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insect expression vector pPAC-C/EBPδ was constructed by cleaving pCMV-C/EBPδ (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with BamHI andEcoRI. BamHI linkers were ligated to the C/EBPδ cDNA and the resulting fragment was subcloned into theBamHI site of the pPAC expression vector. The pcDNAI expression vectors for C/EBPα 5′ deletion mutants have been previously described (26Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Construction of insect expression vectors for C/EBPα deletion mutants was performed by cleavage of the respective pcDNAI vector with HindIII/XbaI restriction enzymes. Subsequently, each fragment corresponding to cDNA for C/EBPα deletion mutants was incubated with Klenow fragment (Amersham Biosciences) and dNTPs (40 μmof each). BglII linkers were ligated to the blunt-ended cDNAs and fragments were subcloned into the BamHI site of the pGAC insect expression plasmid. No significant difference in expression levels between the insect expression vectors pPAC and pGAC was observed. The Nkx2.1 deletion mutant D1-93 was constructed by subcloning appropriate PCR-derived fragments into the BamHI site of pPAC. The 5′ deletion mutant was preceded by a methionine codon and a Kozak translation initiation sequence. The upper primer used was 5′-CGGGATCCGCCACCATGGAGCTGCCACCTTACCAGGACAC-3′ (ATG start codon underlined) and the lower primer used was 5′-CGGGATCCCTATCACD46–152CGACCATAAAGCAAGG-3′. The internal deletion mutant (AspD6–152) was constructed by PCR using primers excluding amino acids 46–152 of Nkx2.1. Thus, the internally deleted fragment was replaced by a SmaI linker encoding proline and glycine. The primers used were: 5′-TCCCCCGGGGGCCGCCTGGCCCTGTCTGTAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGCCCAGCGCACCCCGCCGGAAGC-3′. Substitution of the C/EBPδ NH2-terminal transactivation domain with that of C/EBPα was done by cleaving the plasmid pPAC-C/EBPδ with restriction enzymesBspEI and BamHI to excise the 3′ basic-leucine zipper domain of C/EBPδ and by cleaving pGAC-C/EBPα with the restriction enzymes BamHI and MluI to excise the 5′ NH2-terminal transactivation domain of C/EBPα. Subsequently, these fragments were ligated and subcloned into the empty pGAC expression vector. The resulting construct, encoding a C/EBPα-C/EBPδ swap mutant, replaces amino acids 1–186 of C/EBPδ with amino acids 1–192 of C/EBPα. The wild-type CCSPpromoter-reporter gene constructs and the construct with mutated C/EBP-binding sites have been described previously (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Nkx2.1-binding site mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows (complementary strands are not shown, mutated bases are underlined): distal Nkx2.1 site mutation, 5′-CCAAGTAAATAATGCAATCTCGACCTGGGAGCGCAATCACTGCCC-3′; proximal Nkx2.1 site mutation, 5′-CACTGCCCTCTACCCAGGTCGGGCTGCAAGGAACATATAAAAAGCC-3′. For the mutation of both Nkx2.1 sites, the plasmid with the proximal site mutation was subsequently mutated with the distal site mutation oligonucleotides. Following site-directed mutagenesis, the mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (insect cell qualified; Invitrogen) at 27 °C. COS-1 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All medium were supplemented withl-glutamine and antibiotics. For transient transfection experiments, SL2 cells were seeded in 60-mm diameter cell culture dishes as described (27Suske G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 130: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected using the calcium-phosphate method essentially as described by DiNocera and Dawid (28Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 4.2 × 106 cells/dish. Every dish received 8 μg of DNA including 4 μg of reporter plasmid and 2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid p97b as an internal reference. Variable amounts of expression plasmid were compensated by the addition of the empty pPAC expression vector. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h prior to changing medium. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transient transfections of COS-1 cells for overexpression of C/EBP factors were carried out using the DEAE-dextran method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 2 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's transfection medium containing 20 μg of C/EBPα, C/EBPδ, or Nkx2.1 expression plasmids and 500 μg of DEAE dextran. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein concentrations were assayed by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method (Pierce). Whole cell extracts from SL2 cells for Western blot experiments were prepared as described (30Patrone C. Gianazza E. Santagati S. Agrati P. Maggi A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 835-841PubMed Google Scholar) and protein concentrations were determined as described above. Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 2 × 104 cpm of oligonucleotide probe along with nuclear protein (1–8 μg) in binding buffer as described by Casselet al. (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (final salt concentration 80 mm NaCl and 40 mm KCl) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were preincubated in binding buffer for 15 min at room temperature prior to addition of the labeled probe. In competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction. The sequence of the oligonucleotides used were (complementary strands not shown, mutated bases underlined): wild-type, 5′-AGCTTAGTAAATAATGCAATCTCCTAAGTGGAGCGCAATCACTGCCCTCTACCTCTTGTGGGCTGCAAA-3′; C/EBP-binding sites mutated, 5′-AGCTTAGTAAATAATACCGTCTCCTAAGTGGAGCACCGTCACTGCCCTCTACCTCTTGTGGGCTGCAAA-3′, Nkx2.1-binding sites mutated, 5′-AGCTTAGTAAATAATGCAATCTCGACCTGGGAGCGCAATCACTGCCCTCTACCCAGGTCGGGCTGCAAA-3′. In the case of antibody supershift assays, 1 μl of antiserum or preimmune serum was added. Polyclonal antibodies to C/EBPα and C/EBPδ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a pre-electrophoresed, nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE as running buffer. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. For investigation of the expression levels of C/EBPα deletion mutants, 30 μg of whole cell proteins from the respective transfected SL2 cells were separated through a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by electroblotting. The filter was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween (TBS/Tween) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TBS/Tween, and subsequently incubated with primary C/EBPα antibody at a dilution of 1:3000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. After three additional washing steps, bound primary antibody was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) using a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Previous studies have identifiedcis-elements within the first 172 bp of the proximalCCSP promoter that confer lung cell specificity. The transcription factors Nkx2.1, HNF-3α, C/EBPα, and C/EBPδ, can act through this region (22Nord M. Cassel T.N. Braun H. Suske G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 923: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). To further investigate the action of these transcription factors on the CCSPpromoter, we performed transfections in Drosophila SL2 cells. These cells lack many mammalian transcription factor homologues and are thus a useful tool to study the activity of transcription factors on mammalian promoters (27Suske G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 130: 175-187PubMed Google Scholar). Nkx2.1 activated theCCSP promoter 3.5-fold, whereas HNF-3α, C/EBPα, or C/EBPδ were almost inactive (Fig. 1 B). In pairwise co-transfections, a strong synergistic activity was seen between C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 that reached a 54-fold induction of the reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). All other combinations of transcription factors resulted in levels of transactivation that were approximately additive except for C/EBPα and C/EBPδ that exhibited a slightly more than additive transactivation (Fig. 1 B). The finding that C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 synergistically transactivate theCCSP promoter led us to perform further transfection studies with different amounts of expression plasmid for these transcription factors. Increasing amounts of transfected C/EBPα expression plasmid, along with 2000 ng of Nkx2.1 expression plasmid, activated theCCSP promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A), whereas C/EBPα on its own was inactive even at highest DNA levels (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of C/EBPα, Nkx2.1 stimulated the CCSPpromoter already at 50 ng of Nkx2.1 expression plasmid (Fig.2 B). The highest stimulation was obtained with 1000 ng of Nkx2.1 expression plasmid (up to 12.5-fold over the preservative value of Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα alone) (Fig. 2 B). In summary, these data show that high level activation of the CCSP promoter is dependent on the simultaneous presence of Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα.Figure 2Titration of Nkx2.1 and C/EBP α for synergistic activity on the CCSP promoter. A, increasing amounts of expression plasmids for C/EBPα were cotransfected inDrosophila SL2 cells with or without 2 μg of expression plasmid for Nkx2.1 along with the CCSP promoter reporter-plasmid (−172 bp to +7 bp). B, increasing amounts of expression plasmids for Nkx2.1 were cotransfected in the absence or presence of 500 ng of expression plasmid for C/EBPα along with theCCSP promoter-reporter plasmid. Luciferase activities were normalized against β-galactosidase activity. The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant. The values represent the averages of at least three independent experiments. Error barsindicate ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Studies in transgenic mice have revealed that additional Nkx2.1-binding sites reside further upstream in the CCSP promoter (21Ray M.K. Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. DeMayo F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2056-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the relevance of these upstream Nkx2.1-binding sites for the synergistic activity with C/EBPα, we performed transient transfections in SL2 cells with a reporter plasmid containing 2.1 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the endogenous CCSP promoter. Activation of the −2.1-kb CCSP promoter fragment by Nkx2.1 or C/EBPα on their own, was 7.1- and 1.5-fold, respectively (S.D. 0.78 and 0.33, respectively). When Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα expression plasmids were transfected together, the induction of the reporter gene reached 47.4-fold (S.D. 4.0). Thus, the synergy conferred by Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα is essentially the same as with the shorter CCSPpromoter construct. The somewhat higher transactivation by Nkx2.1 on its own on the longer −2.1-kb CCSP promoter as compared with the −172-bp CCSP promoter, likely reflects the action of Nkx2.1 through the more promoter-distal sites previously described (21Ray M.K. Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. DeMayo F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2056-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these data we conclude that sequences within the first −172 bp of the CCSP promoter are sufficient for full synergistic activation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1. We next investigated whether the C/EBP- and Nkx2.1-binding sites present in the proximal CCSP promoter are essential for the synergistic activation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1. We performed transient transfections using the −172 bp CCSP promoter with mutated C/EBP-binding sites or mutated Nkx2.1-binding sites (Fig.3). Inactivation of the proximal or distal C/EBP-binding site resulted in significantly reduced transactivation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 as compared with the wild-type promoter (Fig. 3). When both C/EBP-binding sites were mutated, activation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 together was 9-fold, whereas the induction by Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα on their own was 3- and 1-fold, respectively, representing a more than additive induction. More than additive induction was also observed when submaximal levels of expression vectors were used (data not shown). Possibly, Nkx2.1 recruits C/EBPα to the CCSP promoter, perhaps via a direct protein-protein interaction. However, we did not detect any strong direct protein-protein interaction of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 in pull-down experiments (data not shown). Alternatively, interaction between Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα might be mediated by additional factors present in the cells. Inactivation of the proximal or distal Nkx2.1-binding site resulted in significantly reduced transactivation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 as compared with the wild-type promoter (Fig. 3). Inactivation of the distal Nkx2.1 site had a stronger effect than inactivation of the proximal site, however, synergistic activity was still observed. When both Nkx2.1-binding sites were inactivated, synergy was abolished. In summary, this demonstrates the requirement of both the C/EBP- and Nkx2.1-binding sites in mediating the synergistic transactivation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1. The C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 sites in theCCSP promoter are located in close proximity to each other (see Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 are capable of simultaneous binding to their respective adjacent sites, a 58-bp oligonucleotide, spanning −94 bp to −36 bp of theCCSP promoter and including both C/EBP-binding sites and the Nkx2.1-binding site (Fig. 4 A) was incubated in the presence of nuclear extracts from COS-1 cells, transiently transfected with expression plasmids for Nkx2.1 or C/EBPα or with mock DNA. Prominent complexes were detected in the presence of both C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and5, respectively). Upon the inclusion of the respective antibody, these complexes were efficiently abolished and supershifts appeared (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 6, respectively). In the presence of both C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 containing nuclear extracts, a strong slowly migrating shift appeared (Fig.4 A, lane 7, marked with an arrowhead) as compared with C/EBPα alone (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The appearance of the strong shift was accompanied by the loss of the Nkx2.1 shift (Fig. 4 A, lane 7), suggesting that a majority of the Nkx2.1 molecules bind together with C/EBPα. Inclusion of Nkx2.1 or C/EBPα antibodies in the presence of both Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα containing nuclear extracts, resulted in a supershift of the slow migrating complex (Fig. 4 A,lane 8 and 9, respectively). These results suggest that the slow migrating complex represent simultaneous binding of Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα. Inclusion of increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotide abolished all complexes formed in the presence of both C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 containing nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 B,lanes 2–4). Competition with an oligonucleotide with the C/EBP-binding sites intact and the Nkx2.1 sites mutated, abolished the C/EBPα containing complex as well as the slowly migrating complex representing simultaneous binding of Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα, but left the Nkx2.1-containing complex intact (Fig. 4 B, lane 7). When higher amounts of competing oligonucleotide were included, the Nkx2.1 containing complex was reduced as well (Fig.4 B, lane 8). Competition with an oligonucleotide with intact Nkx2.1-binding sites and mutations in the C/EBP sites did not affect the C/EBPα containing complex and reduced, but did not abolish, the slowly migrating Nkx2.1·C/EBPα complex (Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6). Formation of the slowly migrating Nkx2.1·C/EBPα complex even though excess of competing unlabeled oligonucleotide was included (Fig. 4 B,lanes 5 and 6), indicates that Nkx2.1 binds stronger to the CCSP promoter together with C/EBPα than alone. A possible explanation for this could be a protein-protein interaction between the two factors. In conclusion, these results show that C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 can bind simultaneously to the proximalCCSP promoter and suggest that the two transcription factors interact. Earlier studies have demonstrated that C/EBPα contains three separate transactivation domains termed TEI, TEII, and TEIII (26Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of these domains for the synergy with Nkx2.1, we used a series of C/EBPα deletion mutants in transient transfections together with Nkx2.1. As shown in Fig.5 A, deletion of the first 11 NH2-terminal amino acids of C/EBPα did not significantly affect the synergy with Nkx2.1. When amino acids 1–70 of C/EBPα were deleted, removing TEI, a significant decrease of synergistic activity with Nkx2.1 was detected and the maximal induction of the reporter gene reached 26-fold, an ∼50% decrease. Removal of amino acids 1–96 and thus TEII further decreased the transactivation potential of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1. When additional amino acids were deleted, synergy was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5 A). The expression level of the C/EBPα deletion mutants was controlled by Western blot analyses. All mutants were expressed at similar levels (Fig.5 B). In summary, these results indicate that further amino acids outside the previously characterized TEI and TEII are necessary for full synergy between C/EBPα and Nkx2.1. However, the predominant synergistic activity stems from TEI and TEII. C/EBPα and C/EBPδ are highly similar in the DNA-binding basic region and dimerization of the leucine zipper domain. Consequently, C/EBP proteins bind to similar cis-acting elements (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 32Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). C/EBPα and C/EBPδ interact with similar efficiency to each of the two C/EBP-binding sites of the proximal CCSP promoter and both are expressed in lung (2Cassel T.N. Nordlund-Moller L. Andersson O. Gustafsson J.A. Nord M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, C/EBPα and C/EBPδ differ significantly in the NH2-terminal transactivation domain. This confers differences in target gene activation as exemplified by our finding that C/EBPδ does not act synergistically with Nkx2.1 (Fig. 1 B). To test if the C/EBPα NH2-terminal transactivation domain is sufficient to give synergy with Nkx2.1, we constructed a C/EBPα-C/EBPδ swap mutant. Nkx2.1, together with a mutant protein containing the C/EBPα transactivation domain fused to the C/EBPδ basic region-leucine zipper domain synergistically activated the CCSP promoter with equal efficiency as wild-type C/EBPα (Fig.6). This result, together with the data from the C/EBPα deletion studies, shows that the synergistic activation of the CCSP promoter by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 is dependent on transactivation domains present in the NH2-terminal part of C/EBPα. A transactivation domain of Nkx2.1 is located at the NH2-terminal region between amino acid residues 51 and 123 (33De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Tell G. Perrone L. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Pucillo C., De Felice M. Acquaviva R. Formisano S. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this transactivation domain in the synergistic activity with C/EBPα, we constructed two Nkx2.1 deletion mutants lacking amino acid residues 1–92 and 46–152, respectively. As shown in Fig.7 A, the deletion of amino acid residues 1–92 of Nkx2.1 affected synergy with C/EBPα to a minor extent. Maximal induction reached 32-fold, representing a 40% decrease in synergistic activity. When performing transient transfections with the Nkx2.1 deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 46–152, however, the synergistic activity with C/EBPα was completely abolished (Fig. 7 A). The expression levels of the wild-type and mutant Nkx2.1 protein were examined with electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a Nkx2.1 consensus binding site and were found to be similar (Fig. 7 B). These results show that the transactivation domain(s) in the NH2-terminal part of Nkx2.1 is vital to give full synergistic activity with C/EBPα. Regulation of eukaryotic transcription is intricate and involves a variety of transcription factors to promote tissue- and cell-specific expression of a given gene. During development, the exact temporal and spatial expression of transcription factors are imperative steps to control the differentiation of multipotential progenitors into specialized cell types. A variety of transcription factors, including HNF-3α and -β, C/EBPα, C/EBPδ, and Nkx2.1, have been shown to be important for lung-specific gene expression (35Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Mendelson C.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 875-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Currently, less is known of how lung-enriched transcription factors act together to control cell differentiation and differentiation-dependent gene expression in the lung epithelium (37Liu C.

The importance of Nkx2.1 for normal lung development was demonstrated in the Nkx2.1 (−/−) mice (16Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

These mice exhibit severe abnormalities in lung morphogenesis. The lungs completely fail to undergo branching morphogenesis. In addition, epithelial cell differentiation is severely impaired as expression of the differentiation markers SP-A and CCSP is absent in the mutant lungs (17Minoo P., Su, G. Drum H. Bringas P. Kimura S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). An impaired cellular differentiation in Nkx2.1 (−/−) mice is in line with previous studies suggesting an important role for Nkx2.1 in the gene regulation of SP-A andCCSP (19Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 21Ray M.K. Chen C.Y. Schwartz R.J. DeMayo F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2056-2064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both genes start being expressed late in lung development, correlating to the extensive cellular differentiation that takes place during this period (35Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Mendelson C.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 875-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, as the expression of Nkx2.1 is confined to epithelial cells from an early time point of lung morphogenesis and is sustained through development (15Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), additional transcription factors are likely to be important to promote the extensive differentiation program of late lung development. The importance of C/EBPα in lung development was demonstrated in C/EBPα (−/−) mice, which have morphological abnormalities with hyperproliferation of alveolar type II cells (11Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). That C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 synergistically transactivate the lung-specific CCSPgene suggests that combinatorial action of these two transcription factors is vital for high level expression of CCSP. Following this, the developmental expression patterns of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 could explain the differentiation-dependent expression pattern of CCSP during lung development. In rat developing lung, C/EBPα expression is detected from embryonic day 18 in temporal connection to the initiation of epithelial differentiation (14Li F. Rosenberg E. Smith C.I. Notarfrancesco K. Reisher S.R. Shuman H. Feinstein S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L241-L247PubMed Google Scholar) and high level expression of CCSP (39Nord M. Andersson O. Brönnegård M. Lund J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). A similar expression pattern of these proteins is seen in mice (23Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W. De Vries E.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1993; 26: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).2 The strong synergy between C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 in the regulation ofCCSP suggests that the onset of C/EBPα expression in the developing lung is the key to high level expression of CCSP (Fig. 8). Based on our data, together with the results of targeted inactivation of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1, we hypothesize that Nkx2.1 serves to specify lung epithelial cell lineage early in lung development and regulates lung-specific gene expression. C/EBPα has its main role in late development to serve as a regulator of cellular differentiation and proliferation, and thus governs differentiation-dependent gene expression. A gene such asCCSP, which is specifically expressed in the lung epithelium and exhibits a differentiation-dependent expression pattern, would then be predicted to require the simultaneous presence of Nkx2.1 and C/EBPα to be highly expressed (Fig. 8). One concern in regard to the hypothesis that C/EBPα is a major determinant of high level CCSP expression is the results from theC/ebpα (−/−) mice. Although these mice exhibit a phenotype related to a defective control of proliferation, the expression pattern of CCSP and other differentiation markers was seemingly unaltered at the time of birth (11Flodby P. Barlow C. Kylefjord H. Ahrlund-Richter L. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24753-24760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, there are several potential explanations for this discrepancy in relation to the results of this study. The levels of CCSP have not reached adult levels at the time of birth and adult levels are not reached until several days postnatally (23Ten Have-Opbroek A.A.W. De Vries E.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1993; 26: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following this, it is possible that the major C/EBPα action takes place after birth. In addition, the expression levels of CCSP were measured using in situ hybridization, making quantitation of the expression ambiguous. 3P. Flodby, personal communication. Another possible explanation is the action of additional C/EBP factors in the lung epithelium. In addition to C/EBPα, we have demonstrated that C/EBPβ can act together with Nkx2.1 to synergistically transactivate theCCSP promoter.4 C/EBPβ is also expressed in the lung epithelium (40Sugahara K. Sadohara T. Sugita M. Iyama K. Takiguchi M. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 297: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), however, the C/EBPβ/Nkx2.1-mediated synergistic activation of CCSP expression was lower than that of C/EBPα/Nkx2.1. 4T. N. Cassel and M. Nord, unpublished results. These results suggest that C/EBPβ, in addition to C/EBPα, may play a role in the regulation of CCSP and also suggest that the CCSP expression seen in C/ebpα (−/−) mice could stem from C/EBPβ transactivation. In other tissues, the interplay between different members of the C/EBP transcription factors and their expression during tissue development appears to be a complex process. An overlapping role for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ has been demonstrated in genetically modified mice in which C/EBPβ is expressed from theC/ebpα locus (41Chen S.S. Chen J.F. Johnson P.F. Muppala V. Lee Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7292-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In these mice, C/EBPβ can functionally replace C/EBPα in liver, supporting an overlapping role for these transcription factors. The question how different members of a family of transcription factors, which display similar or identical DNA-binding specificity, are able to regulate distinct sets of target genes is an important part in the study of promoter-specific transcription factors. In this study, we demonstrate that C/EBPα, but not C/EBPδ, is capable of synergistic transactivation with Nkx2.1. The inability of C/EBPδ to act synergistically with Nkx2.1 results from differences of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain compared with C/EBPα. This was demonstrated with the C/EBPα-C/EBPδ swap mutant, showing that a hybrid protein containing the C/EBPα transactivation domain and the C/EBPδ DNA-binding and dimerization domain, was capable of synergistic action with Nkx2.1. Thus, the ability of C/EBPα to act in synergistic transactivation with Nkx2.1 is specified by the NH2-terminal transactivation domain. From the deletion studies of C/EBPα, we show that the main synergistic activity with Nkx2.1 stems from TEI and TEII of C/EBPα (Fig. 5). TEI and TEII of C/EBPα have previously been shown to be important for interaction with TBP and TFIIB (42Nerlov C. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These domains are not conserved in C/EBPδ (31Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar) explaining the lack of synergy between Nkx2.1 and C/EBPδ. As the individual members within the C/EBP and Nkx2 transcription factor families exhibit similar binding site preferences, promoter-specific activation cannot be explained by the individual action of single factors. In this respect, the synergy of C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 described here provide insight into how promoter specificity is achieved by specific combinatorial action of a subset of transcription factors. In this study, we demonstrate a synergistic transactivation by C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 of the lung-specific CCSP gene. During development, this finding provides an explanation for the onset of high level expression of CCSP as the appearance of C/EBPα in the developing lung epithelium is temporally correlated to extensive cellular differentiation and the expression of CCSP. On the transcriptional regulation level, the synergy between C/EBPα and Nkx2.1 provides an example of how promoter-specific transcription factors act in concert to enhance the rate of transcription. Together, these findings provide insight into the well organized program that coordinates gene transcription in individual cells and during organ formation.

In the case of Tip60 and TAFII250, Tat seems to inhibit their HAT activity and consequently modulate the expression of cellular genes (5Weissman J.D. Brown J.A. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A.

When it interacts with P/CAF, p300/CBP and GCN5, an increase in the transactivator potential of Tat on the HIV-1 LTR has been observed. In this latter case, it has also been shown that Tat is itself a substrate for these HATs (2Col E. Caron C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Gracia J. Favier A. Khochbin S. J. Biol.

Indeed, GCN5 and p300/CBP can acetylate Tat on its lysines 50 (Lys50) and 51 (Lys51) while P/CAF acetylates the viral protein on its lysine 28 (Lys28). The acetylation of these specific lysines on Tat seems to create a signal, which helps Tat in its diverse activities. The acetylation of Lys28 of Tat by P/CAF enhances its interaction with the positive transcription elongation factor complex b (8Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The Tat-mediated recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor complex b and its interaction with the transactivation-responsive region (TAR) RNA enhance the processivity of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex leading to a considerable increase in viral RNA production (reviewed in (10Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar)). The acetylation of Lys50 leads to the dissociation of Tat from TAR (reviewed in Ref. 11Nakatani Y. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 443-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been shown that the acetylation of Lys50 of Tat creates a strong binding site for the P/CAF bromodomain (12Dorr A. Kiermer V. Pedal A. Rackwitz H.R. Henklein P. Schubert U. Zhou M.M. Verdin E. Ott M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Mujtaba S., He, Y. Zeng L. Farooq A. Carlson J.E. Ott M. Verdin E. Zhou M.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this case, the bromodomain of P/CAF effectively competes with the TAR RNA and helps the removal of Tat from TAR. The acetylation of different lysines of Tat therefore appears to create a code reminiscent of the histone code (14Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar, 15Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), finely regulating the activity of the protein. Although the functional significance of Tat acetylation is relatively well understood, the consequence of the interaction of Tat with different HATs on their activities remains obscure. Here we investigated this issue and found that Tat is a general inhibitor of histone acetylation by the cellular HATs. We have also found that in at least one case, that of CBP, Tat controls the choice of its potential substrates. Our data show that Tat, while remaining a substrate for these HATs, inhibits the acetylation of histones but not that of other specific cellular factors. The C-terminal part of Tat was found to be responsible for the selective inhibition of the HAT activity of GCN5 and CBP. These data strongly suggest that Tat largely uses the cellular acetylation signaling system to enhance the viral gene expression and to modulate that of some cellular genes.

Caron C. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) by incubating recombinant HATs with their substrate as mentioned in the legends of the figures, in a 40-μl reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA). Protein acetylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or by “filter binding method”: reactions were loaded on filter paper pieces, washed three times with 50 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 8.5, dried, and counted in scintillation liquid. In vitro acetylation using HeLa nuclear extracts was performed as follows: 25 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts (in vitro transcription grade, Promega) were incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]acetyl-CoA, 1.5 μm purified histones, and 50 ng/ml of trichostatin A (TSA), in the presence of indicated amounts of either GST or GST fused to wild type Tat or Tat mutants. After 30 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and histone acetylation was analyzed by autoradiography. The same amounts of HeLa nuclear extracts and GST or GST-Tat were used to monitor kinase activity in the extracts and the histones in the presence of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a buffer, pH 7.3, containing 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Jurkat cells, seeded at 5.105 cells/ml, were incubated for 20 h with 100 nm GST or GST-Tat and treated 6 h with TSA (50 ng/ml). The cells were then pelleted, washed in PBS, and sonicated in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Equivalent amounts of extracts were used to obtain a Western blot, which was then probed with an anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, with reporter plasmids pGal4-luciferase and p-renilla-luciferase (as an internal control), and expression vectors for Gal4-HATs and Tat as indicated in the legends of Figs. 3 and 6. Luciferase activities (firefly and renilla) were measured on HeLa extracts using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase values were normalized with respect to renilla luciferase values.Figure 6A, the C-terminal domain of Tat is necessary to repress HAT-dependent transcriptional activation in vivo. Gene reporter assays were performed as described in the legend of Fig. 1 C by co-transfecting reporter plamids pG4-TK-Luc, the internal control p-renilla-luc, and 200 ng of expression vector for Gal4-HATs fusion proteins and 200 ng of expression vectors (pCMV-Tat) encoding either wild type (WT) Tat or mutants (M1 and M2).

Beads were incubated (1 h, 4 °C) with 100 μl of a buffer (20% glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 250 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet-P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmacetyl-CoA) containing 5 μg of purified, recombinant GCN5. After three washes in the same buffer, complexes were recovered in gel loading buffer and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then revealed by Western blot using anti-His antibody (Qiagen). An in vitro HAT assay was set up using recombinant GCN5 and CBP, in the presence of GST or increasing amounts of GST-Tat. Tip60, whose HAT activity was previously shown to be inhibited by Tat (6Creaven M. Hans F. Mutskov V. Col E. Caron C. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was used as a control. Fig. 1 shows that GST-Tat, but not GST, greatly reduced the HAT activity not only of Tip60 but also of GCN5 and CBP (Autorad panels). These results suggested that Tat could be a general inhibitor of histone acetylation by nuclear HATs. These data also suggest that Tat may have a dramatic effect on general histone acetylation and prompted us to investigate the effect of Tat on histone acetylation in vivo and in vitro. To investigate whether Tat was capable of interfering with the general cellular HAT activity, a series of experiments was set up. Purified GST-Tat, capable of entering cells, was incubated overnight with Jurkat cells. Cells were then treated 6 h with TSA to inhibit histone deacetylases, and the level of histone acetylation was monitored in the total cell extracts using an anti-acetylated H4 antibody. Fig. 2 A shows that in the presence of Tat, the level of in vivo TSA-induced histone acetylation was significantly lower than that observed in the control cells (two independent experiments are shown, Exp1and Exp2, respectively). These experiments strongly suggested that Tat was also capable of inhibiting the nuclear HAT activity in vivo. The inhibition of general HAT activity by Tat was also confirmed in vitro. HeLa nuclear extracts, competent for in vitro transcription and rich in HAT activity, were used to evaluate the ability of Tat to interfere with the general HAT activity present in the extract. The extracts were incubated with [14C]acetyl-CoA and purified histones in the presence of either recombinant GST-Tat or GST as a control. Fig.2 B shows that Tat interfered with the acetylation of histones by the nuclear HATs present in the extract. To show that this action of Tat was specific on the HATs and not on another unrelated enzymatic activity present in the extract, we tested the effect of Tat on global kinase activity by incubating the extract with [γ-32P]ATP and either GST or GST-Tat (Fig.2 C). Interestingly, Tat seemed to activate or repress the phosphorylation of a few proteins present in the extract but there was no global inhibition of the kinase activities on the nuclear proteins in the presence of Tat. These experiments support the notion that the repression of histone acetylation by Tat is due to a specific action of the viral protein on the nuclear HATs present in the extract. To rule out the possibility of artifacts, we designed two additional experiments. First, Tat is itself a substrate of several HATs including GCN5 and CBP. One could argue that Tat would compete with the histones for acetylation by the HATs and therefore inhibit histone acetylation. To exclude this possibility, we tested the HAT inhibitory effect of a Tat mutated on lysines 50 and 51, the target lysines of both GCN5 and CBP, and compared it with the inhibitory effect of a wild type protein. Fig. 2 D shows that this mutant inhibits the HAT activity of GCN5 (left panel) as well as that present in HeLa nuclear extracts (right panel) as efficiently as the wild type Tat. This result suggests that Tat does not inhibit histone acetylation through a substrate-based competition mechanism. Another reason for the repression of HAT by Tat could be the histone masking effect of Tat. Indeed, a Tat-histone interaction might hinder the access of the enzyme to the histones. This is very unlikely, because in cells or in nuclear extracts, the nonspecific binding of hundreds of other nuclear proteins with Tat would greatly reduce this nonspecific binding of Tat to histones. Nevertheless, to completely exclude this artifact, the interaction of Tat with histones under our HAT assay conditions was investigated. Fig. 2 E shows that histone retention is comparable between GST and GST-Tat and is also identical to the background level of interaction of histones with Sepharose beads alone (lane 1). This experiment rules out the involvement of histone binding by Tat in inhibiting nuclear HAT enzymatic activity. Considering these data, we also predicted that Tat should interfere with the HAT-dependent transcriptional activation in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that the HAT activity of CBP and P/CAF is directly involved in the activation of transcription when these enzymes are targeted to a promoter (16Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Vectors encoding parts of CBP, P/CAF, or GCN5, including their HAT domain, fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid containing five Gal4-binding sites cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter controlling the expression of a luciferase gene (Fig.3 A). As expected, compared with the Gal4-DNA-binding domain alone, the transcription of the reporter gene was activated by the HAT domain of CBP (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 4 and 5) and to a lesser extent by that of P/CAF and GCN5 (compare lane 7 withlane 8 and lane 10 with lane 11). The co-expression of Tat significantly decreased this transcription activation. From these experiments we conclude that Tat is capable of inhibiting the activity of CBP, P/CAF, and GCN5 in vitroas well as in vivo. Since several HATs have been shown to acetylate substrates other than histones, we also monitored the effect of Tat on the protein acetyltransferase activity of these enzymes. CBP appeared as a good candidate because it specifically acetylates several transcription factors such as MyoD (17Polesskaya A. Naguibneva I. Duquet A. Bengal E. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5312-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and p53 (18Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Purified p53 and histones were used as substrates for bacterially expressed CBP in the presence of GST alone or GST-Tat. Fig. 4 Ashows that CBP can efficiently acetylate both histones and p53 (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 3). The addition of GST-Tat specifically inhibited the acetylation of histones while that of p53 remained unaffected (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and5). The ability of CBP to acetylate MyoD in the absence and presence of Tat was also tested. Here again, while Tat efficiently inhibited histone acetylation, it slightly affected the ability of CBP to acetylate MyoD (Fig. 4 A, lane 7). A mixture of p53 and MyoD remained acetylated by CBP in the presence of Tat, while the acetylation of histones was dramatically reduced (Fig.4 A, lane 9). Finally, we have also shown that, while Tat inhibits histone acetylation by CBP, it does not interfere with its own acetylation by this enzyme (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that in the presence of Tat, CBP is able to discriminate between its potential substrates. To have a better insight into the mechanism involved in the Tat-dependent inhibition of histone acetylation by CBP and GCN5, in vitro tests were first used to map the regions of Tat mediating this inhibitory activity. A series of recombinant Tat deletion mutants were tested for their effect on the HAT activity of CBP and GCN5 in an in vitro assay (Fig. 5 A). The results obtained with mutants M1 to M4, harboring progressive C-terminal deletions, showed that a deletion of the C-terminal 86–101 amino acids of Tat (M1 mutant) completely abolished the repression of GCN5 and CBP HAT activities by Tat (Fig. 5 B). The C-terminal domain of Tat seems then involved in the inhibition of these HATs. However, we had shown previously that this domain was dispensable for the Tat-GCN5 interaction and that the amino acids 20–48 region of Tat was necessary and sufficient to interact with GCN5 (2Col E. Caron C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Gracia J. Favier A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28179-28184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To characterize more precisely the respective role of the GCN5-interacting (aa 20–48) and the C-terminal (aa 67–101) domains of Tat in its interaction with GCN5 and in the inhibition of the GCN5 HAT activity, a series of GST-Tat mutant proteins was produced. These mutants are: M5, containing aa 20–48 region of Tat (GCN5-interacting domain); M6, aa 67–101 (HAT inhibitory domain); and M7, aa 20–48 fused to 67–101 (Fig.5 A). A GST pull-down assay confirmed the interaction between Tat aa 20–48 (M5) and GCN5 (Fig. 5 C). A construct containing the C terminus of Tat fused to the GCN5-interacting domain also interacted efficiently with GCN5 (Fig. 5 C,M7). Interestingly, the C-terminal inhibitory domain of Tat did not show any stable interaction with GCN5 (Fig. 5C, M6). A quantitative HAT assay was performed using the GCN5 HAT domain and the GST-Tat mutants described above were tested for their inhibitory effects on histone acetylation by GCN5. Surprisingly, we found that the C-terminal domain of Tat was as efficient as the full-length protein in inhibiting GCN5 (Fig. 5 D, compare M6 toWT) and that the fusion of the GCN5-binding domain of Tat to this inhibitory domain did not increase the inhibition of histone acetylation by GCN5 (Fig. 5 D, M7 mutant). The GCN5 interaction domain of Tat alone could not inhibit histone acetylation by GCN5 (Fig. 5 D, M5 mutant). Taken altogether, these results show that the C-terminal domain of Tat, which is not involved in a stable interaction with GCN5, is necessary and sufficient to repress the HAT activity of GCN5. The in vivo Gal4 targeting test was also used to evaluate the role of the Tat C-terminal domain in interfering with the activities of CBP, P/CAF, and GCN5. Interestingly, in vivo a larger deletion of the C-terminal domain of Tat was necessary to relieve the repressive activity of Tat than in vitro. Indeed, while the full-length Tat and M1 mutant (aa 1–86) repressed the transcriptional activity of CBP, Tat M2 mutant (aa 1–60) was unable to interfere with the CBP activity (Fig.6 A, compare lane 5with lanes 3 and 4). However, for P/CAF and GCN5, the in vivo results approached those obtained in vitro, since the M1 mutant of Tat was not as efficient as the full-length protein in repressing the activity of these enzymes (Fig.6 A, compare lanes 9 and 14 withlanes 8 and 13, respectively). We could also show that in these experiments both M1 and M2 mutants were as efficient as the wild type Tat in inducing HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity (Fig.6 B). These data demonstrate that the two mutants are efficiently produced and, most importantly, that the capacity of Tat to repress histone acetylation by the nuclear HATs is not required for and does not interfere with the Tat-dependent activation from HIV-1 LTR. The recent literature strongly suggests that HIV-1 encoded transactivator, Tat, largely uses the acetylation signaling system to optimally accomplish its various functions. The most studied aspect of this phenomenon is the gain of function by Tat on the HIV LTR, consecutive to its interaction with HATs or to its acetylation. However, Tat seems to also modulate the activity of the cellular HATs, which may in turn control many cellular events regulated by protein acetylation. The present study strengthens this hypothesis by showing the inhibitory effect of Tat on the histone acetyltransferase activity of three specific HATs: Tip60, CBP, and GCN5. Moreover, the general action of Tat on the cellular HATs was further confirmed by demonstrating that Tat could specifically inhibit the use of histones as substrates by these HATs in vitro as well as in vivo. Indeed, Tat is not a mere inhibitor of the catalytic activity of these cellular HATs but is capable of conferring them a substrate specificity. This phenomenon was clearly demonstrated in the case of CBP, which showed a selective inhibition of histone acetylation compared with the non-histone substrates, p53 and MyoD. These observations suggest that Tat may block the access of histones but not of other substrates to the catalytic site of CBP. This hypothesis predicts not only that the inhibitory action of Tat would be dependent on the structure of the substrate but also that Tat may induce a change in the conformation of the targeted enzyme. A modification of the conformation of CBP/p300 by the Tat had also been suggested, since the HAT had a better interaction with the basal transcription factors TBP and TFIIB in the presence of Tat peptide 41–45 (7Deng L. de la Fuente C., Fu, P. Wang L. Donnelly R. Wade J.D. Lambert P., Li, H. Lee C.G. Kashanchi F. Virology. 2000; 277: 278-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this Tat-induced change of conformation may as well be involved in a better recognition of certain substrates by p300/CBP, since in the presence of Tat, the enzyme efficiently acetylates the p50 subunit of NF-kB (19Furia B.

Our investigations show that the C-terminal domain of Tat is involved in the control of the enzymatic activity of the targeted HATs. The same domain has been shown to be involved in the inhibition of histone acetylation by TAFII250 (5Weissman J.D. Brown J.A. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P.A. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this case also, the C-terminal inhibitory region of Tat interacted with a much lower affinity with TAFII250 than the aa 18–36 region of Tat (20Weissman J.D. Hwang J.R. Singer D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Deng and colleagues (7Deng L. de la Fuente C., Fu, P. Wang L. Donnelly R. Wade J.D. Lambert P., Li, H. Lee C.G. Kashanchi F. Virology. 2000; 277: 278-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) have recently reported that Tat had no effect on the acetylation of free histone H4 by p300/CBP. This apparent discrepancy with the results presented here can be explained by our demonstration of the specific involvement of the 15 C-terminal amino acids of Tat in the inhibition of histone acetylation by CBP and GCN5. Indeed, in their studies these authors used a Tat lacking these critical 15 amino acids of Tat 101, which were shown here to be necessary for the inhibition. Interestingly, our data also show that the inhibition of the cellular HAT activity by Tat is not involved in the capacity of Tat to stimulate transcription from HIV-1 5′ LTR. Indeed, M2 Tat mutant lacking the C-terminal HAT-repressor domain is as efficient as the wild type Tat in inducing transcription from the HIV-1 LTR. This observation suggests that the Tat-dependent inhibition of cellular HAT aims at the modulation of cellular gene expression rather than directly controlling viral gene transcription. The ability to induce a general inhibition of histone acetylation has also been reported for several specific viral proteins. Indeed, Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded protein, v-IRF, directly interacts with p300 and suppresses its enzymatic activity on histones, leading to a hypoacetylation of histones H4 and H3 in vivo (21Li M. Damania B. Alvarez X. Ogryzko V. Ozato K. Jung J.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8254-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). p300 is also the target of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded protein EBNA3C. The interaction of the viral protein with p300 leads to the inhibition of p300 HAT activity and consequently to histone hypoacetylation also in vivo (22Cotter M.A. Robertson E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5722-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A hypoacetylation of histone H4 is also induced by the bovine herpes virus-1 VP22 protein (23Ren X. Harms J.S. Splitter G.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8251-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However these studies have not investigated whether, like Tat, these viral proteins were capable of inducing a substrate selectivity. The Tat-induced HAT substrate selectivity described here is not unique, since several papers have also reported that the adenovirus-encoded protein E1A is capable of directly modulating the catalytic activity of several HATs. For instance, in the cases of p300/CBP and P/CAF, E1A not only modulates histone acetylation (24Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Indeed, interestingly, a concentration of E1A able to induce anin vitro acetylation of histones and MyoD by p300/CBP inhibits the acetylation of transcription factors TR/RXR, TFIIEβ, and TFIIF/Rap74 (27Li Q. Imhof A. Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5634-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). E1A also inhibits the p300-mediated acetylation of the transcriptional activators p53 (25Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

The prototypic cyclophilin (cyp18) was isolated as the cellular receptor for the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) (3Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Google Scholar) and shown to be a PPIase (4Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Google Scholar, 5Takahashi N. Hayano T. Suzuki M. Nature. 1989; 337: 473-475Google Scholar). In T cells, CsA exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the calcium-dependent phases of interleukin-2 production (6Schreiber S. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying this immunosuppressive effect involves the binding of the CsA·cyp18 complex to the phosphatase calcineurin (7Friedman J. Weissman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 799-806Google Scholar, 8Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar), which in turn leads to the inhibition of the translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor to the nucleus and prevention of interleukin-2 gene transcription (9Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Google Scholar). Studies have shown that inhibition of the PPIase activity of cyp18 does not mediate immunosuppressive effects (10Snyder S.H. Lai M.M. Burnett P.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 283-294Google Scholar). Since this first discovery, many other family members have been isolated from different tissues and organisms. From bacteria to humans, they are ubiquitously, abundantly expressed and show a very strong conservation of their PPIase domain (1Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Google Scholar, 11Galat A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 149-162Google Scholar). Cyclophilins have been localized in different cell compartments, and their poorly understood functions have been so far linked to multiple cellular processes, such as protein folding (12Schiene C. Fischer G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 40-45Google Scholar), trafficking (13Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Google Scholar), chaperone activity (14Ferreira P.A. Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Google Scholar), oxidative stress response (15Santos A.N. Korber S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Fischer B. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1-7Google Scholar), and functional arrangement of components within receptor complexes (16Schiene-Fischer C. Yu C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 1-6Google Scholar). The abundance and ubiquitous expression of these proteins have suggested that their function might be pleiotropic, but a growing body of evidence points toward the fact that different cyclophilins function in a restricted and specific manner. For instance, their specific localization in different cellular compartments might be an indication of their specificity of substrate and function. The specific function of a given cyclophilin will depend not only on its PPIase domain structure but also on the composition of the surrounding segments, which will dictate its cellular localization and interaction with partners. Structural and experimental studies of these polypeptidic domains will be of great interest in the understanding of the functional regulation of cyclophilins. This may make it possible to link a particular cyclophilin to a given signal transduction pathway. For example, cyp18, which does not span behind the PPIase domain, is predominantly cytoplasmic (11Galat A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 149-162Google Scholar). Some others, like human cyp23 and cyp22 possess, respectively, secretory and mitochondrial targeting signal peptides (1Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Google Scholar). Another cyclophilin, Drosophila ninaA, a membrane protein localized in the secretory pathway, is responsible of the correct folding of rhodopsins in the compound eye (13Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Google Scholar). The structure of ninaA is in coherence with its localization, because to its PPIase domain is attached an N-terminal signal peptide and a very hydrophobic C-terminal tail. Another subfamily of cyclophilins gather cyp40-like proteins (17Kieffer L.J. Thalhammer T. Handschumacher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5503-5507Google Scholar), which are conserved from yeast to humans. Their PPIase domain is extended by a protein-protein interaction domain containing tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats and a calmodulin binding sequence. Through its TPR domain, Cyp40 associates with the inactive unliganded steroid receptor·Hsp90 chaperone complex (18Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Google Scholar). What about the nucleus? Nup358 cyclophilin belongs to the nuclear pore complex and seems to take part in the trafficking of macromolecules (19Wu J. Matunis M. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Google Scholar). This very large nucleoporin, including Ran-binding domains, bears the PPIase domain at its C terminus. Other nuclear cyclophilins have been suspected to play a role in RNA metabolism. For instance, cyp33, isolated from human T cells, which contains an RNA-binding domain in addition to its PPIase active site, has been shown to bind poly(A) or poly(U) polyribonucleotides (20Mi H. Kops O. Zimmermann E. Jaschke A. Tropschug M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 201-205Google Scholar). The human srcyp (21Nestel F.P. Colwill K. Harper S. Pawson T. Anderson S.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8183-8192Google Scholar) are other examples of cyclophilins suspected to play a role in RNA processing. In keeping with their nuclear localization, these cyclophilins bear multiple NLS within their long positively charged C-terminal tails. We report the cloning and characterization of Moca-cyp, a newDrosophila melanogaster nuclear cyclophilin. This protein belongs to a subfamily of large cyclophilins, found in multicellular eukaryotic organisms of the animal kingdom. Specific structural and enzymatic features defining this subfamily are described within this report. The expression of Moca-cyp is regulated duringDrosophila embryogenesis. We also show the existence of a variant Moca-cyp cDNA corresponding to an alternatively spliced mRNA. Finally, we discuss the potential implication of this family of cyclophilins in the regulation of transcription and/or splicing. The recombinant plasmid pGEX-dCBP/CH3 was constructed, using the following procedures: poly(A)+ mRNAs purified (Quick Prep micro purification kit, AmershamBiosciences) from Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells (24Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365Google Scholar) were reverse transcribed (RT) using the murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) and random primer d(N)6 (New England BioLabs). RT products were PCR-amplified using a set ofDrosophila CBP (dCBP) (25Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.-X. Nonaka M. Smolik s.M. Armstrong S. Goodman R.H. Ishii S. Nature. 1997; 386: 735-738Google Scholar) gene-specific primers, 5′-TGAAGTCAGCGGCGATGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCACCTGTTGGCT-3′ extended, respectively, with EcoR1 and BglII cloning sites. The 998-bp-amplified dCBP fragment (nucleotides 6892–7890 of published cDNA sequence (25Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.-X. Nonaka M. Smolik s.M. Armstrong S. Goodman R.H. Ishii S. Nature. 1997; 386: 735-738Google Scholar)) was digested with EcoR1 andBglII restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs) and ligated to the same cloning sites of pBluescriptSK(−) (Stratagene). The recombinant plasmid pBlue31.9, thus obtained, was used for the construction of GST fusion expression plasmid. Briefly, after digestion with Msc1 (in the cDNA) and NotI (in the vector) enzymes, the dCBP fragment (nucleotides 7365–7890 of published cDNA sequence (25Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.-X. Nonaka M. Smolik s.M. Armstrong S. Goodman R.H. Ishii S. Nature. 1997; 386: 735-738Google Scholar)) was released, from pBlue31.9 plasmid, Klenow-treated and cloned into SmaI cloning site of pGEX2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant plasmid pGEX-dCBP/CH3, thus obtained, was used for fusion protein production and radiolabeling as described previously (26Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Google Scholar). Plasmids pBluescript814 and pBluescript532 (respectively, nucleotides 2046–3177 and nucleotides 40–3177 of Moca-cypcDNA) are in vivo excision products of recombinant phages lambdaZAP-814 and lambdaZAP-532 (according to the Stratagenein vivo excision procedure) isolated by cDNA library screening (see below). By inserting the XbaI-BamH1 polylinker fragment of pET-19 vector (Novagen) into the same cloning sites of pBluescript814, a translation initiation codon (ATG) was added to the 5′-end of the partial Moca-cyp cDNA 814. The new recombinant plasmid pMet814 was used for in vitrotranscription and translation experiments. p814ES is a recombinant pBluescript plasmid containing an EcoR1-SpeI fragment of Moca-cyp cDNA (nucleotides 2046–2552). The pSKPCR2–532 plasmid was constructed for whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization probe preparation. Briefly, a 826-bp fragment of Moca-cyp (encompassing nucleotides 1337–2163) was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers 5′-CATGCCAGCACTTACGGTG-3′ and 5′-GGTGAATCGTCACGCTTCC-3′. Then the fragment was purified, Klenow-treated, and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript plasmid. For in vivo inducible expression analysis, pBluescript532 was digested with Ase1 (in the cDNA), Klenow-treated, and cut with NotI (in the vector). Then, the purified cDNA fragment (nucleotides 40–3001 of Moca-cypcDNA) was ligated to NotI- and XhoI (Klenow-treated)-digested pMTV5-His vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid was called pMTV5-His/Moca-cyp. The recombinant pETcyp532 plasmid (nucleotides 98–691 ofMoca-cyp cDNA) was constructed for PPIase activity measurement. For this purpose, first the PPIase domain of Moca-cyp was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers: 1) (EcoR1-BspH1)-5′-ATGACGGTAAACAAACGCGACGCGGG-3′ and 2) (BamH1-KpnI)-5′-GGAGCGCCTCTTGTGCTTCTTCTC-3′. The PCR fragment was digested with BspH1 andBamH1 and ligated to NcoI and BamH1 cloning sites of pET28a vector (Novagen). Then pETcyp532 plasmid was used to overexpress and purify the cyclophilin domain of Moca-cyp using the following protocol: An overnight culture of Escherichia coli transformed with pET532, was used to inoculate 6 liters of growth media. At an A 600 of ∼0.5, bacteria were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Then bacteria were collected, resuspended in a Tricine buffer (10 mm Tricine, pH 8.2), disrupted using a French press (SLM Aminco), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was passed through a TSK-fractogel SO 3−column (Merck). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (up to 2 m), and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The cyclophilin domain-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against the buffer, and bound to a TSK-affi-blue matrix (Merck). The elution was realized with 2 m KCl. Then fractions containing the cyclophilin domain were pooled and concentrated, and a size exclusion chromatography step was appended (buffer: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The homogeneous protein fractions were pooled and frozen at −80 °C. Any contamination with periplasmic E. coli cypB was avoided, because the first purification step was designed in a way that the chosen pH prevented the binding of cypB to the matrix. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-cypB antibody. For the construction of pGEX2TKL156, a fragment of Moca-cypcDNA (nucleotides 1831–1985) was PCR-amplified and inserted intoEcoR1 and BamH1 sites of pGEX2TKL vector. The recombinant plasmid thus obtained was used for fusion protein production (26Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Google Scholar) and anti-Moca-cyp antibody affinity purification (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Expression screening was performed essentially as described previously (28Kaelin W.G.J. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T., Li, Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Google Scholar), using a lambdaZapII cDNA expression library constructed with 0- to 9-hDrosophila embryo cDNA. The partial cDNA 814 isolated through the first screening was used as a DNA probe for the screening of a lambdaZapII cDNA library constructed with 0- to 24-hDrosophila embryo cDNA. Multiple recombinant clones were isolated, and the clone 532 contained the longest cDNA. Two independent 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of 5′-cloned ends) experiments were realized to clone the 5′-end of Moca-cypcDNA. For the first set of experiments, a cDNA library constructed with 0- to 4-h Drosophila embryo cDNA was used to perform nested PCR amplifications, usingMoca-cyp-specific primers 5′-CGACCTTTGCTTCAGCCTC-3′ and 5′-GTCGCGTTTGTTTACCGTCA-3′ and vector specific primers corresponding to the plasmidic vector pNB40 (29Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 425-437Google Scholar). Independently, a SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), and aMoca-cyp-specific primer 5′-CCCCGGTTGGCCATCGACAGCAGGAAG-3′ were used to isolate the 5′-end of Moca-cyp from S2 poly(A+) mRNA. Sequencing was performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer apparatus. Subsequently, sequences were processed and analyzed using DNASTAR sequence analysis programs. Searches within the non-redundant (NR) data base were performed using BLAST2 and PSI-BLAST programs running at the National Center for Biological Information (NCBI) (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches were carried out using the HMMER package (31Eddy S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Google Scholar). Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) was also used to study protein architecture into domains and to detect distant but significant relationships between compared sequences. HCA combines sequence comparison with secondary structure predictions and is particularly efficient at low levels of sequence identity (typically below 20–25%). Guidelines to the use of HCA were described elsewhere (32Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions were performed using the profile neural network prediction PHD program (33Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Google Scholar). Three-dimensional model was constructed using Modeler-3 (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar), using the experimental structure of the uncomplexed form of Brugia malayi Cyp1 as template (PDB identifier: 1A58). Cytoplasmic RNAs were extracted fromDrosophila S2 cells as described previously (35Modjtahedi N. Lavialle C. Poupon M.-F. Landin R.-M. Cassingena R. Monier R. Brison O. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 4372-4379Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNAs were purified (mRNA purification kit, Amersham Biosciences), resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a ZetaProbe membrane (Bio-Rad) in 0.15 mNH 4+ acetate buffer. After transfer, the membrane was prehybridized for 1 h in Church buffer (36Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar) and then hybridized for 16 h at 65 °C in the same buffer supplemented with the 32P-labeled probe (Megaprime kit, AmershamBiosciences). Then the filter was washed twice with 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) for 15 min at 65 °C and exposed to an autoradiographic film. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and recovered on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (26Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Google Scholar) (Amersham Biosciences). pMet814 and pBluescript532 were in vitro transcribed and translated (TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radiolabeled translation products were incubated with the indicated GST fusion proteins in 400 μl of Net.N supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) for 45 min at 4 °C. After five washes in the same buffer, precipitated proteins were boiled in 1× SB, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography, after EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) treatment of the gel. S2 cells were grown at 20 °C in Schneider media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and transfected using an Invitrogen calcium phosphate transfection kit and protocols. 24 h after transfection, transient expression of pMTV5-His/Moca-cyp was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm CuSO4 to the growth medium for 24–48 h. Pools of stably transfected S2 cells expressing pMTV5-His or pMTV5-His/LacZ or pMTV5-His/Moca-cyp were also established in the presence of 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen, following the supplier's protocols). Rabbit Moca-cyp antiserum SE2382 (Eurogentech) was developed against a synthetic peptide of Moca-cyp extending over amino acids 594–608 (QDNEYRNRYPLSPIR). The affinity purification and elution (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) of anti-Moca-cyp antibodies from SE2382 polyclonal serum was realized using the pGEX2TKL156 fusion protein. Anti-V5 is a purified mouse monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Untransfected and transfected cells were harvested, washed three times with ice-cold TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl), and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in Net.N (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) or EBC (50 mmTris-HCl at pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (20 μg/μl each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmNa3VO4 and 1 mm NaF). Then the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g to pellet cell debris. Proteins present in the supernatant were quantified (Bio-Rad) and then directly resolved by SDS-PAGE after boiling in 1× SB (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol) or subjected to immunoprecipitation and/or Western blot analysis. Nuclear extract was prepared according to Andrews and Faller (37Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 249-256Google Scholar). Drosophila embryo extracts (gift of C. Antoniewski and D. Szymczak) were prepared as follows: Drosophila w1118 eggs collected at different times of embryogenesis were ground (volume to volume) in the cracking buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 4 m urea) and analyzed by Western blot using affinity-purified SE2382 anti-Moca-cyp antibodies. The loading of the samples was controlled by Western blot analysis using the rabbit polyclonal anti-MBF1(a gift of M. Jindra) raised against the constitutively expressed Drosophilamultiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBF1) (M. Jindra, personal communication). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using the following procedure: Indicated antibodies were first pre-adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (40 μl of a 50% slurry, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of NET.N buffer. After three washes in the same buffer, antibody-loaded beads were incubated with 500 μg of cell lysate, for 1 h at 4 °C in a 600-μl incubation volume. Then, beads were washed five times with NET.N buffer, proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SB, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) using Towbin buffer (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) and a liquid electrotransfer device. After transfer, membranes were blocked, in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with sodium azide (0.1%) for 2 h, and then incubated for 16 h at room temperature with the specified primary antibody diluted in the same buffer. After several washes with TBST, the blot was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To measure the specificity of SE2382 polyclonal serum, 50 μg/lane of S2 cell extract were Western blot analyzed using a 1:2500 dilution of the polyclonal serum preincubated or not with 1 mg/ml free antigenic peptide. Stably transfected S2 cells expressing pMTV5-His or pMTV5-His/LacZ or pMTV5-His/Moca-cyp were seeded onto chamber slides (LAB-TEK) in the growth media and induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4. After 24 h of induction, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and then incubated for 3 min with methanol at room temperature. V5-tagged proteins were detected by incubation with an anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml (in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 0.5%/bovine serum albumin 3%) followed by a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Samples were DNA-stained with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, mounted using Vectashield mounting medium H-1000 (Vector Laboratories) and observed by confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems SA, HCX PLAPO CS 63/1.32–0.60 oil). Whole-mount RNA in situhybridization experiments were performed according to Gavis and Lehmann (39Gavis E.R. Lehman R. Cell. 1992; 71: 301-313Google Scholar). Antisense and sense digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were prepared using the pSKPCR2–532 plasmid (labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, according to the supplier's protocol). Embryos were mounted in Spurr embedding medium (Sigma). In situhybridizations on polytene chromosomes were prepared as described previously (40Lemeunier F. Aulard S. Popscu P. Hayes H. Dutrillaux B. Techniques in Animal Cytogenetics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 137-149Google Scholar). All steps of embryo preparation and incubation with the antibody were carried out as described in Gavis and Lehmann (39Gavis E.R. Lehman R. Cell. 1992; 71: 301-313Google Scholar). The affinity-purified anti-Moca-cyp antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution, and detection was realized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). Embryos were mounted in Spurr embedding medium (Sigma) and analyzed. PPIase activity was measured according to Hani et al. (41Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Google Scholar). Inhibition of PPIase activity was measured by preincubating CsA with the enzyme in the mixture for 5 min at 10 °C before starting the reaction by the addition of the substrate and the α-chymotrypsin. The inhibition constant K i was calculated according to a slow tight binding model with the following formula, f=kenz2×([E]−Ki−[I]+([E]−Ki−[I])2+4[E]Ki)Equation 1 where [E] is enzyme concentration, [I] is inhibitor concentration, and k enz is enzymatic acceleration of the followed reaction. With the aim of searching for nuclear proteins involved in the regulation of p300/CBP-dependent transcription, a protein fusion of glutathione S-transferase (GST) to the CH3 domain ofDrosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) (amino acids 2366–2540) (25Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P. Hou D.-X. Nonaka M. Smolik s.M. Armstrong S. Goodman R.H. Ishii S. Nature. 1997; 386: 735-738Google Scholar) was radiolabeled and used as a probe to screen aDrosophila embryo cDNA expression library. Thus, the clone 814 (1.2 kb) was isolated and analyzed. A fragment of the isolated cDNA was subcloned (p814ES) and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA prepared from S2 cells (Fig. 1 B). Two poly(A)+ mRNAs of about 3.5 and 4.3 kb were detected. Because the cloned cDNA 814 had a poly(A)+ tail and was shorter than the two mRNA detected by Northern blot analysis, we concluded that it was not complete and the corresponding 5′-end was missing. Another round of cDNA library screening was realized using a p814ES radiolabeled DNA probe. Among multiple cDNA clones isolated, the longest one (clone 532) was fully sequenced and further analyzed (Fig. 1 A). The clone 532 contained a poly(A)+ tail and its 5′ end corresponded to the position 40 of the nucleotide sequence presented in figure 1A. The 5′ end of the cDNA (Fig. 1 A) was obtained by PCR amplification (see “Experimental Procedures”). The full-length composite cDNA (named Moca-cyp), which spans 3177 nucleotides, co"

Cooperation for HIV-1 receptor activity was observed when two forms of CCR5 were coexpressed, either the wild-type (WT) receptor and a defective mutant with deletion of the amino-terminal (NT) extracellular domain or the latter ΔNT mutant and a human-mouse CCR5 chimera bearing the NT domain from human CCR5. Cooperation was most efficient when the two forms of CCR5 were in a 1:1 ratio. It was not observed between the CCR5 ΔNT mutant and a chimeric receptor (5444) in which the NT domain of CCR5 was in the context of another G-protein-coupled receptor, the HIV-1 receptor CXCR4. These results suggested that physical association between two forms of CCR5 was required for their cooperation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in transfected cell lysates indeed showed that the ΔNT CCR5 mutant formed oligomeric complexes with the WT CCR5 or the HMMM chimera but not with the CXCR4-derived chimera 5444. These observations suggest that the formation of CCR5 oligomers is a constitutive process independent from activation by chemokine ligands. The interaction of HIV-1 with independent subunits of CCR5 oligomers could favor the local recruitment of fusiogenic proteins and the formation of a fusion pore.

Chemokines are classified according to the relative position of two conserved cysteine residues in their amino-terminal region, the major subgroups being termed CXC (or α) and CC (or β) and the same nomenclature (CXCR and CCR) used to designate their receptors (5Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in cell signal transduction, chemokine receptors have attracted a lot of interest because they represent cell entry portals for the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and related simian or feline retroviruses. A list of chemokine receptors or related orphan GPCRs can mediate HIV-1 entry in certain experimental conditions, but only two of them, CCR5 and CXCR4, seem to be usedin vivo. The predominant role of CCR5 is indicated by the resistance to HIV-1 infection of individuals genetically deficient for the expression of this receptor, the most frequent defect being a 32-nucleotide deletion (Δ32 allele) resulting in a translation frameshift after residue 187 (reviewed in Refs. 6Berger E.A.

Although HIV-1 strains infecting cells via CCR5 (termed R5 strains) can be isolated throughout infection, strains using CXCR4 (termed X4) or both receptors (R5X4) generally emerge at more advanced stages. The selectivity of HIV-1 for CCR5 or CXCR4 can explain differences in cell tropism such as the ability of R5 but not X4 strains to replicate in macrophages. The inhibition of HIV-1 infection by chemokines and other CCR5 or CXCR4 ligands raises hope for novel antiviral strategies (1Loetscher P. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Adv.

Biol. 2001; 1: 40-49Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and stimulates investigations on the role of these receptors in the initial steps of the virus life cycle. The cell entry of HIV-1 and other retroviruses is mediated by their envelope glycoproteins (Env), which consist in trimeric complexes of a surface subunit (gp120 in the case of HIV-1) responsible for contacts with target cells and a transmembrane subunit (gp41) mediating membrane fusion (reviewed in Refs. 11Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1884-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 12Poignard P. Saphire E.O. Parren P.W. Burton D.R. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1999; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The conformation changes in the Env complex required to activate the fusiogenic properties of gp41 are considered to be triggered by the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 or CXCR4. This interaction has been observed by different techniques, usually in presence of soluble forms of the CD4 protein that led to consider CCR5 and CXCR4 as CD4-associated HIV-1 coreceptors (14Lapham C.K.

However, the possibility of CD4-independent binding of gp120 to CCR5 and CXCR4 (17Bandres J.C. Wang Q.F. O'Leary J. Baleux F. Amara A. Hoxie J.A. Zolla-Pazner S. Gorny M.K. J.

How CCR5 or CXCR4 interact with gp120 is not known at the molecular level. The current view is that the functional interaction with HIV-1 gp120, i.e.leading to infection, is mediated by the extracellular domains of chemokine receptors, in particular their amino-terminal (NT) domain and second extracellular loop, whereas their intracellular domains coupled to the cell signaling machinery are dispensable, at least in experimental situations (reviewed in Refs. 6Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 20Berson J.F. Doms R.W. Semin.

The ability of CCR5 and CXCR4 to interact with gp120 is certainly a critical parameter, but it can be wondered if other features could also contribute to their HIV-1 receptor activity. Discrepancies have indeed been reported between gp120 binding and efficiency of HIV-1 infection in certain experiments (22Baik S.S. Doms R.W. Doranz B.J.

A high local density of HIV-1 receptors could favor the clustering of activated viral fusiogenic proteins that seems important for the formation of fusion pores (29Bentz J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 227-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Chernomordik L. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J.

In line with this view, the oligomeric status of chemokine receptors could represent an important parameter for HIV-1 infection. The possibility that GPCRs form oligomeric complexes has been the matter of a long debate but now seems to be an accepted fact supported by a list of coimmunoprecipitation and transcomplementation experiments and more recently evidenced by biophysical techniques based on light resonance energy transfer (for reviews see Refs. 32Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 33Bouvier M. Nat.

There is still no consensus on the possible function(s) of such dimers or higher order oligomers of GPCRs. In most instances, the formation of such structures appears to be a constitutive process, independent from the activation of these receptors by their ligands (32Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Conflicting results have been obtained in the case of chemokine receptors. In a series of studies, the formation of CCR5, CCR2, or CXCR4 homodimers as well as CCR5/CCR2 heterodimers was found to occur upon treatment of cells with the cognate chemokine ligands (35Vicente-Manzanares M. Montoya M.C. Mellado M. Frade J.M. del Pozo M.A. Nieto M. de Landazuri M.O. Martinez A.C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2497-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Benkirane et al. found that wild-type CCR5 could be trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells expressing the truncated form of CCR5 (residues 1–187) encoded by the Δ32 allele and proposed that formation of dimers was a constitutive process necessary for efficient processing of the receptor to the cell surface (39Benkirane M.

Although such an effect of the Δ32 mutant on the cell surface expression of CCR5 could not be evidenced in a recent study (40Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Van Ryk D.I. Locati M. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2287-2301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we have reported experiments confirming the finding of Benkirane et al. (39Benkirane M.

Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46975-46982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In similar experiments, we found that the HIV-1 receptor activity of CCR5 was enhanced when cells coexpressed a functionally defective CCR5 mutant obtained by complete deletion of the amino-terminal extracellular domain. Another example of cooperation between two forms of CCR5 was obtained by rescuing HIV-1 receptor activity upon expressing two defective CCR5 mutants in transfected cells. This functional transcomplementation apparently required physical association of the different forms of CCR5 detected in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. These results provide strong and direct evidence for the formation of constitutive CCR5 oligomers and shed new light on the molecular interplay between the HIV-1 envelope proteins and the target cell membrane. The HEK293T and HeLa-derived cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin).

Recombinant macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1β) was purchased from Peprotech, Inc. All WT and mutant chemokine receptors cDNAs were expressed from the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter using a standard calcium phosphate technique. The expression vectors for WT and c-Myc-tagged CCR5 human CCR5 (44Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), the HMMM human-mouse chimeric CCR5 (51Picard L. Simmons G. Power C.A. Meyer A. Weiss R.A. Clapham P.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5003-5011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), truncated CCR51–100 (41Chelli M. Alizon M. J. Biol.

Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been described previously. The CCR5 ΔNT mutant corresponding to an in-frame deletion between Asp2and Lys26 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis on a single-stranded template. PCR amplification strategies were used to obtain the FLAG-tagged forms of CCR5 (in-frame insertion of the amino acid sequence DYKDDDDK after the initiation codon) and the 5444 chimera, which has the NT domain of human CCR5 (Met1 to Lys26) and the other domains of human CXCR4 (Cys28 to Ser352). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed from the enhanced GFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Infection of HeLa-P4 cells expressing different forms of CCR5 or co-cultures with Env+ cells were performed essentially as described previously (44Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in 6-well trays (5 × 105 cells/well) with a total amount of 3 μg of DNA/well. Co-cultures or infections were initiated 24 h later by adding an equivalent number of freshly trypsinized HeLa-Env/ADA cells or 105 infectious units of each R5 HIV-1 strains. After 24 h (or 36 h for infections), the cells were washed, fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and stained for β-galactosidase activity with X-gal. Blue-stained foci were scored under ×20 magnification. Cell counts >200 were obtained by extrapolation from randomly selected fields. The surface expression of chemokine receptor was monitored as described previously (52Brelot A. Heveker N. Pleskoff O. Sol N. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA 36 h after cotransfection with GPCR and GFP expression vectors (6:1 ratio). Cells were incubated 1 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum with 1 μg/ml of anti-CCR5 (2D7 or 3A9) or anti-CXCR4 (12G5) mAb and then washed and stained for 1 h at 4 °C with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated secondary antibody before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. The green (GFP) and red (CCR5 or CXCR4) fluorescence was analyzed on an Epics Elite flow cytometer (Coultronics). Results are shown as the percentage of PE-positive cells or mean PE intensity in the GFP-positive fraction as indicated. Approximately 107 transfected HEK293T cells or CEM cells were lysed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of 0.5%n-dodecyl-d-maltoside (Sigma), 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min), and immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C on 1-ml samples (1 mg of proteins) by contact with 1 μg of 2D7 or anti-c-Myc mAb (2 h) and protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nylon membranes before contact with the 3A9, M2 (anti-FLAG), or 9E10 (anti-c-Myc) mAb (all at 1 μg/ml) and then with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgGs (0.5 μg/ml). The reaction was revealed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The HIV-1 receptor activity of CCR5 was assayed by transient transfection of CD4+ HeLa-P4 cells followed by infection by R5 HIV-1 strains (ADA, JRCSF, or YU2) or co-culture with HeLa-Env/ADA cells (44Pleskoff O. Treboute C. Brelot A. Heveker N. Seman M. Alizon M. Science. 1997; 276: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Infection by HIV-1 or fusion with Env+ cells (also expressing the HIV-1-transactivating protein, Tat) activates a β-galactosidase (lacZ) transgene in HeLa-P4 cells, allowing us to quantify these events by staining with X-gal. Syncytia formation and HIV-1 infection were not detected when HeLa-P4 cells expressed the ΔNT CCR5 mutant corresponding to a 25-residue deletion in the amino-terminal extracellular domain (Fig.1, A and B). Unexpectedly, the cotransfection of this defective mutant and the wild-type (WT) CCR5 resulted in markedly higher numbers of syncytia with Env+ cells and HIV-1 infection events by comparison with cells transfected with the WT CCR5 only (Fig. 1, A andB). The efficiency of cell fusion or infection was similar for cells transfected with equal amounts (1.5 μg) of WT and ΔNT CCR5 vectors or with 3 μg of the WT CCR5 vector. The cooperation observed in this experiment could either be because of functional complementation of the defective mutant or enhanced expression of the WT receptor. The cell surface expression of the two forms of CCR5 was assayed by flow cytometry after staining with the 3A9 or 2D7 mAbs, which react with the NT domain and the second extracellular loop of CCR5, respectively. Similar flow cytometry profiles were obtained for cells transfected with the WT CCR5 or the ΔNT mutant upon staining with the 2D7 mAb, indicating that the deletion did not affect cell surface expression, whereas the 3A9 mAb only stained cells expressing WT CCR5 as expected (Fig. 2 A; TableI). An analysis of HeLa-P4 cells cotransfected with equal amounts of the WT CCR5 vector and either a control plasmid or the ΔNT CCR5 vector revealed similar staining efficiency with the 3A9 mAb (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the enhanced HIV-1 receptor activity of cells coexpressing WT and ΔNT CCR5 seemed to be attributed to a complementation effect.Table IRelative cell surface expression of CCR5, CXCR4, and derivatives in transfected HEK293T cellsReactivity with mAb2D73A912G5%CCR51001000ΔNT11200HMMM3.2890CXCR400100544405289Flow cytometry analysis was performed as shown in Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab Flow cytometry analysis was performed as shown in Fig. 2. To obtain further evidence of cooperation between two forms of CCR5, we sought to rescue HIV-1 receptor function by coexpressing the ΔNT mutant and another defective forms of CCR5. In our hands, point mutations in the extracellular loops of CCR5 had a very limited functional effect, whereas the deletions were not compatible with transport of CCR5 to the cell surface, probably because they caused improper folding and intracellular retention of the polypeptide chain. Therefore, our option was to use a CCR5 chimera (HMMM) in which the NT and TM1 domains derived from human CCR5 (H) and other domains from its mouse homologue (M). Although such a chimeric receptor has been reported to be a functional HIV-1 receptor (51Picard L. Simmons G. Power C.A. Meyer A. Weiss R.A. Clapham P.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5003-5011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Bieniasz P.D. Fridell R.A. Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2599-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), its activity was very low in our assays. It was <10% relatively to WT CCR5 in fusion assays between transfected HeLa-P4 cells and HeLa-Env/ADA cells (Fig. 3 A) and in infections with the YU-2 and JRCSF HIV-1 strains (Fig.3 B), whereas infection by HIV-1 ADA was somehow more efficient (∼30% relatively to WT CCR5). Flow cytometry analysis with the 3A9 mAb indicates that the lower HIV-1 receptor activity of the HMMM chimera does not result from reduced surface expression (Table Iand Fig. 2 A). Cotransfection of CCR5 ΔNT and HMMM expression vectors (1.5 μg each) in HeLa-P4 cells resulted in efficient fusion with HeLa-Env/ADA cells and infection by the HIV-1 JRCSF and YU-2 strains, whereas infection by HIV-1 ADA strain was markedly increased (Fig. 3,A and B). The number of syncytia or infection events was comparable with those seen when HeLa-P4 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of WT CCR5, again indicating that the functional complementation of these two CCR5 mutants is a relatively efficient process. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the ΔNT mutant did not up-regulate the surface expression of the HMMM receptor (Fig. 2 B). In similar experiments, the CCR5 ΔNT mutant was not rescued by coexpressing the mouse CCR5 or other chimeric receptors not containing the amino-terminal domain of human CCR5 2M. Chelli and M. Alizon, unpublished data. or by the CCR51–100 mutant corresponding to the NT and TM1 domains (Fig. 3 A) and previously shown not to be processed to the cell surface (41Chelli M. Alizon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46975-46982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To find out whether complementation was possible when the NT domain of CCR5 was in the context of a more distant GPCR, it was substituted to the homologous domain of CXCR4. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the resulting 5444 chimera and WT CXCR4 were expressed at a similar level in transfected cells, whereas the reactivity with the 3A9 mAb was ∼50% relative to WT CCR5 (Table I), indicating that the amino-terminal domain of CCR5 was accessible. Upon expression of the 5444 chimera in HeLa-P4 cells we could detect fusion with HeLa-Env/ADA cells at a relatively low level (∼20% relative to WT CCR5) (Fig. 3 A), which is in agreement with observations made with similar chimeric receptors (54Pontow S. Ratner L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11503-11514Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The efficiency of fusion was not enhanced when HeLa-P4 cells coexpressed the 5444 chimeric receptor and the ΔNT mutant (Fig. 3 A). These different results suggested that the cooperation of different forms of CCR5 for HIV-1 receptor activity required some form of interplay that cannot take place with a more distant GPCR such as CXCR4. It obviously led to an envision that functional complementation involved the formation of dimers or higher order oligomers. In cells expressing two receptors capable to efficiently associate, the relative proportions of homodimers and heterodimers can be deduced from simple equations and follow theoretical curves shown in Fig.4 A. The efficiency of fusion with Env+ cells and the level of CCR5 at the cell surface were in approximately a linear relationship with the amount"
https://openalex.org/W2093172368,"Polyglutamine disease is now recognized as one of the conformational, amyloid-related diseases. In this disease, polyglutamine expansion in proteins has toxic effects on cells and also results in the formation of aggregates. Polyglutamine aggregate formation is accompanied by conversion of the polyglutamine from a soluble to an insoluble form. In yeast, the efficiency of the aggregate formation is determined by the balance of various parameters, including the length of the polyglutamine tract, the function of Hsp104, and the level of polyglutamine expression. In this study, we found that the co-expression of a long polyglutamine tract, which formed aggregates independently of the function of Hsp104, enhanced the formation of aggregates of a short polyglutamine tract in wild-type cells as well as in Δhsp104 mutant cells. Thus, the expression of a long polyglutamine tract would be an additional parameter determining the efficiency of aggregate formation of a short polyglutamine tract. The co-localization of aggregates of long and short polyglutamine tracts suggests the possibility that the enhancement occurs due to the seeding of aggregates of the long polyglutamine tracts."
