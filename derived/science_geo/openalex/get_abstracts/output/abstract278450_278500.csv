https://openalex.org/W2022425129,"Nitrogen fixation, measured by the reduction of acetylene to ethylene, was found in workers of the dry-wood termite Kalotermes minor. The soldiers and reproductive castes fixed little or no nitrogen. The fixation rates ranged between 24 and 566 micrograms of nitrogen fixed per month per gram (wet weight) of termite. Nitrogen fixation can be a significant source of nitrogen for these termites."

Failure to acquire the concept was reflected in inaccurate responses on the adjustment task and by inability of students to verbalize a correct strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2054225943,"A device for sampling the interstitial waters of deep-sea sediments in situ has been developed and tested. The sampler collects a series of samples over a depth of 1.5 meters in the sediment and thus makes possible the accurate delineation of chemical gradients existing in the pore waters. Samples collected in the North Atlantic indicate that significant gradients of K(+) and Ca(2+) exist in the sediments sampled. Interstitial solutions sampled between Ireland and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, are characterized by the depletion of K(+) and the enrichment of Ca(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W2014222991,"The maximum length of 36.5 feet (11.1 meters) attributed to the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) by Günther and others is a mistake. Examination of the jaws and teeth of the specimen referred to by Günther and comparison with the jaws of white sharks of known length revealed a length of about 17 feet ( approximately 5 meters). The largest white shark reliably measured was a 21-foot (6.4-meter) individual from Cuba. Bites on whale carcasses found off southern Australia suggest that white sharks as long as 25 or 26 feet (7 (1/2) or 8 meters) exist today. The size of extinct Carcharodon has also been grossly exaggerated. Based on a projection of a curve of tooth size of Recent Carcharodon carcharias, the largest fossil Carcharodon were about 43 feet ( approximately 13 meters) long."

https://openalex.org/W2026142954,"Huntite flowstone has recently been discovered in Carlsbad Caverns. This flowstone occurs as a thin, white layer of microcrystals (approximately 1 to 60 micrometers in diameter) which appears buckled and crinkled. The huntite is believed to be precipitating directly from magnesium-rich solutions rather than forming by alteration of preexisting minerals."
https://openalex.org/W2042681345,"The backscattering of alpha particles from a radioactive source can be used to determine the amounts of heavy elements such as lead in surface materials. A light, portable instrument has been constructed that can be used as a survey meter for painted surfaces. It has a sensitivity of 0.3 percent by weight in a measurement of a few minutes."

Paleontologist Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago says that honor belongs to Triceratops, another member of the family Ceratopsidae."

https://openalex.org/W4234971762,"One of the simplest and most useful algebraic structures is the group, study of which dates back to 1830. The concept is not only of mathematical interest, but has found application in fields ranging from quantum mechanics to crystallography. Despite their long history and many uses, groups remain a remote concept to many. Since the accompanying two articles concern advances in group theory and its applications, this short summary of the basic axioms and properties of groups is offered as a convenient primer."
