https://openalex.org/W2126643406,"We present an approach to fabricate solid capsules with precise control of size, permeability, mechanical strength, and compatibility. The capsules are fabricated by the self-assembly of colloidal particles onto the interface of emulsion droplets. After the particles are locked together to form elastic shells, the emulsion droplets are transferred to a fresh continuous-phase fluid that is the same as that inside the droplets. The resultant structures, which we call ""colloidosomes,"" are hollow, elastic shells whose permeability and elasticity can be precisely controlled. The generality and robustness of these structures and their potential for cellular immunoisolation are demonstrated by the use of a variety of solvents, particles, and contents."
https://openalex.org/W2153328681,"beta-Defensins are small antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system produced in response to microbial infection of mucosal tissue and skin. We demonstrate that murine beta-defensin 2 (mDF2beta) acts directly on immature dendritic cells as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), inducing up-regulation of costimulatory molecules and dendritic cell maturation. These events, in turn, trigger robust, type 1 polarized adaptive immune responses in vivo, suggesting that mDF2beta may play an important role in immunosurveillance against pathogens and, possibly, self antigens or tumor antigens."

Thus, climate change may not lead to a poleward shift in the distribution of intertidal organisms, as has been proposed, but instead will likely cause localized extinctions at a series of “hot spots.” Patterns of exposure to extreme climatic conditions are temporally variable, and tidal predictions suggest that in the next 3 to 5 years “hot spots” are likely to appear at several northern sites."

https://openalex.org/W1998144577,"A well-known organic host compound undergoes single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transitions upon guest uptake and release. Despite a lack of porosity of the material, guest transport through the solid occurs readily until a thermodynamically stable structure is achieved. In order to actively facilitate this dynamic process, the host molecules undergo significant positional and/or orientational rearrangement. This transformation of the host lattice is triggered by weak van der Waals interactions between the molecular components. In order for the material to maintain its macroscopic integrity, extensive cooperativity must exist between the molecules throughout the crystal, such that rearrangement can occur in a well-orchestrated fashion. We demonstrate here that even weak dispersive forces can exert a profound influence over solid-state dynamics."

Neuronal ATP secretion is quantal and calcium-dependent, but it has been suggested that ATP release from astrocytes may not be vesicular. Here we report that, besides the described basal ATP release facilitated by exposure to calcium-free medium, astrocytes release purine under conditions of elevated calcium. The evoked release was not affected by the gap-junction blockers anandamide and flufenamic acid, thus excluding purine efflux through connexin hemichannels. Sucrose-gradient analysis revealed that a fraction of ATP is stored in secretory granules, where it is accumulated down an electrochemical proton gradient sensitive to the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1. ATP release was partially sensitive to tetanus neurotoxin, whereas glutamate release from the same intoxicated astrocytes was almost completely impaired. Finally, the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, which strongly evokes glutamate release, was only slightly effective in promoting purine secretion. These data indicate that astrocytes concentrate ATP in granules and may release it via a regulated secretion pathway. They also suggest that ATP-storing vesicles may be distinct from glutamate-containing vesicles, thus opening up the possibility that their exocytosis is regulated differently.

It was first believed that calcium waves are propagated by the diffusion of intracellular messengers, such as Ca2+ and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, across gap junctions (see Ref. 9Haydon P.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 185-193Crossref Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, and Refs. therein). It has more recently become clear that calcium propagation may occur by means of an extracellular pathway because it also takes place among physically separated astrocytes (3Hassinger T.D.

Several lines of evidence now suggest that ATP is the major extracellular messenger for inter-astrocyte calcium-mediated communication (10Guthrie P.B. Knappenberg J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L.

First, ATP is released from astrocytes during calcium wave propagation (10Guthrie P.B. Knappenberg J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L. Charles A.C. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 520-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang Z. Haydon P.G. Yeung E.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Second, the propagation can be reduced or abolished by purinergic antagonists (10Guthrie P.B. Knappenberg J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L. Charles A.C. Kater S.B. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, ATP mediates calcium-based intercellular communications between astrocytes and other cell elements such as meningeal cells (17Grafstein B. Liu S. Cotrina M.L. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Muller cells (18Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and microglia (19Verderio C. Matteoli M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These findings have highlighted the importance of ATP in cross-talk among astrocytes and between them and other cell types in the central nervous system. The mechanisms of ATP release by glial cells has been actively investigated (9Haydon P.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 185-193Crossref Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 13Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H.

Naus C.C. Charles A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in glioma cells, connexin expression potentiates both the resting and the stimulated ATP release (13Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Naus C.C.G. Nedergaard M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the possibility of a vesicular component of ATP release has never been investigated in astrocytes. ATP is known to be packaged in vesicles, being co-stored with acetylcholine in central and peripheral nerves, and with noradrenaline in the vesicles of sympathetic nerve terminals and in the related granules from chromaffin cells (23Zimmermann H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 420-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence has been recently reported of vesicular ATP release from endothelial cells (24Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The existence of typical secretory granules undergoing regulated secretion in astrocytes has recently been defined (25Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and proteins of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery have been identified in glial cells (26Parpura V. Fang Y. Basarsky T. Jahn R. Haydon P.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Jeftinija S.D. Jeftinija K.V. Stefanovic G. Brain Res. 1997; 750: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Maienschein M. Marxen M. Volknandt W. Zimmermann H. Glia. 1999; 26: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because these findings could be consistent with vesicular storage and regulated purine secretion from astrocytes, we investigated the mechanisms of ATP storage and release from primary cultures of hippocampal astrocytes. Antibodies against rat SgII1 were raised in rabbits, purified by affinity chromatography, and characterized as previously described (25Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies against GFAP came from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; the polyclonal antibodies against colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and the polyclonal antibodies against synaptobrevin/VAMPII were from Synaptic System GmbH (Gottingen, Germany). Ribophorin and complex 3 were kindly provided by Prof D. Borgese (Milan, Italy). The secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas Red, 10 nm gold particles, and peroxidase were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA); APV, CNQX, MCPG, t-ACPD, AMPA, and bafilomycin A1 were from Tocris Neuramin (Bristol, UK); quinacrine dihydrochloride, bradykinin, glutamate, ATP, PPADS, PMA, anandamide, apyrase (grade II) and flufenamic acid, BAPTA/AM were from Sigma. The ATP assay kit came from Molecular Probes Europe (Leiden, NL) and the lactate dehydrogenase kit from Sigma (Milano, Italy). Hippocampal mixed-glia cultures from embryonic rat pups (E18) were obtained using previously described methods (25Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, after dissection, the hippocampi were dissociated by treatment with trypsin (0.25% for 10 min at 37 °C) followed by fragmentation with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The dissociated cells were plated onto glass coverslips at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml, and the cultures were grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Euroclone Ltd, UK) and glucose at a final concentration of 5.5 g/l (glial medium). To obtain a pure astrocyte monolayer, any microglia cells were harvested by shaking 3-week-old cultures. The primary hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from E18 embryos as previously described (29Verderio C. Coco S. Fumagalli G. Matteoli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6449-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cultures were fixed for 25 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 mphosphate buffer containing 0.12 m sucrose. The fixed cells were detergent-permeabilized and labeled with primary antibodies followed by fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted in 70% glycerol in phosphate buffer containing 1 mg/ml phenylendiamine. The images were acquired using a BioRad MRC-1024 confocal microscope equipped with LaserSharp 3.2 software. Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (25Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Quinacrine staining was performed by incubating living cultures for 30 min at 37 °C with Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmCaCl2, 6 mm glucose, 25 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) containing 5 × 10−7m quinacrine dihydrochloride. Quinacrine-fluorescent living astrocytes were examined with a Zeiss microscope equipped with epifluorescence and photographated using a TMAX 400 (Eastman Kodak Co.). After being grown on Petri dishes until near confluence, the astrocytes were scraped, washed, and resuspended 1:4 in homogenization buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm Mg acetate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cells were homogenized using a cell cracker (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min to prepare the post-nuclear supernatant. This supernatant was loaded onto a 0.4–1.8 M sucrose gradient and spun in a 41 SW rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 25,000 rpm for 18 h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting as previously described (25Calegari F. Coco S. Taverna E. Bassetti M. Verderio C. Corradi N. Matteoli M. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22539-22547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters which, after being incubated in blocking buffer (5% milk, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), were labeled with primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1–0.3% Tween 20. After extensive washing, the immunodecoration pattern was revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal from Pierce, Rockford, IL) following the manufacturer' s protocol. The cultured cells were loaded for 60–90 min at 37 °C with 5 μm FURA-2 pentacetoxy-methylester in KRH, washed in the same solution, and transferred to the recording chamber of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a calcium imaging unit. For the assays, a modified CAM-230 dual-wavelength microfluorimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) was used as a light source. The experiments were performed using an Axon Imaging Workbench 2.2 equipped with a PCO SuperVGA SensiCam (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The ratio values in discrete areas of interest were calculated from sequences of images to obtain temporal analyses. The images were acquired at 1–3 340/380 ratios/s. The experiments were performed in a static bath at room temperature (24–25 °C). The increases in calcium were quantified by measuring the peak and/or area of the response. The biological assay for glutamate detection was performed as previously described (29Verderio C. Coco S. Fumagalli G. Matteoli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6449-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Specifically, monolayers of astrocyte cultures in 60-mm Petri dishes were kept in 1 ml of KRH in the absence and then in the presence of PMA or t-ACPD for 10–30 min at 37 °C. Neuronal cultures loaded with FURA-2 were then exposed to the different aliquots of KRH. Immediately before challenging, the aliquot collected from unstimulated astrocytes was supplemented with the stimuli. To verify that the biological activity of the conditioned medium was caused by accumulated glutamate, a subset of recordings were made in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists, APV and CNQX (29Verderio C. Coco S. Fumagalli G. Matteoli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6449-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U., De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although embryonic hippocampal neurons lack t-ACPD receptors coupled to calcium mobilization, 2C. Verderio and M. Matteoli, unpublished data. the specific antagonist MCPG was always added to the conditioned medium upon t-ACPD stimulation. To test the tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) sensitivity of glutamate release, the same astrocyte monolayer was challenged with PMA before and after 20-h incubation with the neurotoxin. Collected aliquots were frozen and then tested on the same FURA-2-loaded neurons. The endogenous glutamate concentration in the conditioned medium was determined by HPLC analysis coupled with fluorimetric detection as previously described (30Verderio C. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Fedele E. Schenk U., De Flora A. Matteoli M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Off-site ATP bioassay aliquots of KRH (1 ml), conditioned as described above for glutamate detection, were split into two parts before testing on FURA-2-loaded astrocytes. One part was pretreated with apyrase (30 units/ml) for 15 min before testing. Before being exposed to ATP sensor cells, each aliquot was supplemented with a mixture of glutamate antagonists (APV 100 μm, CNQX 20 μm, MCPG 1 mm) and the appropriate stimulus when conditioned under control conditions. KRH conditioned under mechanical stimulation was collected from astrocyte monolayers shaken for 5 min on an orbital shaker (Stuart Scientific, UK). The same aliquots were tested for lactate dehydrogenase activity following the manufacturer's protocol. ATP levels in the superfusates of pure astrocyte monolayers were measured using a luciferin/luciferase assay (Molecular Probes, Leiden, NL) and a luminometer (Lumat, Berthold, LB9501) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each sample was run in duplicate. Most of the samples were assayed within 5–10 min of collection; the others were frozen for subsequent ATP determination. ATP was detected on subcellular fractions by means of the same assay of equal aliquots of sucrose fractions that were boiled for 5 min before being frozen. To study the mechanisms of ATP release from hippocampal astrocytes, both “on line” (Fig. 1 A) and “off-site” (Fig. 1 D) biological assays were performed. The first method is based on the finding that microglia co-cultured with astrocytes may act as ATP reporter cells by selectively responding to the ATP released from adjacent astrocytes as [Ca2+]i increases (19Verderio C. Matteoli M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this assay, FURA-2-loaded astrocyte-microglia co-cultures (Fig. 1 A) were digitally imaged in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (100 μm APV and 20 μmCNQX) to exclude the possible contributions of released glutamate ord-serine. A gentle touch of the astrocyte with a glass pipette (a widely used stimulus for ATP secretion: 10, 12, 13) (Fig. 1,A and B) generated an increase in [Ca2+]i in the stimulated cell, followed by a delayed [Ca2+]iresponse in neighboring astrocytes and microglial cells. Despite the efficient propagation of the calcium signal among astrocytes (19Verderio C. Matteoli M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the microglia [Ca2+]i responses were completely blocked or substantially inhibited when mechanically stimulated in the presence of the nonselective purinergic antagonist PPADS (50 μm) or the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase (30 units/ml) (Fig. 1 C). No significant changes in mean astrocyte calcium responses were recorded in the presence of PPADS or apyrase (percent changes in Δ340/380 fluorescence ratio: PPADS, 74.5 ± 7.8, n = 5, p = 0.14; apyrase, 115.68 ± 21.5, n = 6, p = 0.43, data normalized to controls). These data indicate that ATP is the extracellular messenger responsible for microglial [Ca2+]i responses. Furthermore, a significant delay in the residual response was observed in the presence of the same blockers (a 514 ± 42% increase in the time to peak response in the presence of PPADS, and 420 ± 35% in the presence of apyrase, as compared with controls). Similar results were obtained when the mixed cultures were stimulated with 1 μm bradykinin (Fig. 1 C), which selectively increases [Ca2+]i in astrocytes (19Verderio C. Matteoli M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The alternative bioassay for the study of ATP secretion was based on off-site measurements of released purine. Superfusates, conditioned by differently treated pure astrocyte monolayers, were added to FURA-2-loaded astrocytes as ATP sensor cells in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists (Fig. 1 D). Fig. 1 Eshows the [Ca2+]i responses induced by the superfusates collected under static bath conditions (a) or during mechanical stimulation (b). The [Ca2+]i responses were completely prevented when the conditioned medium was treated with apyrase for 10–15 min (Fig. 1 F), thus indicating that ATP was the involved bioactive compound. Analysis of lactate dehydrogenase release revealed no significant difference between the extracellular media collected under static bath conditions or during mechanical stimulation (lactate dehydrogenase activity: control, 4.87 ± 0.69 units/liter; mechanically stimulated, 6.27 ± 1.2 units/liter, n = 4, p = 0.37; Triton X-100-treated, 247 ± 11.3,n = 4, p < 0.001), thus excluding ATP leakage caused by shear damage. The lack of cell damage was also confirmed by the exclusion of Trypan Blue from the mechanically stimulated astrocytes (data not shown). We used the two bioassays to obtain insights into the mechanisms that control ATP release from primary astrocytes on different kinds of stimulation. To investigate the possible calcium dependence of ATP release, astrocytes were mechanically stimulated after 45 min treatment with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (10 μm). Purine release was largely calcium-dependent, as the response in ATP reporter cells was significantly attenuated when the medium was collected from BAPTA-treated astrocytes (off-site bioassay, Fig. 1 E, c). BAPTA treatment significantly reduced the calcium response to below baseline levels (Fig. 1 F). Furthermore, ATP release was significantly increased by treatment with the potent secretagogues PMA (100 nm) (Fig. 1 G) or with the glutamate receptor agonists AMPA (100 μm) and t-ACPD (100 μm) (Fig. 1 H), which have been previously shown to stimulate glutamate secretion when simultaneously applied to astrocytes (31Bezzi P. Carmignoto G. Pasti L. Vesce S. Rossi D. Rizzini B.L. Pozzan T. Volterra A. Nature. 1998; 391: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). On the basis of a standard dose-response curve of [Ca2+]i response amplitude to different concentrations of exogenous ATP, the actual ATP concentration in the collected medium was estimated to be 130–290 nmunder static bath and 550–700 nm after mechanical stimulation or secretagogue treatment. Determination of the ATP in the extracellular medium using the sensitive luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay revealed a 4.5 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3) increase in ATP release after PMA stimulation. We then evaluated whether connexin hemichannels mediate ATP efflux from primary astrocytes upon stimulation. To test this hypothesis directly, we measured stimulated ATP release in the presence of the gap-junction blockers anandamide, which effectively uncouples astrocytes (11Guan X. Cravatt B.F.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or flufenamic acid, which has been recently used as connexin hemichannel blocker (21Stout C.E. Costantin J.L. Naus C.C.

(Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in figure 2A, no significant reduction in [Ca2+]i response was observed when the astrocytes were mechanically stimulated after 10–30 min incubation with 100 μm anandamide (on-line bioassay). Accordingly, [Ca2+]i responses in ATP reporter cells to the medium conditioned by a PMA-stimulated astrocyte monolayer were unaffected by the presence of the gap-junction blocker (off-site bioassay) (Fig. 2 B). To ensure that the doses of anandamide used in this study were appropriate to block gap-junction communication, FURA-2-loaded astrocytes were mechanically stimulated in the presence of the purinergic antagonist PPADS and the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase with or without anandamide. When the extracellular pathway was inhibited by the purinergic blockers, anandamide completely prevented calcium signal propagation, thus indicating an efficient block of the gap-junction-mediated communication (wave propagation radius: PPADS, apyrase, without anandamide: 145.9 ± 11 μm, n = 4; PPADS, apyrase, with anandamide: 12.1 ± 6.4 μm, n = 5,p < 0.01). Furthermore, as blocking of gap-junctions may not be indicative of inhibition of connexin hemichannels, we tested whether anandamide blocks NAD+ influx down a concentration gradient, which is known to occur through connexin hemichannels (33Bruzzone S Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). An 86 ± 13% reduction of NAD+ influx was caused by a 15-min preincubation with 100 μm anandamide. These data indicate that anandamide, which is effective in blocking nucleotide fluxes through connexin hemichannels, does not significantly impair ATP release evoked by astrocyte stimulation. Similarly, no significant reduction in ATP release, monitored as [Ca2+]i response in microglial cells (on-line bioassay), was observed when the astrocytes were mechanically stimulated after 10–30 min incubation with 50 μm flufenamic acid (data not shown). It has been reported in the literature that exposure of astrocytes to calcium-free medium facilitates ATP release and that this treatment promotes opening of connexin hemichannels (15Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S., Li, J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Naus C.C. Nerdergard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 21Stout C.E. Costantin J.L. Naus C.C. Charles A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Treatment of hippocampal astrocytes with calcium-free medium significantly increased basal ATP release, as detected by using the sensitive luciferin-luciferase assay (196 ± 15% increase upon controls). ATP release was significantly reduced (30 ± 1.8% reduction) in cultures incubated with the gap-junction inhibitor anandamide. Our data indicated the existence of a calcium-dependent, gap-junction blocker-insensitive release of ATP in primary cultures of hippocampal astrocytes, suggesting a vesicular purine storage. In line with this hypothesis, labeling of astrocytes with quinacrine fluorescence dye, which is known to stain high levels of ATP bound to peptides in large granular vesicles (24Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Belai A. Burnstock G. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) revealed the existence of an ATP-containing population of vesicular organelles, prominently localized in the perinuclear region of the astrocytes (Fig. 3 A). This vesicular staining was reminiscent of the localization of secretogranin II (SgII), a well established marker of dense-core vesicles (35Rosa P. Hille A. Lee R.W. Zanini A., De Camilli P.

Progress in x-ray diffraction instrumentation at synchrotron sources has created an opportunity to study the transformation kinetics at the level of individual grains. Our measurements show that the activation energy for grain nucleation is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that predicted by thermodynamic models. The observed growth curves of the newly formed grains confirm the parabolic growth model but also show three fundamentally different types of growth. Insight into the grain nucleation and growth mechanisms during phase transformations contributes to the development of materials with optimal mechanical properties.

To identify clusters of genes constituting such diagnostic profiles, we characterized the specific transcriptional responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeto growth limitation by carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur. Microarray experiments were performed using cells growing in steady-state conditions in chemostat cultures at the same dilution rate. This enabled us to study the effects of one particular limitation while other growth parameters (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen tension) remained constant. Furthermore, the composition of the media fed to the cultures was altered so that the concentrations of excess nutrients were comparable between experimental conditions. In total, 1881 transcripts (31% of the annotated genome) were significantly changed between at least two growth conditions. Of those, 484 were significantly higher or lower in one limitation only. The functional annotations of these genes indicated cellular metabolism was altered to meet the growth requirements for nutrient-limited growth. Furthermore, we identified responses for several active transcription factors with a role in nutrient assimilation. Finally, 51 genes were identified that showed 10-fold higher or lower expression in a single condition only.

The transcription of these genes can be used as indicators for the characterization of nutrient-limited growth conditions and provide information for metabolic engineering strategies. Growth of microorganisms in their natural environment and in many industrial applications is often limited by nutrient availability (1Pretorius I.S. Yeast. 2000; 16: 675-729Google Scholar,2Attfield P.V. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1351-1357Google Scholar). In these situations the specific growth rate of the organism is determined by the low (non-saturating) concentration of a single nutrient. For example, in the industrial production of bakers' yeast sugar-limited, aerobic cultivation at relatively low specific growth rates is essential to achieve high biomass yields. On the other hand processes such as beer fermentation occur at high concentrations of fermentable sugars and are limited by other nutrients (e.g.oxygen, nitrogen). As a result the yeast's metabolic activities are altered. This situation is different from nutrient starvation in which the absence of a nutritional component is often the cause of stress responses that result in growth arrest or cell death (3Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Google Scholar, 4Gasch A.P. Werner-Washburne M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 181-192Google Scholar).In the laboratory, cultivation of microorganisms is predominantly performed in shake-flasks, in which all relevant nutrients are at least initially present in excess. During the course of batch cultivation the physical and chemical environment constantly changes, which directly affects the specific growth rate and the regulation of many metabolic processes (5Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Google Scholar). With the use of chemostat cultures, it is possible to study steady-state physiological adaptations to nutrient-limited growth. The medium that is continuously fed into the culture can be designed such that growth is limited by a single, defined nutrient, whereas all other nutrients remain present in excess. In conjunction with this continuous feed of fresh media into the vessel, waste media and cells are removed at the same rate. This results in a constant dilution rate (h−1) which in steady-state cultures is equal to the specific growth rate μ (6Harder W. Kuenen J.G. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1977; 43: 1-24Google Scholar). This offers the unique possibility to study metabolism and its regulation at a fixed and constant specific growth rate under tightly defined nutritional conditions.Microorganisms have evolved a multitude of strategies to cope with nutrient limitations. Low, growth-limiting amounts of important nutrients often lead to the induction of high affinity transport systems and/or metabolic systems that allow more efficient incorporation of the nutrients into biomass constituents. A classical example is the high affinity glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutatrate aminotransferase system from Klebsiella pneumoniae (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes) that can replace glutamate dehydrogenase as the primary ammonia-assimilating enzyme system during ammonia-limited growth (7Tempest D.W. Meers J.L. Brown C.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 405-407Google Scholar). In other cases, the final biomass composition itself has a reduced content of the growth-limiting nutrient. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, it has been observed that the amino acid composition of the subset of structural enzymes used in the assimilation of sulfur, carbon, or nitrogen have a reduced content of the respective element compared with their average content in the predicted proteome (8Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Google Scholar).The physiological responses of microorganisms to different nutrient limitation regimes can be regulated at various levels. At the level of transcription, DNA microarrays allow the accurate, genome-wide mapping of regulatory responses. With few exceptions (9Ter Linde J.J.M. Liang H. Davis R.W. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7409-7413Google Scholar, 10Ter Linde J.J.M. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2002; 19: 825-840Google Scholar, 11Hayes A. Zhang N., Wu, J.

Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37001-37008Google Scholar) DNA microarray analyses have been performed using cells grown in shake flasks. With the use of chemostats, detailed analyses of the transcriptional responses of S. cerevisiae to nutrient limitations may aid in the development of new, DNA array-based approaches for diagnosis of industrial fermentation processes. Furthermore, such studies provide valuable information for the functional analysis of genes whose encoded protein has no known or only poorly defined function. However, as yet there have been no systematic investigations into the impact on genome-wide transcriptional regulation of different nutrient limitation regimes in chemostat cultures.The main chemical elements that are assimilated into yeast biomass are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus (13Lange H.C. Heijnen J.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 75: 334-344Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory already addressed the impact of oxygen supply on the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae (9Ter Linde J.J.M. Liang H. Davis R.W. Steensma H.Y. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7409-7413Google Scholar, 12Piper M.D.W. Daran-Lapujade P. Bro C. Regenberg B. Knudsen S. Nielsen J. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37001-37008Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine which of the currently recognized genes of S. cerevisiae have uniquely higher or lower expression when growth is limited for each of the macro nutrients, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus. To this end, a wild type strain of S. cerevisiae was grown on glucose under strictly defined conditions in aerobic, nutrient-limited chemostat cultures at a constant growth rate. These experiments revealed the transcriptional differences that contribute to altered yeast metabolism and so can serve as molecular identifiers to diagnose the status of nutrient-limited fermentations or refine metabolic engineering strategies. The complete data set is available for download at www.nutrient-limited.bt.tudelft.nl.DISCUSSIONDuring macronutrient-limited growth of steady-state cultures ofS. cerevisiae we measured the differential expression of 1881 different genes (31% of the predicted genome). From this group of transcripts, we studied 484 that were found to have significantly higher or significantly lower abundance in one condition when compared with the other three conditions tested. The information distilled in the functions and promoters of these open reading frames offers us insights into the metabolic responses of the cell that result in more efficient utilization of the growth limiting nutrient. Furthermore, because these regulatory events were coupled to highly specific environmental changes using the controlled environment of the chemostat, these genes were used to generate a set of molecular “indicators.” It is proposed that this list can be used for the diagnosis of media deficiencies from fermentations using undefined media or regulatory anomalies arising during rounds of strain improvement by metabolic engineering.One consequence of our specific goal to study these limited regulatory events is that many interesting phenomena were excluded from the present work (such as the previously described connection between phosphorus and sulfur metabolism (45Crowther D.J. Kent N.A. Spit A.F. Mellor J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 354-359Google Scholar) or carbon and nitrogen metabolism (46Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Google Scholar)). These analyses are, however, beyond the scope of this paper and will, therefore, be investigated in future studies.Global Transcriptional Regulation to Optimize Assimilation of Growth-limiting NutrientsAlmost all nutrients enter the cell via transport proteins whose capacity and affinity properties vary. When the growth of a microorganism is limited by the low abundance of a nutrient in the medium, an increase in high affinity uptake systems is essential to cell survival. This situation is exemplified in S. cerevisiae by the hexose transport family of proteins (encoded by the HXT genes) that contains as many as 20 members (47Wieczorke R. Krampe S. Weierstall T. Freidel K. Hollenberg C.P. Boles E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 123-128Google Scholar). In our study, when growth was limited by the carbon source (glucose) we found a gene for high affinity glucose uptake (HXT2) and a reserve transporter (HXT5) elevated, whereas genes encoding low affinity uptake (HXT1, HXT3, andHXT4) were reduced relative to conditions of glucose excess. This was in agreement with previous chemostat studies by Diderichet al. (48Diderich J.A. Schepper M. van Hoek P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Klaassen P. Boelens H.F. de Mattos M.J. van Dam K. Kruckeberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15350-15359Google Scholar, 49Diderich J.A. Schuurmans J.M. Van Gaalen M.C. Kruckeberg A.L. van Dam K. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1515-1524Google Scholar). Furthermore, the genes encoding high affinity transport proteins of the other nutrients (MEP2,PHO84/PHO89, and SUL2 for ammonium, phosphorus, and sulfate, respectively) were all relatively increased in a manner specific to the appropriate nutrient-limited culture. In the case of phosphorus limitation, the genes for vacuolar polyphosphate synthesis were also transcribed at a higher level. This agreed with the hypothesis that polyphosphate synthesis is a mechanism to maintain low intracellular free phosphate levels to enhance high affinity uptake (37Ogawa N. deRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Google Scholar).The second strategy that was identified to enhance survival during nutrient-limited growth is to exploit other possible sources of that nutrient. Amino acids can serve to supply the cell with carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, which was reflected by elevated levels of several amino acid transporter genes in these three limitations. Furthermore, strategies to scavenge carbon (in the form of maltose, sucrose, fatty acids, and carboxylic acids), energy (from lactate and formate), nitrogen (from allantoin, proline, and urea), phosphorus (from glycerophosphoinositol), and sulfur (fromS-adenosylmethionine, isethionate, taurine, and glutathione) were reflected in the specific transcript changes for each limitation.The third regulatory outcome was the elevation of genes whose products are involved in the mobilization and utilization of storage compounds. This was principally seen during nitrogen-limited and sulfate-limited cultivation. Both protein degradation (51Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5609-5613Google Scholar) and allantoin utilization (52Cooper T.G. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 139-169Google Scholar) are recognized routes for the mobilization of stored nitrogen, whereas glutathione catabolism can be used as a source of sulfur forS. cerevisiae (53Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Google Scholar). Several genes involved in these pathways were elevated in a manner specific to their respective limitations.Finally, biomass remodeling for nutrient sparing has also been proposed as a mechanism for successful adaptation to nutrient-limiting conditions. Previous reports of the preferential expression of low sulfur-containing proteins during sulfur-limited growth in other microbes (54Cuhel R.L. Taylor C.D. Jannasch H.W. Arch. Microbiol. 1981; 130: 1-7Google Scholar, 55Mazel D. Marliere P. Nature. 1989; 341: 245-248Google Scholar) have recently been complemented by a yeast study that analyzed the proteome (8Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Google Scholar). This work proposed a model for the evolutionary adaptation of proteins to low nutrient levels through their reduced carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur content following a model recognized by Pardee (50Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5886-5892Google Scholar) for a sulfur-binding protein fromSalmonella typhimurium. More recently still, sulfur conservation in yeast by differential gene expression has been observed in response to sulfur demand induced by cadmium stress (40Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.-C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Google Scholar). Our results corroborate these reports because we found a (2-fold) overrepresentation of genes that code for proteins with low methionine content (below 1%) among those elevated specifically during sulfur limitation. This differential regulation was most dramatically illustrated by the PDC6 transcript that increased some 10–50-fold when compared with the other three conditions. The protein encoded by this gene has 6 sulfur-containing amino acids, in contrast to its isozymes Pdc1p and Pdc5p, which contain 17 and 18 sulfur-containing amino acids, respectively. However, in contrast to the report of Fauchon et al. (40Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.-C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Google Scholar), we only found the relationship to be true for the methionine content in proteins and not for cysteine. It is possible that this is a function of the importance of cysteine to protein stability. This important distinction may only be detectable in our experiments since we used steady-state sulfur-limited chemostat cultures and not stress-induced sulfur depletion.In addition to these regulatory events that reflect adaptation to nutrient limitations, we observed disproportionately low biomass yields on glucose of the nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and sulfur-limited cultures for the rates of respiration. The significantly lower yield per ATP has previously been explained for nitrogen-limited chemostat cultures by increased uncoupling between ATP synthesis and biomass production (24Larsson C. von Stockar U. Marison I. Gustafsson L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4809-4816Google Scholar). This interesting observation is under further investigation in our laboratory.The Activities of Specific Transcriptional Regulons during Nutrient-limited GrowthGenome-wide regulation of transcription in response to environmental change is an essential component of the rearrangement of metabolic fluxes. However, because of the introduction of microarray technologies, it is apparent that the functional relationships of many changed transcripts are difficult if not impossible to explain. One factor that often contributes to this ambiguity is experimental design since the changes observed for a given experimental condition are defined relative to an unavoidably imperfect reference. Our experiments illustrate this point clearly since for each experimental culture (carbon-, nitrogen-, phosphorus-, or sulfur-limited) each of the other three cultures could serve as a reference condition because they contained each others' nutrients in excess at a constant residual concentration. The most informative group of genes for specific regulatory information, therefore, are the 484 genes identified here that were specifically up- or down-regulated in response to change of only a single nutrient.We found several over-represented sequences in the promoters of the co-regulated genes; however, the relationship between these putative transcription factor binding sites and gene regulation was imperfect. The explanation for this is 2-fold; (i) changes in transcript abundance can be achieved indirectly through the combined actions of other regulatory events, and (ii) for most transcription factors, the sequence(s) of their binding site is poorly described. We have tried to minimize the occurrence of the former possibility by using multiple comparisons as described above; however, this can be further improved by the addition of more reference situations (e.g. trace element or vitamin growth limitations) and selecting the specifically regulated gene sets. Improvement on the issue raised by the second possibility is, however, more complicated, as shown by a study of theDAL1/DAL4 promoter that showed active promoter elements were extremely difficult to predictably identify (18van der Merwe G.K. van Vuuren H.J.J. Cooper T.G. Curr. Genet. 2001; 39: 156-165Google Scholar). The promoter analysis data presented here therefore holds its greatest value in simply identifying over-represented sequences to indicate which transcription factors are likely to be active. This can be used to indicate what regulons underlie the observed metabolic adaptations to nutrient-limited growth. This knowledge can be useful for the metabolic engineering of global gene regulation.Transcriptional Information to Identify Nutrient-limited GrowthDevelopment of array-based diagnostic approaches requires clear definitions of the nature of gene changes in response to environmental conditions. Our experimental approach forms the basis for this information by studying growth that was limited by each of four nutrients that are assimilated by the cell to form the principle components of biomass. Although each of the 484 genes identified above is subject to regulation that is specific for one nutrient limitation, further refinement of this list can provide identifier genes whose changes are clearly recognizable even in the absence of reference situations. We therefore searched these genes for specific increases or decreases whose magnitude was at least 10-fold in comparisons with each others' nutrient limitation. This resulted in 54 transcripts, of which 48 were specifically higher, and 6 were specifically lower in a single limitation (Table IV). With the ease of custom array design and array technologies that hugely reduce the time from sample to signal, it is conceivable that transcript signals using these open reading frames can be used in a control loop to ensure successful fermentations when media composition is unknown.Table IVList of diagnostic genes that are indicative of growth limited by either carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfurGene nameSystematic nameGrowth-limiting nutrientCarbonNitrogenPhosphorusSulfurSpecific identifiers for carbon-limited growthYBR116C235.1 ± 1014-aRepresents the average signal from three independent biological replicates ± S.D.<124-b<12, genes whose expression were not reliably detectable.19.2 ± 5<12 TKL2YBR117C138.5 ± 67<12<12<12YCR010C1032.0 ± 149<12<12<12YDL085W307.1 ± 9022.8 ± 318.5 ± 5<12CTA1YDR256C1239.3 ± 241<12<12<12YDR384C1543.4 ± 6235.5 ± 751.4 ± 423.2 ± 3YER024W713.8 ± 17253.9 ± 1154.7 ± 1270.6 ± 7POX1YGL205W246.7 ± 2713.6 ± 215.6 ± 512.4 ± 2YGR043C310.8 ± 13619.6 ± 012.2 ± 214.8 ± 2YGR236C351.5 ± 161<12<12<12HXT5YHR096C1207.9 ± 34239.1 ± 625.5 ± 467.3 ± 17YIL057C1984.0 ± 150<12<12<12POT1YIL160C1083.7 ± 36565.3 ± 575.3 ± 1434.4 ± 6SFC1YJR095W507.1 ± 30<12<12<12JEN1YKL217W1943.4 ± 14339.5 ± 442.0 ± 1318.2 ± 8IDP2YLR174W669.0 ± 8751.8 ± 934.3 ± 1541.0 ± 5FBP1YLR377C214.4 ± 30<12<12<12YMR107W2622.7 ± 320<12<1215.9 ± 1YMR118C325.4 ± 18117.4 ± 2<12<12SIP18YMR175W954.8 ± 211<1224.0 ± 6<12YMR206W349.8 ± 4929.1 ± 915.0 ± 3<12ADH2YMR303C3255.2 ± 124922.5 ± 452.1 ± 1537.3 ± 0YNL195C381.7 ± 13435.4 ± 1335.7 ± 1021.9 ± 3FUN34YNR002C1617.8 ± 14842.9 ± 1487.2 ± 677.2 ± 9YOL101C141.9 ± 39<12<12<12FDH1YOR388C2028.9 ± 529<1215.0 ± 2<12YPL201C501.8 ± 123<12<12<12YPL276W1041.7 ± 307<12<12<12CIT3YPR001W376.3 ± 66<12<12<12HXT3YDR345C83.9 ± 202359.7 ± 1431931.0 ± 971488.4 ± 79HXT1YHR094C14.1 ± 3313.1 ± 11532.6 ± 157432.9 ± 28Specific identifiers for nitrogen-limited growthDAL4YIR028W20.5 ± 2238.4 ± 2123.6 ± 9<12CPS1YJL172W32.4 ± 14333.4 ± 15025.3 ± 823.1 ± 5DAL5YJR152W90.8 ± 182436.8 ± 168102.3 ± 15105.5 ± 7DAL80YKR034W12.7 ± 3829.6 ± 18044.4 ± 7<12YMR088C102.6 ± 231280.1 ± 2881.6 ± 1295.1 ± 6YPR194C<121426.6 ± 11491.4 ± 29<12Specific identifiers for phosphorus-limited growthPHOL1YAR071W55.2 ± 3768.2 ± 122357.2 ± 11444.7 ± 4GIT1YCR09SC13.3 ± 812.7 ± 4983.3 ± 118<12YDR281C28.2 ± 2649.8 ± 12960.1 ± 9022.4 ± 6SPL2YHR136C60.8 ± 85<121267.3 ± 84<12SUL1YBR294W1035.2 ± 67487.2 ± 3142.0 ± 81885.4 ± 397Specific identifiers for sulfur-limited growthAGP3YFL055W31.6 ± 5<12<12773.8 ± 111PDC6YGR087C66.0 ± 44161.1 ± 3037.4 ± 71874.3 ± 236YIL166C22.3 ± 321.7 ± 224.3 ± 41650.4 ± 271YLL056C45.5 ± 940.1 ± 753.7 ± 11588.3 ± 27YLL057C<12<12<122232.7 ± 354YLL058W25.0 ± 225.6 ± 326.8 ± 4596.0 ± 9YOL162W13.8 ± 432.4 ± 313.2 ± 6614.7 ± 39YOL163W<1221.9 ± 4<12638.0 ± 20YOL164W25.9 ± 1240.8 ± 841.6 ± 121738.9 ± 193YRO2YBR054W451.3 ± 170375.6 ± 49606.2 ± 8319.2 ± 5SCS3YGL126W369.3 ± 290438.9 ± 206602.7 ± 251<12CTR3YLR411W1039.9 ± 139439.0 ± 29345.3 ± 5726.6 ± 5Genes are represented here whose average abundance in one condition differed by more than 10-fold from its abundance in all three other conditions.4-a Represents the average signal from three independent biological replicates ± S.D.4-b <12, genes whose expression were not reliably detectable. Open table in a new tab Growth of microorganisms in their natural environment and in many industrial applications is often limited by nutrient availability (1Pretorius I.S. Yeast. 2000; 16: 675-729Google Scholar,2Attfield P.V. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1351-1357Google Scholar). In these situations the specific growth rate of the organism is determined by the low (non-saturating) concentration of a single nutrient. For example, in the industrial production of bakers' yeast sugar-limited, aerobic cultivation at relatively low specific growth rates is essential to achieve high biomass yields. On the other hand processes such as beer fermentation occur at high concentrations of fermentable sugars and are limited by other nutrients (e.g.oxygen, nitrogen). As a result the yeast's metabolic activities are altered. This situation is different from nutrient starvation in which the absence of a nutritional component is often the cause of stress responses that result in growth arrest or cell death (3Werner-Washburne M. Braun E.L. Crawford M.E. Peck V.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1159-1166Google Scholar, 4Gasch A.P. Werner-Washburne M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 181-192Google Scholar). In the laboratory, cultivation of microorganisms is predominantly performed in shake-flasks, in which all relevant nutrients are at least initially present in excess. During the course of batch cultivation the physical and chemical environment constantly changes, which directly affects the specific growth rate and the regulation of many metabolic processes (5Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Google Scholar). With the use of chemostat cultures, it is possible to study steady-state physiological adaptations to nutrient-limited growth. The medium that is continuously fed into the culture can be designed such that growth is limited by a single, defined nutrient, whereas all other nutrients remain present in excess. In conjunction with this continuous feed of fresh media into the vessel, waste media and cells are removed at the same rate. This results in a constant dilution rate (h−1) which in steady-state cultures is equal to the specific growth rate μ (6Harder W. Kuenen J.G. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1977; 43: 1-24Google Scholar). This offers the unique possibility to study metabolism and its regulation at a fixed and constant specific growth rate under tightly defined nutritional conditions. Microorganisms have evolved a multitude of strategies to cope with nutrient limitations. Low, growth-limiting amounts of important nutrients often lead to the induction of high affinity transport systems and/or metabolic systems that allow more efficient incorporation of the nutrients into biomass constituents. A classical example is the high affinity glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutatrate aminotransferase system from Klebsiella pneumoniae (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes) that can replace glutamate dehydrogenase as the primary ammonia-assimilating enzyme system during ammonia-limited growth (7Tempest D.W. Meers J.L. Brown C.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 117: 405-407Google Scholar). In other cases, the final biomass composition itself has a reduced content of the growth-limiting nutrient. For example, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, it has been observed that the amino acid composition of the subset of structural enzymes used in the assimilation of sulfur, carbon, or nitrogen have a reduced content of the respective element compared with their average content in the predicted proteome (8Baudouin-Cornu P. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Marliere P. Thomas D. Science. 2001; 293: 297-300Google Scholar). The physiological responses of microorganisms to different nutrient limitation regimes can be regulated at various levels. At the level of transcription, DNA microarrays allow the accurate, genome-wide mapping of regulatory responses. With few exceptions (9Ter Linde J.J.M. Liang H. Davis R.W.

Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37001-37008Google Scholar) DNA microarray analyses have been performed using cells grown in shake flasks. With the use of chemostats, detailed analyses of the transcriptional responses of S. cerevisiae to nutrient limitations may aid in the development of new, DNA array-based approaches for diagnosis of industrial fermentation processes. Furthermore, such studies provide valuable information for the functional analysis of genes whose encoded protein has no known or only poorly defined function. However, as yet there have been no systematic investigations into the impact on genome-wide transcriptional regulation of different nutrient limitation regimes in chemostat cultures. The main chemical elements that are assimilated into yeast biomass are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus (13Lange H.C. Heijnen J.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 75: 334-344Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory already addressed the imp"

This octanoyl modification is essential for ghrelin-induced GH release. We report here the purification and identification of human ghrelin from the stomach, as well as structural analysis of the human ghrelin gene and quantitation of changes in plasma ghrelin concentration before and after gastrectomy. Human ghrelin was purified from the stomach by gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography, using a ghrelin-specific radioimmunoassay and an intracellular calcium influx assay on a stable cell line expressing GHS-R to test the fractions. In the course of purification, we isolated human ghrelin of the expected size, as well as several other ghrelin-derived molecules. Classified into four groups by the type of acylation observed at Ser3; these peptides were found to be non-acylated, octanoylated (C8:0), decanoylated (C10:0), and possibly decenoylated (C10:1). All peptides found were either 27 or 28 amino acids in length, the former lacking the C-terminal Arg28, and are derived from the same ghrelin precursor through two alternative pathways. The major active form of human ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide octanoylated at Ser3, as was found for rat ghrelin. Synthetic octanoylated and decanoylated ghrelins produce intracellular calcium increases in GHS-R-expressing cells and stimulate GH release in rats to a similar degree. Both ghrelin and the ghrelin-derived molecules were found to be present in plasma as well as stomach tissue. Plasma levels of immunoreactive ghrelin after total gastrectomy in three patients were reduced to approximately half of their pre-gastrectomy values, after which they gradually increased. This suggests that the stomach is the major source of circulating ghrelin and that other tissues compensate for the loss of ghrelin production after gastrectomy.

Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid peptide capable of stimulating GH release in vitro and in vivo, has a unique n-octanoyl modification at its third serine residue (Ser3), which is essential for this function (9Takaya K.

Subsequently, des-Gln14-ghrelin, also isolated from rat stomach, was identified as a second endogenous ligand for GHS-R (12Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Des-Gln14-ghrelin is produced from the ghrelin gene by an alternative splicing mechanism and is also octanoylated at Ser3.In the present study, we purified human ghrelin from the stomach, using a ghrelin-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) (13Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and an intracellular calcium influx assay on a stable cell line expressing GHS-R (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M.

During the course of purification, we noticed several minor peptides with characteristics different from standard ghrelin that displayed ghrelin-like activity. We identified these stomach peptides as ghrelin-derived molecules and examined the levels of ghrelin as well as these ghrelin-derived molecules in human plasma.The ghrelin gene is abundantly expressed in rat (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar) and human (14Ariyasu H. Takaya K. Tagami T. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Akamizu T.

Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 15Date Y. Kojima M. Hosoda H. Sawaguchi A. Mondal M.S. Suganuma T. Matsukura S. Kangawa K. Nakazato M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4255-4261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results prompted us to question whether ghrelin should be drastically reduced following gastrectomy. To address this question, we examined the change in plasma levels of immunoreactive ghrelin (ir-ghrelin) in humans before and after total gastrectomy.DISCUSSIONHere, we reported the purification and characterization of human ghrelin and the other minor ghrelin-derived molecules from the stomach. The major active form of human ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide with an n-octanoyl modification at Ser3. This peptide is identical to rat ghrelin with the exception of two residues (Arg11-Val12). The ghrelin-derived molecules we observed include octanoyl ghrelin-(1–27), decanoyl ghrelin, decanoyl ghrelin-(1–27), and decenoyl ghrelin. Moreover, the non-active forms des-acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin-(1–27) were also present in the human stomach. As described, we were able to classify human ghrelin and the ghrelin-derived molecules into two groups on the basis of amino acid length and into four groups by type of acylation at Ser3. Furthermore, all of these molecular forms of ghrelin were found in human plasma as well as in the stomach. In human stomach, the processing product ratio of 27-amino acid to 28-amino acid ghrelins was observed to be ∼1:3.It is likely that the 27- and 28-amino acid ghrelin molecules isolated in this study are produced through alternative C-terminal processing of the same ghrelin precursor. It is well known that peptide hormones are cleaved by processing proteases to product multiple forms, such as the enkephalins (16Noda M. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Toyosato M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 295: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), endorphins, dynorphins (17Kakidani H. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Noda M. Morimoto Y. Hirose T. Asai M. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 298: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), corticotropins, and β-lipotropins (18Nakanishi S. Inoue A. Kita T. Nakamura M. Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. Numa S. Nature. 1979; 278: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Many of the known proteolytic precursor cleavage events occur at pairs of basic amino acid residues (Lys or Arg), and both basic residues are usually absent from the resultant products (19Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Glembotski C.C. Dores R.M. Trends Neurosci. 1983; 6: 229-235Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, some proteolytic cleavages, as in the case of cholecystokinin, occur immediately after a C-terminal single basic residue (especially Arg) (20Takahashi Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Wakabayashi T. Ohtsuka E. Matsuki S. Ikehara M. Matsubara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1931-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ghrelin-(1–28) may fit into this category, because cleavage to produce this peptide occurs following the C-terminal Pro27-Arg28. Interestingly, this basic arginine residue remains at the C terminus of ghrelin-(1–28) but is removed from ghrelin-(1–27) (which terminates in proline). A similar cleavage profile is seen in the case of α-neo-endorphin (YGGFLRKY-Pro-Lys) (21Kangawa K. Minamino N. Chino N. Sakakibara S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and β-neo-endorphin (YGGFLRKY-Pro) (22Minamino N. Kangawa K. Chino N. Sakakibara S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whose precursor possesses the Lys-Arg basic pair followed by a C-terminal proline. It is thought that production of these peptides occurs through cleavage at the C terminus of paired basic Lys-Arg residues, followed by removal of the C-terminal basic residue by a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme (23Weber E. Evans C.J. Chang J. Barchas J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptide bonds involving proline are resistant to common proteases such as this. However, the removal of C-terminal lysine in α-neo-endorphin occurs partially to generate β-neo-endorphin. In a similar manner, ghrelin-(1–27) may be produced by removal of the C-terminal arginine of ghrelin-(1–28) by a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme. Although ghrelin-(1–27) was present only at a very low level in rat stomach, it is likely that these processing mechanisms control of the maturation of human ghrelin.The human prepro-ghrelin we isolated is predicted to encoded a 117-residue precursor peptide. We previously reported that there are two types of ghrelin precursors from rat stomach cDNA analysis, a 117-amino acid precursor (prepro-ghrelin) and a 116-amino acid precursor (prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin) (12Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Des-Gln14-ghrelin, a splice variant of ghrelin, is the second endogenous ligand for the GHS-R. Only a small percentage of the ghrelin clones isolated from the human stomach library encoded the des-Gln14-ghrelin precursor, and the des-Gln14-ghrelin peptide was not identified in human stomach. The ratios observed between the two precursor populations, ghrelin and des-Gln14- ghrelin, was 5 to 1 in rat stomach, and 6 to 5 in mouse stomach (24Tanaka M. Hayashida Y. Iguchi T. Nakao N. Nakai N. Nakashima K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3697-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These differences are likely species-specific.Ghrelin was the first example discovered of a bioactive peptide modified by an n-octanoic acid moiety. Although acyl modification of many proteins has been observed, including G-proteins and some G-protein-coupled receptors, the modifications are most often myristoylations (25Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and palmitoylations (26Linder M.E. Middleton P. Hepler J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this study, we further showed that ghrelin can be modified byn-decanoic acid. All of the acyl-modified ghrelins and ghrelin-derived molecules studied here have the same potency to induce an increase of [Ca2+]i in the GHS-R-expressing cells and stimulate GH release in anesthetized rats, and de novo synthesis of molecules concretely demonstrated that octanoic acid is not the only Ser3 modification that will confer full activity to ghrelin (27Bednarek M.A. Feighner S.D. Pong S.S. McKee K.K. Hreniuk D.L. Silva M.V. Warren V.A. Howard A.D. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Heck J.V. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4370-4376Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 28Matsumoto M.

We recently reported the identification of bullfrog ghrelin acylated with n-decanoic acid and found that this ghrelin species comprises 33% of total isolated bullfrog ghrelin (29Kaiya H. Kojima M. Hosoda H. Koda A. Yamamoto K. Kitajima Y. Matsumoto M. Minamitake Y. Kikuyama S. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40441-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the human stomach, the ratio of octanoylated to decanoylated ghrelin was found to be roughly 3:1. Because acylation of ghrelin is essential for its activity, the enzyme that catalyzes this modification step should be an important regulator of ghrelin biosynthesis. However, the mechanism by which ghrelin is acylated during post-translational processing is still unclear.We also analyzed the change in human plasma ir-ghrelin levels before and after total gastrectomy. We already reported that plasma levels of ir-ghrelin in totally gastrectomized patients were reduced to 35% of those in normal controls (14Ariyasu H. Takaya K. Tagami T. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Akamizu T. Suda M. Koh T. Natsui K. Toyooka S. Shirakami G. Usui T. Shimatsu A. Doi K. Hosoda H. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4753-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In this study, C-RIA was used due to the instability of acylated ghrelin relative to its des-acylated counterpart, making its measurement from stored plasma samples unreliable. Plasma levels of ir-ghrelin were promptly reduced by approximately half within 30 min after total gastrectomy. Half-lives after intravenous administration of human ghrelin was about 10 min (30Nagaya N. Kojima M. Uematsu M. Yamagishi M. Hosoda H. Oya H. Hayashi Y. Kangawa K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1483-R1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the levels then began to increase in these cases, and in one patient even completely normalized. Significant amounts of ir-ghrelin were detected in the rat duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon (13Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), suggesting that these organs may be responsible for this compensation.Further work will be required to determine the physiological significance of the various different forms of human ghrelin and ghrelin-related peptides discovered during the course of this study. Although all of these molecules displayed similar dose-response profiles from the tests performed in this study, it is possible that the various ghrelin forms have different signaling properties or stability. Growth hormone (GH)1secretion from the pituitary gland is regulated by two hypothalamic hormones, growth hormone-releasing hormone and somatostatin (1Muller E.E. Locatelli V. Cocchi D. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 511-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Tannenbaum G.S. Ling N. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A third independent pathway responsible for regulation of GH release has recently emerged from studies of artificial GH secretagogues (GHSs) (3Bowers C.Y. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1998; 54: 1316-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,4Smith R.G. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Cheng K. Hickey G.J. Wyvratt M.J., Jr. Fisher M.H. Nargund R.P.

GHSs are synthetic compounds that are potent stimulators of pituitary GH release, acting through the GHS receptor (GHS-R) (5Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Cully D.F. Arena J.P. Liberator P.A.

Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar). Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid peptide capable of stimulating GH release in vitro and in vivo, has a unique n-octanoyl modification at its third serine residue (Ser3), which is essential for this function (9Takaya K. Ariyasu H. Kanamoto N. Iwakura H. Yoshimoto A. Harada M. Mori K. Komatsu Y. Usui T. Shimatsu A. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Akamizu T. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 143: R7-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Subsequently, des-Gln14-ghrelin, also isolated from rat stomach, was identified as a second endogenous ligand for GHS-R (12Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Des-Gln14-ghrelin is produced from the ghrelin gene by an alternative splicing mechanism and is also octanoylated at Ser3. In the present study, we purified human ghrelin from the stomach, using a ghrelin-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) (13Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and an intracellular calcium influx assay on a stable cell line expressing GHS-R (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar, 12Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). During the course of purification, we noticed several minor peptides with characteristics different from standard ghrelin that displayed ghrelin-like activity. We identified these stomach peptides as ghrelin-derived molecules and examined the levels of ghrelin as well as these ghrelin-derived molecules in human plasma. The ghrelin gene is abundantly expressed in rat (8Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7159) Google Scholar) and human (14Ariyasu H. Takaya K. Tagami T. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Akamizu T. Suda M. Koh T. Natsui K. Toyooka S. Shirakami G.

Metab. 2001; 86: 4753-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) stomach, and in the rat, no other major sources of ghrelin production have been observed (13Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 15Date Y. Kojima M. Hosoda H. Sawaguchi A. Mondal M.S. Suganuma T. Matsukura S. Kangawa K. Nakazato M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4255-4261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results prompted us to question whether ghrelin should be drastically reduced following gastrectomy. To address this question, we examined the change in plasma levels of immunoreactive ghrelin (ir-ghrelin) in humans before and after total gastrectomy. DISCUSSIONHere, we reported the purification and characterization of human ghrelin and the other minor ghrelin-derived molecules from the stomach. The major active form of human ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide with an n-octanoyl modification at Ser3. This peptide is identical to rat ghrelin with the exception of two residues (Arg11-Val12). The ghrelin-derived molecules we observed include octanoyl ghrelin-(1–27), decanoyl ghrelin, decanoyl ghrelin-(1–27), and decenoyl ghrelin. Moreover, the non-active forms des-acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin-(1–27) were also present in the human stomach. As described, we were able to classify human ghrelin and the ghrelin-derived molecules into two groups on the basis of amino acid length and into four groups by type of acylation at Ser3. Furthermore, all of these molecular forms of ghrelin were found in human plasma as well as in the stomach. In human stomach, the processing product ratio of 27-amino acid to 28-amino acid ghrelins was observed to be ∼1:3.It is likely that the 27- and 28-amino acid ghrelin molecules isolated in this study are produced through alternative C-terminal processing of the same ghrelin precursor. It is well known that peptide hormones are cleaved by processing proteases to product multiple forms, such as the enkephalins (16Noda M. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Toyosato M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 295: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), endorphins, dynorphins (17Kakidani H. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Noda M. Morimoto Y. Hirose T. Asai M. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 298: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), corticotropins, and β-lipotropins (18Nakanishi S. Inoue A. Kita T. Nakamura M. Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. Numa S. Nature. 1979; 278: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Many of the known proteolytic precursor cleavage events occur at pairs of basic amino acid residues (Lys or Arg), and both basic residues are usually absent from the resultant products (19Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Glembotski C.C. Dores R.M. Trends Neurosci. 1983; 6: 229-235Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, some proteolytic cleavages, as in the case of cholecystokinin, occur immediately after a C-terminal single basic residue (especially Arg) (20Takahashi Y. Kato K. Hayashizaki Y. Wakabayashi T. Ohtsuka E. Matsuki S. Ikehara M. Matsubara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1931-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ghrelin-(1–28) may fit into this category, because cleavage to produce this peptide occurs following the C-terminal Pro27-Arg28. Interestingly, this basic arginine residue remains at the C terminus of ghrelin-(1–28) but is removed from ghrelin-(1–27) (which terminates in proline). A similar cleavage profile is seen in the case of α-neo-endorphin (YGGFLRKY-Pro-Lys) (21Kangawa K. Minamino N. Chino N. Sakakibara S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and β-neo-endorphin (YGGFLRKY-Pro) (22Minamino N. Kangawa K. Chino N. Sakakibara S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whose precursor possesses the Lys-Arg basic pair followed by a C-terminal proline. It is thought that production of these peptides occurs through cleavage at the C terminus of paired basic Lys-Arg residues, followed by removal of the C-terminal basic residue by a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme (23Weber E. Evans C.J. Chang J. Barchas J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Peptide bonds involving proline are resistant to common proteases such as this. However, the removal of C-terminal lysine in α-neo-endorphin occurs partially to generate β-neo-endorphin. In a similar manner, ghrelin-(1–27) may be produced by removal of the C-terminal arginine of ghrelin-(1–28) by a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme. Although ghrelin-(1–27) was present only at a very low level in rat stomach, it is likely that these processing mechanisms control of the maturation of human ghrelin.The human prepro-ghrelin we isolated is predicted to encoded a 117-residue precursor peptide. We previously reported that there are two types of ghrelin precursors from rat stomach cDNA analysis, a 117-amino acid precursor (prepro-ghrelin) and a 116-amino acid precursor (prepro-des-Gln14-ghrelin) (12Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Des-Gln14-ghrelin, a splice variant of ghrelin, is the second endogenous ligand for the GHS-R. Only a small percentage of the ghrelin clones isolated from the human stomach library encoded the des-Gln14-ghrelin precursor, and the des-Gln14-ghrelin peptide was not identified in human stomach. The ratios observed between the two precursor populations, ghrelin and des-Gln14- ghrelin, was 5 to 1 in rat stomach, and 6 to 5 in mouse stomach (24Tanaka M. Hayashida Y. Iguchi T. Nakao N. Nakai N.

We recently reported the identification of bullfrog ghrelin acylated with n-decanoic acid and found that this ghrelin species comprises 33% of total isolated bullfrog ghrelin (29Kaiya H. Kojima M.

All of the acyl-modified ghrelins and ghrelin-derived molecules studied here have the same potency to induce an increase of [Ca2+]i in the GHS-R-expressing cells and stimulate GH release in anesthetized rats, and de novo synthesis of molecules concretely demonstrated that octanoic acid is not the only Ser3 modification that will confer full activity to ghrelin (27Bednarek M.A. Feighner S.D.

We recently reported the identification of bullfrog ghrelin acylated with n-decanoic acid and found that this ghrelin species comprises 33% of total isolated bullfrog ghrelin (29Kaiya H. Kojima M. Hosoda H. Koda A. Yamamoto K. Kitajima Y. Matsumoto M. Minamitake Y. Kikuyama S. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40441-40448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the human stomach, the ratio of octanoylated to decanoylated ghrelin was found to be roughly 3:1. Because acylation of ghrelin is essential for its activity, the enzyme that catalyzes this modification step should be an important regulator of ghrelin biosynthesis. However, the mechanism by which ghrelin is acylated during post-translational processing is still unclear. We also analyzed the change in human plasma ir-ghrelin levels before and after total gastrectomy. We already reported that plasma levels of ir-ghrelin in totally gastrectomized patients were reduced to 35% of those in normal controls (14Ariyasu H. Takaya K. Tagami T. Ogawa Y. Hosoda K. Akamizu T. Suda M. Koh T. Natsui K. Toyooka S. Shirakami G. Usui T. Shimatsu A. Doi K. Hosoda H. Kojima M. Kangawa K. Nakao K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4753-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In this study, C-RIA was used due to the instability of acylated ghrelin relative to its des-acylated counterpart, making its measurement from stored plasma samples unreliable. Plasma levels of ir-ghrelin were promptly reduced by approximately half within 30 min after total gastrectomy. Half-lives after intravenous administration of human ghrelin was about 10 min (30Nagaya N. Kojima M. Uematsu M. Yamagishi M. Hosoda H. Oya H. Hayashi Y. Kangawa K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: R1483-R1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the levels then began to increase in these cases, and in one patient even completely normalized. Significant amounts of ir-ghrelin were detected in the rat duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon (13Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), suggesting that these organs may be responsible for this compensation. Further work will be required to determine the physiological significance of the various different forms of human ghrelin and ghrelin-related peptides discovered during the course of this study. Although all of these molecules displayed similar dose-response profiles from the tests performed in this study, it is possible that the various ghrelin forms have different signaling properties or stability.

https://openalex.org/W2130092916,"The oxysterol receptors LXR (liver X receptor)-alpha and LXRbeta are nuclear receptors that play a key role in regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. We found that LXRs also play a significant role in glucose metabolism. Treatment of diabetic rodents with the LXR agonist, T0901317, resulted in dramatic reduction of plasma glucose. In insulin-resistant Zucker (fa/fa) rats, T0901317 significantly improved insulin sensitivity. Activation of LXR did not induce robust adipogenesis but rather inhibited the expression of several genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Hepatic glucose output was dramatically reduced as a result of this regulation. Nuclear run-on studies indicated that transcriptional repression was primarily responsible for the inhibition of PEPCK by the LXR agonist. In addition, we show that the regulation of the liver gluconeogenic pathway by LXR agonists was a direct effect on hepatocytes. These data not only suggest that LXRs are novel targets for diabetes but also reveal an unanticipated role for these receptors, further linking lipid and glucose metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2154691560,"The evolution of complex organs is a source of controversy because they require the contributions of many adaptations to function properly. We argue that placentas are complex, that they have evolved multiple times in Poeciliopsis, and that there are closely related sister taxa that have either no placentas or intermediate stages in the evolution of a placenta. Furthermore, placentas can evolve in 750,000 years or less, on the same time scale as suggested by theoretical calculations for the evolution of complex eyes. Independent origins of such complexity, accompanied by sister taxa that either lack or have intermediate stages in the evolution of the trait, present an opportunity to study the evolution of novelty and complexity from a comparative, evolutionary perspective."

However, examples of such patterns in ecological systems are scarce. We develop a quantitative technique to demonstrate the existence of waves in Central European larch budmoth ( Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) outbreaks. We show that these waves travel toward the northeast-east at 210 kilometers per year. A theoretical model involving a moth-enemy interaction predicts directional waves, but only if dispersal is directionally biased or habitat productivity varies across the landscape. Our study confirms that nonlinear ecological interactions can lead to complex spatial dynamics at a regional scale."

Here we validate a climate model, with and without indirect aerosol effects, by using satellite observations. The model agrees better with observations when both indirect aerosol effects are included. However, the simulated clouds are more susceptible to aerosols than the observed clouds from the POLDER satellite, thus overestimating the indirect aerosol effect. By taking the difference in susceptibilities into account, the global mean total anthropogenic aerosol effect is reduced from –1.4 to –0.85 watts per square meter."

https://openalex.org/W2046177079,"Peroxynitrite is thought to be a nitric oxide-derived neurotoxic effector molecule involved in the disruption of key energy-related metabolic targets. To assess the consequences of such interference in cellular glucose metabolism and viability, we studied the possible modulatory role played by peroxynitrite in glucose oxidation in neurons and astrocytes in primary culture. Here, we report that peroxynitrite triggered rapid stimulation of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity and the accumulation of NADPH, an essential cofactor for glutathione regeneration. In contrast to peroxynitrite, nitric oxide elicited NADPH depletion, glutathione oxidation, and apoptotic cell death in neurons, but not in astrocytes. These events were noticeably counteracted by pretreatment of neurons with peroxynitrite. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism responsible for this PPP stimulation and neuroprotection, we found evidence consistent with both exogenous and endogenous peroxynitrite-mediated activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in the PPP. Moreover, functional overexpression of the G6PD gene in stably transformed PC12 cells induced NADPH accumulation and offered remarkable resistance against nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis, whereas G6PD gene-targeted antisense inhibition depleted NADPH levels and exacerbated cellular vulnerability. In light of these results, we suggest that G6PD activation represents a novel role for peroxynitrite in neuroprotection against nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis.

Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar for a review). In neurons and astrocytes,⋅NO is produced through the activation of a constitutive calcium-dependent neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and participates in the signaling pathway, leading to rises in cGMP levels (2Garthwaite J.

In addition, astrocytes have the ability to form ⋅NO in a calcium-independent fashion that requires prior transcriptional expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase isoform by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1and/or certain cytokines (5Murphy S.

Under certain neuropathological situations, however, excessive or inappropriate ⋅NO biosynthesis (nitrosative stress) is followed by a reaction of⋅NO with superoxide (O2⨪) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a pro-oxidant molecule thought to execute the neurotoxic ⋅NO-mediated responses (7Beckman J.S.

With respect to the neurotoxicity elicited by inappropriate ⋅NO biosynthesis, the intracellular content of glutathione (GSH) appears to play a key role in dictating cellular vulnerability. Thus, ⋅NO and peroxynitrite potently oxidize sulfhydryls, including GSH (11Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Clancy R.M. Levartovsky D. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Yegudin J. Abramson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Accordingly, neuronal GSH oxidation has been proposed to be a contributing factor leading to the mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity associated with nitrosative stress (13Bolaños J.P.

Unlike neurons, astrocytes are cells that efficiently maintain GSH in its reduced redox status, even under conditions of excessive endogenous⋅NO formation (16Bolaños J.P. Peuchen S. Heales S.J.R.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) involved in such different cellular abilities to restore GSH levels is an issue that remains to be elucidated. Hepatocytes are cells prone to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (18Spolarics Z. Stein D.S. Garcı́a Z.C. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 691-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of this pathway in neurons (20Ben-Yoseph O. Boxer P.A. Ross B.D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and astrocytes (21Kussmaul L. Hamprecht B. Dringen R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has been proposed to elicit a protective action against H2O2 toxicity through the PPP activity-mediated production of NADPH, a cofactor necessary for GSH regeneration from oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (22Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K.W. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar,23Salvemini F. Franzé A. Iervolino A. Filosa S. Salzano S. Ursini M.V. J. Biol.

A similar protective mechanism has also been reported for Jurkat human T cells, where targeted inactivation of transaldolase,i.e. the rate-limiting step in the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, prevents the GSH oxidation and apoptosis caused by a number of pro-oxidant compounds, including ⋅NO (24Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In keeping with the above-mentioned studies, we reported previously that glucose utilization through the PPP in LPS-stimulated astrocytes offers self-protection against endogenous ⋅NO-mediated GSH oxidation (25Garcı́a-Nogales P. Almeida A. Fernández E. Medina J.M. Bolaños J.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because LPS-stimulated astrocytes synthesize O2⨪ through inducible nitric-oxide synthase-dependent activity (26Xia Y. Roman I.J. Masters B.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the peroxynitrite thus formed could be an effector molecule directly involved in the modulation of PPP activity. Here, we report that peroxynitrite elicited a rapid stimulation of PPP activity in both neurons and astrocytes through the activation of G6PD. Furthermore, we report strong evidence suggesting that such a phenomenon would be involved in the protection of neurons against ⋅NO-mediated glutathione oxidation and apoptosis. Peroxynitrite was synthesized and quantified spectrophotometrically (ε302 = 1670m−1 cm−1) as previously described (27Hughes, M. N., and Nicklin, H. G. (1968) J. Chem. Soc. Abstr. 450–452Google Scholar). Alkaline stock solutions with an approximate ONOO−concentration of 0.5 m were stable at −70 °C for at least 3–4 months. Nitric oxide was purchased from Al Air Liquide (Madrid, Spain) and extemporarily dissolved in O2-free water by 20-min bubbling until saturation. The concentration of⋅NO solutions was estimated with an ⋅NO electrode (ISO-NO, World Precision Instruments, Inc.) using the⋅NO-saturated solution as a standard (∼2 mm⋅NO). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), LPS, dihydrorhodamine 123, TEMPOL (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), and hemoglobin were obtained from Sigma.

Other substrates, enzymes, and coenzymes were purchased from Sigma, Roche Diagnostics, or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Astrocyte-rich primary cultures derived from neonatal 1-day-old Wistar rats were prepared as previously described (28Bolaños J.P. Peuchen S. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Heales S.J.R. Brain Res. Protoc. 1997; 1: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were plated in culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at a density of 1.25 × 105cells/cm2 in 175-cm2 flasks. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C with a change of medium twice a week. After 12–14 days, cells were collected by trypsinization and reseeded in culture medium at a density of 2.5 × 105cells/cm2 on appropriate plastic dishes. For the experiments, astrocytes were used 24 h after reseeding. Cerebral cortex neurons in primary culture were prepared from fetal rats at 16–17 days of gestation (29Almeida A. Medina J.M. Brain Res. Protoc. 1998; 2: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Dissociated cell suspensions were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105cells/cm2 on appropriate plastic dishes previously coated with poly-d-lysine (15 μg/ml) in culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Forty-eight hours after plating, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum and 20 mm d-glucose. On day 4 of culture, cytosine arabinoside was added (10 μm) to prevent non-neuronal proliferation. For the experiments, neurons were used on day 9. PC12 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Dionisio Martı́n-Zanca (Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain) and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 6% horse serum, and 20 mm glucose on collagen-coated plastic dishes. For selection and growth of stably transfected cells, this medium was supplemented with G418 (500 μg/ml). Full-length rat G6PD cDNA was subcloned into theEcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pEGFP (Clontech) and sequenced. Constructs with the G6PD gene inserted in the sense (pEGFP-G6PD-sense) or antisense (pEGFP-G6PD-antisense) orientation were selected. PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2and transfected by lipofection (TransFast) with pEGFP-G6PD-sense, pEGFP-G6PD-antisense, or pEGFP plasmid constructs following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were passaged and incubated in culture medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml), with a medium change twice a week to allow the selection of stably expressing clones. Isolated colonies were transferred to 12-well plates and expanded. Different clones were subjected to Northern blotting for G6PD mRNA identification as well as G6PD activity determination. Clones showing maximum (sense) or minimum (antisense) G6PD activities were used for the experiments. The activity of the PPP was measured essentially as described by Hothersall et al. (30Hothersall J.S. Baquer N.Z. Greenbaum A.L. McLean P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) based on the determination of the difference in 14CO2 production from [1-14C]glucose (decarboxylated by the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction and by the Krebs cycle) and from [6-14C]glucose (decarboxylated only by the Krebs cycle). Astrocytes and neurons grown in 175-cm2 flasks were collected by trypsinization. Cell pellets were resuspended in O2-saturated incubation buffer (11 mm sodium phosphate, 122 mm NaCl, 3.1 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, and 1.3 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Aliquots (500 μl) of the suspension were placed in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 2 μCi of d-[1-14C]glucose or 8 μCi of d-[6-14C]glucose (5.5 mm d-glucose) in either the absence (control) or presence of SIN-1 at the indicated concentrations. Each Erlenmeyer flask was equipped with a central well containing an Eppendorf tube containing benzethonium hydroxide. The flask atmosphere was flushed with O2 for 20 s, after which the flask was sealed with a rubber cap and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking. Incubations were stopped by injection into the main well of 0.2 ml of 1.75 m HClO4, although shaking was continued for a further 20 min to facilitate the entrapment of14CO2 by benzethonium hydroxide. The radioactivity trapped by benzethonium hydroxide was measured in scintillation fluid (Universol, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Irvine, CA) by liquid scintillation counting (98% efficiency; LS 6500, Beckman Instruments). Blanks without cells were used in parallel to measure background radioactivity, which was subtracted from the sample values. Preliminary experiments showed that, under these conditions, the14CO2 generated was linear with time, at least up to 30 min, in both control and SIN-1 (up to 1 mm)-treated cells. Protein contents were determined in 10-μl aliquots of the cell suspensions. For the calculations, the specific radioactivity (dpm/mol) of glucose was used, and the results are expressed as pmol of glucose transformed into CO2/min/mg of protein. For glutathione determinations, cells grown in 8-cm2 wells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately collected by scraping off with 1% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for glutathione determinations on the same day as previously described (25Garcı́a-Nogales P. Almeida A.

Total glutathione contents (GSx) were determined in comparison with GSSG standards (0–50 μm) treated in the same way as the samples. GSSG was quantified after derivatization of GSH with 2-vinylpyridine using similarly treated GSSG standards (0–5 μm). Results are expressed as the oxidized glutathione status ((GSSG/GSx) × 100) (33Dringen R. Pfeiffer B. Hamprecht B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 562-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells seeded on 4-cm2 plates were washed with ice-cold PBS, and 250 μl of 0.5 m KOH in 50% (v/v) ethanol was immediately added, as described by Stocchi et al. (34Stocchi V. Cucchiarini L. Magnani M. Chiarantini L. Palma P. Crescentini G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) for the stable extraction of both reduced and oxidized nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides. Aliquots (200 μl) of the cell lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, neutralized to a pH of 7.8 with 200 μl of 0.5 mtriethanolamine and 0.5 m potassium phosphate, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Fifty-microliter aliquots of the supernatant were immediately used for NADPH plus NADH determination by chemiluminescence as previously described (35Wulff K. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1985: 280-284Google Scholar). For NADPH determinations, NADH was previously oxidized by incubating the samples with 0.5 milliunits/μl lactate dehydrogenase and 1 mm pyruvate (36Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). For NADP+determinations, NADP+ was previously reduced by incubating the samples with 5 milliunits/ml G6PD, 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 5 mm MgSO4 (36Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1985: 251-271Google Scholar). For NAD+ determinations, NAD+ was previously reduced by incubating the samples with 5 milliunits/μl alcohol dehydrogenase and 172 mm ethanol (36Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M.

NADPH, NADH, NADP+, and NAD+ concentrations were calculated by extrapolation of the sample values to their respective appropriate standard curves obtained with pure standards (Sigma). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and deproteinized with 0.6 mHClO4. Cells were scraped off the plastic dishes and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After neutralization of the supernatants with 5 mK2CO3, the neutralized extracts were lyophilized and resuspended in 250 μl of water. Glucose 6-phosphate (37Michal G. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M.

Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1985: 220-227Google Scholar) concentrations were determined in these samples as described. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, to give a final protein concentration of ∼1 mg/ml and homogenized with a Ultraturrax T-8 homogenizer (Ika, Staufen, Germany), and G6PD activity was determined spectrophotometrically as previously described (39Deutsch J. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1983: 190-197Google Scholar). Enzyme activity is expressed as nmol of glucose 6-phosphate transformed per min/mg of protein. Northern blot analysis was carried out on total RNA samples isolated from the cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method as previously described (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed (15 μg of RNA/line) on a formaldehyde-containing 1% (w/v) agarose gel. After transfer to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cross-linking with ultraviolet irradiation (UV Stratalinker Model 2400, Genetic Research Instruments, Essex, UK), membranes were hybridized for 18 h at 65 °C in the presence of the appropriate random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled cDNA probes and exposed to Eastman Kodak XAR-5 film. As cDNA probes, we used either the 2.2-kb cDNA encoding the full-length rat G6PD gene (a generous gift from Dr. Ye-Shih Ho, Wayne State University) or a 0.7-kb cDNA fragment of the rat cyclophilin gene (generously donated by Dr. Dionisio Martı́n-Zanca). Cyclophilin mRNA was used as a control of the amount of total RNA loaded in each lane. Cells were scraped off the plastic dishes with lysis buffer (12.5 mm Na2HPO4, 116 mm NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 100 μm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7), and aliquots containing 100 μg of protein from each sample, extemporarily determined following the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using ovalbumin as a standard and the BenchMarkTM prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen), were electrophoresed on 10% acrylamide gel (MiniProtean®, Bio-Rad) and transferred to a Hybond® nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) low-fat milk/TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5) for 1 h and then incubated in the presence of the appropriate antibody (either anti-G6PD at 1:1000 dilution or anti-GFP at 1:250 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, membranes were further incubated in 3% (w/v) low-fat milk/TBST buffer for 45 min at room temperature in the presence of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody at 1:40,000 dilution and immediately incubated with the luminol chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 min before being exposed to HyperfilmTM chemiluminescence film for 3 min (anti-G6PD antibody) or 25 min (anti-GFP antibody). Astrocytes or neurons were removed from the flasks by mild trypsinization and resuspended at a density of 20 × 106 cells/ml in prewarmed (37 °C) buffered Hanks' solution (5.26 mm KCl, 0.43 mmKH2PO4, 132.4 mm NaCl, 4.09 mm NaHCO3, 0.33 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing streptolysin O (1 kilounit/ml) (42Stanton R.C. Seifter J.L. Boxer D.C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12442-12448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the protease inhibitor mixture (see above). Cells were incubated in either the absence (control) or presence of SIN-1 (1 mm) at 37 °C in a water bath with shaking for 30 min (astrocytes) or 5 min (neurons). When appropriate, some incubations were performed in the presence of a degraded SIN-1 solution (72 h at 37 °C). After the incubation period, aliquots of the cell suspension were centrifuged at 500 × g, and both the supernatants and pellets were subjected to anti-G6PD antibody Western blotting as described above. Films were scanned; the intensity of the bands was quantified; and the values were subtracted from the background intensity values using an image analyzer system (NIH Image), kindly supplied by Wayne Rasband (National Institutes of Health). To estimate the endogenous formation of peroxynitrite from astrocytes (43Vega-Agapito V. Almeida A. Hatzoglou M. Bolaños J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29753-29759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), cells were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 18 h in either the absence or presence of the peroxynitrite scavenger methionine (10 mm) (44Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24664-24670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite generation was shown by the ability of these cells to oxidize dihydrorhodamine 123 as previously described (45Dugan L.L. Sensi S.L. Canzoniero L.M.T. Handran S.D. Rothman S.M. Lin T.S. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6377-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cells were incubated with dihydrorhodamine 123 (1 μg/ml) in buffered Hanks' solution for 1 h at 37 °C, and rhodamine 123 fluorescence microphotographs were taken with an inverted microscope using a fluorescein filter (excitation filter, 480–490 nm; and emission filter, 510–560 nm). Early apoptotic cell death was determined after staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide using a commercially available kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Data acquisition (∼10,000 cells) was carried out in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with a 15-milliwatt argon ion laser tuned at 488 nm using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The analyzer threshold was adjusted on the FSC channel to exclude noise and most of the subcellular debris. Annexin V-stained cells that were propidium iodide-negative (annexin V+/propidium iodide−) were considered to be apoptotic. Proteins were determined in the cell lysates by the method of Lowry et al. (46Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. for the number of culture preparations indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis, followed by the least significant difference multiple range test. In all cases,p < 0.05 was considered significant. To address the potential involvement of peroxynitrite in the regulation of PPP activity, the differences in the rates of oxidation ofd-[1-14C]glucose andd-[6-14C]glucose to14CO2 (30Hothersall J.S. Baquer N.Z. Greenbaum A.L. McLean P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) during a 5-min incubation period were assessed in astrocytes and neurons in primary culture. Because of the extreme instability of authentic peroxynitrite solutions at physiological pH (half-life of ∼1.7 s), we used SIN-1 as the peroxynitrite donor (47Feelisch M. Ostrowski J. Noak E.A. J. Cardiosvasc. Pharmacol. 1989; 14: S13-S22Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 48Schrammel A. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments using the⋅NO-sensitive electrode (ISO-NO) (data not shown) suggested an approximate peroxynitrite formation from SIN-1 (1 mm) of ∼20 μm, as previously reported (48Schrammel A. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To ensure immediate maximum peroxynitrite release from SIN-1, all SIN-1-containing solutions were always preincubated in DMEM at 37 °C for 20 min before addition to the cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the PPP activity found in control astrocytes was ∼2.6-fold higher than that found in control neurons. Incubation of both cell types with SIN-1 dose-dependently increased the PPP activity to values ranging between ∼2- or ∼1.5-fold at 0.25 mm SIN-1 and up to ∼3.5- or ∼2.5-fold at 1 mm SIN-1 in astrocytes or neurons, respectively (Fig. 1 A). In all cases, the observed enhancement of PPP activity by peroxynitrite treatment was due to increased [1-14C]glucose oxidation, whereas [6-14C]glucose oxidation remained unaltered (data not shown). To investigate whether the observed activation of PPP activity by peroxynitrite was associated with NADPH generation, the intracellular concentrat"

AplidinTM induced a specific cellular stress response program, including sustained activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase Src, and the serine/threonine kinases JNK and p38 MAPK. AplidinTM-induced apoptosis was only partially blocked by the general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone and was also sensitive to AG1478 (an EGFR inhibitor), PP2 (an Src inhibitor), and SB203580 (an inhibitor of JNK and p38 MAPK) in MDA-MB-231 cells. Supporting a role for EGFR in AplidinTMaction, EGFR-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts underwent apoptosis upon treatment more slowly than wild-type EGFR fibroblasts and also showed delayed JNK and reduced p38 MAPK activation.N-Acetylcysteine and ebselen (but not other antioxidants such as diphenyleneiodonium, Tiron, catalase, ascorbic acid, and vitamin E) reduced EGFR activation by AplidinTM.N-Acetylcysteine and PP2 also partially inhibited JNK and p38 MAPK activation. The intracellular level of GSH affected AplidinTM action; pretreatment of cells with GSH orN-acetylcysteine inhibited, whereas GSH depletion caused, hyperinduction of EGFR, Src, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Remarkably, AplidinTM also induced apoptosis and activated EGFR, JNK, and p38 MAPK in two cell lines (A-498 and ACHN) derived from human renal cancer, a neoplasia that is highly refractory to chemotherapy.

In vitro, AplidinTM has potent cytotoxic activity against breast, colon, non-small cell lung, and prostate carcinoma and melanoma cells (2Lobo C. Garcı́a-Pozo S.G. Núñez de Castro I. Alonso F.J.

It has also shown strong antitumor activity in various xenograft models (4Faircloth, G., Hanauske, A., Depenbrock, H., Peter, R., Crews, C., Manzanares, I., Meely, K., Grant, W., and Jimeno, J.

AplidinTM has recently entered Phase II clinical trials in a variety of solid tumors upon showing promising toxicity and pharmacological properties in Phase I studies (5Raymond, E., Paz-Ares, L., Izquierdo, M., Belanger, K., Maroun, L., Bowman, A., Anthoney, A., Jodrell, D., Armand, J.

S32, Abstr. 197, Lisbon, PortugalGoogle Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism of action of AplidinTM. Early studies indicated that it exerts an antiproliferative effect through the inhibition of protein synthesis and reduction of ornithine decarboxylase activity (6Urdiales J.L. Morata P.

In addition, AplidinTMinhibits vascular endothelial factor secretion and autocrine stimulation in a human leukemia cell line (8Broggini, M., Marchini, S., D'Incalci, M., Taraboletti, G., Giavazzi, R., Faircloth, G., and Jimeno, J. in Proceedings of the 11th National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-American Association for Cancer Research Symposium on New Drugs in Cancer Therapy, November 7–10, 2000, p. 86, Abstr. 214, AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). Many anticancer drugs elicit apoptosis in cancer cells (9Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar, 10Fisher D.E.

Several studies have reported the activation of one or more members of the MAPK1 family of intracellular signaling kinases by cytotoxic agents. Among them, JNK and p38 MAPK and, less frequently, ERK1/2 play important roles in these apoptotic processes (12Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4450-4458PubMed Google Scholar). However, JNK and p38 MAPK are not always involved in apoptosis. They also promote proliferation, differentiation, or survival depending on the cell type and external stimulus (19Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger R.S. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21Hayakawa J.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). Interestingly, JNK is also activated by chemopreventive agents such as the isothiocyanates present in cruciferous vegetables (23Chen Y.-R. Wang W. Kong A.-N.T. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1769-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and has been shown to lie upstream of the caspase proteases that constitute the effector system in the apoptotic pathway (14Seimiya H. Mashima T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4631-4636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, in other cases, such as apoptosis induced by doxorubicin or γ-irradiation, caspase activation is independent of JNK (24Herr I. Wilhem D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of action of AplidinTM in human cancer cells, we chose the MDA-MB-231 breast cell line, which contains mutated p53 and ras genes and is highly invasive and proliferative. Here we report that AplidinTM induced rapid and sustained activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, JNK, and p38 MAPK. SB203580, an inhibitor of both JNK and p38 MAPK in these cells, substantially inhibited the cytotoxic effect of AplidinTM, suggesting an important role of these kinases in AplidinTMaction. These effects depend on a decrease in intracellular GSH. In addition, we found that EGFR activation by AplidinTM was partially mediated by Src, but was somehow abnormal because it did not lead to the same binding of Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins as that induced by EGF. In view of the promising effects observed in patients in Phase I studies, we extended the study to two lines, ACHN and A-498 cells (both wild-type p53), of renal cancer, a neoplasia highly refractory to chemotherapy. In these cells, AplidinTM also activated EGFR, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but did not affect the high endogenous level of active Src. MDA-MB-231, ACHN, and A-498 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mm glutamine (all from Invitrogen). Wild-type and EGFR-deficient (egfr −/−) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from Dr. E. Wagner (Institut für Molekulare Pathologie, Vienna, Austria). AplidinTM is manufactured by PharmaMar S. A. (Madrid, Spain). Stock solutions were freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in the cell culture to final concentrations as indicated. Ascorbic acid, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), Tiron, vitamin E ((+)-α-tocopherol acid succinate), catalase, H2O2, GSH, N-acetylcysteine, ebselen, l-buthionine (SR)-sulfoximine (BSO), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were from Sigma. PP2 (4-amino- 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-D]pyrimidine), tyrphostin AG1478,SB203580, and benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone caspase inhibitor were from Calbiochem. Human EGF was from PreproTech Ltd. Anti-JNK1, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-ERK, anti-human EGFR, anti-Grb2, and anti-Src antibodies (for Western blotting) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Src antibody (for immunoprecipitation) was generously donated by Dr. J. Brugge. Anti-phospho-JNK1, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-Src Tyr418, anti-phospho-Akt Ser348, anti-caspase-3 (active form), and anti-β-actin antibodies were from New England Biolabs Inc. Anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Shc antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-phospho-EGFR Tyr1068/Tyr1086/Tyr1148/Tyr1173antibodies were from BioSource, International. After treatment, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in a solution of chilled methanol/acetic acid (1:1) for 2 min. The fixed cells were washed with PBS, placed on slides, and stained with 2 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min. Excess dye was washed off with PBS. Nuclear morphology was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot). Cells after different treatments with AplidinTM and/or inhibitors were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). For staining, cells (1 × 106) were harvested, washed with PBS, and then fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were treated with DNase-free RNase for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, centrifuged, and incubated in PBS-containing propidium iodide (25 μg/ml). Forward light scatter characteristics were used to exclude the cell debris from the analysis. Apoptotic cells were determined by their hypochromic subdiploid staining profiles. To estimate early apoptotic cells, Alexa 488-conjugated annexin V (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used together with propidium iodide dead cell counterstain following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells (3.5 × 104) were seeded in 24-well dishes (Nunc). One day later, cells were treated or not with AplidinTM in normal growth medium and pulsed with 5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (AmershamBiosciences) for 30 min at the indicated times post-treatment. At the end of the labeling period, the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice in PBS and fixed with chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min. Trichloroacetic acid was then removed, and the monolayers were washed with ethanol and air-dried at room temperature for 20 min. Thereafter, precipitated macromolecules were dissolved in 500 μl of 0.5 n NaOH and 0.1% SDS, and 450 μl of each sample was diluted in 5 ml of OptiPhase HighSafe scintillation solution (Wallac). Radioactivity was measured on a 1209 RackBeta counter (Wallac). To estimate cell mass, the medium was removed, and 24-well dishes were washed with PBS, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, washed twice with PBS, and stained with 100 μl of 0.1% aqueous crystal violet for 20 min. Dishes were rinsed four times in tap water and allowed to dry. One-hundred μl of 10% acetic acid was added, and the content of each well was mixed before reading the absorbance at 595 nm. To study the effect of AplidinTM on the activity of different kinases (Src, p38 MAPK, JNK, ERK, and Akt), cells were preincubated for 24 h in serum-free medium. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated overnight with the corresponding antibody (1 μg/ml). After a 1-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose, immune complexes were washed three times with the same radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lacking deoxycholic acid and SDS and three times with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and electrophoresed on 8% (EGFR and PDGFR) or 12% (Src) acrylamide gels. For Western blot analysis, cell protein extracts were prepared following standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein extracts were electrophoresed on 8 or 15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.). The filters were washed, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 136 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, and 0.5% Tween 20), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody (1:1000 dilution). Blots were washed three times for 10 min with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed by a peroxidase reaction using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). AplidinTM showed high activity against MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1 A), with an antiproliferative IC50 of 5 nm at 48 h post-treatment (data not shown). This concentration is pharmacologically relevant, as the circulating plasma levels of AplidinTM in patients exposed to the maximum tolerated dose in Phase I clinical studies is 7.1 nm (26Abella B. Faircloth G. López-Lázaro L. Guzmán C. Jimeno J. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: 1395-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis was detected 1–3 h after drug addition (Fig. 1 B). By flow cytometry analysis, AplidinTM was found to induce the subdiploid profile, which is a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 1 C). At 24 h, 20–25% apoptotic cells were found in cultures growing in normal medium treated with 50–500 nmAplidinTM, and ∼10% apoptotic cells were found in cultures treated with 5 nm AplidinTM. In line with this, AplidinTM-treated cells showed time- and dose-dependent nuclear condensation and fragmentation in comparison with the homogeneous staining of untreated cells as assessed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (Fig. 1 D,upper panels) and the generation of the active form of caspase-3 (lower panels). When added simultaneously to the drug, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a general caspase inhibitor, decreased the cytotoxic activity of AplidinTM by ∼50% as assessed by crystal violet staining (data not shown). This indicates that AplidinTM-induced apoptosis is mediated by caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The cytotoxic action of AplidinTM is triggered rapidly, as a pulse treatment of 5 min (using 500 nm) gave the maximum antiproliferative effect at 48 h (data not shown). Doses 10–100-fold higher than the antiproliferative IC50 were used to identify the primary targets and early mechanism of action of AplidinTM. To examine the role of MAPKs in AplidinTM-induced apoptosis, we studied the effects of AplidinTM on the activity of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK using antibodies specifically recognizing the active phosphorylated forms. AplidinTM caused rapid, strong, and sustained activation of p38 MAPK and JNK without altering their concentrations (Fig. 2 A). The same result was obtained in immune complex kinase assays (data not shown). Addition of AplidinTM in vitro to immune complexes from untreated cells did not affect kinase activity (data not shown), suggesting that p38 MAPK/JNK activation in vivo is due to effects on their at least 11 upstream regulators (22Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). In agreement with the expression of an activated K-ras oncogene (27Gilhooly E.M. Rose D.P. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 267-270PubMed Google Scholar), MDA-MB-231 cells displayed a high basal level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 under unstimulated conditions, which was mostly unaffected by AplidinTM treatment (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, AplidinTM did not change the cellular content of phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 2 A), an enzyme that prevents cell death by multiple apoptosis inducers (see Ref. 28Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar for review). To examine the importance of these effects in the induction of apoptosis, we used SB203580, a pyridinylimidazole that inhibits some p38 MAPK isoforms (29Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar, 30Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). However, control experiments showed that, in MDA-MB-231 cells, SB203580 inhibited both JNK and p38 MAPK at 5–30 μm (Fig. 2 B) (data not shown). This correlated with the inhibition of AplidinTM-induced apoptosis. As determined by flow cytometry, SB203580 (30 μm) decreased the number of apoptotic cells from 41 to 16% after 24 h of AplidinTM treatment in serum-free medium (Fig. 2 C), an effect clearly visible by phase-contrast microscopy (Fig. 2 D). These data indicate that the activation of JNK and/or p38 MAPK plays a critical role in the induction of MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis by AplidinTM. Moreover, the activation of these kinases was unaffected by benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (data not shown), suggesting that these events lie upstream of caspase activation in the apoptosis cascade. Because JNK activation by some stimuli involves Src-mediated EGFR phosphorylation (31Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we studied whether AplidinTM could have this mode of action. We found that AplidinTM caused EGFR phosphorylation, which was partially blocked by pretreatment with PP2 (Fig. 3 A), a specific inhibitor of Src (32Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 33Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). AplidinTM induced a more sustained EGFR phosphorylation than EGF (Fig. 3 B, upper panels); it peaked at 1–4 h and remained above the base line for 24 h (middle panels). Accordingly, the activation-linked down-regulation of EGFR content was delayed in AplidinTM-treated cells with respect to EGF-treated cells (Fig. 3 B, middle panels). Combined treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with EGF and AplidinTM resulted in cellular toxicity and persistent EGFR phosphorylation, indicating a dominant and probably aberrant effect of AplidinTM (Fig. 3 B, lower panels). This was further suggested by analysis of the binding of the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc to EGFR. In contrast to what happened upon EGF addition, EGFR activation by AplidinTM did not cause binding of Grb2 or Shc to the receptor (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, in cells treated with both agents, Grb2 binding was also inhibited, as was binding of Shc at early times (2 and 30 min post-treatment), although it strongly increased later (60 min) (Fig. 3 C). EGFR is subjected to inhibitory and activating phosphorylation of specific residues by several kinases. Five sites of in vivoautophosphorylation have been identified in EGFR: Tyr992, Tyr1068, Tyr1086, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173 (34Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 35Margolis B., Li, N. Koch A. Mohammadi M. Hurwitz D.R. Zilberstein A. Ullrich A. Pawson T. Schlessinger J.

To make sure that AplidinTMhas a stimulatory effect on EGFR, we used residue-specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. At least four of these five amino acids became phosphorylated upon AplidinTM addition (Fig. 3 D). To assess the specificity of EGFR activation, the effect of AplidinTM on PDGFR was studied in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. AplidinTM did not induce phosphorylation of this receptor (Fig. 3 E). These cells were sensitive to AplidinTM, although they lack EGFR expression, indicating that EGFR transactivation is not required for AplidinTM-induced apoptosis. Additionally, given that PP2 significantly reduces AplidinTM-induced EGFR phosphorylation and that Src transactivates EGFR in some cell systems (31Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 37Biscardi J.S. Maa M.-C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.-H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol.

Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20130-20135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of AplidinTM on Src expression and activity. By means of an antibody that specifically recognizes the activation-linked phospho-Tyr418 of Src, AplidinTM rapidly activated Src without altering the amount of protein (Fig. 3 F). Because MDA-MB-231 cells express Src and Fyn, but not Yes (data not shown), which are the three ubiquitously expressed members of the Src kinase family that have at least partially overlapping functions (39Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G. Yamazaki T. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Forman K.-J.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the possibility that AplidinTMmay also affect Fyn cannot be ruled out. The role of EGFR activation in AplidinTM action was studied in egfr −/− MEFs. In both the presence and absence of serum, egfr −/− MEFs underwent apoptosis with delayed kinetics in comparison with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4 A) (data not shown). At late times after treatment, however, no differences were found in cell proliferation or viability (data not shown). Consistent with this, the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK egfr −/− MEFs was reduced and delayed, respectively, compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4 B, upper panels). To examine the contribution of EGFR and Src to the activation of p38 MAPK/JNK by AplidinTM, we used PP2. Pretreatment with PP2 and also with GSH caused only partial reduction of p38 MAPK and JNK activation inegfr −/− and wild-type MEFs. SB203580 had a stronger effect than PP2 and GSH in egfr −/−cells. In addition, we studied the contribution of the activation of Src and p38 MAPK/JNK to the cytotoxic action of AplidinTMby measuring the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells and wild-type andegfr −/− MEFs treated with the drug in the presence of PP2 or SB203580. In all three cell types, SB203580 significantly inhibited AplidinTM action. In contrast, PP2 was effective only in MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in MEFs (Fig. 4 C). In agreement with the differential activation of p38 MAPK/JNK, these experiments also confirmed thategfr −/− MEFs are less sensitive to the drug than wild-type MEFs. Together, these results indicate that the activation of EGFR, Src, and p38 MAPK/JNK is involved in AplidinTM action in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas only EGFR and p38 MAPK/JNK (but not Src) seem to be involved in the cytotoxic effect of AplidinTM in MEFs. EGFR activation participates in, but is not sufficient for, the induction of apoptosis by AplidinTM. Reactive oxygen species mediate JNK activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α) (40Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), an effect that, in the case of H2O2, requires Src-dependent EGFR transactivation (31Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These data led us to investigate the putative role of reactive oxygen species in AplidinTM action. As shown in Fig. 5 (A andB) (data not shown), pretreatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with various antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, DPI (an inhibitor of flavin-containing enzymes such as NAD(P)H oxidase), Tiron (a scavenger of superoxide ions), and vitamin E or addition of catalase (H2O2-degrading enzyme) did not affect the induction of EGFR phosphorylation by AplidinTM. In contrast, two compounds that raise the cellular level of GSH,N-acetylcysteine (a GSH precursor) and ebselen (a GSH peroxidase mimetic), reduced EGFR phosphorylation by AplidinTM (Fig. 5 C). Confirming the involvement of GSH in AplidinTM action, treatment of cells with exogenous GSH diminished, whereas BSO (a specific inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) increased, AplidinTM-induced EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C). None of the agents tested (N-acetylcysteine, ebselen, DPI, and Tiron) modified EGFR activation by its EGF ligand (Fig. 5 D). We next analyzed the possible link between GSH content, Src and EGFR, and the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Exogenously added GSH andN-acetylcysteine (but not BSO) reduced JNK and p38 MAPK activation by AplidinTM (Fig. 6 A). Likewise, GSH also blocked Src activation by AplidinTM, whereas BSO had no effect (Fig. 6 B). In addition, PP2 and tyrphostin AG1478 (an EGFR inhibitor) also inhibited the activation of these kinases by AplidinTM (Fig. 6 C). Together, these data indicate that the depletion of GSH activates Src and that the activation of Src and EGFR is partially responsible for the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK. EGF alone did not induce p38 MAPK and induced JNK only weakly and did not affect the activation of these two kinases by AplidinTM (Fig. 6 D). To examine whether the mechanism of action of AplidinTM in MDA-MB-231 cells could be extrapolated to human renal cancer cells, we used the A-498 and ACHN cell lines. Both were sensitive to the antiproliferative (IC50 = 5 and 15 nm, respectively) and cytotoxic action of AplidinTM (Fig. 7 A). As in MDA-MB-231 cells, we found that Apl"

Cells move across the presumptive somite boundary and violate gene expression boundaries thought to correlate with the site of the somite boundary. Similarly, cells do not appear to be preassigned to a given somite as they leave the node. The results offer a detailed picture of somite shaping and provide a spatiotemporal framework for linking gene expression with cell movements."

However, after loss of TBP, RNA polymerase II (pol II) remains in a transcriptionally active phosphorylation state, and in situ run-on experiments showed high levels of pol II transcription comparable to those of wild-type cells. In contrast, pol I and pol III transcription was arrested. Our results show a differential dependency of the RNA polymerases on TBP and provide evidence for TBP-independent pol II transcriptional mechanisms that allow reinitiation and maintenance of gene transcription in vivo."

The intracellular protozoan parasite Theileria is the only eukaryote known to induce uncontrolled host cell proliferation. Survival of Theileria-transformed leukocytes depends strictly on constitutive nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity. We found that this was mediated by recruitment of the multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) into large, activated foci on the parasite surface. IKK signalosome assembly was specific for the transforming schizont stage of the parasite and was down-regulated upon differentiation into the nontransforming merozoite stage.

Strain TCA1 required H2 as an electron donor and TCA as an electron acceptor for growth, indicating that dechlorination is a respiratory process.

https://openalex.org/W2046019785,"l-Glutamate is believed to function as an intercellular transmitter in the islets of Langerhans. However, critical issues, <i>i.e.</i> where, when and howl-glutamate appears, and what happens upon stimulation of glutamate receptors in the islets, remain unresolved. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), an isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter essential for neuronal storage of l-glutamate, is expressed in α cells (Hayashi, M., Otsuka, M., Morimoto, R., Hirota, S., Yatsushiro, S., Takeda, J., Yamamoto, A., and Moriyama, Y. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 276, 43400–43406). Here we show that VGLUT2 is specifically localized in glucagon-containing secretory granules but not in synaptic-like microvesicles in αTC6 cells, clonal α cells, and islet α cells. VGLUT1, another VGLUT isoform, is also expressed and localized in secretory granules in α cells. Low glucose conditions triggered co-secretion of stoichiometric amounts ofl-glutamate and glucagon from αTC6 cells and isolated islets, which is dependent on temperature and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and inhibited by phentolamine. Similar co-secretion ofl-glutamate and glucagon from islets was observed upon stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol. Under low glucose conditions, stimulation of glutamate receptors facilitates secretion of γ-aminobutyric acid from MIN6 m9, clonal β cells, and isolated islets. These results indicate that co-secretion ofl-glutamate and glucagon from α cells under low glucose conditions triggers GABA secretion from β cells and defines the mode of action of l-glutamate as a regulatory molecule for the endocrine function. To our knowledge, this is the first example of secretory granule-mediated glutamatergic signal transmission."

PC12 cells transfected with necdin or MAGE-H1 exhibit accelerated differentiation in response to nerve growth factor. Expression of these two MAGE proteins is predominantly cytoplasmic in PC12 cells, and necdin was found to be capable of homodimerization, suggesting that it may act as a cytoplasmic adaptor to recruit a signaling complex to p75.

Neuronal responses to activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor range from enhanced outgrowth to increased cell death, and p75 null mice exhibit a plethora of defects in both neuronal and non-neuronal systems (1Bentley C.A. Lee K.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7706-7715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2von Schack D. Casademunt E. Schweigreiter R. Meyer M. Bibel M. Dechant G. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 977-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, the primary interactors and signaling mechanisms activated by p75 are not well understood (3Hempstead B.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although p75 belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily, its intracellular type II death domain does not self-aggregate (4Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and does not interact with the major binding partners of type I death domains. Identification of specific signaling partners for p75 has been frustrating, as this particular receptor is a difficult bait in conventional yeast two-hybrid. Nonetheless seven candidate interactors have been reported so far for p75 (3Hempstead B.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 5Barker P.A. Salehi A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Most of these candidate interactors lack known catalytic domains, suggesting that they must recruit additional binding partners to form a functional signaling complex. There are no general sequence or functional homologies between the described p75 interactors, and the physiological significance of most of them remains to be established. To identify biologically relevant interactors for p75, we used the Ras rescue system (RRS) 1The abbreviations used are: RRS, Ras rescue system; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; NGF, nerve growth factor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; MHD, MAGE homology domain for protein interaction trapping in yeast (6Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RRS selects for protein interactions in the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasm, and there is no requirement for nuclear or other translocations of the binding partners. The system thus provides an appropriate screening method for the membrane-proximal binding of a receptor intracellular domain with its primary interactors. Our RRS screens identified two MAGE family proteins as novel p75 interactors and highlight type II MAGE proteins as a potential interactor family for type II death domain proteins. Plasmids, yeast strains, and screening protocols for RRS were as described (6Broder Y.C. Katz S. Aronheim A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1121-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Linker (K274RWN to SLPL342) and death domain (T343KRE to ESLC416) regions of p75-ICD were generated by PCR from rat p75. Synthetic oligonucleotides were designed to encode the nine-residue (SESTATSPV) tail domain of p75-ICD. A pADH death domain bait was used to screen a mouse embryonic head cDNA library in pMyr. Alignments of MAGE sequences and phylogenetic trees were constructed using ClustalX. Rat tissues for Western blot analysis were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, macerated to a fine powder, and solubilized in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm orthovanadate and proteinase inhibitors (Merck) containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-necdin antibodies. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6% fetal calf serum and 6% horse serum. For induction of neuronal differentiation, the cells were seeded at a density of 10–15 × 105 cells/cm2 and differentiated for 2–4 days with NGF (5–50 ng/ml). Transient transfection of COS cells was with DEAE-dextran. Transient and stable transfections of PC12 cells lines were carried out by electroporation with 80 μg of DNA per 107 cells in 0.4-cm cuvettes on an ECM-300 (BTX) set to 320 V, 6-ms pulse length. Stably transfected PC12 were selected under 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin for ∼4 weeks until resistant colonies appeared. Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm orthovanadate and proteinase inhibitors (Merck) containing either 0.7% CHAPS or 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min and then precleared with 30 μl of a 50% suspension of protein-G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) before incubation with primary antibody. Immunoprecipitates were eluted with 80 μl of 1 mguanidine HCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, before running on SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies for precipitation were as follows: anti-p75 MC192 (from Alomone Laboratories), anti-p75 REX (7Weskamp G. Reichardt L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 649-663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-HA (from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibodies and dilutions for Western blots were as follows: anti-necdin polyclonal NC243 (8Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev.

Cells were fixed for immunofluorescence microscopy for 20 min with ice-cold 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, quenched in 0.1m glycine PBS for 15 min, and permeabilized for 10 min in PBS, 5% donkey serum, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% saponin. Permeabilized cells were incubated with anti-HA (1:4000) for 2 h at room temperature followed by donkey anti-rabbit rhodamine-redX-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. A mouse embryonic head RRS library was screened against three baits comprising the death domain, the 69-residue juxtamembrane “linker,” and the nine-residue C-terminal “tail” of p75. These screens yielded interacting candidates only for the death domain bait. One of the clones encoded the C-terminal 81 amino acid residues of necdin (11Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a MAGE family member thought to act as a cell cycle regulator. Further yeast co-transfections of necdin with the complete panel of p75-ICD subdomains revealed that necdin interacts with both the linker and death domain segments of p75 (Fig.1 A). The sequence homologies between necdin and NRAGE, which was previously identified by Barker and colleagues as a p75 interactor (12Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L.

Unfortunately, a number of MAGE constructs (e.g. NRAGE and MAGEL2) were found to associate with yeast plasma membrane, thus precluding their use in the RRS system. MAGE-H1/APR-1 (13Zhu F. Yan W.

BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was found to interact robustly with the p75 death domain by RRS (data not shown). Thus, at least three type II MAGE proteins (Fig. 1 B) are capable of interacting with p75. Tissue RNA arrays (data not shown) and in silico profiling reveal extensive overlaps in the expression profiles of these genes. Adult rats express robust levels of necdin protein in the hypothalamus and in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Fig.1 C), whereas necdin levels during development are much lower. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were then carried out in both COS and PC12 cells to confirm the p75-necdin and p75-MAGE-H1 interactions. In accordance with the RRS results, p75 co-precipitated with necdin or MAGE-H1 from transfected COS cells (Fig.2 A) or PC12 cells (Fig.2 B). In PC12 cell lines stably transfected with necdin, application of either NGF or BDNF clearly enhanced the interaction of necdin with p75 (Fig. 2 C). Necdin protein levels did not change during the course of this experiment (data not shown). Finally, a p75-necdin interaction at endogenous levels of expression was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation from lysates of freshly dissected adult rat DRG (Fig. 2 D). NRAGE was previously found to affect p75-trk association (12Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and we therefore examined whether necdin had similar effects in transiently transfected COS cells stimulated with NGF. TrkA co-precipitated together with p75 in the absence of necdin, and this association was lost in necdin-expressing cells (Fig. 2 E). Thus, by interacting with p75, necdin can modulate association of p75 with other neurotrophin receptors. Necdin, like other MAGE family proteins, does not have any known intrinsic catalytic activity and is likely to signal by recruiting other molecules to a p75 signaling complex. We therefore conducted additional RRS screens using necdin as bait and identified a number of novel expressed sequence tags of unknown function as necdin interactors (data not shown). Interestingly, one known gene obtained in this screen was necdin itself (Fig. 2 F, left). Homo-oligomerization of necdin was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged necdin proteins from transfected COS cells (Fig. 2 F, right). PC12 cells are a well established model for NGF-induced differentiation and do not express endogenous necdin (14Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the influence of transient transfection of necdin or MAGE-H1 on NGF effects in PC12 cells. Both necdin- and MAGE-H1-transfected cells responded to NGF by a dose-dependent increase in neurite extension, which was greater than observed in vector-transfected cells (Fig.3 A). This accelerated neurite extension was quantified in stable necdin-PC12 lines (Fig.3 B). Necdin expression levels did not change over the time course of these experiments (data not shown). No effect was observed on the number of differentiated cells. Enhanced neurite extension was not observed when BDNF was applied instead of NGF or upon application of NGF or BDNF to transfected nnr5 cells (data not shown). To establish whether the enhanced neurite outgrowth might be a consequence of accelerated differentiation, we quantified the phosphorylation levels of cdc2, a cell cycle marker (15Dobashi Y. Shoji M. Kitagawa M. Noguchi T. Kameya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12572-12580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cdc2 was decreased ∼5-fold more in necdin-PC12 cells as compared with vector-PC12 cells 24 h after NGF application (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the effect of the NGF-p75-necdin signal in these cells is indeed to accelerate differentiation. Finally, we examined the subcellular distribution of necdin expression in both cycling and differentiated PC12-necdin cells. As shown in Fig. 3 D necdin protein was primarily cytoplasmic in cycling PC12, and this did not change upon differentiation. An appreciable amount of necdin was found in processes and growth cones of differentiated PC12 (Fig.3 D, lower). Microscopy after harsher permeabilization or Western blot of nuclear extracts revealed lower amounts of necdin in the nucleus (data not shown). The low levels of nuclear necdin did not change after NGF stimulation or during differentiation (data not shown). These results establish two members of the type II MAGE gene family, necdin and MAGE-H1, as p75 interactors. Necdin and MAGE-H1 are related to NRAGE, which was previously identified as a p75 interactor (12Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All three interactors contain a conserved sequence called the MAGE homology domain (MHD), a defining feature of the MAGE gene family (5Barker P.A. Salehi A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Since both necdin and MAGE-H1 are essentially comprised of only the MHD, this structural domain determines the interaction of MAGE proteins with p75. Since most type II MAGE proteins are at least as closely related in sequence to MAGE-H1 or necdin or NRAGE as the latter three are to each other (Fig. 1 B), additional members of this subfamily may also associate with p75. The death domain of p75 belongs to the structurally distinct type II fold (4Liepinsh E. Ilag L.L. Otting G. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4999-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and the possibility that type II MAGE proteins form a family of binding partners for type II death domain proteins is an intriguing avenue for future study. The multiplicity of potential interactions between these two families may create a compensatory network that is physiologically robust, but at the same time refractory to reductionist analysis. For example, the three MAGE interactors for p75 have overlapping expression profiles, which may complicate the analyses of null allelles for these genes, at least in the context of p75 signaling. We examined the effects of NGF-induced p75 signaling via the two MAGE interactors in PC12 cells and found that they cause an acceleration of neuronal differentiation (Fig. 3). The p75-necdin signal must synergize with a TrkA signaling pathway, since the effects of necdin on differentiation are not seen in nnr5 cells, which lack TrkA, or upon application of BDNF to PC12 cells. Importantly, the effects of necdin on PC12 differentiation were seen only in ligand-stimulated cells and are therefore consequent to NGF signaling. Very recently published data from antisense experiments on embryonic DRG neurons also support a differentiation or survival-promoting role for necdin in NGF-responsive neurons (9Takazaki R. Nishimura I. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This could be due to a change in trk-p75 association (Fig.2 E), thus “freeing” TrkA from some inhibitory constraint imposed by p75, or could be due to an independent signal emanating from p75 and transduced by necdin. The propensity of necdin for homo-oligomerization (Fig. 2 F), and its cytoplasmic localization in PC12 (Fig. 3 D), both support the likelihood of necdin acting as a cytoplasmic adaptor for a p75-induced signaling complex. It should, however, be noted that this does not rule out a nuclear localization or role for necdin in other cell types (16Taniura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although these in vitro analyses suggest a role for a p75-necdin signal in neuronal differentiation, what might be thein vivo significance of such signaling? The most prominent sites of necdin expression in rodents are the DRG and hypothalamus (Fig. 1 C), both of which are known to also express p75 and trk receptors. A significant (and unexplained) loss of DRG neurons has been described in p75 null mice (17Fan G. Jaenisch R. Kucera J. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and specific hypothalamic defects have been described in one line of necdin mutant mice (18Muscatelli F. Abrous D.N. Massacrier A. Boccaccio I. Le Moal M. Cau P. Cremer H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 3101-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Comparative analyses of these mutant mice may shed light on this interesting question. To summarize, we have identified necdin and MAGE-H1 as novel interactors for the intracellular domain of p75 and suggest that type II MAGE proteins will feature prominently in p75 signal transduction. We are grateful to Phil Barker, Moses Chao, and Louis Reichardt for generous gifts of antisera; to Ami Aronheim for gracious help with RRS; and to R'ada Massarwa for excellent technical assistance."

In this study we show that in fetal rat brown adipocyte primary cultures the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi), as well as retinoic acids 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinoic acid also have “extragenic” effects and induce p44/p42 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) activation. The latter is involved in UCP-1 gene expression, because inhibition of p38MAPK activity with PD169316 impairs the ability of Rosi and retinoids for UCP-1 induction. The inhibitory effects of PD169316 are mimicked by the antioxidant GSH, suggesting a role for reactive oxygenated species (ROS) generation in the increase of UCP-1 expression in response either to Rosi or 9-cis-retinoic acid. Thus, we propose that Rosi and retinoids act as PPAR/RXR and RAR/RXR agonists and also activate p38MAPK. These two coordinated actions could result in a high increase of transcriptional activity on the ucp-1 enhancer and hence on thermogenesis. PPARα and γ agonists but not retinoids also increase UCP-3 expression in fetal brown adipocytes. However, the regulation of UCP-3, which is not involved in thermogenesis, seems to differ from UCP-1 given the fact that is not affected by p38MAPK inhibition.

This function relies on the presence of the tissue-specific uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and stimulates heat production by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from the respiratory chain (1Kozak L.P. Harper M.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 339-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). UCP-1 expression is under complex regulation. An enhancer element in the 5′-flanking region of the ucp-1 gene has been described with putative binding sites for the thyroid hormone receptor (THR), retinoic acid (RA) receptors (RAR and RXR), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) (2Sears I.B.

Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although β-adrenergic stimulation is the main physiological pathway that induces thermogenesis and UCP-1 expression in BAT, it is likely to be mediated by the induction of the PPARγ coactivator (PGC-1), a master coactivator that binds PPARγ, PPARα, THR, RAR, and RXR (4Puigserver P., Wu, Z.

BAT also expresses the recently described UCP-2 and UCP-3, the latter being restricted to two thermogenic tissues (BAT and skeletal muscle). UCP-3 has shown to uncouple respiration when expressed ectopically in yeast and mammalian cells (6Boss O. Samec S. Kuhne F. Bijlenga P. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Seydoux J. Giacobino J.P. Muzzin P.

In contrast, the PPARα ligand Wy14643 induced UCP-3 but not UCP-1 expression, although it was able to transactivate the −4551UCP-1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (11Teruel T.

Commun. 2000; 273: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effect of Rosi on UCP-1 mRNA levels is mediated by increasing the transcription of the gene through the binding of the PPAR/RXR heterodimer to the PPAR response element (PPRE) described in the enhancer (2Sears I.B. MacGinnitie M.A. Kovacs L.G. Graves R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3410-3419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This paper describes p38MAPK and p44/p42MAPK activation triggered either by Rosi or 9-cis-RA or all-trans-RA treatment in fetal rat brown adipocytes, with p38MAPK implication in UCP-1 but not UCP-3 expression.RESULTSFetal rat brown adipocytes, when isolated and allowed to attach to the plastic dishes for 4 h in 10% FCS-MEM, express adipogenic (FAS) and thermogenic (UCP-1) markers. After 20 h of culture in the absence of serum, UCP-1 mRNA levels decrease dramatically, facilitating the study of its up-regulation by several hormones/signals. Under these conditions, treatment for 24 h with noradrenaline or triiodothyronine or 9-cis-RA or insulin-like growth factor-1 is able to induce UCP-1 gene expression (27Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Alvarez A. Benito M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1251-1259PubMed Google Scholar) (25Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have previously used the same culture conditions to demonstrate that Rosi per se and in the absence of any other exogenously added signal increases UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner and induces activation of the full promoter UCP-1-CAT (11Teruel T. Clapham J.C. Smith S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (12Teruel T. Smith S.A. Peterson J. Clapham J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To explore the possible involvement of the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), p38MAPK, and/or PKA on UCP-1 induction by Rosi, we used chemical inhibitors for those kinases as follows: PD98059 (PD), 20 μm, to inhibit ERKs; PD169316 (PD*), 800 nm, as a p38MAPK inhibitor; and H89, 10 μm, to inhibit PKA activity. The efficiency of PD* and PD to inhibit p38MAPK activity and p44/p42MAPK phosphorylation at the doses used was tested in Fig. 3,B and C. Furthermore, H89 at 10 μmcompletely blocked UCP-1 mRNA induction as well as FAS mRNA repression by Bt2cAMP (Fig. 1 B). Fetal rat brown adipocytes were treated for 24 h with or without 10 μm Rosi either in the absence or presence of the inhibitors. At the end of the culture period, total RNA was extracted and analyzed for UCP-1 expression by Northern blot (Fig. 1 A). As expected, Rosi increased UCP-1 mRNA levels by 4-fold, and this effect was unmodified in the presence of PD or H89. However, the inhibition of p38MAPK activity with PD* resulted in a nearly complete blockade of UCP-1 induction by Rosi without a significant effect on the basal UCP-1 mRNA levels found in untreated cells. To validate whether the increase in UCP-1 expression produced by Rosi in a p38MAPK-dependent manner was independent of differentiation-inducing properties of Rosi or p38MAPK (28Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the expression of the adipogenic marker FAS was also analyzed (Fig. 1 A). Rosi treatment for 24 h did not induce FAS mRNA levels and did not increase intracellular lipid content (data not shown), indicating that the effects of Rosi are related to specific thermogenic gene expression rather than to a differentiation program. Furthermore, no changes on FAS mRNA expression were observed regardless of the presence or absence of the inhibitors (Fig. 1 A).Figure 1Rosi induction of UCP-1 gene expression is dependent on p38MAPK activity but independent of p44/p42MAPK and PKA activities. Fetal brown adipocytes, after 20 h of serum deprivation in BSA-MEM medium, were cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of 10 μm Rosi ± 20 μm PD or 800 nm PD* or 10 μmH89 (A) or for 6 h in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm Bt2cAMP ((Bu)2cAMP) ± 10 μm H89 (B). Total RNA was extracted from the different conditions, and 15 μg of it was submitted to Northern-blot analysis and hybridized with labeled UCP-1 and FAS cDNAs. A final hybridization with the 18 S rRNA cDNA was performed for normalization. Representative autoradiograms and densitometric analysis of UCP-1 mRNA levels after standardization using the 18 S rRNA signal are shown. Results (arbitrary densitometric units) are means ± S.E.

Fetal primary brown adipocytes were transiently co-transfected with 10 μg of −4551UCP-1-CAT together with 2 μg of pCMVβ-galactosidase for internal control of transfection. Upon transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in a serum-free BSA-MEM medium in the absence or presence of Rosi with or without PD169316. At the end of the culture period, cells were collected and assayed for CAT activity. As depicted in Fig. 2 A, Rosi increased −4551UCP-1-CAT activity 3-fold, and this stimulation was totally precluded when the p38MAPK inhibitor was present in the culture medium. These results indicate that p38MAPK but not p44/p42MAPK or PKA activity is necessary for Rosi-induced UCP-1 gene transcription. To check whether the inhibition of p38MAPK was affecting the levels of the PPARγ protein, a direct Western blot was performed (Fig. 2 B). Similar PPARγ protein content was detected in brown adipocytes either in the absence or presence of PD*. Furthermore, we checked whether nuclear protein binding to the PPRE of the UCP1 enhancer was affected by the inhibition of p38MAPK, either in the presence or absence of Rosi. Nuclear extracts from cells cultured for 24 h with or without Rosi and/or PD* were used in gel mobility shift assays using UCP-1-PPRE double-stranded oligonucleotide as a probe (Fig. 2 C). Protein binding to DNA was observed in control brown adipocytes, and this binding was essentially unmodified either by the presence of Rosi or PD*. This band seems to be specific, because it disappears in competition experiments with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PPRE probe.Figure 2PD169316 precludes Rosi-induced UCP-1 promoter activity.

To check the possibility that Rosi could be inducing p38MAPK activation, we treated brown adipocytes with Rosi for different period of time, and cell lysates were analyzed for dual phosphorylation (Thr-180/Tyr-182) of p38MAPK by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody. No phosphorylation of p38MAPK was detected in control cells cultured for 20 h in a serum-free BSA-MEM medium. However, Rosi treatment for 1 h induced p38MAPK phosphorylation, which was maintained up to 6 h (Fig. 3 A). The changes observed in the amount of phospho-p38MAPK reflect changes in the activity, because the protein levels of p38MAPK are similar in all the conditions. Furthermore we performed p38MAPK activity assay with protein lysates from control cells and cells treated with Rosi for 3 h and obtained similar results. Rosi increased MBP phosphorylation 3-fold in anti-p38MAPK immunoprecipitates, and this activation was prohibited in cells cotreated with Rosi and PD*, validating the use of this chemical compound as a p38MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 3 B). Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-p44/p42MAPK antibody revealed that the presence of Rosi for 3 h also increases p44/p42MAPK activity, which is further elevated after 6 h (Fig. 3 C). This p44/p42MAPK activation is inhibited by PD, validating the use of this chemical compound in brown adipocytes. 0.1% Me2SO, the vehicle used, did not produce any effect (data not shown). These data clearly show that Rosi, besides being a PPARγ agonist, stimulates kinase activities that can modulate its effects on gene expression.Although p38MAPK activation, but not p44/p42MAPK, is involved in UCP-1 gene induction by Rosi, this kinase does not play any role in UCP-3 expression either induced by Rosi or by the PPARα agonist Wy14643 as is assumed from the results obtained by Northern-blot analysis and represented in Fig. 4, where it is shown that UCP-3 expression is induced in cells treated with Rosi or Wy14643 regardless of the presence of the p38MAPK inhibitor PD169316.Figure 4Effects of the p38MAPK inhibitor PD169316 on UCP-1 and UCP-3 gene expression. After 20 h of serum deprivation, fetal brown adipocytes were cultured for 24 h with 10 μm Rosi or 10 μm Wy14643 (Wy) or 400 nm 9-cis-RA, or 400 nmall-trans-RA, both in the absence or presence of 800 nm PD*. Total RNA was extracted from the different conditions, and 15 μg was submitted to Northern blot analysis and hybridized with labeled UCP-1 and UCP-3 cDNAs. A final hybridization with the 18 S rRNA cDNA was performed for normalization. Representative autoradiograms are shown. Densitometric analysis of UCP-1 and UCP-3 mRNA levels after standardization using the 18 S rRNA signal are shown. Results (arbitrary densitometric units) are means ± S.E. (n = 8).

Brown adipocytes were cultured for 24 h with 9-cis-RA (agonist for RXR and RAR) or all-trans-RA (RAR agonist) in the absence or presence of the p38MAPK inhibitor (PD169316). Northern-blot analysis for UCP-1 expression revealed that 9-cis-RA treatment produced a huge increase in UCP-1 mRNA levels (12-fold) that was inhibited 50% in the presence of PD169316. The RAR agonist also induced UCP-1 expression but to a lesser extent than 9-cis-RA, this effect also being precluded by inhibition of p38MAPK. As previously published (12Teruel T. Smith S.A. Peterson J. Clapham J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), none of the retinoids had any effect on UCP-3 expression (Fig. 4). Because p38MAPK activation also seemed to be involved in UCP-1 induction by retinoic acids, we decided to examine whether 9-cis-RA and all-trans-RA also activated p38MAPK; this was monitored by a Western blot of phosphorylated p38MAPK. As shown in Fig. 5, 9-cis-RA induced p38MAPK phosphorylation with a timing pattern similar to Rosi. p44/p42MAPK activation was also observed upon 9-cis-RA stimulation. Regarding all-trans-RA, it also activated p44/p42MAPK and p38MAPK but less strongly than 9-cis-RA.Figure 59-cis-RA and all-trans-RA induce p38MAPK and p44/p42MAPK phosphorylation. Fetal brown adipocytes, after 20 h of serum deprivation, were cultured in the absence or presence of 400 nm 9-cis-RA or 400 nmall-trans-RA for 1, 3, and 6 h. Total protein (30 μg) was submitted to SDS/PAGE, blotted onto nylon membrane, immunodetected with anti-phospho-p38MAPK (P-p38MAPK) or anti-p38MAPK (A) or anti-phospho-p44/p42MAPK (P-p44MAPK,P-p42MAPK) or anti-p44/p42MAPK (B) and developed with ECL chemiluminiscence.

Brown adipocytes were or were not pretreated 30 min with an antioxidant agent, reduced GSH, before the addition of Rosi or 9-cis-RA and further cultured for 24 h. UCP-1 expression was analyzed by Northern-blot, and the results depicted in Fig. 6 show that the presence of GSH inhibited the increase in UCP-1 mRNA levels elicited by either Rosi or 9-cis-RA.Figure 6GSH impairs Rosi and 9-cis-RA induction of UCP-1.

PPARs are activated by ligand binding, which induces conformational changes leading to the recruitment of several coactivators (33Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some agonists for PPARs, including the prostaglandin 15d-PGJ2 and the thiazolidinediones ciglitazone, pioglitazone, and troglitazone, have shown PPAR-independent effects, activating different cytosolic signaling pathways (ERK or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or p38MAPK) depending on the cellular system (30Takeda K.

Marchetti I. Dani C., Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Binetruy B. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Hong H.Y. Varvayanis S. Yen A.

To our knowledge, the results presented in this study describe for the first time p44/p42 and p38MAPK activation by 9-cis-RA and all-trans-RA as well as Rosi in fetal rat brown adipocytes. Kinetics for both activations are different. Meanwhile p38MAPK activation is rapid and sustained, whereas p44/p42MAPK phosphorylation delays and happens gradually. The biological effects of p44/p42MAPK activation are unknown. Phosphorylation by p44/p42MAPK can modulate PPAR activity, both in a positive and negative manner (15Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D.

Nevertheless, from our results we conclude that this kinase is not involved in UCP-1 gene expression, but other effects remain unexplored. On the contrary, the timing of p38MAPK phosphorylation by Rosi fits tightly to the time frame for UCP-1 gene induction (11Teruel T. Clapham J.C. Smith S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and inhibition of p38MAPK activity prevents UCP-1 mRNA increase by this thiazolidinedione or retinoids. This effect seems to be specific for the thermogenic protein UCP-1 and not related to the differentiation-inducing properties of Rosi or p38MAPK, because the expression of the adipogenic gene FASremains unmodified by either the presence of Rosi or PD* in fetal rat brown adipocytes.p38MAPK activation via PKA in β-adrenergic UCP-1 gene induction in post-natal"
https://openalex.org/W2070513189,"The heteromeric amino acid transporters b0,+AT-rBAT (apical), y+LAT1-4F2hc, and possibly LAT2-4F2hc (basolateral) participate to the (re)absorption of cationic and neutral amino acids in the small intestine and kidney proximal tubule. We show now by immunofluorescence that their expression levels follow the same axial gradient along the kidney proximal tubule (S1>S2≫S3). We reconstituted their co-expression in MDCK cell epithelia and verified their polarized localization by immunofluorescence. Expression of b0,+AT-rBAT alone led to a net reabsorption of l-Arg (given together withl-Leu).

Similarly, l-cystine was (re)absorbed when b0,+AT-rBAT was expressed alone. This net transport was further increased by the coexpression of 4F2hc, due to the mobilization of LAT2 (exogenous and/or endogenous) to the basolateral membrane. In summary, apical b0,+AT-rBAT cooperates with y+LAT1-4F2hc or LAT2-4F2hc for the transepithelial reabsorption of cationic amino acids and cystine, respectively.

This transcellular (re)absorption involves the passage across both the luminal and the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. Most neutral amino acids are taken up through the luminal membrane of these cells by a Na+-dependent electrogenic transport system that was named B0 or B for kidney and intestine, respectively, and that is not molecularly defined as yet (1Palacin M.

These studies indicated that b0,+AT-rBAT functions as an obligatory exchanger and suggested that its major mode of transport is, at a normal membrane potential, the uptake of extracellular cationic amino acids orl-cystine that are exchanged against intracellular neutral amino acids. These neutral amino acids could in turn be recycled into the cell by system B/B0. Recently, we have characterized the biosynthesis, localization and uptake function of b0,+AT-rBAT expressed in MDCK cells (12Bauch C. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F181-F189Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This study has shown in an epithelial context that the surface expression of b0,+AT and rBAT depends on their association, which is necessary for the maturation and stabilization of rBAT. This study has also confirmed that b0,+AT-rBAT displays extracellularly a high apparent affinity for l-cystine > cationic amino acids (l-Arg) > large neutral amino acids (l-Leu). The basolateral efflux of amino acids is as yet less well understood than the apical influx. The two heteromeric amino acid transporters, composed of the glycoprotein subunit (heavy chain) 4F2hc(CD98) and an associated catalytic subunit, y+LAT1 or LAT2, that are highly expressed in the proximal kidney tubule and the small intestine, were shown in Xenopus oocytes to function as obligatory exchangers (13Pfeiffer R.

This transporter preferentially exchanges middle-sized and large neutral amino acids across the membrane. Importantly, its apparent affinities for various amino acids is much lower inside compared with outside of the cells (with an exception for Gly), suggesting that its activity depends on the intracellular amino acid availability (15Meier C. Ristic Z. Klauser S. Verrey F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It was suggested that its physiological role is to equilibrate the relative concentration of the various intracellular neutral amino acids, in particular by transporting some amino acids out of the cell that would not be substrates of the putative unidirectional efflux pathway (20Rossier G.

Nolan (www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/protocols/pro_helper_free.html), which were adapted from Ref. 21Pear W. Scott M. Nolan G.P. Robbins P. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Gene Therapy Protocols.

Briefly, Phoenix amphotropic retrovirus producer cells were transfected with the abovementioned constructs using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 16 h after transfection, the medium was exchanged, and after another 48 h at 32 °C, the supernatant was harvested and filtered. MDCK target cells were plated at 5–10% confluency, and viral supernatants containing 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) were added 24 h later. The freshly transduced cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 1000 rpm and 32 °C immediately thereafter. After 24 h at 32 °C the medium was exchanged, and cells were further cultivated in normal medium at 37 °C. This procedure was repeated 8–10 times to achieve a maximal expression of the transport proteins to be investigated. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2 terminus of human rBAT, MAEDKSKRDSIEMSMKGC, the COOH terminus of mouse b0,+AT, CHLQMLEVVPEKDPE, the NH2 terminus of mouse y+LAT1, QHEADDGSALGDGASPC, the COOH terminus of mouse y+LAT1, CDLEDGELSKQDPKSK, and the COOH terminus of mouse LAT2, CPIFKPTPVKDPDSEEQP, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium). The monoclonal anti-human 4F2hc antibody used was previously described in Ref. 22Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S.

Nr. 3412) at 100% confluence and cultivated for 7 days preceding experiments. rBAT expression was induced 3 days prior to experiment with 1 μm dexamethasone. Filters were washed three times using phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Filters were washed three times and cut into squares. 4F2hc-rBAT, b0,+AT-4F2hc, y+LAT1-4F2hc, and LAT2-4F2hc double immunofluorescence was performed with a mix of the respective antibodies 4F2hc (1:1000), rBAT (SZ564; 1:50), b0,+AT (SZ557; 1:500), y+LAT1 (SZ398; 1:200), LAT2 (SZ560; 1:200) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After washing, filter pieces were incubated for 6 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit-IgG antibody (Sigma) and CY3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). After another round of washing, the filters were mounted in DAKO-glycergel (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo (2Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.

Confocal images were taken using a Leica laser scan microscope (TCSSP, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a ×63 oil immersion objective. The appropriate controls were performed without the first and/or second primary antibodies. Kidneys of anesthetized male mice (NMRI; RCC, Füllinsdorf, Switzerland) were fixed for 5 min by intravascular perfusion through the abdominal aorta as previously described (23Loffing J. Loffing-Cueni D. Valderrabano V. Klausli L. Hebert S.C. Rossier B.C. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Kaissling B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F1021-F1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Coronal slices (1–2-mm thick) of the kidney were frozen in liquid propane and stored at −80 °C until use. Serial cryosection (4–5 μm) were cut and placed on Chromium(III) potassium sulfate-coated glass slides. Sections were preincubated for 10 min with 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin. Afterward, sections were sequentially incubated with primary antibodies against LAT2 (SZ559) 1:1000, y+LAT1 (SZ553) 1:200–1:500, and bo,+AT (SZ400) 1:500 for 16 h at 4 °C. Binding sites of primary antibodies were revealed with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Sections were studied by epifluorescence with a Polyvar microscope (Reichert Jung, Vienna, Austria). For controls, consecutive cryosections were incubated in preimmune serum. Images were acquired with a charge-coupled device camera (Visicam 1280, Visitron System, Puching, Germany) and processed by Image-Pro Plus version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) and Corel Photoshop software. MDCK cells were passaged to 24-mm Corning Costar Transwell filters at 100% confluence and cultivated for 7 days. rBAT expression was induced 24 h prior to experiment with 1 μm dexamethasone. Integrity of the monolayer was checked by resistance measurement using the Millicell device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were washed three times with uptake buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose) at 37 °C and incubated in uptake buffer for 30 min. The buffer was replaced unilaterally with buffer supplemented with amino acid at the indicated concentrations and the corresponding 3H-labeledl-amino acid as tracer (except forl-[14C]cystine); the contralateral compartment received the same solution without the labeledl-amino acid tracer. Uptake experiments were performed for the times indicated. DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) (100 μm) (Sigma) was added to the solution for experiments with l-cystine. The uptake was stopped by replacing the amino acid uptake solution with ice-cold uptake buffer and washed four times. The filters were excised and placed into scintillation vials containing scintillation fluid (Packard, Meriden, CT). After shaking overnight at room temperature, radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. RT-PCR was performed to identify the dog LAT2 transporter. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA from wild-type MDCK cells, LAT2-transfected cells serving as the internal positive control, with or without MMRV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and 50 pmol of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). 1:10 of the first-strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using 50 pmol of degenerate LAT2 primers (forward primer 5′-GGTCAGYGCCTGTGGTATCA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCAGCACRTAGTTGGAGAAG-3′ (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland)) and 2 units of recombinant Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The cycling parameters were the following: 3 min 94 °C, 35 cycles of 1 min 94 °C, 30 s 57 °C, and 1 min 72 °C, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on agarose gel, the band cut out and extracted with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed at Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland) using the above PCR primers. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. The difference between control and test values was evaluated using analysis of variance (one-way) with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. The fact that b0,+AT, LAT2 and y+LAT1 are colocalized in the proximal tubule of the kidney in vivo is shown in Fig. 1. As yet, the in vivolocalization of y+LAT1 had not been published. Interestingly, the present images of serial kidney sections indicate that the localizations of b0,+AT, LAT2, and y+LAT1 along the proximal tubule are superimposable, all showing the same axial gradient along the proximal tubule segments (S1>S2≫S3). Thus, in view of the fact that all b0,+AT expressed in the kidney was shown to be associated with rBAT (24Fernandez E. Carrascal M. Rousaud F. Abian J. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Chillaron J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F540-F548Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the three heteromeric transporter b0,+AT-rBAT, LAT2-4F2hc, and y+LAT1-4F2hccolocalize along the kidney proximal tubule with a very similar axial gradient. Only for y+LAT1, the staining along the S1 and S2 segments appears to terminate earlier. Interestingly, some LAT2 staining is visible along the distal tubules as well. To perform a functional analysis of coexpressed heteromeric amino acid transporters of the proximal tubule and intestine, the MDCK cell line that is of distal nephron origin was chosen as recipient, because it does not express a high baseline transepithelial amino acid transport activity. Nevertheless, for the interpretation of the data obtained on transfected/transduced MDCK cells, one has to keep in mind that they do express some endogenous transporters. For instance, experiments performed in the eighties suggested the presence of endogenous system A and L (mostly basolateral), ASC (basolateral and apical), and of an apical Na+/amino acid symporter with a broad substrate selectivity (25Boerner P. Evans-Laying M., U, H.S. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13957-13962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MDCK cell line already expressing the apical heteromeric transporter b0,+AT-rBAT as well as untransfected MDCK cells were sequentially transduced with amphotropic pseudoretrovirus encoding the subunits of the heteromeric transporters y+LAT1-4F2hc and/or LAT2-4F2hc. The steady-state localization of these gene products was then analyzed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Fig. 2, A and B shows that 4F2hc, when expressed with LAT2 in b0,+AT-rBAT-expressing cells, localizes mainly to the lateral membrane. Only little intracellular and no apical 4F2hc staining can be seen. At the cell surface, there is also no overlap with rBAT (panel A, apical staining) or b0,+AT (panel B, intracellular and apical staining). LAT2 and 4F2hc co-localize in the basolateral membrane (Fig. 2 C), as expected from their localization in mouse kidney and small intestine (20Rossier G. Meier C. Bauch C. Summa V. Sordat B. Verrey F. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34948-34954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In this figure, made at a stage at which only ∼50% of the cells expressed both 4F2hc and LAT2, some cells exhibited LAT2 staining only, that, interestingly, was localized both intracellularly and at the lateral membrane. Because LAT2 was previously shown to necessitate association with 4F2hc for functional surface expression in Xenopus oocytes, the partial membrane localization of LAT2 in the absence of visible 4F2hc indirectly suggests the presence of some endogenous canine 4F2hc that is not recognized by the species-specific monoclonal antibody. The fact that coexpression of exogenous 4F2hc leads to an essentially basolateral immunolocalization of LAT2 confirms the hypothesis that 4F2hc is the limiting factor for LAT2 surface expression in MDCK cells. The subcellular localization of y+LAT1 has been visualized as yet only in Xenopus oocytes and in non-polarized transfected HEK293 cells (26Mykkanen J. Torrents D. Pineda M. Camps M. Yoldi M.E. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Huoponen K. Heinonen M. Oksanen J. Simell O. Savontaus M.L. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Aula P. Hum. Mol.

Commun. 2002; 291: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that exogenous y+LAT1 behaves as LAT2, namely that it colocalizes with exogenous 4F2hc in the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells (Fig. 2 D) and that in the absence of exogenous 4F2hc, only a small fraction of it appears at the basolateral surface (putatively associated with endogenous 4F2hc). To test the role and the cooperation of b0,+AT-rBAT and/or y+LAT1-4F2hc on transepithelial cationic amino acid transport, we added l-Arg and l-Leu together to both sides of the epithelia, to allow amino acid exchange to proceed in the absence of a transepithelial concentration gradient.l-Arg was chosen because it is, on the one hand, a good influx substrate for the apical transporter b0,+AT-rBAT that exchanges preferentially extracellular cationic amino acids orl-cystine against intracellular neutral amino acids and, on the other hand, a good efflux substrate for the basolateral transporter y+LAT1 known to preferentially exchange intracellular cationic amino acids against extracellular neutral amino acids plus Na+ (13Pfeiffer R.

B., and Chiueh, C. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9655–9660). When these neurotrophic cells were subjected to nonlethal 2-h serum deprivation, their neuronal nitric oxide synthase and Trx were up-regulated, and the cells became more tolerant of oxidative stress, indicating that NO may protect cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Here, the mechanism by which NO exerts its protective effects was investigated. Our results reveal that in SH-SY5Y cells, NO inhibits apoptosis through its ability to activate guanylate cyclase, which in turn activates the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). The activated PKG is required to protect cells from lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, to inhibit caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and to elevate the levels of Trx peroxidase-1 and Trx, which subsequently induces the expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, active PKG promotes the elevation of c-Jun, phosphorylated MAPK/ERK1/2, and c-Myc, consistent with the notion that PKG enhances the expression of Trx through its c-Myc-, AP-1-, and PEA3-binding motifs. Elevation of Trx and Trx peroxidase-1 and Mn(II)-superoxide dismutase would reduce H2O2and O2⨪, respectively. Thus, the cytoprotective effect of NO in SH-SY5Y cells appears to proceed via the PKG-mediated pathway, andS-nitrosylation of caspases plays a minimal role.

Furthermore, when the cells were subjected to 2 h of nonlethal stress in serum-free medium 12 h prior to the 24-h lethal serum deprivation, these cells exhibited hormesis, a protective effect induced by the preconditioning stress. This observed hormesis is associated with the elevation of Trx, NO, and cGMP, and the biosynthesis of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, externally added Trx induced the synthesis of Bcl-2 and Mn(II)-superoxide dismutase and suppressed serum-free induced ⋅OH, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis.Nitric oxide is known to promote and protect cells from apoptosis depending on conditions and cell types studied. At relatively high concentrations, NO causes apoptotic cell death in macrophages (9Meβmer U.K. Reimer D.M. Reed J.C. Brüne B.

The elevation of Bcl-2 was accomplished by the inhibition of Bcl-2 degradation catalyzed by caspase-3 (25Kim K.Y.M. Kim T.H. Seol D. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

Our results indicate that NO, elevated by the preconditioning stress-induced synthesis of neuronal NOS, causes the elevation of cGMP, which activates the PKG. The active PKG induces the synthesis of Bcl-2, TPx-1, Trx, c-Jun, and Mn(II)-superoxide dismutase and the phosphorylation of MAPK/Erk1/2 and c-Myc. Thus, with our system, the antiapoptotic effect of NO is mediated via a cGMP-dependent mechanism, whereas directS-nitrosylation of caspases appears not to be involved. Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the etiology and/or progression of aging and disease (for review, see Refs. 1Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Serum deprivation has been shown to induce free radical generation and apoptotic cell death, particularly with human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which exhibit high sensitivity to oxidative stress due to their low content of Trx1 (6Andoh T.

Furthermore, when the cells were subjected to 2 h of nonlethal stress in serum-free medium 12 h prior to the 24-h lethal serum deprivation, these cells exhibited hormesis, a protective effect induced by the preconditioning stress. This observed hormesis is associated with the elevation of Trx, NO, and cGMP, and the biosynthesis of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, externally added Trx induced the synthesis of Bcl-2 and Mn(II)-superoxide dismutase and suppressed serum-free induced ⋅OH, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis. Nitric oxide is known to promote and protect cells from apoptosis depending on conditions and cell types studied. At relatively high concentrations, NO causes apoptotic cell death in macrophages (9Meβmer U.K. Reimer D.M. Reed J.C. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas tumor necrosis factor-α and lipopolysaccharide induce NO synthesis in rat PC12 cells and apoptosis (10Heneka M.T.

However, at physiologically relevant concentrations, NO protects cells from apoptosis (6Andoh T. Lee S.Y. Chiueh C.C.

This protective mechanism has been shown to proceed via either a cGMP-dependent or -independent pathway. NO can also directly S-nitrosylate the active site cysteine of caspases and inhibit apoptosis (14Mannick J.B. Miao X.Q. Stamler J.S. J. Biol.

In addition, caspase-3 zymogens were found to be S-nitrosylated at their active site cysteine, and Fas induced its denitrosylation (16Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X.

We find that activation of the c-jun promoter through the ATF1 site requires phosphorylation of ATF1 at serine 63. A serine 63 to alanine mutation of ATF1 acts to block epidermal growth factor (EGF) induction of a transfected c-jun gene. ATF1 can be phosphorylated by mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), which is activated by EGF and ERK1/2. Kinase-dead MSK1 mutants blocked EGF induction of a transfected c-jun gene suggesting that MSK1 or a similar family member is required for induced c-junexpression. Use of the MEK1 inhibitor U0126 and dominant negative MEK1 further showed that MSK1 activation and c-jun induction require the ERK pathway. In contrast, a JNK inhibitor blocked EGF induction of c-jun expression but not ATF1 phosphorylation. These results show that the two MAPK pathways, ERK and JNK, are required for EGF-induced c-jun expression and that the ERK pathway acts through downstream phosphorylation of ATF1.

The products of the c-jun gene family (c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D) either homodimerize or form heterodimers with members of the c-fosgene family (c-Fos, Fos B, Fra1, and Fra2) or ATF family of transcription factors (2Angel P.

The Jun homodimers and Jun/Fos heterodimers bind specifically to AP1 sites (consensus sequence 5′-TGAGTCA-3′) also known as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive elements (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). The response of c-jun to mitogens is controlled by two mechanisms. First, phosphorylation of the N-terminal region of c-Jun by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 activates its transcriptional activation function, and second, mitogens induce transcription from the c-jun promoter (5Chang L.

Reporter genes containing the c-jun promoter can reproduce stimulation by many of the agents that stimulate c-junexpression. This has allowed the mapping of sequence elements required for induction. The c-jun promoter contains binding sites for SP1, CTF, MEF2, and ATF factors. There are two AP1-like elements, at −72 and −190, which have been termed the jun1 and jun2 sites, respectively (12van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have previously found that the jun1 site binds predominantly ATF1 and lesser amounts of the closely related factor CREB in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, the jun2 site binds ATF2-c-Jun heterodimers (12van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R.

Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). We mapped regions of the mouse c-jun promoter responsible for EGF induction and found that the ATF1 (jun1) site at −72 and a MEF2 site at −59 are critical for induction (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whereas point mutations show that both sites are required for EGF induction, we did not detect cooperative binding to these closely spaced sites. 2P. Gupta and R. Prywes, unpublished results.2P. Gupta and R. Prywes, unpublished results. Induction by genotoxic agents such as UV light requires both the jun2 and ATF1 sites (14van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The −59 site is bound by the MEF2 family of proteins, which include MEF2A through MEF2D. We found that MEF2D is the predominant factor binding to the c-jun MEF2 site in HeLa cell nuclear extracts with minor binding by MEF2A (16Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) although others have found more equal binding by MEF2A and MEF2D (17Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24927-24933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The intracellular pathways linking the EGF receptor to the c-jun promoter are not completely known. We previously investigated the role of a number of signaling pathways using activated and dominant negative factors. These experiments showed that EGF activates the c-jun promoter through a Ras to Rac to MEKK pathway (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because MEKK activates JNK, these results showed that the same pathway activates both the c-Jun protein product and transcription from the c-jun promoter. It has also been shown that serum and EGF activation of the c-jun promoter requires ERK5 signaling using MEF2 factors with mutations in their ERK5 phosphorylation site (18Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V.

Activation of the c-junpromoter by a G protein-coupled receptor (human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activated by carbachol) was found to utilize multiple pathways including JNK, p38, and ERK5, because all of these pathways needed to be blocked to completely reduce c-junluciferase induction by carbachol (20Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Activated RhoA was also found to activate the c-jun promoter in NIH3T3 cells (21Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 535-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), although we observed only very weak activation in HeLa cells (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell.

RhoA was found to activate c-jun in NIH3T3 cells via is activation of p38γ and required both the ATF1 and MEF2 sites (21Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S.

This provides one mechanism for activation of the c-jun promoter although these MAPKs are not induced by all inducers of c-jun expression. We report here on our investigation of the pathway activating the ATF1 site. ATF1 is inducibly phosphorylated on serine 63 to activate its transcriptional activity (24Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). This site is homologous to the serine 133 site in CREB that is phosphorylated upon activation and that is involved in binding to the coactivator CREB-binding protein (24Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). ATF1/CREB phosphorylation can be activated by ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways (25Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1/2 can activate members of the related RSK and MSK kinase families whereas and p38 can also activate the MSK family (26Bruning J.C. Gillette J.A. Zhao Y. Bjorbaeck C. Kotzka J. Knebel B. Avci H.

Mouse knock-outs of MSK1 and MSK2 show that these kinases are the major kinases required for EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts (31Wiggin G.R. Soloaga A. Foster J.M. Murray-Tait V. Cohen P. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Mutations in RSK2 were found to be associated with Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) (32Trivier E., De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Pannetier S. Zackai E. Young I. Mandel J.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Hanauer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and fibroblasts from CLS patients were found to be defective for EGF-induced CREB phosphorylation, suggesting that RSK2 is required for this modification in human fibroblasts (30De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This difference in the requirement for MSK1/2 or RSK2 may be because of cell-type specificity, because platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1-induced phosphorylation of CREB was normal in RSK2-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (26Bruning J.C. Gillette J.A. Zhao Y. Bjorbaeck C. Kotzka J. Knebel B. Avci H. Hanstein B. Lingohr P. Moller D.E. Krone W. Kahn C.R. Muller-Wieland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2462-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have tested here whether ATF1 phosphorylation is required for EGF induction of the c-jun promoter and what the pathway is for EGF-induced ATF1 phosphorylation. We find that ATF1 is rapidly phosphorylated after EGF treatment along with MSK1 kinase activity. Inhibition of MEK1 in the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway blocked EGF-induced ATF1 phosphorylation, MSK1 kinase activity, and c-jun expression. Dominant negative mutants of ATF1 and MSK1 inhibited EGF induction of c-jun mRNA suggesting that the ERK1/2 to MSK to ATF1 pathway is required for induction of c-jun expression. Human recombinant EGF was obtained fromBIOSOURCE International. The inhibitors of the MAPK, U0126, SB203580, and JNKII, were from Calbiochem. Phospho-specific antibodies to ERK, JNK, and p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling whereas the phospho-CREB/ATF1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-ATF1 sera were from Tsonwin Hai, Ohio State University (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). M2 antibodies against the FLAG tag, Protein A-agarose, the expression vector p3x FLAG-CMV, and the protease inhibitor mixture (P1860) were from Sigma. Plasmid pJC6GL3 contains position −225 to +150 of the murine c-jun promoter and a luciferase reporter gene (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A Renilla luciferase gene with the SV40 promoter, pRLSV40P, was used as an internal control (33Chen X. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). MSK1 and its mutants at residues 195 and 565 were subcloned into the expression vector p3xFLAG-CMV using the EcoRI and XbaI sites, with the FLAG tag at the N terminus. ATF1 and ATF1-S63A, with a serine to alanine mutation at position 63, were subcloned into p3xFLAG-CMV with the tag at the C terminus. For promoter transfection and RNase protection assays, IMAGE clone 3968444 (ATCC) that contains −50 to +4005 of the Mus musculusc-jun cDNA was digested with BamHI andXhoI and cloned into the BamHI andSalI sites of pJC6GL3 to make a construct, pcJUN, containing −225 to +4005 nucleotides of the mouse c-jun gene. Note that the genomic c-jun gene does not contain introns (34Hattori K. Angel P., Le Beau M.M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9148-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MSK1 and the MSK1 dominant negative mutants were from Dario Alessi, University of Dundee. The JNKK2-JNK1 fusion construct with three hemagglutinin tags was obtained from Anning Lin (35Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). pRaf BXB was used as an activated form of c-Raf-1 (36Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). MEKK1 was overexpressed in vector pCMV5 (37Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Activated MEK5 (MEK5DD), dominant negative MEK5 (MEK5AA), and ERK5 had three hemagglutinin tags at the N terminus and were a gift of Jack Dixon (University of Michigan), whereas the p38 expression vector had a FLAG tag at the N terminus. Activated MKK6 (MKK6EE) and dominant negative MKK3b(A) were gifts from Jiahuai Han (Scripps Research Institute). Dominant negative MEK1A was as described (38Pages G. Brunet A. L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ERK2 and Ras valine 12 expression vectors were from C. Chandra Kumar (Schering-Plough Research Institute). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS). Duplicates of 6-well plates were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar)). The c-jun reporter plasmid pJC6GL3 (0.25 μg), the internal control pRLSV40P (0.1 μg), and the indicated amounts of expression vectors were transfected keeping the total DNA at 2.5 μg per well with herring sperm DNA. Medium was changed 16–20 h after transfection; 8 to 12 h later cells were serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% NCS for 24 to 30 h. Luciferase assays were done using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Preparation of cell extracts was as described by the manufacturer. All firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase levels. HeLa cells were transfected with 3× FLAG tagged MSK1 (2.5 μg) alone or with the activators MEKK1, JNKK2-JNK1, Raf BXB and ERK2, MKK6EE and p38, or MEK5DD and ERK5 (2.5 μg of each activator) keeping the total DNA at 10 μg per 10-cm plate with herring sperm DNA. After 16 h of transfection, the medium was changed with DMEM and 10% NCS, and after another 8 h the medium was changed to DMEM with 0.2% NCS. After 60 h of transfection cells were treated with drugs U0126 (10 μm), SB203580 (10 μm), and/or JNKII (20 μm) for 40 min followed by EGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Plates were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture. Cells in lysates were scraped from the plates, transferred to microfuge tubes, and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,0000 rpm, and the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies (1:200 dilution) and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of 50% protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. To measure the kinase activity of FLAG-MSK1, bacterially purified His-tagged ATF1 was used as the substrate. His-tagged ATF1 was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal chelate affinity chromatography as described (40Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MSK1 immunoprecipitates (10 μl) were mixed with 14 μl of Kinase Buffer K (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 90 μm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol, and 10 μm ATP) along with 1 μl of purified His-ATF1 (1 mg/ml). The kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 12 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 0.3% Bromphenol Blue, 30% glycerol, 3% β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-CREB antibodies (1:1000 dilution). The MSK1 immunoprecipitates (10 μl) were also immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibodies (1:1000) to control for the expression levels of transfected MSK1. Cell lysates were prepared from HeLa cells grown on 35-mm plates by resuspending the cells in 50 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet-P40). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, 3× SDS sample buffer (25 μl) was added, and the samples were immunoblotted with 1:1000 dilutions of the indicated antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:5000) were used as secondary antibodies, and the signal was visualized using the ECL plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa cells (10-cm plates) were transfected with pcJUN containing −225 to +4005 of the mouse c-jun gene along with the internal control hsp70 promoter (phsp70CAT) (15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Where indicated the cells were also transfected with WT or mutant ATF1 (0.5 to 10 μg) and MSK1 genes (2.5 μg). After 60 h of transfection cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors and with or without EGF as described for the kinase assays. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated as described by the manufacturer and stored in formamide at −80 °C. Total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with 1 × 105 cpm of the RNase protection probe at 48 °C overnight. The RNase protection probe for transfected mouse c-jun, pJG4, was linearized with HindIII and transcribed with SP6 polymerase and [α-32P]CTP (15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This probe contains the mouse c-jun promoter and 250 nucleotides of the CAT gene such that it recognizes the transfected c-jun gene (150 nucleotides) and the CAT portion of the hsp70CAT internal control (250 nucleotides) (15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The hybridized samples were digested with 2 μg/ml of RNase T1 and 40 μg/ml of ribonuclease A at 30 °C for 1 h as described (15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Digests were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels and exposed to x-ray film. The endogenous level of human c-jun mRNA in untransfected HeLa cells was measured using the RNase protection probe pAP1SP65 that was linearized by EcoRI and transcribed with SP6 polymerase and [α-32P]CTP (15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We found previously that ATF1 is the predominant factor in HeLa nuclear extracts that binds to the jun1, AP1-like site in the c-jun promoter and that this site is critical for EGF induction of the c-jun promoter (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate how ATF1 might contribute to regulation of the promoter, we used phospho-specific antiserum to CREB phosphorylated at serine 133, which also recognizes ATF1 phosphorylated at serine 63. We found a strong and rapid increase in phosphorylated ATF1 after EGF treatment of HeLa cells, whereas there was no significant change in the amount of total ATF1 (Fig. 1 A). The kinetics of the increase precedes the increase in c-junmRNA consistent with a role in increasing c-juntranscription (6Lamph W.W. Wamsley P. Sassone-Corsi P. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 15Han T.H. Lamph W.W. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4472-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The increase was transient, returning to basal levels by 60 min. To identify a kinase responsible for phosphorylation of ATF1 we tested MSK1. MSK1 has been shown to phosphorylate CREB and to be activated by EGF, as well as ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs (27Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with 3× FLAG-tagged MSK1, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and assayed for ATF1 serine 63 kinase activity using recombinant ATF1 and anti-phospho-CREB serum. The transfected HeLa cells were treated with EGF or anisomycin, an activator of the p38 pathway that has been shown to activate MSK1 (27Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Both EGF and anisomycin caused a strong increase in MSK1 kinase activity, without affecting MSK1 levels (Fig. 1 B). These results show that MSK1 can be activated to phosphorylate ATF1 by EGF treatment comparably to anisomycin and suggest that it is involved in activating the c-jun promoter upstream of ATF1. Because we previously found that MEKK1 strongly activates the c-jun promoter (13Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we tested whether MEKK1 and other MAPK pathway family members could activate MSK1 kinase activity. Overexpression of MEKK1 alone is sufficient to cause activation of downstream components; however the MAPKs require activation. For JNK1 we transfected an activated form, JNKK2-JNK1, that is fused to its upstream kinase JNKK2/MKK7 (35Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ERK2, p38, and ERK5 were transfected with activated forms of their upstream kinases Raf-1, MKK6, and MEK5, respectively. MEKK1 activated MSK1 kinase activity, but its downstream kinase JNK1 did not, suggesting that MEKK1 activates MSK1 through a different pathway (Fig. 1 C). ERK2 and p38 activated MSK1 kinase activity as expected whereas ERK5 did not activate. ERK5 was highly activated as shown by induction of MEF2 reporter genes (data not shown). JNKK2-JNK1 was active as shown by its activation of a c-jun reporter gene (described below). These results suggest ERK2 and p38 as candidates for mediating MEKK1 and EGF activation of MSK1 and ATF1 phosphorylation. To determine the MAPK pathways responsible for EGF-induced phosphorylation of ATF1, we used chemical inhibitors of the different MAPK pathways. U0126 inhibits the ERK1/2 pathway by inhibiting the upstream kinase MEK1/2 (41Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). SB203580 inhibits the p38 pathway whereas the recently identified JNKII inhibits JNK1/2 (42Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J.

Although SDF-1α transduces signals via CXC receptor 4 (CXCR4), resulting in activating a panel of downstream signaling molecules, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), little is known about the SDF-1α-mediated signaling pathways leading to tube formation. Here we examined the signal transduction pathway involved in SDF-1α-mediated tube formation by primary human umbilical endothelial cells and murine brain capillary endothelial cell line (IBE (immortalized murine brain capillary endothelial) cells). SDF-1α stimulated tube formation by IBE cells, which was blocked by LY294002 and pertussis toxin, suggesting that PI3-kinase and Giprotein were involved in this process. SDF-1 also stimulated tube formation of human umbilical endothelial cells, and the response was LY294002-sensitive. SDF-1α activated PI3-kinase in IBE cells. In stable IBE cell lines expressing either the mutant p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (denoted Δp85-8 cells), which lacks association with the p110 subunit, or kinase-inactive c-Fes (denoted KEFes 5-15 cells), SDF-1α failed to activate PI3-kinase and to stimulate tube formation. SDF-1α-induced tube formation was inhibited by an antibody against murine vascular endothelial cadherin. The antibody as well as LY294002 attenuated SDF-1α-mediated compact cell-cell contact, which proceeded to tube formation.

They are divided into two groups, angiogenic stimulators, which share a consensus Glu-Leu-Arg-motif preceding the first cysteine residue, and inhibitors that lack this motif in their sequence.

Using this culture model, we have shown previously that expression of dominant negative c-Fes caused impaired chemotaxis toward FGF-2 and Ang2 (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J.

Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of dominant negative c-Fyn inhibited FGF-2- and Ang2-mediated tube formation (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsuda S. Ohtsuru A. Yamashita S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the signal transduction pathways leading to SDF-1α-mediated tube-like structure formation of IBE cells and human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). SDF-1α stimulated tube formation of both cells, and PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked tube formation, suggesting that PI3-kinase might be involved in this process by these cells. PI3-kinase was activated by SDF-1α-treatment in IBE cells, and the activation was dependent on c-Fes kinase activity. These results suggest that PI3-kinase is an important signaling molecule of SDF-1α-induced tube-like structure formation of endothelial cells. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat monoclonal antibody against mouse vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) was from Pharmingen. Mouse recombinant SDF-1α was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). LY294002, PP2, PD98059, and pertussis toxin were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as a stock solution, except pertussis toxin, and stored at −30 °C until use. Stock solutions were further diluted with Me2SO and dissolved in culture medium. Final concentration of Me2SO was 0.1% in all cases. Pertussis toxin was suspended in Tris-buffered saline and was kept at 4 °C until use. HUVECs and their culture medium were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with endothelial cell growth supplement, dexamethasone, fetal bovine serum, insulin, and epidermal growth factor as described in the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Parental IBE cells obtained from temperature-sensitive mutant SV40 large T transgenic mouse brain capillaries were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing fetal bovine serum, endothelial cell growth supplement, insulin, interferon-γ, and epidermal growth factor as has been described previously (17Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Stable IBE cell lines expressing kinase-inactive (dominant negative) c-Fes (denoted KEFes 5-15 cells) were described elsewhere (20Kanda S. Lerner E.C. Tsuda S. Shono T. Kanetake H. Smithgall T.E. J.

A stable cell line expressing deleted mutant p85 PI3-kinase subunit, which does not interact with p110 catalytic subunit (22Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A.

Tsuda S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7027-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Experiments using IBE cell lines were performed at 33 °C rather than at 39 °C because at the latter temperature, cells became senescent and lost responsiveness to extracellular stimuli (17Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). For IBE cells, cells were cultured between two layers of type I collagen gels in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin with or without indicated samples as described previously (17Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). For HUVECs, cells suspended in endothelial cell basal medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum were inoculated onto growth factor-reduced Matrigel® (BD Biosciences) with or without indicated samples and cultured for 24 h as described previously (24Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). To quantify the length of newly formed tubes, three random phase-contrast photomicrographs (×10 objectives) per well were taken, and the length of each tube was measured using NIH Image software (version 1.64). Tube length obtained from FGF-2-stimulated cells or SDF-1α-stimulated cells was set to 100 as described in the respective figure legends. The method used for determination of PI3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates of anti-phosphotyrosine was described previously (25Kanda S. Hodgkin M.N. Woodfield R.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Thomas G. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23347-23353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In brief, serum-starved cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by absorption with protein A-agarose beads. After extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were incubated with phosphatidylinositol and [γ-32P]ATP, and reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates. Incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into phosphatidylinositol was measured by Image Analyzer BAS 5000 (Fuji) followed by exposure on x-ray films (Amersham Biosciences). Serum- and growth factor-starved IBE cells were either stimulated or left unstimulated with 500 ng/ml SDF-1α in the presence of orthovanadate (50 μm) for 10 min. c-Akt was immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt antibody followed by immunoblotting with either anti-phospho-Akt or anti-Akt antibodies. SDF-1α induces tube-like structure formation of primary human endothelial cells (10Mirshahi F. Pourtau J. Li H. Muraine M. Trochon V. legrand E. Vannier J.-P. Soria J. Vasse M. Soria C. Thromb.

To examine whether SDF-1α also stimulates tube formation of IBE cells, we tested the effect of SDF-1α on morphological changes of the cells. IBE cells respond to FGF-2 and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) to form lumen-containing tube-like structures (18Rahmanian M. Pertoft H. Kanda S. Christofferson R. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, FGF-2 induced multicellular aggregates of IBE cells followed by sprouting and fusion of aggregates, resulting in branching tube-like structures (26Kanda S. Tomasini-Johansson B. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SDF-1α induced the formation of the tube-like structures of IBE cells, which was similar to the effect of FGF-2. CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled receptor. We then examined the effect of pertussis toxin on SDF-1α-induced tube formation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, pertussis toxin at 50 ng/ml blocked SDF-1α-induced tube formation, suggesting that Gi protein was involved in this process. We then tested the effects of pharmacological inhibitors on SDF-1α-induced tube formation. Neither Src family inhibitor PP2 nor mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 inhibited SDF-1α-induced tube formation of IBE cells (data not shown). Treatment of cells with PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked SDF-1α-induced tube formation (Fig. 1 C). PI3-kinase inhibitor could not block FGF-2- and Ang2-mediated tube formation (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kanda S. Hodgkin M.N. Woodfield R.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Thomas G. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23347-23353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). FGF-2- and Ang2-mediated tube formation was dependent on c-Fyn kinase activity (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsuda S. Ohtsuru A. Yamashita S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ang2 could not further stimulate FGF-2-induced tube formation (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Ang2 and FGF-2 utilized a common signaling pathway leading to tube formation, such as c-Fyn. To test whether SDF-1α-induced tube formation requires different signaling pathways activated by FGF-2 and Ang2, we examined the additive effect of SDF-1α on FGF-2- and Ang2-induced tube formation. As shown in Fig. 1 D, SDF-1α further stimulated FGF-2- and Ang2-induced tube formation. These results suggest that SDF-1α-induced tube formation of IBE cells may be dependent on PI3-kinase, which is not involved in FGF-2- and Ang2-mediated tube formation. We also examined the formation of tube-like structures by primary HUVECs on Matrigel. Fig. 2 A shows that FGF-2 as well as SDF-1α induced the formation of tube-like structures. In addition, LY294002 markedly inhibited SDF-1α-mediated formation of tube-like structures of HUVECs (Fig. 2 B). LY294002 showed little effect on FGF-2-induced formation of tube-like structures of HUVECs. 2S. Kanda, unpublished observations. Considered collectively, PI3-kinase may be involved commonly in SDF-1α-mediated tube formation by endothelial cells from different origins.Figure 2As shown in A, SDF-1α-induces tube-like structure formation of HUVECs. HUVECs were cultured on to the surface of Matrigel in the presence or absence of indicated growth factors. Tube length obtained from FGF-2-stimulated cells was set to 100. As shown in B, the SDF-1α-induced tube-like structure formation of HUVECs is LY294002-sensitive. HUVECs were seeded onto the surface of Matrigel in the presence of either 0.1% Me2SO (DMSO) or 10 μm LY294002 and cultured for 24 h. Tube length obtained from SDF-1α-stimulated cells was set to 100.

IBE cells were treated with either Me2SO (vehicle) or LY294002 for 30 min and then stimulated with SDF-1α. Cells were lysed, and PI3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was examined by thin layer chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PI3-kinase activity in immunoprecipitates of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from IBE cells was increased by SDF-1α treatment, suggesting that SDF-1α induced tyrosine phosphorylation of particular proteins followed by association with PI3-kinase. SDF-1α also increased the PI3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of HUVECs. c-Fes tyrosine kinase is exclusively expressed in endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells. Activation of c-Fes by extracellular stimuli requires oligomerization by its coiled-coil domain followed by autophosphorylation (27Smithgall T.E. Rogers J.A. Peters K.L., Li, J. Briggs S.D. Lionberger J.M. Cheng H. Shibata A. Scholtz B. Schreiner S. Dunham N. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). c-Fes tyrosine kinase is expressed in both HUVECs and IBE cells (20Kanda S. Lerner E.C. Tsuda S. Shono T. Kanetake H. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10105-10111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we showed that Ang2-mediated activation of PI3-kinase was dependent on c-Fes (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of SDF-1α on PI3-kinase in KEFes 5-15 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, SDF-1α could not elevate the PI3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of KEFes 5-15 cells. This result suggests that SDF-1α–mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of particular proteins, which subsequently associate with PI3-kinase, may be c-Fes-dependent. SDF-1α also failed to increase the PI3-kinase activity in Δp85-8 cells, suggesting that the association of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was required in this reaction. c-Akt/protein kinase B is one of the important downstream targets of PI3-kinase and is involved in cell survival. We examined the activation of c-Akt by SDF-1α. As shown in Fig. 3 C, phosphorylation of c-Akt was increased by SDF-1α-treatment in IBE cells, and the increase was not observed in KEFes 5-15 cells. Considered collectively, these data suggest that SDF-1α utilized c-Fes, resulting in activation of PI3-kinase and c-Akt in IBE cells. We also examined the SDF-1α-mediated tube formation in KEFes 5-15 and Δp85-8 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, SDF-1α failed to stimulate tube formation in KEFes 5-15 cells as well as Δp85-8 cells. These results strongly suggest that SDF-1α-mediated tube-like structure formation by endothelial cells requires PI3-kinase activation, possibly through c-Fes.Figure 4SDF-1α cannot induce tube-like structure formation by KEFes 5-15 cells (A) or Δp85-8 cells (B).Indicated IBE cell lines were treated or untreated with 500 ng/ml of SDF-1α or FGF-2 (as a positive control) and cultured between two layers of collagen gels.

Data shown are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although distinct methods are employed to assess the ability of cultured endothelial cells to form tube-like structures, common behavior involved in this process includes cell-cell contact. Endothelial cells contact each other to form cellular aggregates followed by lumen formation between aggregated cells (26Kanda S. Tomasini-Johansson B. Rubin K. Claesson-Welsh L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 29Ingber D.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We then examined the effect of SDF-1α on endothelial cell-cell contact. When treated with SDF-1α, IBE cells adhered to neighboring cells and formed compact aggregation at 8 h, which is characterized by the disappearance of borders between aggregated cells (Fig. 5 A). This tight cell-cell contact, denoted cell compaction, is observed in cadherin-dependent cell-cell aggregation (31Vestweber, D., and Kemler, R. EMBO J. 4,3393–3398Google Scholar, 32Matsubara, S., and Ozawa, M. J. Cell Biol. 154, 573–584Google Scholar). Tight cell-cell contact was not observed in untreated IBE cells (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, cell compaction was inhibited by anti-VE-cadherin antibody, suggesting that VE-cadherin was required for cell compaction. Consequently, anti-mouse VE-cadherin antibody inhibited SDF-1α-induced tube formation (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact may be involved in this process. As shown in Fig. 6, compaction was hardly observed in SDF-1α–treated IBE cells in the presence of LY294002. Only loose cell-cell contact was observed in SDF-1α–treated KEFes 5-15 cells and in Δp85-8 cells as well. These results suggest that SDF-1α-induced tube formation may be regulated by PI3-kinase-dependent tight cell-cell contact. Considered collectively, PI3-kinase and its downstream target molecules, such as c-Akt, seem to be required for SDF-1α-induced tube formation. In fact, recent reports have demonstrated that c-Akt was involved in tube formation of endothelial cells (33Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T.

Although FGF-2 induced cell compaction of IBE cells as well, PI3-kinase inhibitor did not inhibit the cell compaction (data not shown). FGF-2 sufficiently promoted tube formation by KEFes 5-15 cells and Δp85-8 cells. FGF-2 activates PI3-kinase through activated Ras but not through binding to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (23Mochizuki Y. Tsuda S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7027-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ang2 activated PI3-kinase through binding to tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, and the activation was dependent on c-Fes kinase activity (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ang2-induced PI3-kinase activity was involved in chemotaxis of IBE cells. Treatment of cells with LY294002 did not inhibit Ang2-induced tube formation (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PI3-kinase does not seem to be involved in this response. On the other hand, FGF-2 and Ang2 activated c-Fyn in IBE cells (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsuda S. Ohtsuru A. Yamashita S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with PP2 or expression of kinase-inactive c-Fyn inhibited FGF-2- or Ang2-promoted tube formation of IBE cells, suggesting that signals through receptor tyrosine kinases leading to tube formation seem to require c-Fyn but not PI3-kinase (19Mochizuki Y. Nakamura T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsuda S. Ohtsuru A. Yamashita S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that c-Fyn was activated by SDF-1α treatment in Jurkat T cells (15Chemock R.D. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect SDF-1α-induced c-Fyn activation in IBE cells (data not shown). Additionally, PP2 failed to inhibit SDF-1α-induced tube formation. Since induction of chemotaxis involves dissociation of cells, Ang2-mediated PI3-kinase activation would not be involved in cell compaction. Conversely, SDF-1α-induced PI3-kinase activation was required for cell compaction. A number of protein kinases are activated by lipid products of PI3-kinase (36Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 37Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Depending on the culture condition (i.e. two dimensional culture for migration assay and three-dimensional culture for tube formation), qualitatively different signaling molecules may be accumulated into focal adhesion complexes or cell-cell contacts, where cross-talk between growth factor signaling and cell adhesion signaling exist. Therefore, PI3-kinase activated by Ang2 or SDF-1α may regulate distinct sets of downstream signaling molecules. In conclusion, we have shown in the present study that SDF-1α induced tube formation of endothelial cells through c-Fes-dependent activation of PI3-kinase, and formation of cadherin-dependent tight cell-cell contact seemed to be involved in this process.Figure 6Treatment of cells with LY294002 or cells expressing kinase-inactive c-Fes and mutant p85 subunit of PI3-kinase reduces tight cell-cell contact mediated by 500 ng/ml SDF-1α.

https://openalex.org/W2074938682,"Abstract The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has four membrane-associated domains, three of which are membrane-spanning (M1, M3, and M4) and one of which is a re-entrant pore loop (M2). The M1–M3 domains have been demonstrated to influence the function of the ion channel, but a similar role for the M4 domain has not been reported. We have identified a methionine residue (Met823) in the M4 domain of the NR2A subunit that regulates desensitization and ion channel gating. A tryptophan substitution at this site did not alter the EC50 for glycine or the peak NMDA EC50 but decreased the steady-state NMDA EC50 and markedly increased apparent desensitization, mean open time, and peak current density. Results of rapid solution exchange experiments revealed that changes in microscopic desensitization rates and closing rates could account for the changes in macroscopic desensitization, steady-state NMDA EC50, and current density. Other amino acid substitutions at this site could increase or decrease the rate of desensitization and mean open time of the ion channel. Both mean open time and desensitization were dependent primarily upon the hydrophobic character of the amino acid at the position. These results demonstrate an important role for hydrophobic interactions at Met823 in regulation of NMDA receptor function."

The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms regulating MIP-3α gene transcription in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. We show that a κB element at nucleotides −82 to −93 of the MIP-3α promoter binds p50/p65 NF-κB heterodimers and is a major regulator of basal and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated gene activation. Scanning mutagenesis of the MIP-3α 5′-flanking region also identified two additional binding elements: Site X (nucleotides −63 to −69) and Site Y (nucleotides −143 to −154). Site X (CGCCTTC) bound Sp1 and regulated basal MIP-3α gene transcription. Overexpression of Sp1 increased basal luciferase activity, whereas, substitutions in the Sp1 element significantly reduced reporter activity. In contrast, Site Y (AAGCAGGAAGTT) regulated both basal and cytokine-induced gene activation and bound the Ets nuclear factor ESE-1. Substitutions in the Site Y element markedly reduced inducible MIP-3α reporter activity. Conversely, overexpression of ESE-1 significantly up-regulated MIP-3α luciferase levels.

Interaction of these molecules with their respective leukocyte receptors induces a characteristic set of responses that are necessary for leukocytes to leave the circulation and infiltrate tissues. These include elevation of intracellular calcium levels, modulation of adhesion molecule expression, formation of lamellipodia, and migration of leukocytes along a chemotactic gradient. Thus increased chemokine production and release is an important mechanism regulating leukocyte activation and recruitment in response to injury or infection. To date, over 40 chemokines have been identified, which can be classified into one of four subfamilies according to the number and arrangement of conserved cysteine residues (C, CC, CXC, or CX 3C) (2Ben-Baruch A.

Macrophage inflammatory protein-3α (also known as CCL20 or liver and activation regulated chemokine) is a recently described CC chemokine that is predominantly expressed at extralymphoid sites, including the small intestine and colon and is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli (8Hieshima K.

Science. 1998; 279: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In recent studies we, and others, have shown that enterocytes are a major site of MIP-3α production in human colon and that epithelial MIP-3α protein levels are elevated in IBD1 (15Kwon J.H. Keates S. Bassani L. Mayer L. Keates A.C. Gut. 2002; 51: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Izadpanah A. Dwinell M.B. Eckmann L. Varki N.M. Kagnoff M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G710-G719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies are complemented by a recent report that MIP-3α mRNA levels were significantly elevated in chronically inflamed colons from IL-10 knockout mice (17Scheerens H. Hessel E. Waal-Malefyt R. Leach M.W. Rennick D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of colonic inflammation in this model by treatment with anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody resulted in down-regulation of MIP-3α mRNA levels. Because Crohn's disease in humans and the IL-10 knockout murine model of colitis are both characterized by a prominent infiltration of the colonic mucosa by CD4+ T-lymphocytes (18James S.P. Fiocchi C. Graeff A.S. Strober W. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 1483-1489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Davidson N.J. Leach M.W. Fort M.M. Thompson-Snipes L. Kuhn R. Muller W. Berg D.J. Rennick D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), these data suggest that MIP-3α may play an especially important role in the recruitment of these cells to the epithelial layer during intestinal inflammation. The production of chemokines is largely regulated at the level of gene transcription (2Ben-Baruch A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Ye J. Young H.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Of particular significance is the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors, which are important regulators of a variety of immune and inflammatory response genes (21Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 22Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 23Neurath M.F. Becker C.

Several recent studies have demonstrated that MIP-3α gene expression is NF-κB-dependent (16Izadpanah A. Dwinell M.B. Eckmann L. Varki N.M. Kagnoff M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: G710-G719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Harant H. Eldershaw S.A. Lindley I.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Imaizumi Y. Sugita S. Yamamoto K. Imanishi D. Kohno T. Tomonaga M. Matsuyama T. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In particular, Fujiie et al. (27Fujiie S. Hieshima K. Izawa D. Nakayama T. Fujisawa R. Ohyanagi H. Yoshie O. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have reported that an NF-κB binding site in the murine MIP-3α promoter is required for cytokine-induced gene expression in Caco-2 human colonic epithelial cells. Whether production of MIP-3α by human intestinal epithelial cells requires the participation of additional nuclear factors has not been investigated. In this study we confirmed that the human MIP-3α promoter NF-κB binding site plays a major role in regulating IL-1β-induced gene transcription in Caco-2 cells. We also identified two additional 5′ regulatory elements: “Site X” (nucleotides −63 to −69) and “Site Y” (nucleotides −143 to −154). Our findings demonstrate that Sp1 and the epithelium-specific Ets nuclear factor ESE-1 (binding to Site X and Site Y, respectively) are important co-regulators of MIP-3α gene expression in Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells. Caco-2 ileocecal cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and non-essential amino acids (Sigma) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For all experiments, confluent Caco-2 cell monolayers were stimulated by IL-1β (5 ng/ml). This stimulus was selected because colonic levels of this pro-inflammatory cytokine are significantly elevated in human IBD (28Cominelli F. Pizarro T.T. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 10: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown previously that IL-1β can dose-dependently up-regulate MIP-3α mRNA and protein production in Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells (15Kwon J.H. Keates S. Bassani L. Mayer L. Keates A.C. Gut. 2002; 51: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the human MIP-3α gene was isolated by screening a human genomic library using a 32P-labeled MIP-3α cDNA probe. To create the probe, Caco-2 cell RNA (1 μg) was reversed-transcribed, and cDNAs encoding MIP-3α were amplified by PCR as previously described (29Keates S. Keates A.C. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A. Kelly C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G75-G82PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers used to generate the MIP-3α probe were: sense, 5′-GAG TTT GCT CCT GGC TGC TTT-3′; antisense, 5′-TTT ACT GAG GAG ACG CAC AAT-3′. The genomic library screening procedure was performed essentially as described by Keateset al. (30Keates A.C. Nunes D.P. Afdhal N.H. Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, a commercially available human genomic library in Lambda Fix II (Stratagene) was plated onEscherichia coli LE 392 at a density of 37500 plaque forming units/150-mm Petri dish and then transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Plaque filters were then hybridized with a random primer-labeled human MIP-3α cDNA probe at 42 °C in a solution containing 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 0.1% SDS, 50% (v/v) formamide, and 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate. Final washes to remove non-hybridized probe were performed in 0.25× SSC at 42 °C. Genomic clones that hybridized with the MIP-3α probe were replated and rescreened until they were plaque-purified. Lambda DNA was then isolated from the positive clones and digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases, and Southern blots of the digests were probed with the human MIP-3α cDNA probe. Fragments of insert DNA that hybridized with the probe were then subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene). Genomic DNA 5′ to the MIP-3α cDNA probe (i.e. the MIP-3α promoter) was then sequenced by “walking” from both ends or from a defined point using specific oligonucleotide primers. An 849-bp fragment (containing nucleotides −817 to +33) of MIP-3α promoter was prepared by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA using a sense primer containing a MluI restriction site and an antisense primer containing a BglII restriction site. Following digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes the MIP-3α promoter fragment was directionally cloned into the pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase expression vector (Promega) to generate a “full-length” MIP-3α reporter construct. Reporter genes containing sequentially truncated fragments (−712, −618, −521, −406, −317, −216, −162, −124, −103, and −62 to +33) of the MIP-3α promoter region were prepared in a similar manner using sense primers containing MluI restriction sites, and the antisense primer used to generate the full-length MIP-3α reporter construct. Mutant reporter constructs containing systematic scanning substitutions of the MIP-3α promoter or targeted substitutions in the binding elements of putative regulatory factors (i.e. NF-κB, C/EBP, Site X, and Site Y; see Table I) were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis as previously described (31Keates A.C. Keates S. Kwon J.H. Arseneau K.O. Law D.J. Bai L. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Kelly C.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 2 × 105/well on a twelve-well tissue culture dish (Corning Costar). Three hours prior to transfection, Caco-2 cells were incubated with fetal calf serum-free, antibiotic-free media and then transfected with 1.8 μg of MIP-3α reporter gene plasmid DNA or equimolar amounts of MIP-3α reporter constructs containing truncated promoter sequences. To correct for variations in DNA uptake by the cells, each test construct was co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase control vector (Promega). Transfections using pGL3-Basic vector without an insert were used as a negative control. For experiments investigating the effect of Sp1, Sp3, and ESE-1 overexpression on MIP-3α reporter gene activity, Caco-2 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of full-length MIP-3α reporter gene and 1.5 μg of pCMV-Sp1 or pCMV-Sp3 (kindly provided by Dr. G. Suske, Marburg, Germany) or 1.5 μg of pCI-ESE-1. After transfection for 15 h, the media were removed and replaced with complete growth medium. After a further 24 h, Caco-2 cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with serum-free medium for 16 h to reduce background luciferase levels prior to stimulation with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 6 h. The firefly and Renillaluciferase activities of the cells were then measured simultaneously in each sample using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To examine the activation of transcription factors EMSA was performed essentially as described by Keates et al. (31Keates A.C. Keates S. Kwon J.H. Arseneau K.O. Law D.J. Bai L. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Kelly C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43713-43722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) Briefly, single-stranded complementary oligonucleotides bearing either wild-type or mutant MIP-3α promoter binding elements (i.e. NF-κB, Site X, and Site Y) were prepared by custom oligonucleotide synthesis (Genosys Biotechnologies). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus binding site for Sp1 was obtained commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After annealing, 100 ng of the double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Labeled probes were then purified on a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Binding reactions for NF-κB EMSAs were performed as described by Ferrari et al. (32Ferrari D. Wesselborg S. Bauer M.K.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Site X EMSAs were performed according to the method of Wang et al. (33Wang D. Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14244-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that 100 μm ZnSO4 was added to the binding reactions. Site Y EMSAs were performed according to the protocol of Oettgen et al. (34Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4419-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Caco-2 cell nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in the reaction mixture after which the probe DNA was added and the incubation continued for another 30 min. Probe-protein complexes were then separated from free probe using 4.5% native polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C to visualize the probe-protein complexes. To confirm the specificity of the binding reactions supershift assays were performed using antibodies to the Sp family proteins Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the Ets factors ESE-1 (Oncogene Research Products), ESE-2 and Ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the NF-κB subunits p50, p52, p65, Rel B, and c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In some experiments binding specificity was also determined by competition with excess unlabeled probe. Antibodies or competing probe were added to the binding reactions at the start of the 30-min incubation period. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStatTM for WindowsTM version 2.0 (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Analysis of variance followed by protected t tests were used for intergroup comparisons. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that enterocytes are a major site of MIP-3α production in human colon and that epithelial MIP-3α protein levels are elevated in IBD (15Kwon J.H. Keates S. Bassani L. Mayer L. Keates A.C. Gut. 2002; 51: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that control MIP-3α gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells are poorly understood. To investigate the nuclear factors that regulate MIP-3α production we first cloned the 5′-flanking region of the gene from a human genomic DNA library using a MIP-3α cDNA probe. Using this approach we identified three genomic clones, designated G2-1, G6-1, G10-1, that hybridized with the MIP-3α cDNA probe from a screening of ∼375,000 plaque-forming units. An 8-kb EcoRI fragment from clone G6–1 was extensively sequenced and found to contain 878 bp of the MIP-3α gene 5′-flanking region (Fig. 1). The nucleotide sequence of the MIP-3α promoter fragment was identical to that reported recently by Harant et al. (25Harant H. Eldershaw S.A. Lindley I.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this sequence using the TransFac data base (35Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), identified putative binding sites for NF-κB, C/EBP, AP-1, c-Ets, and Sp1/CACCC binding protein within the first 250 bp of the promoter. A previous study by Hieshima et al. (8Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, identified a transcription initiation point 58-bp upstream from the MIP-3α start codon. Previous studies have shown that the production of chemokines is largely regulated via up-regulation of gene transcription (2Ben-Baruch A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Ye J. Young H.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a recent study we have shown that MIP-3α production by cytokine-stimulated Caco-2 cells requires de novo mRNA synthesis (15Kwon J.H. Keates S. Bassani L. Mayer L. Keates A.C. Gut. 2002; 51: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To begin to characterize the areas of the 5′ promoter region that regulate MIP-3α gene expression, a series of luciferase reporter constructs containing sequentially truncated fragments of the MIP-3α promoter were created and transfected into Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 2). As expected, following stimulation by IL-1β (5 ng/ml, 6 h) no significant increase in luciferase reporter gene activity was seen in Caco-2 cells transfected with empty expression vector or a MIP-3α reporter gene containing the TATA binding site alone (nucleotides −62 to +33) compared with non-treated cells. In contrast, the luciferase activity of Caco-2 cells transfected with a MIP-3α reporter construct bearing putative NF-κB & C/EBP binding elements (nucleotides −103 to +33) was increased 11.9-fold (p < 0.01) by IL-1β stimulation. The basal activity of this construct was elevated ∼5.6-fold compared with Caco-2 cells transfected with empty expression vector. Compared with non-stimulated cells, increases in IL-1β-inducible reporter activity were also observed when Caco-2 cells were transfected with MIP-3α reporter genes containing the putative AP-1 binding site (33.6-fold, p < 0.01, nucleotides −124 to +33) and the putative c-Ets binding site (54.8-fold, p < 0.01, nucleotides −162 to +33). An additional increase in luciferase activity (∼2.5-fold,p < 0.01) was seen when Caco-2 cells were transfected with reporter genes containing nucleotides −162 to −317 of the MIP-3α promoter. However, binding elements in this region had little effect on IL-1-inducible reporter activity (∼30-fold), suggesting they primarily regulate basal gene expression. Taken together, these data indicate that nuclear factor binding sites within the first 317 nucleotides of the promoter are both necessary and sufficient for basal and IL-1β-inducible MIP-3α gene expression in Caco-2 cells. Previous studies have shown that the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of immune and inflammatory response genes, including those of the chemokine superfamily (21Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 22Baldwin A.S., Jr. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 23Neurath M.F. Becker C. Barbulescu K. Gut. 1998; 43: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, our data using truncated reporter constructs suggested that the region of the MIP-3α promoter containing putative NF-κB and C/EBP binding elements was also likely to be important for the regulation of inducible gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. We therefore examined this region in greater detail using mutated reporter gene constructs and EMSA (see Table I) to define the role of each nuclear factor binding site. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells transfected with the wild-type MIP-3α reporter by IL-1β (5 ng/ml, 6 h) induced an ∼40-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with non-stimulated cells (Fig. 3 A). Targeted substitutions within the putative NF-κB binding site significantly reduced IL-1-inducible gene expression by ∼90% (p < 0.01) compared with non-stimulated cells. Moreover, in non-stimulated Caco-2 cells, substitution of the putative NF-κB binding site also reduced basal luciferase activity ∼50% (p < 0.01) compared with cells transfected with the wild-type MIP-3α reporter construct (Fig 3 A). In contrast to these findings, substitution of the putative C/EBP binding site had no significant effect on either basal or IL-1β-mediated MIP-3α reporter gene activity. These findings demonstrate that NF-κB binding site, but not the C/EBP binding site, is an important regulator of both basal and IL-1β-inducible MIP-3α gene expression in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. To examine NF-κB regulation of MIP-3α gene expression in more detail we next performed EMSAs in non-transfected Caco-2 cells using a MIP-3α-specific probe. As expected, nuclear extracts from control Caco-2 cells showed little NF-κB binding (Fig. 3 B). Within 30 min of treatment with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) Caco-2 nuclear extracts showed a marked increase in binding of two complexes to the MIP-3α-specific NF-κB probe (indicated by arrows). Levels of the faster migrating complex (band 1) appeared to remain constant over the 6-h time course of the experiment, whereas levels of the slower migrating complex (band 2) were maximal after 30 min to 1 h and declined thereafter. To determine which NF-κB subunits bound to the MIP-3α-specific probe, we next performed a supershift experiment. Nuclear extracts prepared from Caco-2 cells treated with IL-1β (5 ng/ml) for 2 h were incubated with either antibodies against the Rel proteins p50, p52, p65, Rel B, and c-rel or excess cold probe and then subjected to EMSA (Fig. 3 C). The lower complex (band 1) only underwent a supershift with the p50 antibody indicating the presence of a p50/p50 homodimer. In contrast, the upper complex (band 2) was supershifted by both the p50 antibody and the p65 antibody demonstrating binding of p50/p65 heterodimers to the MIP-3α NF-κB binding element. As shown in Fig. 2, truncation of the MIP-3α promoter demonstrated that nuclear factor binding sites within the first 317 nucleotides of the MIP-3α promoter were essential for maximal responses to IL-1β in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, these data also indicated that other factors, in addition to NF-κB, which bind to the promoter between nucleotides −103 and −162 are required for inducible gene expression. To further characterize the factors that regulate cytokine-inducible MIP-3α gene expression we next performed scanning mutagenesis of the MIP-3α promoter between nucleotides −46 to −166 to define specific nuclear factor binding element(s). To accomplish this a series of 12 full-length MIP-3α reporter constructs containing sequential 10 bp nucleotide substitutions were prepared and transfected in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4). As expected, the luciferase activity of Caco-2 cells transfected with reporter genes carrying mutations of the NF-κB binding site (constructs 8 and 9; nucleotides −76 to −96) were substantially reduced (p< 0.01 for both) when compared with cells transfected with the wild-type construct. Caco-2 cells transfected with reporter genes containing substitutions within the putative c-Ets binding element (construct 2; nucleotides −146 to −156) also showed significantly reduced IL-1-inducible luciferase activity (p < 0.01). Similar findings were observed when nucleotides encompassing the putative AP-1 site (constructs 5 and 6; −106 to −126) were substituted. Interestingly, compared with cells transfected with the wild-type MIP-3α reporter construct, a substantial decrease in reporter activity (p < 0.01) was also detected when Caco-2 cells were transfected with a MIP-3α reporter construct in which nucleotides −66 to −76 (construct 10) were mutated.

https://openalex.org/W1964808986,"Mammalian Sprouty proteins have been shown to inhibit the proliferation and migration of cells in response to growth factors and serum. In this communication, using HeLa cells, we have examined the possibility that human Sprouty 2 (hSPRY2) mediates its anti-migratory actions by modulating the activity or intracellular localization of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. In HeLa cells, overexpression of hSPRY2 resulted in an increase in protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) amount and activity in the soluble (100,000 ×g) fraction of cells without an increase in total amount of cellular PTP1B. This increase in the soluble form of PTP1B was accompanied by a decrease in the amount of the enzyme in the particulate fraction. The amounts of PTP-PEST or PTP1D in the soluble fractions were not altered. Consistent with an increase in soluble PTP1B amount and activity, the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and p130Cas was decreased in hSPRY2-expressing cells. In control cells, overexpression of wild-type (WT) PTP1B, but not its C215S catalytically inactive mutant mimicked the actions of hSPRY2 on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and migration. On the other hand, in hSPRY2-expressing cells, the C215S mutant, but not WT PTP1B, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins and attenuated the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2. Interestingly, neither WT nor C215S mutant forms of PTP1B modulated the anti-mitogenic actions of hSPRY2. Therefore, we conclude that an increase in soluble PTP1B activity contributes to the anti-migratory, but not anti-mitogenic, actions of hSPRY2.

Sprouty human Sprouty 2 epidermal growth factor 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B enhanced green fluorescent protein wild-type dominant negative extracellular signal-regulated kinase Sprouty (SPRY)1 was originally described as a protein that regulated fibroblast growth factor signaling in Drosophila and inhibited tracheal branching (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SPRY was reported as an inhibitor of signaling events initiated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (2Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development ( Camb .). 1999; 126: 4139-4147PubMed Google Scholar) inDrosophila and shown to modulate wing vein formation. To date, four isoforms of mammalian SPRY proteins have been cloned (1Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y.

Development ( Camb .). 1999; 126: 4465-4475PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins have a highly conserved C terminus but their N terminus is variable. Like the Drosophila SPRY proteins, a decrease in mouse SPRY2 expression resulted in increased lung branching morphogenesis (3Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J. Bringas P., Jr. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrated that SPRY proteins have conserved function to modulate respiratory morphogenesis. The ability of mouse SPRY4 to inhibit angiogenesis (6Lee S.H. Schloss D.J. Jarvis L. Krasnow M.A. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) also demonstrates that the SPRY proteins plays a profound role in regulating tubular morphogenesis. At the cellular level, we and others have shown that SPRY1 (7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), SPRY2 (8Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and SPRY4 (6Lee S.H. Schloss D.J. Jarvis L. Krasnow M.A. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) inhibit migration and proliferation of cells in response to serum and growth factors. However, the mechanisms involved in SPRY-elicited inhibition of cellular proliferation and migration remain to be completely elucidated. SPRY1 and SPRY2 have been shown to decrease Erk activation in response to fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelium-derived growth factor in vascular endothelial cells (6Lee S.H. Schloss D.J. Jarvis L. Krasnow M.A. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, even though EGF-stimulated cellular proliferation was inhibited by SPRY proteins, the ability of EGF to activate Erk activation was not affected (7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We have also observed that although the activation of Erk by EGF is not altered by overexpression of human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) in HeLa cells, 2Y. Yigzaw and T. B. Patel, unpublished results. the proliferation and migration of these cells in response to EGF is markedly attenuated by hSPRY2 (8Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another level of regulation by SPRY proteins may involve direct interactions with certain signaling molecules. For instance, hSPRY2 has been shown to interact directly with c-Cbl, and this interaction decreases internalization and down-regulation of the EGF receptor (9Wong E.S. Lim J. Low B.C. Chen Q. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5866-5875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because the functions of receptor tyrosine kinases can be attenuated by increase in protein-tyrosine phosphatase activities, we investigated the possibility that hSPRY2 may alter the cellular activity of some protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) and thereby modulate the biological actions of serum or growth factors. In this communication we demonstrate that the amount of soluble protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) activity is increased in hSPRY2-expressing cells. This is accompanied by a decrease in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of PTP1B mimicked the actions of hSPRY2 and inhibited serum-induced cell migration. More importantly, the inhibition of PTP1B activity in hSPRY2-expressing cells by a dominant negative mutant of PTP1B rescued cells from the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2. These data demonstrate that PTP1B plays an important role in mediating the actions of hSPRY2 on cell migration. Full-length HA-tagged or red fluorescent protein-tagged hSpry2 were cloned from two expressed sequence tag clones and stable clones of HeLa that express HA-hSpry2 or hSpry2-red fluorescent protein were generated as reported previously (8Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Replication-deficient (E-1 deleted) recombinant type 5 adenovirus-expressing, HA-tagged wild-type, or C215S mutant PTP1B were prepared using the commercial kit, Adeno-X (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Plasmids containing wild-type human PTP1B (pJ3H-PTP435) and catalytically inactive C215S mutant PTP1B (pJ3H-PTP435-C215S) were kindly donated by Dr. Jonathan Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, PA). These PTP1B constructs containing an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were used as templates to amplify PCR product expressing the corresponding full-length HA-tagged PTP1B cDNAs (WT and mutant), flanked by NotI and KpnI restriction sites. PCR products were subcloned into the NotI/KpnI site of the pShuttle vector provided in the Adeno-X kit (Clontech). All sequences of PTP1B were verified by DNA sequencing. An I-CeuI/PI-SceI restriction fragment from pShuttle containing the cytomegalovirus-IE promoter/enhancer 5′ to the PTP1B cDNA insert and the polyadenylation signal was ligated into adenoviral DNA backbone that was also restricted with I-CeuI and PI-SceI. Following amplification and purification of recombinant viral DNA from bacteria, adenovirus was generated by transfectingPacI-linearized recombinant viral DNA into HEK 293 cells via the use of the lipid transfection agent FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). HeLa cells were lysed by incubation for 15 min on ice with a buffer containing the following: 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine. Lysates were centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatants (soluble fraction) and the pellet (particulate fraction) were then separated from each other. Cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and incubated in 5% milk in PBS. The membranes were incubated in primary antibody anti-HA (HA.11 from Covance Research Products, Richmond, CA) or anti-PTP1B (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h, followed by secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase, 1:3000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. The modified Boyden chambers (Costar, Corning, NY) were used for monitoring cell migration. Essentially, overnight serum-starved cells were trypsinized and washed twice with serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA. Cells were plated on the upper side of transwells (35,000 cells/well) in 100 μl of serum-free medium, and 500 μl of the same medium was added to the lower chamber. The cells were allowed to adhere for 1 h. Cells were treated with virus in serum-free medium for 2 h. After 2 h of virus treatment, serum was added (10%) to the lower chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate overnight at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment the transwell inserts were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol/acetone, and stained with hematoxylin. Cells on the upper chamber side of the membrane were removed with cotton swabs, and cells that migrated through the membrane were counted. Cells were plated in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% serum for 6 h at a density of 7 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. Then serum was withdrawn for an overnight period, and cells were treated with adenoviral vectors for 2 h to express either EGFP, WT PTP1B, or dominant negative (DN) PTP1B. The medium was exchanged with Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% serum and cells incubated for an overnight period. [3H]Thymidine, 1.5 μCi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well and cells incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. At the end of this period, plates were placed on ice, and cells were washed three times each with ice-cold PBS, then with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and finally with ethanol/ether (2:1). The cells were dissolved with 0.1% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH by incubating overnight at room temperature. Aliquots were counted for 3H and protein concentration determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (11Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar) (Micro BCA protein assay kit from Pierce). To monitor PTP1B activity, soluble fractions (100 μg of protein) from control and hSPRY2-expressing cells were used. The PTP1B was immunoprecipitated with anti-PTP1B antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.0 mm EDTA, 2.0 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and aprotinin (12Tao J. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29520-29525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were incubated in a reaction buffer containing 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 20 mmdithiothreitol in the presence and absence of 10 mmvanadate. The reactions were initiated by the addition of32P-labeled Raytide™. After incubation at room temperature for the indicated times, the reactions were stopped by addition of 1 ml of activated charcoal, and 500-μl aliquots of the supernatant were counted for 32Pi released. The vanadate-sensitive activity is presented as PTP1B activity. Raytide™ (Oncogene, San Diego, CA) was labeled according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 0.3 μg/μl Raytide was phosphorylated with 5 units of c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in the presence of 0.3 mm[γ-32P]ATP (1.1 μCi/nmol), 10 mmMgCl2, in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.015% Brij, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA buffer. The reactions were incubated for 5 h at room temperature. Thereafter, acetylated BSA was added to a final concentration of 7 mg/ml, and the reaction was stopped with ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). The BSA/Raytide™ co-precipitate was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 10 min) and washed five times with 500 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid until the background in the blank reaction (reaction without Raytide™) was diminished significantly (≤10% of that in reaction containing Raytide™). The final Raytide™/BSA pellet was washed once with acetone (500 μl) and dissolved in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Aliquots of the32P-labeled Raytide™ were stored at −80 °C. Human SPRY2 inhibits the biological actions of a number of growth factors that exert their effects via activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Because the action of these kinases can be modulated by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases), we hypothesized that hSPRY2 may alter the activity of PTPases. To address this hypothesis, we utilized the previously described (8Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) HeLa cell lines that are transfected to express hSPRY2. The Geneticin (G418)-resistant HeLa cells that do not overexpress hSPRY2 protein were used as controls (8Yigzaw Y. Cartin L. Pierre S. Scholich K. Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Initially, we monitored the amount of various protein-tyrosine phosphatases in total cell lysates and in the soluble fractions of hSPRY2-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the soluble fraction of hSPRY2-expressing cells contained more PTP1B as compared with controls. However, the expression of PTP-PEST and PTP1D were not altered (Fig. 1 A); the equal amounts of Erk in the same blots demonstrates that the loading of proteins was the same. Interestingly, the amount of PTP1B in the soluble fraction remained elevated irrespective of whether the cells were grown in serum or serum-free medium for 1 day. Moreover, the total amount of PTP1B in HeLa cells expressing hSPRY2 was not altered (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with this latter observation, the increase in soluble PTP1B amount in hSPRY2-expressing cells was accompanied by a decrease in the amount of PTP1B in the particulate fraction (Fig. 1 C). The increase in PTP1B in the soluble fraction of cells was also confirmed with other clonal HeLa cell lines expressing hSPRY2-red fluorescent protein (data not shown). To determine whether the soluble PTP1B was active, we immunoprecipitated PTP1B from the soluble fractions of control and hSPRY2-expressing cells and monitored its ability to dephosphorylate32P-labeled Raytide™. As shown in Fig. 2, PTP1B activity in immunoprecipitates from the soluble fractions of hSPRY2-expressing cells was greater than that in controls. These data (Fig. 2) demonstrate that the soluble PTP1B in the hSPRY2-expressing cells is active. The increase in PTP1B activity in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2) is consistent with the observation that the amount of PTP1B in the soluble fraction of hSPRY2-expressing cells is higher than that in controls (Fig. 1,A and C). Although hSPRY2 expression increased PTP1B protein in the soluble fraction by ≥5-fold (Fig. 1, Aand C), the PTP1B activity in immunoprecipitates was increased by ∼2-fold. This may be related to the fact that during the immunoprecipitation procedure, despite our efforts to minimize inactivation of PTP1B, oxidation of the critical cysteine (Cys-215) in the catalytic site of PTP1B occurred and decreased activity. It has been demonstrated that the oxidation of this cysteine residue (Cys-215) to cysteine sulfenic acid decreases PTP1B activity (13Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Despite this discrepancy, the data in Fig. 2 clearly show that the activity of PTP1B in immunoprecipitates of soluble fractions from hSPRY2-expressing cells is greater than that in controls. An increase in PTP1B activity in the soluble fraction would suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins may also be altered. Therefore, we compared lysates of hSPRY2-overexpressing cells with control cells to monitor the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 A, tyrosine phosphorylation of several, but not all, proteins in cells expressing hSPRY2 was decreased as compared with control cells. The same observation was made in another clone of hSPRY2-expressing cells. The most significant decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed on proteins of molecular mass of 130 and 66 kDa. Since one of the substrates of PTP1B is known to be p130Cas (14Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was decreased in cells overexpressing hSPRY2. As shown in Fig. 3 B, compared with control, tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated p130Cas was decreased in hSPRY2-overexpressing cells. Note that the amount of p130Cas in the immunoprecipitates was the same (Fig. 3 B). Taken together with the data in Fig. 2, the findings in Fig. 3 are consistent with the notion that increase in PTPase activity in hSPRY2-expressing cells would decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. Moreover, since p130Cas is a substrate for PTP1B (14Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the decrease in p130Cas phosphorylation corroborates the findings that soluble PTP1B is increased in SPRY2-expressing cells. Next, we reasoned that if hSPRY2 was attenuating the migratory and/or proliferative actions of serum or growth factors by increasing PTP1B activity, then antagonizing the activity of PTP1B in hSPRY2-expressing cells should (i) reverse the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and (ii) rescue the cells from the anti-migratory and/or anti-proliferative actions of hSPRY2. To address this possibility, using adenoviral vectors, we expressed either the WT or catalytically inactive mutant (C215S) of PTP1B in control and hSPRY2-overexpressing cells. Adenovirus that would express EGFP was used as a control. The C215S mutant of PTP1B is catalytically inactive but can bind the substrates and thereby protects substrate dephosphorylation by endogenous (wild-type) PTP1B (14Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 15Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 16Milarski K.L. Zhu G. Pearl C.G. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. MacLean D. Thieme-Sefler A. Zhang Z.Y. Sawyer T. Decker S.J. Dixon J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23634-23639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the C215S mutant functions as a DN PTP1B and is referred to as such from here on. Initially, we investigated the effects of expressing either the WT or DN PTP1B on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in control and hSPRY2- overexpressing cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the expression of WT PTP1B decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in control cells and cells expressing hSPRY2. Note that as shown before (Fig. 3), in cells infected with virus encoding EGFP, the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the hSPRY2-expressing cells was lower than that in control. In control cells, DN PTP1B did not significantly affect tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, but the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in hSPRY2-overexpressing cells was increased by DN PTP1B. It should be noted that the adenovirus-mediated expression of WT and DN PTP1B in control and hSPRY2 containing cells was the same and ∼10-fold higher than the levels of endogenous PTP1B (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, analysis of the soluble fraction of cell lysates for the presence of adenoviral-induced PTP1B showed that in hSPRY2-expressing cells, the amounts of both WT and DN PTP1B were greater than that observed in control cells (Fig. 4 C). These latter data demonstrate that while overexpression of PTP1B permits the presence of soluble enzyme to be detected in control cells, the overexpressed PTP1B is also subject to changes in cellular localization (i.e. increase in soluble fraction) by hSPRY2. To determine whether the DN PTP1B would rescue the cells from the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2, the experiment depicted in Fig. 5 A was performed. Essentially, cells were infected with adenovirus for 2 h to express EGFP or WT PTP1B or DN PTP1B. The migration of these cells in response to serum was then monitored as described under “Materials and Methods.” That the expression of WT and DN PTP1B was similar in these cells was confirmed at the end of the migration protocol as shown in Fig. 4 B. In control cells, the expression of WT PTP1B decreased migration of both control and hSPRY2-expressing cells (Fig. 5 A). DN PTP1B did not appreciably alter the migration of control cells, indicating that in these cells the endogenous PTP1B does not significantly contribute to cell migration. On the other hand, in hSPRY2-expressing cells, DN PTP1B markedly attenuated the ability of hSPRY2 to inhibit cell migration. The ability of WT PTP1B to inhibit migration and the ability of DN PTP1B to rescue cells from the anti-migratory activity of hSPRY2 clearly show a role for PTP1B in mediating the biological actions of hSPRY2. Since we and others have shown that hSPRY2 also inhibits proliferation of cells (6Lee S.H. Schloss D.J. Jarvis L. Krasnow M.A. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22742-22747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the expression of PTP1B would protect cells against the anti-mitogenic actions of hSPRY2. As shown in Fig. 5 B, neither the WT nor the DN PTP1B altered thymidine incorporation in control and hSPRY2-overexpressing cells. PTP1B has been reported to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum by a hydrophobic C-terminal 35-amino acid anchoring region (17Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 18Woodford-Thomas T.A. Rhodes J.D. Dixon J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For activation of platelets by a variety of agonists that activate calcium-dependent neutral protease, calpain has been shown to cleave the protein above this anchoring region and render it soluble (19Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The cleavage of PTP1B results in a 2-fold greater activity of the enzyme and is accompanied by changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (19Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W.

On SDS-PAGE, the protease-cleaved PTP1B migrates as a 42-kDa species as compared with the full-length enzyme that migrates as a 50-kDa protein. In our experiments, the soluble form of PTP1B was not smaller in size as compared with the particulate enzyme, suggesting that the increase in soluble PTP1B in hSPRY2-expressing cells is not the result of cleavage of the C-terminal anchoring region. Moreover, although the presence of soluble PTP1B was difficult to detect in control cells, the overexpression of both WT and DN PTP1B was accompanied by the presence of PTP1B in the soluble fractions (Fig. 4 B). As determined by their migration on SDS-PAGE, these ectopically expressed, soluble, PTP1B species were also not cleaved (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, the presence of full-length (50 kDa) PTP1B in the cytosolic fraction has also been observed in COS7 cells (20Aoki N. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39718-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, it would appear that mechanisms other than cleavage of the full-length PTP1B are responsible for changes in its distribution between the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. In this context, the ability of hSPRY2 to redistribute PTP1B in cells may provide yet another means of regulating the biological actions of PTP1B. The precise mechanisms by which PTP1B is rendered soluble by hSPRY2 remain to be elucidated and form the subject of future studies. Consistent with the observation that the amount of PTP1B and activity in the soluble fraction are elevated, we observed that the phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including p130Cas was also decreased in hSPRY2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3). Since p130Cas is a critical component of the focal adhesion complex (21O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and because its phosphorylation status modulates the migratory response of cells (22Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 23Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J.

We are currently in the process of determining the identity of the other proteins (∼66 kDa) whose phosphorylation is decreased. Among the mechanisms that mediate the actions of SPRY proteins, studies have suggested that SPRY proteins alter the activity of the Ras-Erk pathway by decreasing the activation of Ras (6Lee S.H.

However, to date no attention has been given to the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in modulating the actions of SPRY proteins. In this respect, this is the first report to show that hSPRY2 modulates the cellular localization and activity of PTP1B in the soluble (cytosolic) fraction of cells. Indeed, our findings that overexpression of WT PTP1B, but not the DN PTP1B, in control cells decreases migration demonstrates that PTP1B plays a profound role in regulating this process. The fact that the DN PTP1B attenuates the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2 (Fig. 5 A) further reinforces the role of PTP1B in the migration of cells. More importantly, the experiments with the DN PTP1B demonstrate that the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2 are, in part, mediated by an increase in PTP1B activity. Since DN PTP1B only partially rescues cells from the inhibition of migration in hSPRY2-expressing cells, the data in Fig. 5 A also suggest that in addition to PTP1B, other mechanisms may also contribute to the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2 in response to serum. These additional mechanisms remain to be identified. Interestingly, although hSPRY2 inhibits cellular proliferation (6Lee S.H. Schloss D.J. Jarvis L. Krasnow M.A. Swain J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4128-4133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J.

These results demonstrate the specificity of the role of PTP1B in the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2 and also imply that hSPRY2 inhibits cellular proliferation by modulating other mechanisms. In summary, we have demonstrated that hSPRY2 expression is associated with an increase in PTP1B in the soluble fraction of cells. The experiments with exogenously expressed PTP1B demonstrate that this enzyme plays a profound role in regulating cell migration, but not proliferation, and that the increase in PTP1B activity in hSPRY2-expressing cells contributes to the anti-migratory actions of hSPRY2.

M. M., and Ariga, H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 36647-36651). In this study, we further found that AMY-1 competitively bound to either AKAP95 or AKAP84 in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner of either AKAP. Like AKAP84, AMY-1 was found to bind to the RII-binding region of AKAP95 in vivo and in vitro and to make a ternary complex with RII. It was also found that the formation of the complex of AMY-1 with AKAP84/95 and RII prevented a catalytic subunit from binding to this AKAP complex, leading to suppression of PKA activity. These findings suggest that AMY-1 is an important modulator of PKA."
https://openalex.org/W1966499873,"Necrotic (Nec) is an important component of the proteolytic cascade that activates the Toll-mediated immune response in Drosophila. The Nec protein is a member of the serpin (SERine Protease INhibitor) superfamily and is thought to regulate the cascade by inhibiting the serine protease Persephone. Nec was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein folded to the active native conformation required for protease inhibitory activity. Biochemical analysis showed that Nec had a broad inhibitory specificity and inhibited elastase, thrombin, and chymotrypsin-like proteases. It did not inhibit trypsin or kallikrein. These data show that Necrotic is likely to inhibit a wide range of proteases in Drosophila and that Nec has the specificity requirements to act as the physiological inhibitor of Persephone in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2017794825,"Post-translational processing of the histamine-producing enzyme, l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC), leads to the formation of multiple carboxyl-truncated isoforms. Nevertheless, it has been widely reported that the mature catalytically active dimer is dependent specifically on the production of carboxyl-truncated 53–55-kDa monomers. Here we use transiently transfected COS-7 cells to study the properties of carboxyl-truncated rat HDC isoforms in the 52–58-kDa size range. Amino acid sequences important for the production of a 55-kDa HDC isoform were identified by successive truncations through amino acids 502, 503, and 504. Mutating this sequence in the full-length protein prevented the production of 55-kDa HDC but did not affect enzymatic activity. Further truncations to amino acid 472 generated an inactive 53-kDa HDC isoform that was degraded by the proteasome pathway. These results suggested that processed isoforms, apart from 53–55-kDa ones, contribute toward histamine biosynthesis in vivo. This was confirmed in physiological studies where regulated increases in HDC activity were associated with the expression of isoforms that were greater than 55 kDa in size. We provide evidence to show that regulation of HDC expression can be achieved by the differential production or differential stabilization of multiple enzyme isoforms.

In mammals the enzyme that performs this reaction, l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC1; 4.1.1.22), is initially translated as a 73–74-kDa protein. Studies to purify the enzyme from native sources, however, led to the isolation of 100–110-kDa HDC complexes (fetal rat liver (1Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H. Hayashi H. Wada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse stomach (2Watabe A. Fukui T. Ohmori E. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), mouse mastocytoma cells (3Hammar L. Hjerten S.

These complexes resolved to give 53–55-kDa protein bands on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that cellular expression of the enzyme involved the dimerization of two processed isoforms.Until recently therefore it was widely believed that post-translational processing involved a single carboxyl-terminal processing step (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This was due in part to studies performed with one particular antiserum that recognizes the full-length protein and a carboxyl-truncated isoform that is 53–55 kDa (9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Yet despite multiple reports of purified 110-kDa complexes and 53–55-kDa processing, there were also isolated reports of a ∼120–140-kDa purified complex (11Grzanna R. Neurochem. Res. 1984; 9: 993-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Tran V.T. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 680-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, these experiments were described as flawed (1Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H. Hayashi H. Wada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however more recent studies employing newer antisera have independently demonstrated the more complex nature of HDC post-translational processing. It is now apparent therefore that a number of isoforms are generated from the 74-kDa primary translation product. This includes major additional isoforms of sizes ∼63, ∼58, and ∼36 kDa, as well as a number of other minor bands (13Dartsch C. Chen D. Persson L. Regul. Pept. 1998; 77: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, these more recent data have raised further questions regarding which isoforms are responsible for enzymatic activity, as well as the precise sequence and regulation of the proteolytic processing steps involved. Accordingly, the fundamental physiological question as to why so many isoforms might be generated remains largely unanswered.To address some of these questions in the context of living cells that process the enzyme, it is necessary to determine the contribution of each isoform by specifically preventing the accumulation of that isoform. However very little is known about HDC protein processing, and no cleavage sites have yet been identified. Furthermore, while there have been reports that porcine elastase is capable of digesting HDCin vitro (15Tanaka S. Fukui T. Yamamoto J. Shima Y. Kume T. Ohgo M. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the enzymes that specifically mediate HDC processing in vivo have not yet been identified. The regulation of specific cleavage steps has not previously been demonstrated or addressed.Although the reasons for generating multiple truncated isoforms remains unclear, computer analysis has identified a degradation promoting PEST domain within the carboxyl-terminal tail, between amino acids ∼500 and ∼570 (10Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Engel N. Olmo M.T. Coleman C.S. Medina M.A. Pegg A.E. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reports that supported a single proteolysis step and the generation of a single 53–55-kDa carboxyl-terminal processed isoform have logically argued that formation of the active dimer would involve the removal of this domain and result in protein stabilization (10Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of recombinant proteins supports this interpretation, and in transfected or infected cell models the steady state accumulation of carboxyl truncated 53–55-kDa HDC isoforms was greater than for the full-length isoform (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Dartsch C. Chen D. Persson L. Regul. Pept. 1998; 77: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 17: 10-15PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the identification of processed isoforms that potentially include part of the PEST domain has opened the possibility for isoform-specific patterns of degradation (14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, studies have yet to specifically demonstrate that carboxyl-truncated isoforms that lack the PEST domain can be regulated differently from those that have, and the intracellular signaling pathways that might influence this kind of regulation have yet to be determined.Here we demonstrate that the inactive full-length HDC protein is post-translationally processing into multiple isoforms. This was shown in a number of in vivo cell models, including transfected COS-7 cells, as well as the stomach and fetal livers of rats. We describe the properties of carboxyl-truncated HDC isoforms ranging in size from 51 to 58 kDa and identify sequences that constitute part of the 55-kDa processing site. Mutation of this cleavage site prevented production of the 55-kDa isoform but did not affect enzymatic activity. A carboxyl-truncated 53-kDa isoform of the rat HDC protein was unstable and had no enzymatic activity.DISCUSSIONWithin the wider family of mammalian l-amino acid decarboxylases the histamine-producing decarboxylase, HDC, exhibits a unique pattern of post-translational processing. Specifically, it is translated as an unstable protein that is proposed to undergo carboxyl-terminal processing post-translationally. Therefore, whereas enzymes such as ornithine decarboxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, and glutamic acid decarboxylase are all translated as active enzymes, it has been widely reported that the active unit of cellular HDC activity is a 100–110-kDa dimer consisting of two carboxyl-truncated ∼53–55-kDa monomers. Recently, however, a number of additional processed isoforms have been described.If the cell is capable of generating multiple isoforms, what evidence then exists that a 53–55-kDa one is the preferred cellular isoform for histamine biosynthesis, as is suggested from other studies. Much emphasis has been placed on studies that isolated active 100–110-kDa HDC complexes, but these purification procedures were essentially performed on soluble protein fractions (2Watabe A. Fukui T. Ohmori E. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although this is standard practice in many purification protocols it has only become apparent in recent years that HDC isoforms are differentially localized within the cell (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under such circumstances where the first step of an isolation procedure specifically selects against some isoforms, it is questionable whether the purified isoform accurately reflects the active form in the cell. Because carboxyl-truncated HDC isoforms are now known to be more stable (14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is hardly surprising that the most stable and soluble isoform turned out to be the isoform that was eventually isolated.Emphasis has also been placed on results obtained for one particular antiserum that has without doubt contributed significantly to our current understanding of HDC. However, in rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cells this antiserum recognized only 74- and 53–55-kDa isoforms and not 63-, 58-, or 36-kDa isoforms (9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fajardo et al.(24Fajardo I. Urdiales J.L. Medina M.A. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using the RBL-2H3 cell line but the same antibody used in this study, were recently able to observe expression of the 63/4-kDa isoform. Other studies that claimed to detect the 63/4kDa isoform in fetal rat liver were initially described as flawed, yet here we show that such an isoform is clearly expressed. Considerable confusion exists therefore, with regard to the processing of the primary translation product, as well as the relative activities of processed isoforms.Here we demonstrate definitively that post-translational processing of 74-kDa HDC is required for catalytic activity. However, while an active 55-kDa isoform is certainly generated by carboxyl-terminal processing, HDC catalysis is not solely dependent on this isoform, as would be suggested from previous studies (5Hammar L. Hjerten S. Agents Actions. 1980; 10: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Martin S.A. Bishop J.O. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Instead, other processed isoforms greater than ∼55 kDa in size can contribute toward histamine production. This conclusion has wide ranging implications with respect to our overall understanding of HDC catalysis, as it suggests that the enzyme is quite flexible. Therefore, while there is likely to be a core domain in HDC whose structure is essential for catalysis, amino acid sequences outside this domain are less important for function. Instead, our studies here showed that the non-essential carboxyl-terminal domain contains regulatory elements that allow for the differential expression of HDC isoforms. This is important in the rat stomach, where feeding triggers the release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells in the gastric mucosa and leads to histamine H2 receptor mediated stimulation of gastric acid secretion (25Cui G.L. Sandvik A.K. Munkvold B. Waldum H.L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2002; 174: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In physiological terms therefore the pattern of regulated HDC isoform expression observed here would allow for a transient spike in activity and histamine biosynthesis to occur. This would mean that there is a constant background synthesis of histamine but that production could be boosted and rapidly replenished in anticipation of subsequent feeding. This unique pattern of post-translational regulation could explain in a physiological setting why it is so important to generate multiple active isoforms.We also showed that the expression of different isoforms can be suppressed by the activation of protein kinase A pathways and demonstrated for the first time that HDC isoform expression can be regulated in this way. Although the exact physiological importance of this is not yet clear, there have been reports of tissue-specific decreases in HDC activity by cAMP, although the molecular basis for this regulation was never identified (26Huszti Z. Magyar K. Keleti J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Hammar L. Agents Actions. 1983; 13: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A range of physiological conditions therefore are likely to determine the ratio of PEST-containing and PEST-deficient isoforms and consequently, the duration of histamine synthetic pulses.The fact that HDC catalysis involves multiple active isoforms might in some respects have been anticipated from previous studies where carboxyl-truncated 64-kDa HDC isoforms were transiently expressed in COS-7 or infected Sf9 cells (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in these earlier studies, no steps were taken to prevent the formation of other isoforms, including the 55-kDa one, and the activity levels could have been due in part to processing of 64-kDa HDC. Here, however, not only do we provide the first definitive evidence that processed isoforms apart from the 55-kDa one contribute toward catalysis, but we additionally identify the TRDSKDL domain that is important for 55-kDa processing. Human β-galactosidase is post-translationally processed by cleavage at a similar RDS motif. The protease that performs this maturation is known as “protective protein” and post-proteolytically acts to stabilize β-galactosidase and regulate its intralysosomal degradation (28Zhou X.Y. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Gillemans N. Galjaard H. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4041-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These are the first data that implicate a specific cellular protease with HDC processing in vivo, and it is interesting that this protease is linked to the lysosome. Is it possible therefore that the 55-kDa isoform is only being produced so as to be chaperoned until degradation?In support of other studies we found evidence for a minor 1–2-kDa amino-terminal truncation (14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An example of this is shown in Fig. 7 A where the minor band runs just underneath the primary translation product. Future studies will need to address the functional significance of such a step, particularly because amino truncation of the ∼55-kDa isoform would generate a ∼53-kDa one, and might help explain some of the inconsistencies observed in the literature. This is highlighted in, but by no means limited to, studies on mouse mastocytoma cells. Hammar and Hjerten (5Hammar L. Hjerten S. Agents Actions. 1980; 10: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) described production of a ∼55-kDa isoform, whereas Yamamoto et al. (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) described the production of a carboxyl-truncated ∼53-kDa isoform from the same cell type. Although we cannot completely rule out slight variations in the exact size estimations performed in other studies, our results on this are clear, the ∼53.7-kDa HDC1/477 isoform is the minimal unit of carboxyl-truncated rat HDC that is capable of retaining enzymatic activity. Carboxyl-truncated 53-kDa isoforms are inactive, bothin vitro and in vivo. A carboxyl-truncated 36-kDa isoform is also inactive, which is of interest given recent speculation concerning the functional importance of smaller HDC isoforms (30Safina F. Tanaka S. Inagaki M. Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but leads to the question of why inactive HDC isoforms are generated as part of normal in vivo HDC protein processing. It was not apparent from our study why the removal of amino acids 472 to 477 was inactivating the enzyme. There are no cysteine residues in this region that could be critical for structure. Furthermore, inactivation was not a gradual event as might be expected if the enzyme was gradually unfolding. Instead, inactivation was immediate and absolute, suggesting a more direct role for amino acids 472–477 in catalysis. Future studies will address why these AANLV (472–477) residues are so important for catalysis and stability.Data presented here certainly do not discount the possibility that the 55-kDa isoform is the preferred isoform for histamine biosynthesis. However, our data support the proposition that activity does not depend solely on this isoform, and we conclude that current evidence does not allow for cellular HDC activity to be attributed to any specific isoform. Indeed, we highlight physiological conditions where it would be advantageous to express and regulate multiple active isoforms. We feel that it is inappropriate, therefore, in light of evidence and arguments presented here, to continue referring to the 55-kDa isoform as the active or mature isoform. The challenge remains to devise experimental approaches to specifically address which of the isoforms is responsible for histamine biosynthesis in vivo. Our study suggests that multiple isoforms are likely to be involved. Histamine is generated by the catalytic decarboxylation ofl-histidine. In mammals the enzyme that performs this reaction, l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC1; 4.1.1.22), is initially translated as a 73–74-kDa protein. Studies to purify the enzyme from native sources, however, led to the isolation of 100–110-kDa HDC complexes (fetal rat liver (1Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H. Hayashi H. Wada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse stomach (2Watabe A. Fukui T. Ohmori E. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), mouse mastocytoma cells (3Hammar L. Hjerten S. Agents Actions. 1980; 10: 92-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 4Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem.

Bishop J.O. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). These complexes resolved to give 53–55-kDa protein bands on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that cellular expression of the enzyme involved the dimerization of two processed isoforms. Until recently therefore it was widely believed that post-translational processing involved a single carboxyl-terminal processing step (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This was due in part to studies performed with one particular antiserum that recognizes the full-length protein and a carboxyl-truncated isoform that is 53–55 kDa (9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Yet despite multiple reports of purified 110-kDa complexes and 53–55-kDa processing, there were also isolated reports of a ∼120–140-kDa purified complex (11Grzanna R. Neurochem. Res. 1984; 9: 993-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Tran V.T. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 680-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, these experiments were described as flawed (1Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H. Hayashi H. Wada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however more recent studies employing newer antisera have independently demonstrated the more complex nature of HDC post-translational processing. It is now apparent therefore that a number of isoforms are generated from the 74-kDa primary translation product. This includes major additional isoforms of sizes ∼63, ∼58, and ∼36 kDa, as well as a number of other minor bands (13Dartsch C. Chen D. Persson L. Regul. Pept. 1998; 77: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, these more recent data have raised further questions regarding which isoforms are responsible for enzymatic activity, as well as the precise sequence and regulation of the proteolytic processing steps involved. Accordingly, the fundamental physiological question as to why so many isoforms might be generated remains largely unanswered. To address some of these questions in the context of living cells that process the enzyme, it is necessary to determine the contribution of each isoform by specifically preventing the accumulation of that isoform. However very little is known about HDC protein processing, and no cleavage sites have yet been identified. Furthermore, while there have been reports that porcine elastase is capable of digesting HDCin vitro (15Tanaka S. Fukui T. Yamamoto J. Shima Y. Kume T. Ohgo M. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the enzymes that specifically mediate HDC processing in vivo have not yet been identified. The regulation of specific cleavage steps has not previously been demonstrated or addressed. Although the reasons for generating multiple truncated isoforms remains unclear, computer analysis has identified a degradation promoting PEST domain within the carboxyl-terminal tail, between amino acids ∼500 and ∼570 (10Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Engel N. Olmo M.T. Coleman C.S. Medina M.A. Pegg A.E. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reports that supported a single proteolysis step and the generation of a single 53–55-kDa carboxyl-terminal processed isoform have logically argued that formation of the active dimer would involve the removal of this domain and result in protein stabilization (10Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of recombinant proteins supports this interpretation, and in transfected or infected cell models the steady state accumulation of carboxyl truncated 53–55-kDa HDC isoforms was greater than for the full-length isoform (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Dartsch C. Chen D. Persson L. Regul. Pept. 1998; 77: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 17: 10-15PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the identification of processed isoforms that potentially include part of the PEST domain has opened the possibility for isoform-specific patterns of degradation (14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, studies have yet to specifically demonstrate that carboxyl-truncated isoforms that lack the PEST domain can be regulated differently from those that have, and the intracellular signaling pathways that might influence this kind of regulation have yet to be determined. Here we demonstrate that the inactive full-length HDC protein is post-translationally processing into multiple isoforms. This was shown in a number of in vivo cell models, including transfected COS-7 cells, as well as the stomach and fetal livers of rats. We describe the properties of carboxyl-truncated HDC isoforms ranging in size from 51 to 58 kDa and identify sequences that constitute part of the 55-kDa processing site. Mutation of this cleavage site prevented production of the 55-kDa isoform but did not affect enzymatic activity. A carboxyl-truncated 53-kDa isoform of the rat HDC protein was unstable and had no enzymatic activity. DISCUSSIONWithin the wider family of mammalian l-amino acid decarboxylases the histamine-producing decarboxylase, HDC, exhibits a unique pattern of post-translational processing. Specifically, it is translated as an unstable protein that is proposed to undergo carboxyl-terminal processing post-translationally. Therefore, whereas enzymes such as ornithine decarboxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, and glutamic acid decarboxylase are all translated as active enzymes, it has been widely reported that the active unit of cellular HDC activity is a 100–110-kDa dimer consisting of two carboxyl-truncated ∼53–55-kDa monomers. Recently, however, a number of additional processed isoforms have been described.If the cell is capable of generating multiple isoforms, what evidence then exists that a 53–55-kDa one is the preferred cellular isoform for histamine biosynthesis, as is suggested from other studies. Much emphasis has been placed on studies that isolated active 100–110-kDa HDC complexes, but these purification procedures were essentially performed on soluble protein fractions (2Watabe A. Fukui T. Ohmori E. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although this is standard practice in many purification protocols it has only become apparent in recent years that HDC isoforms are differentially localized within the cell (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki S. Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Under such circumstances where the first step of an isolation procedure specifically selects against some isoforms, it is questionable whether the purified isoform accurately reflects the active form in the cell. Because carboxyl-truncated HDC isoforms are now known to be more stable (14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is hardly surprising that the most stable and soluble isoform turned out to be the isoform that was eventually isolated.Emphasis has also been placed on results obtained for one particular antiserum that has without doubt contributed significantly to our current understanding of HDC. However, in rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cells this antiserum recognized only 74- and 53–55-kDa isoforms and not 63-, 58-, or 36-kDa isoforms (9Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8177-8182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fajardo et al.(24Fajardo I. Urdiales J.L. Medina M.A. Sanchez-Jimenez F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using the RBL-2H3 cell line but the same antibody used in this study, were recently able to observe expression of the 63/4-kDa isoform. Other studies that claimed to detect the 63/4kDa isoform in fetal rat liver were initially described as flawed, yet here we show that such an isoform is clearly expressed. Considerable confusion exists therefore, with regard to the processing of the primary translation product, as well as the relative activities of processed isoforms.Here we demonstrate definitively that post-translational processing of 74-kDa HDC is required for catalytic activity. However, while an active 55-kDa isoform is certainly generated by carboxyl-terminal processing, HDC catalysis is not solely dependent on this isoform, as would be suggested from previous studies (5Hammar L. Hjerten S. Agents Actions. 1980; 10: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 6Martin S.A. Bishop J.O. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Instead, other processed isoforms greater than ∼55 kDa in size can contribute toward histamine production. This conclusion has wide ranging implications with respect to our overall understanding of HDC catalysis, as it suggests that the enzyme is quite flexible. Therefore, while there is likely to be a core domain in HDC whose structure is essential for catalysis, amino acid sequences outside this domain are less important for function. Instead, our studies here showed that the non-essential carboxyl-terminal domain contains regulatory elements that allow for the differential expression of HDC isoforms. This is important in the rat stomach, where feeding triggers the release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells in the gastric mucosa and leads to histamine H2 receptor mediated stimulation of gastric acid secretion (25Cui G.L. Sandvik A.K. Munkvold B. Waldum H.L. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2002; 174: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In physiological terms therefore the pattern of regulated HDC isoform expression observed here would allow for a transient spike in activity and histamine biosynthesis to occur. This would mean that there is a constant background synthesis of histamine but that production could be boosted and rapidly replenished in anticipation of subsequent feeding. This unique pattern of post-translational regulation could explain in a physiological setting why it is so important to generate multiple active isoforms.We also showed that the expression of different isoforms can be suppressed by the activation of protein kinase A pathways and demonstrated for the first time that HDC isoform expression can be regulated in this way. Although the exact physiological importance of this is not yet clear, there have been reports of tissue-specific decreases in HDC activity by cAMP, although the molecular basis for this regulation was never identified (26Huszti Z. Magyar K. Keleti J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27Hammar L. Agents Actions. 1983; 13: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A range of physiological conditions therefore are likely to determine the ratio of PEST-containing and PEST-deficient isoforms and consequently, the duration of histamine synthetic pulses.The fact that HDC catalysis involves multiple active isoforms might in some respects have been anticipated from previous studies where carboxyl-truncated 64-kDa HDC isoforms were transiently expressed in COS-7 or infected Sf9 cells (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in these earlier studies, no steps were taken to prevent the formation of other isoforms, including the 55-kDa one, and the activity levels could have been due in part to processing of 64-kDa HDC. Here, however, not only do we provide the first definitive evidence that processed isoforms apart from the 55-kDa one contribute toward catalysis, but we additionally identify the TRDSKDL domain that is important for 55-kDa processing. Human β-galactosidase is post-translationally processed by cleavage at a similar RDS motif. The protease that performs this maturation is known as “protective protein” and post-proteolytically acts to stabilize β-galactosidase and regulate its intralysosomal degradation (28Zhou X.Y. Galjart N.J. Willemsen R. Gillemans N. Galjaard H. d'Azzo A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4041-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These are the first data that implicate a specific cellular protease with HDC processing in vivo, and it is interesting that this protease is linked to the lysosome. Is it possible therefore that the 55-kDa isoform is only being produced so as to be chaperoned until degradation?In support of other studies we found evidence for a minor 1–2-kDa amino-terminal truncation (14Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4932-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An example of this is shown in Fig. 7 A where the minor band runs just underneath the primary translation product. Future studies will need to address the functional significance of such a step, particularly because amino truncation of the ∼55-kDa isoform would generate a ∼53-kDa one, and might help explain some of the inconsistencies observed in the literature. This is highlighted in, but by no means limited to, studies on mouse mastocytoma cells. Hammar and Hjerten (5Hammar L. Hjerten S. Agents Actions. 1980; 10: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) described production of a ∼55-kDa isoform, whereas Yamamoto et al. (7Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto J. Yatsunami K. Ohmori E. Sugimoto Y. Fukui T. Katayama T. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) described the production of a carboxyl-truncated ∼53-kDa isoform from the same cell type. Although we cannot completely rule out slight variations in the exact size estimations performed in other studies, our results on this are clear, the ∼53.7-kDa HDC1/477 isoform is the minimal unit of carboxyl-truncated rat HDC that is capable of retaining enzymatic activity. Carboxyl-truncated 53-kDa isoforms are inactive, bothin vitro and in vivo. A carboxyl-truncated 36-kDa isoform is also inactive, which is of interest given recent speculation concerning the functional importance of smaller HDC isoforms (30Safina F. Tanaka S. Inagaki M. Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but leads to the question of why inactive HDC isoforms are generated as part of normal in vivo HDC protein processing. It was not apparent from our study why the removal of amino acids 472 to 477 was inactivating the enzyme. There are no cysteine residues in this region that could be critical for structure. Furthermore, inactivation was not a gradual event as might be expected if the enzyme was gradually unfolding. Instead, inactivation was immediate and absolute, suggesting a more direct role for amino acids 472–477 in catalysis. Future studies will address why these AANLV (472–477) residues are so important for catalysis and stability.Data presented here certainly do not discount the possibility that the 55-kDa isoform is the preferred isoform for histamine biosynthesis.

Although we cannot completely rule out slight variations in the exact size estimations performed in other studies, our results on this are clear, the ∼53.7-kDa HDC1/477 isoform is the minimal unit of carboxyl-truncated rat HDC that is capable of retaining enzymatic activity. Carboxyl-truncated 53-kDa isoforms are inactive, bothin vitro and in vivo. A carboxyl-truncated 36-kDa isoform is also inactive, which is of interest given recent speculation concerning the functional importance of smaller HDC isoforms (30Safina F. Tanaka S. Inagaki M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but leads to the question of why inactive HDC isoforms are generated as part of normal in vivo HDC protein processing. It was not apparent from our study why the removal of amino acids 472 to 477 was inactivating the enzyme. There are no cysteine residues in this region that could be critical for structure. Furthermore, inactivation was not a gradual event as might be expected if the enzyme was gradually unfolding. Instead, inactivation was immediate and absolute, suggesting a more direct role for amino acids 472–477 in catalysis. Future studies will address why these AANLV (472–477) residues are so important for catalysis and stability. Data presented here certainly do not discount the possibility that the 55-kDa isoform is the preferred isoform for histamine biosynthesis. However, our data support the proposition that activity does not depend solely on this isoform, and we conclude that current evidence does not allow for cellular HDC activity to be attributed to any specific isoform. Indeed, we highlight physiological conditions where it would be advantageous to express and regulate multiple active isoforms. We feel that it is inappropriate, therefore, in light of evidence and arguments presented here, to continue referring to the 55-kDa isoform as the active or mature isoform. The challenge remains to devise experimental approaches to specifically address which of the isoforms is responsible for histamine biosynthesis in vivo. Our study suggests that multiple isoforms are likely to be involved. We are indebted to Francisca Sanchez-Jimenez (U.

N,N-dimethyldodecylamineN-oxide Vacuolar ATPases (V1VO ATPases) define an ubiquitous class of proton pumps, which utilize ATP hydrolysis to maintain an acidic pH inside the vacuole (1Perzov N.

The electrochemical ion gradient created across the vacuolar membrane is used for the accumulation of positively charged substrates such as calcium and basic amino acids (2Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).

The V-ATPases, consisting of at least thirteen distinct subunits (A3:B3:C:D:E:F:Gy:Hz:a:d:c:c′:c“) are morphologically subdivided in two components: a membrane-bound domain, VO, that contains the ion channel, and an extrinsic domain, V1, in which ATP hydrolysis takes place (4Graham L.A.

The two major subunits A and B, in a stoichiometry of A3:B3, contain the nucleotide-binding sites and are connected to the VO part by the so-called stalk subunits C-H (6Grüber G. Wieczorek H.

Low resolution structural studies of this V1 complex using small-angle x-ray scattering have shown that the hydrated enzyme is an elongated molecule. The x-ray data define a mushroom-shaped V1 ATPase, which consists of an ∼145 Å headpiece, joined by an elongated stalk (8Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V.

These barrel-shaped masses of approximately 30 Å in diameter and 80 Å in length, which consist of the major subunits A and B, are arranged in an alternating manner (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The hexagonal barrel of subunits A and B encloses a cavity of ∼32 Å in which part of the central stalk is asymmetrically located. The stalk protrudes from the bottom side of the headpiece forming an angle of ∼7° with the vertical axis of the molecule. At the upper end of the hexagonal barrel extensions can be observed, assumed to belong to the N termini of subunit A (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct.

These studies resulted in a model in which the subunits H, C, D, G, and F are exposed in the enzyme, whereas subunit E is shielded in the complex (6Grüber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Müller V. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H.

Commun. 2001; 286: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Here we report an investigation of the structure-function relationship of the V1 stalk subunits in M. sexta using the detergent LDAO.1 We show that the detergent liberates a highly active A3B3DEG complex and various hydrolytic-active subcomplexes, A3B3HEGF, A3B3HDEG, and A3B3EG. Electron microscopy has been used to visualize directly the two-dimensional structure of the A3B3EG subcomplex demonstrating a hexagonal modulation surrounding a central cavity with an interior mass.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here show that addition of various amounts of the zwitterionoic detergent LDAO to the V1 ATPase fromM. sexta induces the dissociation of the enzyme into the subcomplexes A3B3DEG, A3B3HEGF, and A3B3EG with altered rates of ATPase activity. Below the critical micelle concentration of 0.05% in a buffer ≥ pH 7.0 (33Helenius A. McCaslin D.R. Fries E. Tanford C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 734-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) the monomeric detergent leads to release of the subunits H, C, and F combined with an enhancement of ATP-hydrolytic activity. By assaying the A3B3DEG subcomplex after chromatography in the absence of LDAO, where activation of ATPase activity was essentially the same, it was possible to conclude that the enhancement is either due to the release of an ensemble of the subunits H, C, and F or to the removal of one of these three polypeptides (see below).Increasing LDAO concentrations to 0.1% shows that the reduced V1 can be converted into an A3B3HEGF complex, whereby under oxidizing conditions the complex dissociates further into a smaller subcomplex composed of the subunits A, B, E, and G. Most recent studies on the oxidized and reduced V1 ATPase from M. sextahave also shown that the subunits H and F are less accessible to proteolytic digestion in the reduced form (32Grüber G. Svergun D.I. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Koch M.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30082-30087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is in line with the data presented in which the presence of 0.1% LDAO leads to the dissociation of these two subunits only under oxidizing conditions. The ATPase activity of the A3B3HEGF and A3B3EG subcomplex after detergent removal is about 52 and 58% of that of V1 ATPase, respectively (see above). This observation that both complexes lacking subunit D still retain a high ATPase activity is important, because this subunit has been proposed as a structural and functional homologue of the γ subunit of F-ATPases (34Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22075-22081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, prolonged digestion of the M. sexta V1 with trypsin resulted in an active enzyme lacking subunit D (13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a previous report of Xie (36Xie X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggested that subunit D is not essential for ATP hydrolysis in the bovine enzyme. However, the resulting hydrolytic-active A3B3EG-domain ofM. sexta forms what can be called a “core” complex (see Fig. 6). For the H+-ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles it has been demonstrated that at least the four subunits A, B, C, and E are necessary for ATP hydrolysis (37Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Peng S.B. Zhang Y. Tsai S.J. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11356-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies recombinant subunits E and C were reconstituted with a biochemically prepared A-B complex, resulting in an A3B3E subcomplex with reproducible reconstitution of ATPase activity (37Xie X.-S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9859-9867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 6-fold stimulation of hydrolytic activity when recombinant C was added to the A3B3E complex. Addition of subunit C to the A-B subcomplex resulted in slight activity (38Peng S.B. Zhang Y. Tsai S.J. Xie X.S. Stone D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11356-11360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most recent studies reveal that subunit C (39Kane P.M. Tarsio M. Liu J. J. Biol.

Francis S.A. Oluwatosin Y. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8979-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Together with our data this reinforces the hypothesis that at least the subunits A, B, and E might constitute part of the minimal ATP-hydrolytic core of V1. The presence of both stalk subunits G and F in the A3B3E complex is not surprising because of their close proximity in the enzyme (Fig. 6), demonstrated by cross-linking experiments in the V1 ATPase from yeast (43Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), clathrin-coated vesicles (44Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and M. sexta (13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an arrangement of the subunits A, B, E, and G close to each other is in accordance with the formation of an A2BEG subcomplex of M. sexta upon treatment with chaotopic iodide, but without hydrolytic activity (13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 45Huss M. Structure, Function and Regulation of the Plasmamembrane V-ATPase from Manduca sexta Ph. D. thesis. University of Osnabrück, Germany2001Google Scholar). Notably, from recent studies using a bifunctional cross-link reagent it has been proposed that subunit E (Vma4p), with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa, is located at the outer surface of the A3B3 hexamer in the V1VO ATPase from yeast (46Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Close inspection of the recently determined three-dimensional structure of the V1 ATPase from M. sexta (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) clearly indicates that no additional mass is located at the outer surface of the A3B3 hexamer of V1 alone.However, a direct correlation between the dissociation of the individual subunits H, C, and F forming different subcomplexes and the change of ATPase activity is not clear at the moment. Nevertheless, the increase of hydrolytic activity after removal of the three subunits H, C, and F implies that it needs such an ensemble of subunits, whose simultaneous dissociation might lead to structural and thereby functional alterations in the remaining subcomplex.To date the best structural model for M. sextaV1 ATPase is an 18 Å three-dimensional reconstruction obtained from single-particle images of the molecules embedded in deep stain (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The V1 model consists of a headpiece of 130 Å in diameter, with the six major subunits A and B alternating around a cavity and a compact central stalk. Inside the cavity the stalk can be seen connected to only two of the major subunits (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Zero-length cross-linking studies (13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Canas B. Kleine-Kohlbrecher D. Huss M.

The presented two-dimensional averages of the A3B3EG subcomplex from M. sextadetermined from negatively stained specimens reveals a hexagonal modulation as seen previously in projection images of V1molecules in stain (13Grüber G.

Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional analysis of the A3B3EG domain shows also that the A3B3 hexamer is occluded by a seventh mass centrally to the hexamer. This hexagonal modulation of the A3B3 hexamer with an internal seventh mass is remarkably similar to the subunit arrangement of the closely related F1 complex. Cryo-electron micrographs of F1from Escherichia coli that were labeled with Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies (47Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have shown that the additional seventh mass includes the central stalk subunits γ and ε.In summary, the amphipathic detergent LDAO is a useful tool for examining the composition of the ATP-hydrolytic core of the M. sexta V1 ATPase. The data presented show that at least the subunits A, B, E, and G are essential for ATP-hydrolysis in this enzyme. Previous experiments (13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J.

The two major subunits A and B, in a stoichiometry of A3:B3, contain the nucleotide-binding sites and are connected to the VO part by the so-called stalk subunits C-H (6Grüber G. Wieczorek H.

Seen from the side the structures of the V1 ATPase, recently identified from Caloramator fervidus (7Boekema E.J. Ubbink-Kok T. Lolkema J.S. Brisson A. Konings W.N. Photosyn.

The V1 ATPase from M. sexta, which reversibly dissociates from the VO part as an in vivoregulatory mechanism (10Sumner J.P. Dow J.A.T. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Grüber G. Harvey W.R. Huss M. Merzendorfer H. Zeiske W. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 127-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low resolution structural studies of this V1 complex using small-angle x-ray scattering have shown that the hydrated enzyme is an elongated molecule. The x-ray data define a mushroom-shaped V1 ATPase, which consists of an ∼145 Å headpiece, joined by an elongated stalk (8Svergun D.I. Konrad S. Huss M. Koch M.H. Wieczorek H. Altendorf K. Volkov V.V.

These barrel-shaped masses of approximately 30 Å in diameter and 80 Å in length, which consist of the major subunits A and B, are arranged in an alternating manner (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The hexagonal barrel of subunits A and B encloses a cavity of ∼32 Å in which part of the central stalk is asymmetrically located. The stalk protrudes from the bottom side of the headpiece forming an angle of ∼7° with the vertical axis of the molecule. At the upper end of the hexagonal barrel extensions can be observed, assumed to belong to the N termini of subunit A (9Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Wieczorek H. Grüber G. J. Struct.

Further insights into the topology of theM. sexta V1 ATPase were obtained by differential protease sensitivity, release by chaotropic agents (13Grüber G. Radermacher M. Ruiz T. Godovac-Zimmermann J.

These studies resulted in a model in which the subunits H, C, D, G, and F are exposed in the enzyme, whereas subunit E is shielded in the complex (6Grüber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Müller V. J.

Here we report an investigation of the structure-function relationship of the V1 stalk subunits in M. sexta using the detergent LDAO.1 We show that the detergent liberates a highly active A3B3DEG complex and various hydrolytic-active subcomplexes, A3B3HEGF, A3B3HDEG, and A3B3EG. Electron microscopy has been used to visualize directly the two-dimensional structure of the A3B3EG subcomplex demonstrating a hexagonal modulation surrounding a central cavity with an interior mass. DISCUSSIONThe results presented here show that addition of various amounts of the zwitterionoic detergent LDAO to the V1 ATPase fromM. sexta induces the dissociation of the enzyme into the subcomplexes A3B3DEG, A3B3HEGF, and A3B3EG with altered rates of ATPase activity. Below the critical micelle concentration of 0.05% in a buffer ≥ pH 7.0 (33Helenius A. McCaslin D.R. Fries E. Tanford C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 734-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) the monomeric detergent leads to release of the subunits H, C, and F combined with an enhancement of ATP-hydrolytic activity. By assaying the A3B3DEG subcomplex after chromatography in the absence of LDAO, where activation of ATPase activity was essentially the same, it was possible to conclude that the enhancement is either due to the release of an ensemble of the subunits H, C, and F or to the removal of one of these three polypeptides (see below).Increasing LDAO concentrations to 0.1% shows that the reduced V1 can be converted into an A3B3HEGF complex, whereby under oxidizing conditions the complex dissociates further into a smaller subcomplex composed of the subunits A, B, E, and G. Most recent studies on the oxidized and reduced V1 ATPase from M. sextahave also shown that the subunits H and F are less accessible to proteolytic digestion in the reduced form (32Grüber G.

This is in line with the data presented in which the presence of 0.1% LDAO leads to the dissociation of these two subunits only under oxidizing conditions. The ATPase activity of the A3B3HEGF and A3B3EG subcomplex after detergent removal is about 52 and 58% of th"

Inhibition of cytokine gene expression is mediated via repression of transcription factors, including NF-κB. Previously we have shown that cytokine production by renal epithelial cells is insensitive to the inhibitory action of dexamethasone. In this study we demonstrate that dexamethasone is unable to inhibit NF-κB activation in the renal epithelial cell line HK-2, as measured by IκB-α degradation and DNA binding activity. Transfection of an NF-κB-inducible reporter gene demonstrated that non-stimulated HK-2 cells contain a high level of constitutively active NF-κB compared with the steroid-sensitive airway epithelial cell line A549, which was not blocked by dexamethasone. Expression and nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was comparable in both cell types. In HK-2 cells, dexamethasone stimulated expression of two glucocorticoid-responsive genes, β2-adrenoreceptors and angiotensinogen. The capacity of GR to transactivate the native angiotensinogen glucocorticoid-responsive element (GRE) using chromatin-IP was not impaired. Moreover, dexamethasone activation of a GRE-driven reporter construct appeared to be equally effective, although less sensitive compared with A549 cells. In conclusion, we provide evidence that glucocorticoids are unable to repress the activity of NF-κB in renal epithelial cells in the presence of an intact stimulatory pathway.

In conclusion, we provide evidence that glucocorticoids are unable to repress the activity of NF-κB in renal epithelial cells in the presence of an intact stimulatory pathway. Glucocorticoids are known to modulate a variety of cellular processes and play an important role in homeostasis and development. Furthermore, glucocorticoids are potent suppressors of the immune system and are therefore used as therapeutic treatment in a broad range of autoimmune and in- flammatory diseases. Glucocorticoid action is mediated via binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; IL, interleukin; AGT, angiotensinogen; GRE, glucocorticoid-responsive element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CAPE, caffeic acid phenethyl ester; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay The inactive receptor is bound to chaperone proteins, including two heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) subunits, and is located in the cytoplasm (1Tsai M.J.

Upon ligand binding, the activated GR dissociates from the chaperone complex and translocates to the nucleus to activate or repress transcription of glucocorticoid target genes. Stimulation of gene transcription is mediated via binding of GR to glucocorticoid responsive elements (GREs) in the promoter region of glucocorticoid responsive genes (1Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 2Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A.

Renal tubular epithelial cells (TEC) are an important source of cytokines and chemokines and are thought to play an active role in the progression of inflammatory processes in the kidney (4van Kooten C. Daha M.R. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 10: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although glucocorticoids are known to have a profound inhibitory effect on cytokine production by a variety of cell types (5Auwardt R.B. Mudge S.J. Chen C.G. Power D.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1620-1628PubMed Google Scholar, 6Miyazawa K. Mori A. Okudaira H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7John M. Hirst S.J. Jose P.J. Robichaud A. Berkman N. Witt C. Twort C.H. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. J.

Woltman A.M. Bakker A.C. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cytokine production by glucocorticoids has been attributed to transrepression of NF-κB, a pro-inflammatory transcription factor that regulates the expression of many inflammatory mediators, including IL-6 and IL-8 (9Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar, 10Lee J.I. Burckart G.J. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1998; 38: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mechanism of NF-κB suppression by glucocorticoids has been studied extensively. Initially it was postulated that corticosteroids inhibit NF-κB activation by increasing the transcription of IκB-α, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB (11Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 12Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar), but this occurs only in certain T-cell lines. Subsequent studies have shown that the activated glucocorticoid receptor can bind to the p65 subunit of NF-κB, thus interfering in the binding of NF-κB to DNA (13Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 14Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The currently accepted view is that corticosteroids interfere with the transactivating potential of NF-κB via alterations in cofactor recruitment (15Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D.

In the present study, we have investigated modulation of gene transcription by dexamethasone in the renal epithelial cell line HK-2 to obtain more insight in the observed steroid insensitivity. We show that dexamethasone is unable to prevent activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptor translocation to the nucleus in renal epithelial cells is functional and comparable to the glucocorticoid-sensitive airway epithelial cell line A549. In renal epithelial cells, dexamethasone stimulated the expression of two glucocorticoid-responsive genes, angiotensinogen (AGT) and β2-adrenoreceptors, but had no effect on cytokine production, clearly demonstrating dissociation of the positive and negative regulatory function of glucocorticoids in this cell type. These results emphasize the cell type-specific characteristics of glucocorticoid action. The renal epithelial cell line HK-2 was kindly provided by M. Ryan, University College Dublin, Ireland (18Ryan M.J. Johnson G. Kirk J. Fuerstenberg S.M. Zager R.A. Torok-Storb B. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 48-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (ΔFCS) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma Chemical Co.). The human airway epithelial cell line A549 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% ΔFCS. Prior to stimulation, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h. Prior to stimulation, cells were transferred to 48-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY) at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells per well and serum-starved. Cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-1α (Preprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). For inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated for 2 h with dexamethasone (Sigma) before addition of IL-1. Production of IL-6 and IL-8 in culture supernatants was measured by specific ELISA as described previously (19van Kooten C. Gerritsma J.S. Paape M.E. van Es L.A. Banchereau J. Daha M.R. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 711-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cytokine production is presented as mean concentration ± S.D. from representative experiments. Experiments were repeated at least three times. IκB-α and β2-adrenoreceptor protein levels were detected in whole cell extracts. Cells were harvested at different time points after stimulation and incubated in lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mix consisting of 5 units/ml Trasylol (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin (all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min on ice. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. For detection of GR translocation, nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared. After stimulation with dexamethasone (10−10 to 10−6m), cells were harvested by scraping in 2 ml of ice-cold Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Sigma) and centrifuged for 5 min. Cytosolic extracts were prepared by addition of buffer A (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min on ice and centrifugation. The pellets containing the nuclear proteins were extracted in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with buffer C (20 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete protease inhibitor mixture). Protein concentration was determined with a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). Cell extracts were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE precast gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-human IκB-α (C-21) antibody, rabbit anti-human β2-adrenoreceptor (H-73) antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse anti-human GR antibody (Signal Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark. Blots were developed with ECL chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using a Stratagene Eagle sight analysis program. Efficiency of transfer was verified by staining with Ponceau Red (Sigma). Total RNA was isolated using RNAzolB (Campro, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 260/A 280ratios were measured to determine the quantity and purity of RNA preparations. Fixed amounts of total cellular RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA by oligo(dT) priming using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Expression of IκB-α and AGT mRNA was determined by RT-PCR with β-actin as a control. Primer sequences are shown in Table I. PCR was performed under standard conditions (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.06 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mm dNTPs, 25 pmol of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with MgCl2 2.5 mm for IκB-α and 1.5 mm for AGT and β-actin. The following scheme was used: 5 min 95 °C, IκB-α/β-actin: 35 cycles of 1 min 95 °C, 1 min 60 °C (IκB-α) or 55 °C (β-actin) and 1 min 72 °C; AGT: 40 cycles of 1.5 min 95 °C, 2.5 min 60 °C, 1.5 min 72 °C; 7 min 72 °C.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with IL-1 for 1 h with or without preincubation with dexamethasone. A small fraction (3 μg) of nuclear extracts was used to establish DNA binding as described previously (24Woltman A.M. De Haij S. Boonstra J.G. Gobin S.J. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2044-2055PubMed Google Scholar). The probe used for detection of DNA binding was a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the κB site from HLA-A (5′-GTG GGG ATT CCC CAC TGC A-3′) (23Gobin S.J. Keijsers V. van Zutphen M. van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar). For supershift assays, anti-p50 (sc-114) and anti-p65 (sc-109) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the nuclear extract and probe mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer and analyzed by autoradiography. NF-κB DNA binding activity was also assessed with Trans-AM NF-κB p65 and p50 transcription factor assay kits (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with 10−6m dexamethasone for 30 min and stimulated with 5 ng/ml IL-1 for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared and 2-μg extracts were added to 96-well plates coated with an oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus site. Binding of NF-κB to the DNA was visualized by anti-p50 and anti-p65 antibodies that specifically recognize activated NF-κB. Antibody binding was measured at 450 nm. Specificity of NF-κB activation was determined by competition experiments using NF-κB wild-type and mutant consensus oligonucleotides that were provided with the kit. The reporter plasmids pGL-3κB-Luc and pMMf-Luc were a generous gift from J. W. Bloom, Dept. of Pharmacology, Tucson, AZ. Plasmid pGL-3κB-Luc contains 3 NF-κB sites linked to the luciferase gene inserted into the pGL3-basic vector. Plasmid pMMf-Luc is a derivative of pGL3-basic containing the MTVGREpromoter of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) linked to the luciferase gene. Before transfection, cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates (Costar) and serum-starved for 24 h. On the day of transfection, culture medium was switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For inhibition studies, cells were pretreated with 10−6mdexamethasone or 10 μg/ml caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE; Sigma) for 1 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE/Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of DNA per well. After a 1-h incubation, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium culture medium containing the appropriate stimulus was added to the cells. 6 h after stimulation, cells were lysed via addition of 500 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and overnight incubation at −20 °C. Lysates were harvested, and luciferase activity was assessed using a luciferase assay substrate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A549 and HK-2 cells were cultured in 8-well chamberslides (Falcon, BD PharMingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells per well. After incubation with dexamethasone, slides were harvested and fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.8% Nonidet P-40 and blocked for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 20% normal swine serum (DAKO). Primary rabbit anti-human GR (E-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:25 in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 60 min. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, biotin-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig (DAKO) was incubated for 45 min. After another wash, slides were incubated with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (DAKO) for 45 min. Slides were counterstained with 10−6mDAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma) for 4 min and washed and mounted in 50% phosphate-buffered saline, 50% glycerol. Slides were analyzed with a Leica TCS-SP confocal laser-scanning microscope. HK-2 cells (1 × 106) were stimulated with dexamethasone (10−8m) for 4 h. ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, protein-DNA complexes were fixed in a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde. Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors) and sonicated (nine 10-s pulses). Sonicated samples were incubated overnight with 5 μg of rabbit anti-histone H4 (ac 5) antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK). A null-antibody immunoprecipitation served as negative control. Of each sample, 20 μl was kept as input/starting material. The soluble chromatin was immunoprecipitated and washed, and histone-DNA complexes were eluted from the antibody by adding elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Histone-DNA cross-links were reversed in 0.2 m NaCl by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. The DNA sample was further purified by 1-h incubation at 45 °C in 0.01 m EDTA, 0.04 mTris-HCl, pH 6.5 and 40 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ice-cold 100% ethanol, and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA. The promoter sequence of the human angiotensinogen gene was obtained from GenBankTM (AF424741). We used the TRANSFAC data base (transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/) (25Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) to predict GR-binding sites in theAGT promoter sequence. Two PCR primer pairs were designed to cover the first (AGT1) or second and third (AGT2) GR-binding sites (Table I). PCR was performed under standard conditions as described for RT-PCR using input samples as positive control. The following scheme was used: 94 °C, 4 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C, 45 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s; and 10 min, 72 °C. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Stimulation of the renal epithelial cell line HK-2 with IL-1 (5 ng/ml) for 6 h resulted in increased production of inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and IL-8. To examine the effect of glucocorticoids on cytokine production, cells were preincubated for 2 h with dexamethasone and stimulated with IL-1 in the continuous presence of dexamethasone. No effect of dexamethasone (10−6m) was observed on either constitutive or IL-1-induced production of IL-6 and IL-8 by HK-2 cells (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, dexamethasone completely abolished IL-8 production in the airway epithelial cell line A549 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, already at 6 h after stimulation there is a clear discrimination in steroid responsiveness between renal and airway epithelial cells, which is more pronounced after 48 h (Fig. 1 C). To identify the mechanism of steroid insensitivity in HK-2, we examined the ability of dexamethasone to repress the activity of NF-κB. Since inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by glucocorticoids has been suggested to be mediated via induction of IκB-α expression (11Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 12Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar), this pathway was first investigated. Western blot analysis showed that IL-1 induced degradation of IκB-α 15–60 min after stimulation, whereas protein levels of IκB-α were unaltered after treatment with dexamethasone for 0.5–24 h (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, dexamethasone was unable to prevent IL-1-induced degradation of IκB-α (Fig. 2 B). After IκB-α degradation, prolonged stimulation of cells with IL-1 (4–24 h) increased IκB-α protein levels, suggesting the presence of an autoregulatory feedback mechanism (Fig. 2 A). In accordance, IL-1 increased mRNA expression of IκB-α, which peaked at 1 h after stimulation (Fig. 2 C). Dexamethasone showed no effect on IκB-α mRNA levels, which is compatible with our protein data. To study the effect of dexamethasone on DNA binding activity of NF-κB we performed EMSA. In non-stimulated HK-2 cells we could already detect NF-κB binding (Fig. 3 A). Previously we have shown that primary renal epithelial cells expressed two NF-κB complexes, a p50-p65 heterodimer and a more abundant p50-p50 homodimer (24Woltman A.M. De Haij S. Boonstra J.G. Gobin S.J. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2044-2055PubMed Google Scholar). Supershift analysis showed that also in HK-2 this p50-p50 complex was the most abundant complex, while the p50-p65 complex was expressed only very weakly. Stimulation of HK-2 for 1 h with IL-1 increased DNA binding activity, which was not inhibited when cells were stimulated in the presence of 1 μm dexamethasone (Fig. 3 A,lane 4). The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on NF-κB has been specifically attributed to interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-κB (13Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 14Caldenhoven E. Liden J. Wissink S. Van de Stolpe A. Raaijmakers J. Koenderman L. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of dexamethasone on p65-mediated DNA binding, we used p65 and p50 transcription factor assay kits, which allow specific detection of activated p65 and p50. As shown in Fig. 3 B, a high level of constitutive binding of p65 and p50 to the NF-κB consensus site could be detected in non-stimulated HK-2 cells compared with the steroid-sensitive cell line A549. Stimulation of HK-2 cells with IL-1 induced an increase in p65- and p50-mediated DNA binding activity, which was not blocked by pretreatment with dexamethasone. The high constitutive level of DNA binding prompted us to study transcriptional activation by NF-κB in HK-2 cells using a NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter gene, pGL-3κB-Luc, which contains three NF-κB consensus sites. In non-stimulated HK-2 cells, a high constitutive activity of the reporter gene was observed, indicating a high level of constitutively active NF-κB in this cell type (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, constitutive levels of reporter gene activity were low in transfected A549 cells. This was not due to a decreased transfection efficiency of A549 cells, which was measured with a control plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP; data not shown). These results are compatible with the DNA binding studies shown in Fig. 3. Next, we studied the capability of dexamethasone to transrepress NF-κB-induced transcription of the reporter gene. Fig. 4 Bshows that in HK-2 cells, reporter gene activity was only minimally blocked by dexamethasone but was strongly repressed (>95%) by CAPE, a known inhibitor of NF-κB activation. In A549 cells, dexamethasone and CAPE suppressed κB-reporter gene activity by, respectively, 65 and 85%. To further analyze the mechanism of steroid action in renal epithelial cells we compared the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway in HK-2 and A549 cells. One of the early steps in glucocorticoid receptor signaling is translocation of GR from the cytosol to the nucleus upon activation of the receptor through ligand binding (1Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2702) Google Scholar, 2Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In both cell types, GR expression in control cells was mainly cytosolic as visualized with immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5, A and C). Already at 30 min after stimulation with 10−6m dexamethasone an increase in nuclear staining was observed, which was more pronounced at 4 h (Fig. 5, Band D). The effect of dexamethasone on GR translocation was also assessed quantitatively with Western blotting. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared after stimulation with increasing doses of dexamethasone (10−10 to 10−8 to 10−6m) for 2 h. Glucocorticoid receptor expression in HK-2 cells was comparable to the expression levels in A549 (Fig. 5 E). Stimulation of HK-2 cells with 10−8 and 10−6m dexamethasone induced an increase in nuclear GR, which was accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic GR (Fig. 5, E and F). Nuclear translocation induced by dexamethasone was similar in both cell types, suggesting that the first part of the GR signaling pathway in HK-2 cells is functional. In A549 cells it has been demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment induces an increase in β2-adrenoreceptor mRNA levels and receptor number (26Mak J.C. Nishikawa M. Barnes P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L41-L46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of β2-adrenoreceptor in HK-2 cells with Western blotting. In both cell types, dexamethasone (10−6m) induced an increase in β2-adrenoreceptor protein levels (Fig. 6). Next, we performed semiquantitative ChIP assays to study AGT expression, which is known to be stimulated by glucocorticoidsin vitro and in vivo (27Brasier A.R. Li J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 465-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang L. Lei C. Zhang S.L. Roberts K.D. Tang S.S. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Aubert J. Darimont C. Safonova I. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the AGT promoter (−1223 to +35) identified the presence of three putative GR-binding sites. Two different primer pairs were designed to amplify the first GR-binding site (AGT1) or the second and third GR-binding site (AGT2) as shown in Fig. 7 A. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against histone H4 (ac 5) showed that in non-stimulated cells, a low level of constitutive histone H4 (Lys-5) acetylation was present (Fig. 7 B). Stimulation of HK-2 cells with 10−8mdexamethasone resulted in a marked enrichment of AGTpromoter DNA (Fig. 7 B). The enrichment for AGTpromoter segments was observed for both AGT1 and AGT2, suggesting that more than one GR-binding site within the AGT promoter is acetylated by dexamethasone-activated GR. In addition we investigated whether the increase in histone acetylation upon stimulation with dexamethasone correlated with an increase in AGT mRNA expression. In accordance with the histone acetylation data, semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that angiotensinogen mRNA levels were increased in cells stimulated with dexamethasone for 4 h compared with non-stimulated cells (Fig. 7 C). To compare the transactivating capacity of GR in HK-2 and A549, cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene, which is regulated by a promoter containing glucocorticoid-responsive elements (pMMf-Luc). Constitutive GR activity in HK-2 cells was very low compared with A549 cells (Fig. 8 A). This was not due to altered transfection rates as confirmed by co-transfection with GFP-expressing control plasmids. At high concentrations of dexamethasone (10−5m), stimulation of the reporter gene was comparable in both cell types (35-fold), indicating that the positive regulatory pathway of glucocorticoids is intact (Fig. 8 B). However, transactivation of the reporter gene in HK-2 cells was less sensitive than in A549 cells with a log shift in EC50 for dexamethasone between the cell lines (Fig. 8,A and B). In the present study we demonstrate dissociation of transrepression and transactivation by glucocorticoids in renal tubular epithelial cells. Glucocorticoids are potent suppressors of the immune system and are known to inhibit cytokine production by a variety of cell types (5Auwardt R.B. Mudge S.J. Chen C.G. Power D.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 1620-1628PubMed Google Scholar, 6Miyazawa K. Mori A. Okudaira H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7John M. Hirst S.J. Jose P.J. Robichaud A. Berkman N. Witt C. Twort C.H. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1841-1847PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have shown previously that cytokine and chemokine production by activated renal tubular epithelial cells is insensitive to the inhibitory action of dexamethasone (8De Haij S. Woltman A.M. Bakker A.C. Daha M.R. van Kooten C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of steroid action in renal epithelial cells. We compared the effect of dexamethasone on cytokine production by the renal epithelial cell line HK-2 with the airway epithelial cell line A549 and found that already at 6 h after stimulation with IL-1 there is a clear discrimination in steroid responsiveness between renal and airway epithelial cells, suggesting that an early signaling pathway might be involved. Suppression of cytokine production by glucocorticoids is mainly attributed to inhibition of NF-κB (3McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee J.I. Burckart G.J. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1998; 38: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), for which several mechanisms have been proposed (11Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K.

In our study, no effect of dexamethasone on IκB-α synthesis and DNA binding activity of NF-κB was observed. Furthermore, transactivation of an NF-κB-inducible reporter gene was not inhibited. The absence of transrepression by dexamethasone prompted us to investigate the glucocorticoid signaling pathway in HK-2. We demonstrate that dexamethasone induced translocation of GR from the cytosol to the nucleus, suggesting that the first part of the signaling pathway is intact. Next, we examined the transactivation capacity of dexamethasone on the expression of AGT, a gene that is positively regulated by glucocorticoids in various cell types, including rat proximal tubular epithelial cells (27Brasier A.R. Li J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 465-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang L. Lei C. Zhang S.L. Roberts K.D. Tang S.S. Ingelfinger J.R. Chan J.S.

J. 1997; 328: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Stimulation of gene transcription is thought to be mediated via acetylation of core histones on highly conserved lysine residues (2Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30Imhof A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R422-R424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-activator molecules including the CREB-binding protein (CBP) are able to induce histone acetylation via intrinsic histone acetyl transferase activity (HAT) and have been shown to bind to activated GR, resulting in a dexamethasone-specific pattern of histone acetylation (15Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 31Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), as was demonstrated previously for the SLPI gene (32Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that stimulation of HK-2 cells with dexamethasone induced an increase in histone 4 (Lys-5) acetylation on different GR binding sites in the AGT promoter, indicating increased transcription of the AGT gene. The increase in histone acetylation was accompanied by an increase in angiotensinogen mRNA levels. Nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation in HK-2 cells was increased after dexamethasone concentrations that did not inhibit cytokine production, suggesting that the steroid insensitivity of renal epithelial cells is specific for the inhibitory function of glucocorticoids, whereas the stimulatory function is intact. At high doses of dexamethasone, transactivation of a GRE-inducible reporter gene in HK-2 cells was comparable to the steroid-sensitive cell line A549. However, at low doses activation of the reporter gene appeared to be less sensitive in HK-2 cells. In parallel, we observed a high level of constitutive NF-κB activation in non-stimulated HK-2 cells compared with A549 cells. Interaction between GR and NF-κB has been shown to result in functional antagonism (13Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 33McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this antagonism might be competition for cofactors, including CBP, as has been proposed in some studies (15Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on this model of functional antagonism, we would like to propose that a high level of constitutive NF-κB activation contributes to the low level of GR reporter gene activity we observed in HK-2 cells orvice versa. Other possibilities include a failure of GR to repress p50-mediated transactivation through the κB site since p50 levels are high under basal levels and are further increased following IL-1 stimulation. Despite the high level of constitutively active NF-κB, cytokine production by non-stimulated HK-2 is low, albeit higher than in A549 cells. This suggests either that it is unlikely that NF-κB is the sole transcription factor involved in increased cytokine production by HK-2 cells, but rather functions in conjunction with other signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (34Shimada M. Andoh A. Hata K. Tasaki K. Araki Y. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Vanden Berghe W. Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. De Bosscher K. Boone E. Haegeman G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or that a repressor must be removed to enable cytokine transcription to occur efficiently. Alternatively, it has been shown that inhibition of transcription factors involves only a single GR monomer and that DNA binding is not required (36Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 37Reichardt H.M. Tuckermann J.P. Gottlicher M. Vujic M. Weih F. Angel P. Herrlich P. Schutz G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7168-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), whereas activation of gene transcription by glucocorticoids is mediated via binding of GR homodimers to GRE in the promoter of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. Defective interaction of GR monomers with NF-κB might also explain the lack of transrepression by glucocorticoids. Inhibition of gene transcription by glucocorticoids can also occur via negative GRE or via transrepression of other transcription factors like AP-1. Whether these inhibitory functions of GR are also hampered in renal epithelial cells still has to be determined. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that renal epithelial cells are responsive to positive but not to negative modulation by glucocorticoids. Decreased GR activity or increased constitutive activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway might contribute to the lack of suppression by glucocorticoids. These results emphasize the cell type-specific characteristics of glucocorticoid action. EMSA experiments were performed in the laboratory of Dr. van den Elsen (Dept. of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands)."
https://openalex.org/W2054498829,"We have investigated the question of the presence of a cap structure located at the top of the F1α3β3 hexamer of the yeast mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase complex. Specifically, we sought to determine whether the putative cap has a rigid structure and occludes the central shaft space formed by the α3β3 hexamer or alternatively whether the cap is more flexible permitting access to the central shaft space under certain conditions. Thus, we sought to establish whether subunit γ, an essential component of the F1 central stalk housed within the central shaft space and whose N and C termini would both lie beneath a putative cap, could be fused at its C terminus to green fluorescent protein (GFP) without loss of enzyme function. The GFP moiety serves to report on the integrity and location of fusion proteins containing different length polypeptide linkers between GFP and subunit γ, as well as being a potential occluding structure in itself. Functional incorporation of subunit γ-GFP fusions into ATP synthase of yeast cells lacking native subunit γ was demonstrated by the ability of intact complexes to hydrolyze ATP and retain sensitivity to oligomycin. Our conclusion is that the putative cap structure cannot be an inflexible structure, but must be of a more flexible nature consistent with the accommodation of subunit γ-GFP fusions within functional ATP synthase complexes.

The enzyme complex is described as having two major structural domains, F1 and F0. The globular F1 catalytic sector contains three α and three β subunits arranged alternately in a hexamer thereby forming a central shaft space that houses part of the γ subunit. Each β subunit contains a catalytic site for the synthesis of ATP. These sites are repetitively and sequentially driven through defined conformational states by the rotation of the γ subunit, which is in turn linked to the translocation of protons through the membrane bound F0sector (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Models of the F1 sector derived from x-ray crystallographic data indicate the presence of an apparent “dimple” in the top of the F1 sector ∼15 Å deep that is contiguous with the central shaft space housing the C- and N-terminal portions of subunit γ (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). Despite the considerable advances in determining much of the structure of F1 (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar, 3Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct.

Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), there are many questions that remain unanswered concerning the structure/function relationships of F1F0-ATP synthase components. One important question relates to the structure of F1 in the vicinity of the dimple at the very top of F1. A “cap” at the top of F1 has been visualized in electron microscopic images of ATP synthase isolated from Escherichia coli (5Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and bovine mitochondria (7Karrasch S. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This cap structure is not seen in models of ATP synthase derived from x-ray crystallographic data of F1. The identity of the proteins that contribute to the cap structure is not clear but may represent, in part, the N-terminal 20–30 amino acids of subunits α and β that were disordered and therefore not represented in models derived from the x-ray crystal data, or alternatively, F0 proteins lost upon crystallization of the complex. Using an immuno-electron microscopy approach, bacterial subunit δ, in particular its C-terminal portion, has been localized to the dimple region (8Wilkens S. Zhou J. Nakayama R. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In earlier studies, proteolysis experiments had indicated that the eukaryotic homologue of subunit δ, OSCP,1 binds to the N-terminal end of the α subunit (9Hundal T. Norling B. Ernster L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 162: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have positioned OSCP in association with F1, but sometimes at the top and sometimes at the side (10Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Boyle G.M. Nagley P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recent evidence obtained using a protein chemistry approach for ATP synthase isolated from rat mitochondria indicates that specific regions at the top of F1 are shielded by F0 components (11Ko Y.H. Hullihen J. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32931-32939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this shielding represents an extension of the stator stalk and that the cap, composed in part by F6 (whose functional homologue in yeast is subunit h (12Velours J. Vaillier J. Paumard P. Soubannier V. Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8602-8607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) and possibly subunit d, completely covers the N termini of all α and β subunits. It is not clear whether the cap represents a solid structure closing off the surface area at the top of F1 as represented by the mouth of the dimple seen in F1 crystal structures. Under the experimental conditions used by Böttcher and colleagues (6Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) the cap of the E. coli ATP synthase (EF1F0) was shown to cover much of the area represented by the dimple. Thus, upon binding of the nucleotide analogue AMP-PNP to EF1F0 a cap structure could be detected concomitant with significant shrinkage in the diameter of F1 (6Böttcher B. Bertsche I. Reuter R. Gräber P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was suggested that some of the differences observed on binding AMP-PNP were a result of a significant rearrangement in the N-terminal domains of the α and β subunits. When a three-dimensional reconstruction of EF1F0 was viewed from the top looking down the axis of the central stalk a triangular shaped cap appeared to cover the central shaft space. A flexible cap that shifts its position throughout the catalytic synthesis of ATP on F1 would be consistent with the idea that the conformationally flexible N termini of the α and β subunits contribute to its structure. The appearance of the cap would alter depending on the state in which the complex was “captured,” sometimes completely covering the top of the F1 and sometimes not. In this study we have investigated the question of the presence of a flexible cap structure in the yeast mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase (mtATPase) complex. Although direct evidence for a cap structure has yet to be reported for yeast mtATPase, the high degree of conservation documented between eukaryotic mtATPase complexes would favor the existence of a cap. Thus we have sought to determine whether the putative cap precludes the assembly into mtATPase complexes of subunit γ, an essential component of the central stalk, fused to a reporter protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP). The N and C termini of subunit γ would both lie beneath the cap within the central shaft space formed by the F1α3β3 hexamer, with the C-terminal glycine residue about 15 Å below the position of the N-terminal end of subunits α and β (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar). Our strategy has been to express in yeast cells subunit γ fused at its C terminus to GFP via a polypeptide linker. Correctly folded GFP forms a very rigid and stable 11-stranded β-barrel structure 24 Å in diameter and 48 Å in length threaded by an α-helix running up the axis of the barrel (13Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar) that is remarkably stable to the action of a range of denaturing agents and proteases (14Ward W.W. Chalfie M. Kain S. Green Fluorescent Protein Properties, Applications and Protocols. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 50-56Google Scholar). The fluorescence properties of GFP have been utilized widely as a convenient tag to report the presence of a protein in various subcellular locations. We have used these properties of GFP to report on the integrity and location of fusion proteins containing different length polypeptide linkers between GFP and mtATPase subunit γ. Functional incorporation of subunit γ-GFP fusions into mtATPase would suggest that the putative cap structure in vivo is not at any time a “solid” inflexible structure that completely occludes the dimple in the top of the F1, but must be of a more flexible nature consistent with the incorporation of subunit γ-GFP fusions within functional ATP synthase complexes. In such complexes it is presumed that that the polypeptide linker connecting subunit γ with GFP would not be obstructed in exiting the central shaft space at the top of F1. Dodecyl β-maltoside and complete protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Sydney, Australia). Vistra ECF substrate was purchased from AmershamBiosciences (Sydney, Australia). A DNA cassette encoding a yeast enhanced variant of GFP, referred to here as YEGFP3L, was retrieved by PCR using the primer pair YGFP3UP/YGFP3DO (YGFP3UP, 5′-GGATCCATCGCCACCATGTCTAAAGGTGAAGAATTATTCACTGG-3′; YGFP3DO, 5′-CAGCTGTTATTTGTACAATTCATCCATACCATGG-3′) with the vector pYGFP3 (15Cormack B.P. Bertram G. Egerton M. Gow N.A. Falkow S. Brown A.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) as template. The PCR product was cloned into theBamHI/NotI site of the multicopy yeast expression vector pAS1NB to produce pAS1NB::YEGFP3L from which the DNA cassette encoding wild-type GFP had been removed. pASN1B is a derivative of pAS1N (16Prescott M. Lourbakos A. Bateson M. Boyle G. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in which a BamHI restriction site has been removed from the PGK promoter region. This vector allows the expression of GFP not fused to a partner protein. The DNA cassettes encompassing segments of the yeast ATP3 gene for subunit γ were recovered by PCR from YRD15 genomic DNA (17Prescott M. Higuti T. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The first, ATP3PO, encompasses 729 bp of sequence upstream of the initiation codon flanked by HindIII and nestedBamHI/BglII/NotI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The second, ATP3T, encompasses a transcription terminator cassette representing the terminator region of the ATP3 gene flanked at the 5′ and 3′ ends by restriction sites for NotI and SacII, respectively. The oligonucleotide pairs ATP3POUP/ATP3PODO and ATP3TUP/ATP3TDO, respectively, were used for these amplifications (ATP3POUP, 5′-TGAAAGCTTGAATGTACAGGTTATGACAACC-3′; ATP3PODO, 5′-AACGATGCGGCCGCAGATCTGAGGATCCCAAAGAGGAAGCACCAG-3′ and ATP3TDO, 5′-ATCGTTGCGGCCGCGCATTGCCTCTTTATTTGACG-3′; ATP3TDO, 5′-TACTCCGCGGTCTGGGCATACGCTTGGTAAAAAACCAAATC-3′; in each case the underline indicates the position of relevant restriction sites). The ATP3PO and ATP3T DNA cassettes were cloned sequentially into the yeast expression vector pRS306 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) asHindIII/NotI and NotI/SacII fragments, respectively, to produce the expression vector denoted pRS306::ATP3. A BglII/NotI DNA fragment encoding YEGFP3L was excised from pAS1NB::YEGFP3L and then cloned into the BglII/NotI site of pRS306::ATP3 to produce a vector (pRS306::ATP3-YEGFP3L27) encoding subunit γ fused to YEGFP3 with a polypeptide linker of 27 amino acids (γ-27-GFP; Fig. 1). A vector (pRS306::ATP3-YEGFP3L4) encoding subunit γ fused to YEGFP3 with a polypeptide linker of 4 amino acids (γ-4-GFP) was derived from pRS306::ATP3-YEGFP3L27 by removal of a 69-bp fragment flanked by BamHI sites (Fig. 1). pRS306::ATP3-YEGFP3L27 was linearized by digestion at the unique XbaI site 363 bp upstream of the initiation codon for subunit γ and used to transform YRD15 cells by the method of Schiestl and Gietz (19Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by plating onto solid minimal medium supplemented with histidine and leucine. Loss of plasmid sequences leaving only sequences encoding a γ-GFP fusion at the chromosomal ATP3 gene locus was induced as follows. Individual ura+ transformant colonies were isolated, cultured in non-selective glucose-containing medium, and then subjected to positive selection for the loss of theURA3 marker (ura−) by plating onto medium containing 5′-fluoro-orotic acid (20Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). One isolate was designated strain MPγ-27 and expresses γ-27-GFP. A PCR product was generated with the primer pair ATP3POUP/ATP3TDO using pRS306::ATP3-YEGFP3L4 as a template and Dynazyme EXT thermostable polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The product was digested with XbaI and used to transform YRD15 cells. Transformants (ura+) and then ATP3 gene replacement events were selected as described above. Strain MPγ-4 expresses γ-4-GFP. A PCR product encoding YEGFP3 linked, without any intervening amino acids, to the C terminus of subunit γ (γ-0-GFP), the yeast ADH1 terminator, and the Kluyveromyces lactis URA3-selectable marker and bearing regions of homology sufficient for recombination with the ATP3 gene was prepared using a template to be described elsewhere. The PCR product was used to transform YRD15 cells. Following selection of ura+transformants and then ATP3 gene replacement events (as described above), one isolate was designated strain MPγ-0 (expresses γ-0-GFP). Expression vector pAS1NB::YEGFP3L was introduced into strain YRD15 to produce the strain MPGFPc. Cells of this strain express GFP not fused to another protein, and therefore GFP is localized to the cytoplasm. Mitochondria were prepared from spheroplasts (21Law R.H. Manon S. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 122-163Google Scholar) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until required. For the isolation of cytoplasmically expressed YEGFP3, MPGFPc cells were cultured in a glucose-containing medium. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA containing Complete Inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and broken open by vortexing with glass beads at 4 °C for 1 min. Soluble proteins were retrieved by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min) and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Assays of mitochondrial lysates were performed as described previously (22Boyle G.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of mtATPase separated on clear native gels was determined in situ by incubating the gel slices in a solution of 5 mm ATP, pH 8.6, in 50 mm glycine/NaOH, pH 8.6, 0.05% lead acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate with gentle agitation at room temperature (23Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7910-7916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A white precipitate in the gel was indicative of ATPase activity. Images of gel sections made for detection of ATPase activity were recorded against a black background using a flat bed document scanner. Clear native gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as described previously (24Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). 200 μg of mitochondrial protein was pelleted for 10 min at 100,000 ×g. Each pellet was solubilized in 20 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3% (w/v) dodecyl β-maltoside), incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged 100,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants (20 μl) were loaded into wells of 4–16% gradient acrylamide gels (13 × 10 × 0.075 cm). Gels were run for 1 h at 100 V, then 2–3 h at 500 V with current limited to 5 mA/gel. Gels, while still between the glass plates, were then imaged for GFP fluorescence using a Wallac multi-wavelength imager in “edge-illumination mode” equipped with filters for excitation (480 ± 20 nm) and emission (535 ± 20 nm). After imaging, gels were separated from gel plates and sliced into sections for further individual analysis. Protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (24Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Proteins extracted from cells (25Yaffe M.P. Scahtz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient acrylamide gels according to standard procedures (26Hames B.D. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 30-49Google Scholar) and using a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Gelman Laboratory, Pall Corporation) after SDS-PAGE by standard procedures. Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antisera against subunit γ (diluted 1:1000). Secondary antibodies were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit. Signals were generated using chemifluorescent Vistra substrate and incubating for 10 mins at room temperature. Chemifluorescence was detected using a Amersham Biosciences Storm PhosporImager (27Bateson M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Prescott M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7462-7466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Image data were analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Integrated volumes for each of the relevant bands were determined and expressed as a percent of the relevant intact fusion protein after background correction. The x-ray crystal structures of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase (Ref. 2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank identifier 1BMF) and GFP (Ref. 28Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Kitts P.A. Kain S.R. Tsien R.Y. Ormö M. Remington S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2306-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank identifier 1EMB) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org; Ref. 29Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27853) Google Scholar). Using the tools available within the program Quanta (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), and to simplify the modeling procedure, a “template” structure was created containing subunit γ plus all residues within a 40-Å radius of its C terminus. Thus, the template contained the dimple and surrounding regions located at the top of F1. To build the model for the zero length linker, the GFP structure was positioned “end on” with its N terminus of GFP proximal to the C terminus of subunit γ. Manual positioning of the GFP structure was carried out so that steric clashes were minimized (using the contacts package within Quanta to highlight close contacts) in the merging of the two termini such that the GFP moiety became a C-terminal extension of subunit γ. The entire F1-derived portion of the model was then constrained (i.e. so that only the GFP portion of the model was allowed to move) and the model subjected to CHARMm minimization. Further minimization was performed using dihedral constraints applied to residues in the N-terminal region of GFP. Minimization was performed to convergence, and upon completion of the modeling procedure all residues in the GFP molecule were in allowed conformations. We predict that in order for the GFP molecule to correctly link to subunit γ, the N-terminal helix must partially unwind. To create the full model of F1 containing subunit γ fused to GFP, the coordinates of the fusion were copied back into1BMF (since the F1-derived portion of the template was constrained during minimization the subunit γ chain of 1BMF could be simply replaced with that of the template). Models containing longer linkers were created similarly, the linkers being added to the C terminus of subunit γ using the “edit protein” facility available within Quanta. Linkers were modeled as extended regions so as to create the maximum possible distance between the C terminus of subunit γ and the GFP moiety. In YRD15 yeast cells lacking endogenous subunit γ, we expressed individually the fusions γ-27-GFP, γ-4-GFP, and γ-0-GFP (Fig. 1) and tested their ability to act as a functional replacement for the native subunit. Yeast cells lacking expression of subunit γ are unable to grow on non-fermentable substrates because of the absence of a functional ATP synthase (30Paul M.F. Ackerman S. Yue J. Arselin G. Velours J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26158-26164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, strains MPγ-27, MPγ-4, and MPγ-0 were assessed for growth in liquid SaccE medium containing ethanol as carbon source (31Gray R.E. Law R.H. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All three strains grew on ethanol-containing medium, enabling comparison of their growth rates at 28 °C with that of the parent strain YRD15 (Table I). There was no significant difference 2Significance levels of difference between generation times were determined using Student's t test, comparing control strain YRD15 and cells expressing subunit γ-GFP fusions.(p > 0.05) in generation time for yeast MPγ-27 (10.9 h) and the control strain YRD15 (10.4 h). The generation times for MPγ-4 (14.7 h) and MPγ-0 (23.9 h), however, were significantly longer than that for the control strain (p > 0.05). Collectively these results indicate that functional mtATPase complexes are assembled in each of the strains MPγ-27, MPγ-4, and MPγ-0 at levels sufficient to support growth on a non-fermentable substrate.Table IGeneration times of strains and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities of isolated mitochondriaStrainGeneration timeATP hydrolysisInhibitionNo addition+Oligomycinhμmol ATP·min −1 ·mg protein −1%YRD1510.43 ± 0.161.70 ± 0.020.61 ± 0.1164MP-2710.88 ± 0.421.20 ± 0.070.20 ± 0.0583MP-414.67 ± 0.081.44 ± 0.130.36 ± 0.0375MP-023.87 ± 2.001.01 ± 0.140.33 ± 0.0167Mitochondria were isolated from cells grown at 28 °C with 2% ethanol as the carbon source.

Open table in a new tab Mitochondria were isolated from cells grown at 28 °C with 2% ethanol as the carbon source. Assays were performed in the presence of 100 μg of oligomycin/mg of protein, where indicated. Numbers represent the mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Individual cells of strains MPγ-27, MPγ-4, and MPγ-0 were observed by fluorescence microscopy. For cells of each strain fluorescence due to GFP was distributed in a filamentous manner characteristic of a mitochondrial location (data not shown). This result indicated that GFP had been correctly targeted to the mitochondrion and that the correct folding of the protein and maturation of the chromophore had occurred. The integrity of the γ-GFP fusion proteins was further investigated as follows. Proteins were extracted from cells of yeast strains MPγ-27, MPγ-4, MPγ-0, and YRD15 and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Polypeptides of M r ∼63,800 (Fig. 2, lane 2) andM r ∼61,600 (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and4) were detected when a blot was probed with polyclonal antibodies against subunit γ. The polypeptides migrated with mobility corresponding to a size slightly larger than that predicted for the corresponding fusion proteins (M r 59,997, 57,891, and 57,495 respectively, for γ-27-GFP, γ-4-GFP, and γ-0-GFP). Native subunit γ (not fused to GFP) from YRD15 mitochondria (Fig. 2, lane 1) was also found to migrate more slowly, M r 32,400, than its predicted size (M r 30,661). Probing an equivalent blot with antibodies against GFP confirmed that each of these polypeptides contained GFP (data not shown). An additional band (M r ∼38,000) not present in YRD15 and representing only minor amounts (1.9%, MP-27; 0.47%, MP-4; and 2.8%, MP-0) of intact fusion protein was observed when blots were probed with antisera against subunit γ (Fig. 2). If it is assumed this polypeptide was assembled into functional mtATPase complexes, the amounts of this polypeptide relative to the intact fusion protein cannot explain the levels of oligomycin sensitive ATPase assayed in isolated MPγ-27, MPγ-4, and MPγ-0 mitochondria (see Table I and below). Thus, compared with YRD15 reductions in ATPase activity of greater than 97% would be expected instead of the 40% observed for MP-0 (Table I). These findings confirm the identity of the fusion proteins and indicate that only complete fusion proteins are present within the vast majority of ATP synthase complexes. In other experiments in which a hexahistidine tag was added to the C terminus of the fluorescent protein moiety, it was possible using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, to recover assembled mtATPase complexes that contain only intact γ-fusion proteins. Under conditions where mtATPase complexes from YRD15 mitochondria did not bind to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, complexes containing γ-4-GFP or γ-0-GFP were recovered from lysates of mitochondria that when assayed for ATPase were found to be oligomycin sensitive (data not shown). Thus, it can be concluded that γ-27-GFP, γ-4-GFP, and γ-0-GFP are able to functionally replace native subunit γ in ATP synthase complexes. This conclusion is consistent with the results of other studies from our laboratory that show different subunits of the yeast mtATPase complex can be functionally replaced by the cognate GFP fusion protein (16Prescott M.

The integrity and function of isolated ATP synthase complexes containing γ-GFP fusion proteins were next investigated. Lysates of mitochondria isolated from cells of yeast strains MPγ-27, MPγ-4, MPγ-0, and YRD15 were subjected to clear native gel electrophoresis. This gradient gel electrophoresis technique (23Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol.

After electrophoresis, gels were sliced longitudinally into several sections. Each section was subjected to one of the following: staining for protein, fluorescence imaging, or an in situ assay for ATPase activity (Fig. 3). When stained for protein (Fig. 3 A), a band having mobility corresponding to that of assembled monomer ATP synthase, purified by the method of Rott and Nelson (34Rott R. Nelson N. J. Biol.

The β subunits of P4Hs are identical to the enzyme and chaperone protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (EC 5.3.4.1) (9Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllylä R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J.

The P4H is also maintained within its correct subcellular compartment by virtue of an ER retention signal at the C terminus of PDI (11Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I.

When expressed alone in a recombinant expression system, the α subunits are insoluble and inactive, whereas coexpression with PDI results in the formation of an active, soluble P4H (7Helaakoski T.

The PDIs from different organisms can often substitute for the authentic partner, such as the human PDI, which can function as a β subunit in mouse andDrosophila P4H tetramers and in a P4H dimer withCaenorhabditis elegans PHY-1 (5Annunen P.

Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In nematodes the exoskeleton (known as the cuticle) is an extracellular matrix composed of small collagen-like molecules (17Page A.P. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes. CAB International, Publishing, Wallingford, Oxon, UK2001: 167-193Google Scholar). The nematode cuticle is synthesized by the underlying hypodermal tissue and performs multiple functions including maintenance of worm body shape. Mutations in collagens forming the cuticle and in the enzymes involved in collagen biosynthesis can result in lethality and severe alterations to body shape, as illustrated by the C. elegans sqt-3 (18Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and bli-4 (19Thacker C. Peters K. Srayko M. Rose A.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) mutant phenotypes.The P4Hs in C. elegans that are involved in the synthesis of cuticle collagens are formed from the α subunits PHY-1 and PHY-2 and the β subunit PDI-2 (14Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The expression, function, and assembly of these subunits have been examined in detail showing that unique P4H forms exist in C. elegans. The most abundant form is a tetramer; this differs, however, from others described, being a mixed PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer (14Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PHY-1 and PHY-2 can also each individually associate with PDI-2 to form dimers (14Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such P4H forms have not been described for any other species to date. Genetic disruption of phy-1 and phy-2simultaneously, or pdi-2 singly, results in embryonic lethality in which embryos develop normally until the first cuticle is required to maintain the elongated worm shape (15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The weakened cuticle is then unable to maintain this form, after which embryos collapse to a disorganized state and eventually die. The body shape defect and reduced 4-hydroxyproline levels in the cuticle collagens of the viable phy-1 null genetic mutant,dpy-18, underline the importance of collagen modification by P4H for nematode body morphology (15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Applying the knowledge of P4H function in C. elegans, we examined a P4H in the filarial parasitic nematode Brugia malayi. B. malayi along with Brugia timoriand Wuchereria bancrofti are the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis in humans, with over 120 million people infected and over 1 billion people at risk of infection worldwide (20World Health Organization (2000) WHO Monogr. Ser.Fact Sheet No. 102Google Scholar). Lymphatic filariasis is a debilitating disease, with approximately one-third of those infected being incapacitated and/or disfigured by the infection (21Ottesen E.A. Duke B.O.L. Karam M. Behbehani K. Bull. W. H. O. 1997; 75: 491-503PubMed Google Scholar). Commercially available inhibitors of P4H have been shown to be toxic to B. malayi adults, producing associated cuticular defects (22Merriweather A. Guenzler V. Brenner M. Unnasch T.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations and the requirement inC. elegans for P4H activity highlight this enzyme class as a potential drug target in the control of human and veterinary parasitic nematode infections.In this article we describe the identification of a P4Hphy-1 gene from B. malayi, characterize the molecular and enzymatic properties of the recombinant B. malayi P4H produced in an insect cell expression system, and examine the expression profile and putative function of the B. malayi phy-1 gene by heterologous expression in the model nematodeC. elegans. Unusually, the B. malayi PHY-1 is a soluble and active P4H when expressed alone in a recombinant system in the absence of PDI, and it does not associate with PDIs from other organisms, including C. elegans. The developmental temporal expression pattern of the B. malayi phy-1 gene was analyzed by RT-PCR using stage-specific mRNA samples. Reporter gene experiments showed that the B. malayi phy-1 promoter directs tissue-specific spatial expression to the hypodermal cells of C. elegans.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have identified and characterized a P4H with unusual properties from the filarial parasite B. malayi. The recombinant B. malayi PHY-1 assembles into an active soluble P4H tetramer when expressed in insect cells in the absence of PDI. High levels of B. malayi phy-1 transcript expression were detected in all parasite stages examined. Analysis of B. malayi phy-1 promoter-reporter gene fusions showed that the construct is expressed in hypodermal cells in a heterologous C. eleganssystem, thus indicating a conservation of control elements between these species. Although B. malayi PHY-1 appears to function as a P4H independently, without a PDI subunit, the B. malayi phy-1 was not able to replace P4H function in a C. elegans phy-1 mutant.The essential nature of the cuticle collagen modifying function of P4H has previously been demonstrated in the nematode C. elegans, where animals lacking or deficient in this function are nonviable or malformed (15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chemical inhibitors of P4H have also been shown to have similar cuticle-specific effects in both C. elegans(14Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and B. malayi (22Merriweather A. Guenzler V. Brenner M. Unnasch T.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As P4H is involved in the synthesis of the nematode cuticle, it is therefore an excellent target for parasite control by chemical inhibition.The general structure and composition of the cuticle or exoskeleton are well conserved throughout the nematode phyla (17Page A.P. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes. CAB International, Publishing, Wallingford, Oxon, UK2001: 167-193Google Scholar). The cuticle is synthesized five times during development and is critical for many functions such as movement and protection from the environment. InC. elegans the structure of the cuticle has been studied in detail, demonstrating that despite overall similarity, cuticles from each developmental stage are chemically and structurally distinct (36Cox G.N. Staprans S. Edgar R.S. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 456-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Following the completion of embryonic elongation the cuticle of the unhatched first larval stage maintains the elongated form of the worm (18Priess J.R. Hirsh D.I. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A weakened or malformed cuticle may cause altered body morphology in viable worms, or in some cases, as in the combined disruption of the P4H α subunit encoding genes phy-1 and phy-2 inC. elegans, the resulting cuticle is too weak for survival (15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cuticle is composed predominantly of collagen, and more than 150 cuticular collagen genes are present in the C. elegans genome (37Johnstone I.L. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similar large gene families are likewise present in parasitic nematodes (17Page A.P. Kennedy M.W. Harnett W. Parasitic Nematodes. CAB International, Publishing, Wallingford, Oxon, UK2001: 167-193Google Scholar), and a representative cuticular collagen, COL-2 (38Scott A.L. Yenbutr P. Eisinger S.W. Raghavan N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), has been cloned from B. malayi. The size of B. malayi COL-2 (33 kDa) is similar to the smallC. elegans collagens (26–35 kDa) and shows overall amino acid sequence similarity to the C. elegans cuticle collagens. A comparison at the amino acid level reveals 46% identity to the C. elegans group 2 (37Johnstone I.L. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) collagen, T07H6.3. Precise positioning of the cysteine residues, which are required for registering and stabilizing the collagen triple helix, is likewise conserved between the B. malayi COL-2 and the C. elegans group 2 collagens. We propose that B. malayiPHY-1 may function to modify cuticular collagens such as B. malayi COL-2, a process that in C. elegans is an essential feature of development.B. malayi PHY-1 is unusual among the metazoan P4Hs in that it is a soluble and active P4H in the absence of a PDI subunit. The function of PDI subunits in the vertebrate and D. melanogaster P4Hs, and in the C. elegans P4Hs that are involved in the synthesis of cuticle collagens, is to keep the α, or PHY, subunits in a catalytically active, nonaggregated conformation and to maintain the enzyme within the ER (10John D.C.A. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Active soluble monomeric P4Hs have been cloned and characterized from the Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus-1 (39Eriksson M. Myllyharju J., Tu, H. Hellman M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22131-22134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis thaliana(40Hieta R. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23965-23971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and partially purified from algae (41Kaska D.D. Myllylä R. Gunzler V. Gibor A. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the C. elegans PHY-3, which is involved in the hydroxylation of collagens in early embryos, acts as a monomeric P4H (42Riihimaa P. Nissi R. Page A.P. Winter A.D. Keskiaho K. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18238-18243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recently identified P4Hs that hydroxylate the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIFα are monomeric cytoplasmic enzymes (43Epstein A.C.R. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2696) Google Scholar, 44Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PHY-1 from the related parasiteO. volvulus may require a PDI subunit to form an active P4H, but neither subunit contains a recognizable ER retention signal (22Merriweather A. Guenzler V. Brenner M. Unnasch T.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,45Wilson W.R. Tuan R.S. Shepley K.J. Freedman D.O. Greene B.M. Awadzi K. Unnasch T.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 103-11746Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These unusual parasite P4Hs and the unique C. elegansP4H forms suggest that nematodes have evolved specialized forms of these enzymes, possibly in order to process the large number of collagens required to form the cuticular extracellular matrix.When recombinant B. malayi PHY-1 was coexpressed in insect cells with PDI from other organisms, no detectable association of the polypeptides was observed. In contrast, the C. elegans PHY-1 and the Drosophila and vertebrate α subunits have been shown to assemble into an active P4H with PDIs from other species (5Annunen P. Koivunen P. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6790-6796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,7Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Vuori K. MacNeil I.A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Veijola J. Koivunen P. Annunen P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26746-26753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the recombinant C. elegans PHY-2 with PDI-2 is very inefficient, and only when it is coexpressed withC. elegans PHY-1 and PDI-2 does it assemble into a fully active, mixed tetramer (14Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, although the recombinant B. malayi PHY-1 can function as an active P4H by itself, it may assemble with additional, as yet unidentified assembly partners.The B. malayi phy-1 expression constructs under the control of the C. elegans phy-1 promoter were not able to rescue theC. elegans phy-1 null (dpy-18(e364)) mutant phenotype. A similar approach, however, has been successfully applied in the rescue of the same mutant strain with a wild type copy of the endogenous gene (15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 A). The inability of theB. malayi PHY-1 to functionally compensate for the lack ofC. elegans PHY-1 could be attributable to a number of causes such as low expression levels, differences in codon usage, missplicing of introns, or low activity of the transgenic protein. Alternatively, although the recombinant B. malayi PHY-1 was shown to be an active P4H by itself, it may have higher activity in vivowhen assembled with an as yet unidentified partner. In support of this contention, the C. elegans PDI-2 does not associate with theB. malayi PHY-1 in a recombinant insect cell expression system (Fig. 4 D). Thus, if additional subunits are needed for B. malayi PHY-1 to rescue dpy-18, these could not be provided by C. elegans. We plan to address this possibility following the completion of sequencing the B. malayi genome, when all possible partners can be assessed for associations with B. malayi PHY-1. Heterologous rescue ofC. elegans mutants by B. malayi genes has not been described to date, but C. elegans rescue has been obtained with genes from the more closely related parasitic nematodeHaemonchus contortus (46Britton C. Murray L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Using a system similar to that employed in our study, the embryonic lethal phenotype resulting from the lack of a cathepsin L protease in C. elegans was rescued by transformation with a homologous gene from H. contortus (46Britton C. Murray L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), demonstrating the conservation of the essential developmental function of these two genes in different species. Amino acid sequence identity of mature cathepsin L proteases between C. elegans and H. contortus is 87%, which is significantly higher than the 59% identity found between PHY-1 polypeptides from C. elegans and B. malayi. The lower identity reflects the more distant evolutionary relationship between the latter pair of nematodes.The B. malayi phy-1 promoter is capable of directing tissue-specific expression in C. elegans to the cuticle-synthesizing hypodermis, a location that is consistent with the proposed function of its gene product. Appropriate tissue-specific expression of reporter genes in C. elegans has been described for promoters from a number of genes from related parasitic nematodes (47Krause S. Sommer A. Fischer P. Brophy P.M. Walter R.D. Liebau E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 48Qin L. Smant G. Stokkermans J. Bakker J. Schots A. Helder J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 49Britton C. Redmond D.L. Knox D.P. McKerrow J.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although to date, none have been described fromB. malayi. Our present study therefore confirms thatC. elegans represents an excellent heterologous system for the analysis of gene expression in the filarial nematodes. Although the native localization of PHY-1 in B. malayi is not known, its function as a P4H, taken together with data from reporter gene studies of the homologous genes from C. elegans (and the reporter gene studies reported here), would predict a hypodermal localization for B. malayi phy-1 expression, which is consistent with a role in cuticle collagen modification. The secondary staining of muscle cells and vulval cells is also identical to that found for theC. elegans homologues phy-1 and phy-2, which are both expressed in vulval cells with additional muscle cell staining found for phy-2 (15Winter A.D. Page A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Like the C. elegans homologues, the B. malayi phy-1 transcript was strongly expressed throughout larval development, with the greatest peaks of abundance consistent with a role in the molting cycle and cuticle synthesis.The essential nature of P4H in development and body morphology inC. elegans has been demonstrated both by genetic and RNA interference analyses and by chemical inhibition studies. The extrapolation of the knowledge gained in C. elegans and other species along with the emerging use of C. elegans as a surrogate system for expression of foreign proteins provide powerful approaches to the further characterization of parasite P4Hs and the assessment of their potential as targets for chemical control. Biosynthesis of vertebrate collagens requires processing by up to eight specific intra- and extracellular posttranslational enzymes (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H)1 class of enzymes (EC1.14.11.2) catalyze the hydroxylation of prolines in theX-Pro-Gly repeats of collagen chains. This endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident enzyme is central to collagen synthesis, as collagen triple helices are thermally unstable in the absence of 4-hydroxyproline residues (2Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 325-400PubMed Google Scholar). P4H also acts as a chaperone in the assembly of collagen ensuring that only correctly folded collagens are released for secretion (4Walmsley A.R. Batten M.R. Lad U. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14884-14892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In vertebrates and Drosophila melanogaster the enzyme is an α2β2tetramer (2Kivirikko K.I.

In the present study G146A and G146V mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis in order to investigate the function played by this conserved residue in folding and stability of hGSTP1-1. Crystallographic analysis of the G146V variant, expressed at the permissive temperature of 25 °C, indicates that the mutation causes a substantial change of the backbone conformation because of steric hindrance. Stability measurements indicate that this mutant is inactivated at a temperature as low as 32 °C.

Most of our knowledge on protein folding derives from studies on small monomeric proteins. However, the majority of native proteins are more complex structures, composed of several subunits that in turn consist of domains. The extrapolation of results obtained in the study of small proteins to larger ones is not always appropriate, and it is therefore important to investigate proteins composed of more than one subunit. Human glutathione transferase P1-1 (hGSTP1-1),1 a homodimeric enzyme and thus representing the simplest type of oligomeric structure, has been the subject of recent studies on protein folding (1Aceto A.

The aim of these investigations was to identify sequence patterns of importance to folding kinetics and/or structure of the final native state. hGSTP1-1 is a Pi class member of a multifunctional superfamily of enzymes, the GSTs. The role of GSTs is considered to be the detoxication of a large number of hydrophobic compounds by catalyzing the conjugation to glutathione (GSH) and thus increase their water solubility (4Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). The cytosolic GSTs have been grouped into a number of different evolutionary classes denoted by the names of Greek letters such as Alpha, Mu, Pi, and so on (4Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar, 5Mannervik B. Ålin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The classification was originally based on primary structure similarities, substrate specificities, and immunologic properties (5Mannervik B. Ålin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), but sequence similarities are currently the overriding criterion. The mass of the dimeric GSTs is ∼50 kDa, and subunits within the same class can combine to form either homo- or heterodimers (6Mannervik B. Jensson H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9909-9912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit contains an active site, and two domains form the subunit. The smaller N-terminal domain (domain I) adopts an α/β topology and provides most of the contacts with GSH. The larger C-terminal domain (domain II) is completely helical and contains most of the residues that form the hydrophobic binding site (10Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O.

Alignment of all known GST structures (more than 100) shows that only 6–7 residues, which is less than 5% of the entire polypeptide chain, are strictly conserved. Despite this limited sequence similarity, all GSTs adopt the same native fold. GST structure analysis with special emphasis on the few conserved residues led to the identification of two local structural motifs in a characteristic position, the N-terminal region of the α6-helix (1Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M., Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1373-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous investigations demonstrated that single mutations of residues forming the capping box ((S/T)XXD) and the hydrophobic staple motifs have a dramatic effect on the protein stability (1Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M., Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Dragani B. Stenberg G. Melino S. Petruzzelli R.

The same amino acid substitutions also have significant effects on protein folding, generating temperature-sensitive folding mutants unable to refold at the physiological temperature 37 °C (1Aceto A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10421-10428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutations corresponding to those made in hGSTP1-1 have also been constructed in hGSTA1-1, a member of the Alpha class showing 31.6% sequence identity with hGSTP1-1 (21Cocco R. Stenberg G. Dragani B. Rossi Principe D. Paludi D. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32177-32183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results obtained were in accordance with those found for hGSTP1-1, further emphasizing that the highly conserved N-capping box and hydrophobic staple motifs play critical and universal roles in GST folding and stability. The α6-helix and preceding loop form a substructure, named GST motif II, which is conserved in the core of all GSTs and related proteins. The analysis of the protein crystal structure indicates that GST motif II is stabilized by a buried network of eight hydrogen bonds, half of which involve water-mediated contacts (23Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Parker M.W. Stenberg G. Mannervik B. Dragani B. Cocco R. Aceto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of the capping mutants, expressed at the permissive temperature of 25 °C, indicated that these amino acid substitutions locally destabilize GST motif II through a partial or complete loss of the hydrogen bond network (23Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Parker M.W. Stenberg G. Mannervik B. Dragani B. Cocco R. Aceto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All these results indicate that a local destabilization of GST motif II has a critical effect on the overall protein stability and strongly support the hypothesis that this buried region might be involved in the nucleation mechanism of protein folding. A strictly conserved glycine residue, Gly-146, in hGSTP1-1 is located four residues before Ser or Thr of the Ncap motif in all known GSTs (1Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M., Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In particular Gly-146 is part of a buried local sequence GXXh(T/S)XXDh (X is any residue and h is a hydrophobic residue), which is maintained in all GSTs and, as a more general folding module, in other proteins such as EF1γ and URE2. Its role has until now remained unexplored. This amino acid residue is located in a bend of the long loop preceding the α6-helix and does not make any specific contacts with other structural parts of the molecule but only with neighboring residues in the polypeptide. Its strict conservation through evolution implicates the absolute necessity of a small amino acid residue in this position. The present investigation addresses the function of the strictly conserved Gly-146 in folding, and its significance for structural stability. By a combination of protein engineering and x-ray structure-function analysis we have obtained evidence that Gly-146 is part of a conserved folding module. As a universal motif it plays a critical role in the refolding and stability of all GSTs and, probably, of other structurally related proteins such as EF1γ and URE2. Wild-type human GSTP1-1 was obtained by expression of a cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described (24Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) were purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotides and dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate single-point mutants. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-CC TTC ATT GTG A/GC/TA GAC CAG-3′ and 5′-TCT TGC CTC CCT GGT TCT G-3′. The altered codon is underlined. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated and then used in inverted polymerase chain reaction. The expression clone pKHP1 (24Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The polymerase chain reaction mixture contained 0.8 μm each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); the buffer supplied with the enzyme and various amounts of DNA template. The temperature program started at 94 °C for 10 min and was followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 9 min. The program terminated with a reaction at 72 °C for 30 min. After electrophoresis the DNA product from the reaction was recovered from the agarose gel. The DNA was ligated and used for transformation of competent E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. The cDNAs encoding the isolated GSTP1-1 mutants were sequenced in their entirety to verify that no undesired mutations had been introduced in the polymerase chain reaction. Cultures of E. coli XL-1 Blue-containing plasmids were grown in 300 ml of LB broth in a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask at 37 °C. At an OD555 of 0.35, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. From the time of addition the culture was grown for about 20 h at 25 or 37 °C. The subsequent purification of wild-type and mutant proteins was performed as described previously (24Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the only modification that the enzymes were purified on a GSH-Sepharose affinity column (25Aceto A. Caccuri A.M. Sacchetta P. Bucciarelli T. Dragani B. Rosato N. Federici G. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters,k cat and K m, were determined at 25 °C as previously described (26Aceto A., Di Ilio C., Lo Bello M. Bucciarelli T. Angelucci S. Federici G. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 2267-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentrations of GSH and CDNB were 2 and 1 mm, respectively. Spectroscopic properties of the mutants and the wild-type enzyme were also studied. A Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter was used for CD measurements in the far-ultraviolet region from 200 to 250 nm. Spectra were recorded using a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml with cuvettes of 0.1 cm path length in a thermostat-controlled cell holder. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a Spex (model Fluoromax) spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm and the λmax and all emission spectra were analyzed at the same protein concentration (0.1 mg/ml). Enzyme was incubated at each temperature for 10 min at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 0.01m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmEDTA and 5 mm dithiothreitol to prevent oxidative inactivation. The enzyme was heat-inactivated in sealed Eppendorf tubes, and the temperature was monitored with a Cryson telethermometer. The inactivation time courses were determined by withdrawing suitable aliquots at different time points from the denaturation mixture for assay of remaining activity. The activity was assayed in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) with 2 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB at 25 °C. Lowering the temperature of incubation could not reverse the thermal inactivation for any of the proteins. The denaturation of the wild-type and glycine mutants was monitored at different temperatures. The enzymes were incubated in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and their activity was monitored for 120 min taking the first value as 100% native protein. An equation describing a single exponential decay with a rate constant of thermal unfolding k u was fitted to the data according to Equation 1. −ln(%native/100%)=kutEquation 1 The free energy of activation of thermal unfolding (ΔG u) was calculated according to Eyring theory (27Johnson F.H. Eyring H. Polissar M.J. The Kinetic Basis of Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1954Google Scholar) as Equation 2,lnku=lnKkbTh−ΔGuRTEquation 2 where kb is the Boltzmann constant; T, the absolute temperature in Kelvin; h, Plank's constant; R, the gas constant; and K is the transmission factor, which was set to unity. The difference of free energy of activation of thermal denaturation between wild-type and each mutant protein (ΔΔG u) was calculated according to Equation3.ΔΔGu=ΔGu,wt−ΔGu,mut=−RT ln(ku,wt/ku,mut)Equation 3 Substitution of Equation 4,ΔGu=ΔHu−TΔSuEquation 4 into Equation 2 yields Equation 5.lnkuT=lnKkbh−ΔHuR1T+ΔSuREquation 5 Both activation enthalpy ΔH u and entropy ΔS u were determined from the temperature dependence of k u. When the refolding of human GSTP1-1 and its mutants was to be monitored, 10 μm enzyme was first denatured in 4 m guanidinium chloride (0.2 mpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.0) at 25, 33, and 40 °C for 30 min and then diluted (defining time 0) 1:40 into renaturation buffer (0.2m potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0) at the same temperature. The final guanidinium chloride concentration was 0.1 m during refolding. All refolding experiments were carried out by rapid addition of the denatured enzyme to renaturation buffer. Activity recovered as a function of time was monitored by withdrawal of appropriate aliquots of the renaturation mixture followed immediately by dilution into 2.0 ml of assay buffer. The kinetic parameters of refolding were determined by non-linear regression analysis by fitting equations with one or two exponentials to the experimental data using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.5 program (Abelbek Software). The values reported in this study represent the means of at least three different experimental data sets. The influence of concentration on folding was analyzed by refolding the wild-type and Gly-146 mutants as described in the previous section. Six different protein concentrations were used for denaturation ranging from 0.2 to 6.0 mg/ml. Refolding was monitored as described above by assaying for recovered activity after 2 h. A second dilution during refolding was performed at different time points after the initiation of reactivation. Enzymes at an optimized concentration (1 mg/ml) were denatured and allowed to start to refold as described above. After 1 min (wild-type) and after 5 and 20 min (all enzymes), the refolding mixture was diluted 10-fold and analyzed for reactivation by measuring increase of activity with time. Coordinates of GST x-ray structures were derived from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/) via the anonymous file-transfer protocol. The crystal structures were analyzed by using Hyperchem (Autodesk, Sausalito, CA) and MolView 1.4.6 (Purdue University) programs. The figures were generated using the RasMol (version 2.6) program. A PHI-BLAST (28Zhang Z. Schäffer A.A. Miller W. Madden T.L. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/psiblast.cgi) search was performed using the BLOSUM62 matrix. The pattern used as a query was GX(2)-[LIVY]-[ST]-X(2)-[D]-[LYIVA] and the threshold value was set to 0.001. Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described elsewhere (29Oakley A.J., Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2-μl drop of a protein solution containing the GST mutant (4.2 mg/ml for G146V, 2 mg/ml for G146A) in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution, which consisted of 15–25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 20 mm CaCl2, 1 mm GSH, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm MES buffer (pH range 5.2–5.8). All trials were carried out at a constant temperature of 22 °C. Crystals took between 3 and 5 days to appear and grew to their final size within 2 weeks. The x-ray diffraction data were collected using a MARResearch area detector with CuKα X-rays generated by a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode x-ray generator. The data were collected at 100 K. The diffraction data were processed and analyzed using programs in the HKL (30Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993Google Scholar) and CCP4 suites (31CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 750-763Google Scholar). The G146A and G146V mutants crystallized in the same space group and cell as wild type. For both mutants the refinement began with wild-type Pi class GST in the C2 space group (10GS; Ref. 29Oakley A.J., Lo Bello M. Battistoni A. Ricci G. Rossjohn J. Villar H.O. Parker M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that had inhibitor and water molecules omitted. In addition residues between 144 and 150 in each monomer were removed from the starting model. Rigid body refinement in CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar) was used to compensate for any possible changes in crystal packing. As the asymmetric unit of the crystal contained two GST monomers, use was made of the non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints on all non-hydrogen atoms throughout the course of the positional refinements. The 2F obs − F calc map of the G146A mutant showed clear and continuous density for residues between 144 and 150 that had been omitted from the search model. These residues were then built into the map. Among the significant features in the subsequent F obs − F calcmap were positive peaks (close to 4× the r.m.s. error of the map) within 2 Å of the Cα of Gly-146, thus confirming the mutation. The residue at position 146 was changed from glycine to alanine and the model refined. The 2F obs −F calc and F obs −F calc maps of the G146V mutant clearly indicated a change in the backbone conformation of the region between residues 144 and 146. After the backbone alterations were made, there was additional density next to the Cα position of residue 146 sufficient to accommodate a valine side-chain (close to 3× the r.m.s. error of the F obs − F calc map), and hence the glycine residue was changed to a valine residue. These residues were then built into the map of the G146V mutant. For both mutants, a number of rounds of positional refinement were performed followed by model building and then by rounds of positional and individual NCS-restrained B-factor refinement. In the final stages of refinement a bulk solvent correction was employed. The correctness of the final structures in the regions around the mutation were confirmed by calculating omit maps between residues 144 and 148. A stereochemical analysis of the refined structure with the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) gave values either similar or better than expected for structures refined at similar resolutions. The coordinates for the G146A and G146V models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers1MD3 and 1MD4, respectively. To investigate the role of the buried and conserved glycine residue (Gly-146, in hGSTP1-1) this amino acid was replaced with alanine and valine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis producing the mutants G146A and G146V. Mutant and wild-type enzymes were expressed in E. coli XL-1 Blue and purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized GSH. The purified enzymes gave a single band on SDS-PAGE (not shown). 65–90% of the total activity was recovered showing that the affinity for GSH-Sepharose was essentially unaffected by the mutations. Considering that the above substitutions could represent temperature-sensitive mutations, protein expression was performed both at 25 and 37 °C of host cell growth. No dependence of protein yield on temperature could be observed (not shown). The yields of the G146A and G146V mutants, in percentage of total cytosolic proteins, were 2.4 and 1.7% respectively after purification, both slightly lower than that (4.0%) of the wild-type enzyme. Table Isummarizes the kinetic parameters for the conjugation of CDNB to GSH catalyzed by the wild-type hGSTP1-1 and Gly-146 mutants. The replacement of Gly-146 with either alanine or valine significantly increases the k cat values of the corresponding mutants as compared with that of the parental enzyme. TheK m values of the mutants were 1.5–2-fold higher for both substrates than those of the wild type. This suggests that the above substitutions slightly but significantly decrease the affinity for GSH and CDNB in both mutants. The physical properties of the Gly-146 mutants and the wild-type enzyme were very similar. The far-UV CD spectra as well as their gel filtration retention times (not shown) were the same, suggesting that all enzyme variants are, in terms of secondary structure and dimeric state of the molecule, essentially identical. The λmax values of the intrinsic fluorescence spectra were 338, 338, and 339 nm for the wild-type enzyme and the G146V and G146A mutants, respectively (not shown), suggesting that a similar polarity characterizes the environment of the tryptophan residues of all enzyme variants. The normalized intensities of the fluorescence of the mutants were slightly higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. This indicates that limited conformational changes distinguish the final structure of the mutants from that of the parent enzyme. These differences involve the environment of one or both tryptophan residues located in GST domain I, far from the mutation site.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type and glycine mutants of hGSTP1-1 heterologously expressed at 25 °C in E. coliSpecific activityk catCDNBK mGSHK mCDNBk cat/K mCDNBunits/mgs −1mmmms −1 mm −1Wild-type35 ± 534 ± 20.15 ± 0.020.94 ± 0.136G146A43 ± 688 ± 40.31 ± 0.021.81 ± 0.0149G146V85 ± 755 ± 40.25 ± 0.041.65 ± 0.1833 Open table in a new tab The structure of helix α6 and the preceding loop is well defined in the wild-type 1.9 Å resolution electron density maps (29Oakley A.J., Lo Bello M.

Clostridial GDH resisted proteolysis by any of these enzymes at 25 °C. Above 30 °C, however, GDH became cleavable by chymotrypsin, apparently at a single site. SDS-PAGE indicated the formation of one large fragment with a molecular mass of ∼44 kDa and one small one of <10 kDa. Proteolysis was accompanied by the loss of enzyme activity, which outran peptide cleavage, suggesting a cooperative conformational change. Proteolysis was prevented by either of the substrates 2-oxoglutarate or l-glutamate but not by the coenzymes NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the protective effects of these ligands resulted from fixation of flexible regions of the native structure of the enzyme. Size-exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE studies of chymotrypsin-treated GDH showed that the enzyme retained its hexameric structure and all of its proteolytic fragments. However, circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation showed global conformational changes affecting the overall compactness of the protein structure. Chymotrypsin-catalyzed cleavage also diminished the thermostability of GDH and the cooperativity of the transition between its native and denatured states. N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry showed that heat-induced sensitivity to chymotrypsin emerged in the loop formed by residues 390–393 that lies between helices α<sub>15</sub> and α<sub>16</sub> in the folded structure of the enzyme."

A functional motif in the kinase domain of mouse SK, designated the BM-motif (86LDGDNhRxhh(N/S)(K/R)97), was defined in the course of identifying the brachymorphic (bm) defect. Sequence comparison and the secondary structure predicted for APS kinase suggest that the BM-motif consists of a DGD-turn sequence flanked by other conserved residues.

Two switch mutations, LD86DL and DN89ND, designed to test the positional constraints of Asp87 and Asp89, exhibited complete loss of both kinase and overall activities, while LD86DL also exhibited a significant (60%) loss of reverse sulfurylase activity, suggesting that this peptide region is interacting with the sulfurylase domain as well as functioning in the kinase reaction.

The synthesis of PAPS is catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme PAPS synthetase in higher organisms. PAPS synthetase consists of two activities, ATP sulfurylase, which catalyzes synthesis of adenosine phosphosulfate (APS) from ATP and SO42− and APS kinase, which phosphorylates APS in the presence of another molecule of ATP to form PAPS.ATP+SO4−2→APS+PPiEquation 1 APS+ATP→PAPS+ADPAn animal model with reduced sulfation, the brachymorphic (bm) mouse, was initially identified by Sugahara and Schwartz (2Sugahara K.

Murine brachymorphism is a severe growth disorder, affecting the skeletal elements as well as certain physiological processes like blood clotting (5Rusiniak M.E. O'Brien E.P. Novak E.K. Barone S.M.

Biochemical analysis showed that brachymorphic cartilage contains normal levels of glycosaminoglycans but has disaccharides that are significantly under-sulfated. The reduced incorporation of sulfate into brachymorphic cartilage is associated with limited PAPS availability largely due to a reduction in APS-kinase activity (2Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Yamakawa T. Oswa T. Handa S. Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Glycoconjugate. Science Society Press, Tokyo, Japan1982: 493-495Google Scholar, 4Lyle S. Stanzak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The initial cloning of a bifunctional PAPS synthetase (SK1) did not identify the underlying etiology of the brachymorphic phenotype, thus prompting the subsequent elucidation of a second isoform (SK2) encoded by a separate gene (7Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger R.C., Jr. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of wild-type and bm SK2 cDNAs revealed that a G to A mutation in the bm allele changes a glycine to an arginine residue (G79R) in the APS-kinase domain of the bifunctional enzyme. Bacterially expressed recombinant normal SK2 protein catalyzes both the ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase reactions and synthesizes PAPS comparably to SK1. In contrast, recombinant SK2 protein containing the G79R mutation had no APS-kinase activity while maintaining its ATP sulfurylase activity. This study provided the first indication that the peptide region in the vicinity of residue 79 in SK2 may also be important for PAPS synthesis. Amino acid sequence alignment of various monofunctional ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase enzymes from lower organisms and plants and bifunctional enzymes from animals revealed the presence of several highly conserved regions (8Li H.

Similarly, sequence conservation around the bm mutation site (Gly79) is very high; however, no function had been established for this region. Based on the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1, the proposed consensus sequence of the region around Gly79, called the BM-motif, is LDGDNhRxhh(N/S)(R/K), whereh is a hydrophobic residue and x is a non-conserved residue. The available monofunctional fungal APS kinase structure (12MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) shows that the homologous region in the fungal enzyme consists of a β-strand (residues 56–60) and an α-helix (residues 62–68), with Asp61 present between these two peptide structures. Although MacRae et al. were unable to crystallize the APS kinase (12MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with bound ATP or APS, comparisons with substrate-bound structures of guanylate kinase (13Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Thus, to explore the functional significance of the BM-motif in the bifunctional PAPS synthetases, we carried out conformational and mutational analyses of the conserved residues, addressing:i) the importance of the BM-motif glycine, andii) the role of other highly conserved residues around the BM-motif glycine. Our previous extensive mutational analyses (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Deyrup A.T. Singh B. Krishnan S. Lyle S. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were performed on the SK1 isoform protein, thus SK1 was used for functional analysis of the BM-motif (residues Leu86–Lys97). Site-directed mutations in SK1 cDNA were generated by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides. Briefly, in a ProEx plasmid obtained from a ProEx/SK1 construct, two unique restriction enzyme sites, Bsm1 and Bsu36I, flanking the BM-motif were used to remove the normal cDNA sequence and to ligate in the mutated BM-motif. The mutational inserts altering the BM-motif also contained an engineered translationally silent restriction site, AvrII, which is not present in the original ProEx/SK1 cDNA construct. Making use of theAvrII site, the colonies containing the mutated BM-motif constructs were identified by double digestion of plasmid DNA withAvrII and XhoI; positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing. BL21 DE3 (codon plus) from cells transformed with normal or mutated plasmid constructs were grown in LB/ampicillin/chloamphenicol liquid culture at 37 °C to an A 600 of 1.0. Following induction with 0.1m isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside for 4 h, the cultures were centrifuged at 9000 × g for 8 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 4 volumes of 50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (freshly prepared), pH 8.5 at 4 °C. The suspension was sonicated, the cellular debris removed by ultracentrifugation at 15,000 × g, the supernatant loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin column. The column was then washed with 7 column volumes of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5 at 4 °C), 7 column volumes of Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5 at 4 °C), and again with 7 column volumes of Buffer A. Protein was eluted with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 200 mm imidazole, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5 at 4 °C). The eluted protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8, buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. The concentration of protein used in fluorescence experiments was ∼200 μg/ml. To eliminate condensation of moisture on the fluorescence sample cell, the experiments were performed at 10 °C. Tryptophan fluorescence emission was recorded in the 305–400 nm range with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Substrate binding experiments were performed at the peak emission wavelength for each substrate (342 nm for LAPSK2 and 338 nm for BM-LAPSK2). Buffer fluorescence was subtracted from sample fluorescence before determining binding constants. The purified recombinant protein was assayed for reverse ATP sulfurylase, APS kinase, and overall PAPS synthetase activities using protocols as described earlier (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All assays were performed at least three times; data are presented as the average of individual results. For low activity mutants, a higher stock concentration of protein (400 μg/ml) was tested to differentiate the specific activities. To investigate the impact of the bm mutation on structural and substrate-binding properties of the kinase domain, fluorescence intensity experiments, which are highly sensitive to the molecular environment of tryptophan residues and allow conformational changes due to substrate binding to be detected directly, were performed. However, since there are 11 and 10 tryptophans in SK1 and SK2, respectively, and two/three substrate binding pockets, it is possible that an increase in fluorescence in one portion of the protein may mask a decrease in fluorescence from another portion resulting in no net change in signal, or that the obtained fluorescence signal may be difficult to de-convolute for the bifunctional protein. Thus, the expressed kinase domains of SK1 (LAPSK1, with two tryptophans) and SK2 (LAPSK2, with only one tryptophan), as well as BM-LAPSK2, the kinase domain of SK2 with bm mutation (G79R), were used for these studies. Buffer-subtracted fluorescence of the three proteins is shown in Fig. 2. Expectedly, LAPSK1, which contains two tryptophans, exhibited higher fluorescence intensity compared with LAPSK2, which contains only one. However, it was surprising that BM-LAPSK2 exhibited 60% loss of fluorescence intensity compared with LAPSK2, thus indicating that i) Trp47 in LAPSK2 is conformationally coupled to Gly79 and ii) there is significant structural change in the kinase domain due to the bm mutation. To assess the effect of the bm mutation on substrate binding, the binding constants for ATP and APS were determined for LAPSK2 and BM-LAPSK2. From the binding curves shown for LAPSK2 (Fig. 3, A and B)K D(ATP) was determined to be 0.3 μm and K D(APS) was 0.13 μm., while for BM-LAPSK2 (Fig. 3, C andD) K D(ATP) was 28.5 μm and K D(APS) was 5.4 μm, suggesting that BM-LAPSK2 binds both ATP and APS poorly. Thus, a decrease in substrate binding caused by the bm mutation may account for the loss of kinase and overall activities in BM-SK2.Figure 3Substrate binding experiments for LAPSK2 and BM-LAPSK2.

Mutations of the DGD-turn residues included D87A, D87R, D87E, G88A, G88R, G88D, D89A, D89R, and D89E, designed to investigate structural aspects (i.e. glycine as a flexible amino acid) as well as charge requirements (i.e. negative charge due to aspartic acid residues). Activity data for wild-type SK1 and the mutant enzymes are presented in Tables I andII.Table IDGD-loop mutantsConstructReverse sulfurylase activityKinase activityOverall activityAPSPAPSμmol ATP/min/mgpmol PAPS/min/mgnmol/min/mgSK11.13298.070.5338.40G88A1.26204.630.8329.04G88R1.3113.822.730.21G88D1.2613.152.600.11D87A1.2420.702.200.24D87R1.345.842.270.27D87E1.4955.032.180.84D89A1.3312.523.000.22D89R1.5314.872.780.15D89E1.3668.961.793.57 Open table in a new tab Table IISwitch mutants and other conserved residue mutantsConstructReverse sulfurylase activityKinase activityOverall activityAPSPAPSμmol ATP/min/mgpmol PAPS/min/mgnmol/min/mgSK11.13298.070.5338.4LD86DL0.3815.682.751.90DN89ND1.115.752.610.33N90A1.11198.170.9526.28N90Q1.21205.800.8024.42R92A1.242.683.070.42K97A1.13243.000.5141.21 Open table in a new tab Although G88A exhibited reverse sulfurylase activity comparable to wild-type, overall (75%) and kinase (69%) residual activities were reduced, suggesting that a flexible amino acid at residue 88 is required for optimal kinase activity. G88R, a mutation analogous to that in the brachymorphic mouse, was designed to test whether SK1 behaves similarly to SK2. As observed for the naturally occurring bm mutation in SK2, the G88R mutation in SK1 leads to complete loss of overall (0.5%) and kinase (4.6%) activities. The relative overall activity of G88D, designed to test the negative charge requirement for the turn region, was reduced to 0.2% and kinase activity to 4.4%. In reverse sulfurylase assays, both G88R and G88D showed activities comparable to wild type. N-terminal to the bm glycine, an aspartate analogous to residue Asp87 is strictly conserved among all the monofunctional APS kinases and bifunctional PAPS synthetases (Fig. 1 A). Based on the APS kinase crystal structure from Penicillium chrysogenum, MacRae et al. (12MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) predicted that a negative charge presented by Asp87 may help bind Mg2+, which in turn presents a positive charge to ATP/APS. Removal of the negative charge by mutating Asp87 to alanine resulted in decreased overall (0.6%) and kinase (6.7%) activities. Likewise, D87R, with the charge reversed, had an activity profile comparable D87A. D87E, which retains the negative charge but extends the side chain by one C–C bond (1.5 Å), was designed to test the tightness and the charge requirements of the substrate binding pocket. Unexpectedly, the relative overall activity for the charge-conserved mutation, D87E, was observed to be only 2.2%, while, there was a slight improvement in kinase activity (18%) compared with D87A or D87R. None of the Asp87 mutants exhibited any loss of reverse sulfurylase activity. Asp89, the residue C-terminal to the BM-motif glycine, is located at the N terminus of the α-helix that follows the DGD-turn, based on the crystal structure of APS kinase from P. chrysogenum (12MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the D89A and D89R mutant proteins both exhibited reverse sulfurylase activity comparable to that of wild-type SK1, they show <0.5% residual overall and <5% kinase activities, suggesting that the negative charge contributed by Asp89 is also essential for a functional APS kinase. Designed to assess the structural flexibility and residue stringency for this position, the D89E mutant showed an improvement in overall (9%) and kinase (23%) activities relative to D89A and D89R, but still indicates a size restriction in this position. To determine whether there is functional restriction on the location of the aspartates, a set of residue-order switch mutations, LD86DL and DN89ND, were designed in which the critical aspartates were moved one residue further away from the DGD-turn on either the N-terminal or C-terminal side of the central glycine. The residual overall (4.9%) and kinase (5.3%) activities of the LD86DL protein suggest that not only is the presence of aspartate necessary for activity, but that the active site is rigid and cannot easily adapt to an altered chemical and electrostatic environment by a shift in the position of the acidic residues. Surprisingly, LD86DL, although mutated in the kinase domain, also had a 60% loss of reverse sulfurylase activity, suggesting involvement of these residues in both the sulfurylase and kinase activities. When residues Asp89 and Asn90 were interchanged in DN89ND, complete loss of kinase (1.5%) and overall (0.9%) activities was observed, again indicating that the BM-motif is very rigid and that this alteration is detrimental to both exogenous and endogenous APS utilization. In contrast to LD86DL, the DN89ND protein maintained reverse sulfurylase activity comparable to wild type. The third set of mutants included N90A, N90Q, R92A, and K97A, which are highly conserved and are located near the C terminus of the DGD-turn (Fig. 1). Despite the strong conservation of Asn90 and its proximity to the DGD-loop, deletion of the side chain amide functionality in N90A resulted in 67% residual overall and kinase activities, N90Q tested whether substituting another amide-presenting side chain residue could prevent losses in overall or kinase activity. Interestingly, the residual overall (64%) and kinase (69%) activities were similar to those for N90A with retention of reverse sulfurylase activity comparable to that of wild-type SK1. In contrast, R92A exhibited complete loss of overall (1.1%) and kinase (0.9%) activities, while reverse sulfurylase activity was normal. Lastly, Lys97, which is also highly conserved and present in the loop following the α-helix (residue 88–94), exhibited all three activities comparable to those of wild-type SK1, suggesting that Lys97 is not essential in SK function. The BM-motif, which is comprised of a DGD-turn and flanking conserved residues, was initially identified through the mutation discovered in SK2 cDNA cloned from the brachymorphic mouse (7Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger R.C., Jr. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons show that the BM-motif is highly conserved among several bifunctional PAPS synthetases and monofunctional APS kinases. Analysis of the BM-motif by tryptophan fluorescence experiments provides the first evidence that the region in SK2 containing the bm mutation (G79R) is important for the structure of the protein and that alteration in conformation associated with the bm mutation accounts for the loss of kinase activity. Furthermore, substrate binding fluorescence experiments show that LAPSK2 exhibits tight binding to APS and ATP, while the bm mutation in LAPSK2 leads to significant reductions in ATP (100-fold) and APS (50-fold) binding, indicating that Gly79 is located in the vicinity of both the ATP and APS binding sites and that the peptide region around Gly79 is a critical component of the PAPS synthetase active site(s). A systematic mutagenesis analysis of the BM-motif showed that, as observed in mutant SK2 from the brachymorphic mouse, changing the SK1 DGD-turn glycine to arginine (G88R) produces a nearly inactive kinase and subsequent loss of overall activity (7Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger R.C., Jr. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Substitution of a positive charge at this position could result in displacement of the MgATP-magnesium or misalignment of the γ-phosphate of ATP, leading to either weaker or complete loss of ATP binding and thereby causing the observed decreases in kinase and overall activities. Even recombinant enzyme with a G88A substitution, which replaces a neutral, flexible amino acid with a neutral, good α-helix-forming residue, exhibited some reduction (30%) in overall and kinase activities, possibly due to an increase in rigidity of the active site via N-terminal extension of the α-helix that follows the DGD-turn, thus causing misalignment of critical aspartates around Gly88. Similar structural consequences may induce the activity loss observed for the G88R and G88D mutant enzymes, as both arginine and aspartic acid residues have higher α-helix propensities than glycine. Furthermore, while the presence of negatively charged residues is a requirement for DGD-turn function, the number and spacing of acidics is critically important since the G88D mutant exhibited a severe loss (0.2%) of overall activity. The results of multiple mutations at Asp87 and Asp89 strongly suggest an absolute requirement for both acidics. Furthermore, the low overall activity observed for glutamic acid substitutions at Asp87 and Asp89 indicate that the active site is not very flexible and that the correctly sized residue side chains are important for internal transfer of APS. These possibilities are partly supported by the findings of MacRaeet al. (12MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which predicted a role for Asp87 in ATP binding, while no such role was predicted for Asp89. However, structural comparison of P. chrysogenum APS kinase with substrate-bound structures of guanylate kinase (13Stehle T. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and 6-phosophofructo-2-kinase (14Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) suggest that APS is placed between the P-loop, FISP-motif, and the α-helix C-terminal of the DGD-loop. Furthermore, during the course of our functional analysis of the BM-motif, MacRae et al. crystallized P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase in the presence of APS (15MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and showed that APS was bound to the sulfurylase active site as well as to the C-terminal kinase-like regulatory domain. As we predicted, this crystal structure shows residue Asp434, analogous to Asp89 in SK1, interacting with the 3′-OH of APS, thereby aiding in proper alignment of APS for phosphoryl transfer. Thus, Asp89 may be participating in internal transfer and reactive alignment of endogenously generated APS in the kinase active site, whereas Asp87 may be involved in the ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer step of the kinase reaction. As mentioned, monofunctional ATP sulfurylases of P. chrysogenum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain inactive C-terminal APS-kinase-like regulatory domains (Fig. 1 B); however, the kinase DGD-loop is replaced by LGD-loop in these sulfurylase regulatory domains. In addition to the presence of a leucine at residue 432 (analogous to Asp87 in SK1), the P-loop in the kinase-like domain is changed from GLSASGKS to GYMNSGKD. Independent studies of bifunctional SK1 (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and monofunctional APS kinase (16MacRae I.J. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that a single mutation in the key residues of the P-loop is sufficient to inactivate the kinase. Loss of kinase activity in our D87A mutant supports the hypothesis put forward by MacRae et al. (15MacRae I.J. Segel I.H. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6795-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16MacRae I.J. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that lack of APS kinase activity in the ATP sulfurylase regulatory domain is due both to the altered P-loop and the absence of an aspartate at residue 432. Additional conserved residues, C-terminal to the DGD-turn, also contribute to PAPS synthetase activity. Based on the P. chrysogenum APS kinase structure, Asn90 is expected to be present on the face opposite the substrate binding pocket, Arg92 is on the substrate binding face of the α-helix, and Lys97 on the loop following the α-helix. Equal and low (30%) residual activity for N90A and N90Q suggests that Asn90 may be playing a structural role via interactions with other residues present on the non-substrate binding face of the α-helix to allow the correct orientation of critical residues on the substrate binding face. The presence of Arg92 on the substrate binding face and a near-complete loss of the overall and kinase activities for R92A suggest that it could be participating in the binding of APS or in the alignment of Asp89 via a salt bridge. In fact, the crystal structure of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase, which shows that one of the specific interactions between APS and the allosteric domain is a bidentate salt linkage between the guanidino head of Arg437 and the phosphosulfate moiety of APS, confirms our prediction that Arg92 is binding to APS. In our previous study of the P-loop (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) we showed that mutation of the kinase domain residue Gly59 to alanine disrupted sulfurylase activity. Also, in our subsequent analysis of the PP-loop (11Deyrup A.T. Singh B. Krishnan S. Lyle S. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) which is located in the sulfurylase domain, we identified two residues, His506 and Asp523, that when mutated to alanine resulted in altered kinase activity. Similar cross-reactivity behavior was observed in the present study for LD86DL, a switch mutant designed to probe the strictness of the spatial constraint on the critical aspartate, Asp87, and the flexibility of the active site. Lastly, it is interesting to observe that in all of the DGD-turn mutants the loss in overall activity is greater than the loss in kinase activity, suggesting that the conversion of endogenous APS, an intermediate in the overall reaction to PAPS, is affected by the BM-motif mutations to a greater degree than is the conversion of exogenous APS, a substrate in the kinase reaction. Thus, in addition to participating in the kinase reaction, the BM-motif may be interacting with the sulfurylase domain and playing a role in the transfer of APS from the sulfurylase to the kinase active site. The hypothesis of less efficient utilization of endogenous APS in the bm mutant enzyme is consistent with results from our previous study where we demonstrated that SK2 isolated from brachymorphic mice exhibits a channeling defect (4Lyle S. Stanzak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further studies to understand the channeling of APS by the recombinant bm-like SK1 are in progress. In summary, our past work sought to identify the components of the APS kinase active site by analyzing the contribution of three functional motifs: the P-loop (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the FISP-motif (10Deyrup A.T. Pathology. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL1997Google Scholar) and the PAPS binding motif (10Deyrup A.T. Pathology. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL1997Google Scholar). With the elucidation of the mutation in the bm mouse (7Kurima K. Warman M.L. Krishnan S. Domowicz M. Krueger R.C., Jr. Deyrup A. Schwartz N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we have now identified a fourth component of the kinase active site, the BM-motif. Our mutational analysis of the BM-motif shows the functional importance of several highly conserved residues of this region in enzyme catalysis, endogenous APS transfer, and in formation of a rigid active site and as well provides a rationale for the lack of kinase activity in the kinase-like regulatory domain of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase. We thank Dr. Youli Wang for help in constructing mutant enzymes, James Mensch for helpful comments during the course of this study, and Daniel Vatner for help in sequence comparison."
