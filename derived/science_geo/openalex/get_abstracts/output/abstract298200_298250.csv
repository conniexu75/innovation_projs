Most of these fishes are contained in the orders Characiformes and Siluriformes (catfishes). The Characiformes constitute more than 30% of the total fish yield in the Amazon basin, whereas the catfishes are of minor importance. Stable isotope data indicate that Characiformes species receive most of their carbon through food chains originating with phytoplankton, while the Siluriformes receive a significant part of their energy from other plant sources."

The ionospheric modification by powerful radio waves is analogous to studies of laser and microwave heating of laboratory plasmas (20). "" Anomalous"" reflectivity effects similar to the observed ionospheric attenuation have already been noted in plasmas modulated by microwaves, and anomalous heating may have been observed in plasmas irradiated by lasers. Contacts have now been established between the workers in these diverse areas, which span a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Perhaps ionospheric modification will also be a valuable technique in radio communications."
https://openalex.org/W2023865386,"A one-step, three-component aqueous etchant was developed for revealing the tracks of charged particles in olivine. The etchant reveals tracks of small cone angle, which are equally well developed in all the crystallographic directions. The scope of fossil cosmic-ray track studies in extraterrestrial samples has thus been increased, because olivine is often an abundant constituent and because it has a higher threshold ionization for track registration and has lower uranium, thorium, and trace element concentrations as compared with pyroxenes and feldspars. The etchant does not attack any of the principal rock-forming minerals in normal etching time, which allows a nondestructive study of fossil tracks in thin-section mounts. The study of fossil cosmic-ray tracks in olivine is particularly valuable for investigations of very, very heavy cosmic-ray nuclei and for highly irradiated samples such as those found in the lunar regolith"

(i) Remnants of shore platforms occur as distinct levels of notched ridge crests and flat summits; degraded sea cliffs are common. (ii) Scattered quartz beach pebbles occur on 16 of 18 levels of exhumed shore platforms in the Fox- Franz Josef type area to altitudes as high as 1700 meters. (iii) Altitudinal spacings of New Zealand terrace flights allow correlation with 18 dated global marine terraces at New Guinea, which were formed during glacio-eustatic highstands of sea level within the last 336 x 10(3) years. Inferred uplift rates at Fox-Franz Josef increased from 3.2 to 7.8 meters per 10(3) years since about 135 x 10(3) to 140 x 10(3) years ago, presumably because of increased convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates."

The molecular distributions of hydrocarbons in this petroleum show that it was probably derived from terrestrial organic matter in turbidite sediment filling the Escanaba Trough. Hydrothermal activity at the Gorda Ridge spreading center provided the heat for petroleum formation and was the source of fluids for sulfide mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W1965097296,"The earliest fossil record of African anthropoid primates (monkeys and apes) comes from the Jebel Qatrani Formation in the Fayum depression of Egypt. Reevaluation of both geologic and faunal evidence indicates that this formation was deposited in the early part of the Oligocene Epoch, more than 31 million years ago, earlier than previous estimates. The great antiquity of the fossil higher primates from Egypt accords well with their primitive morphology compared with later Old World higher primates. Thus, the anthropoid primates and hystricomorph rodents from Fayum are also considerably older than the earliest higher primates and rodents from South America."
https://openalex.org/W2764411071,"A commercially available chelating resin selectively and quantitatively collects methyl mercuric and inorganic mercuric forms of mercury to the exclusion of all other metals studied, except the noble metals. Both forms of mercury can be collected from pH 1 to 9. Collected mercury is readily eluted with a slightly acid, 5 percent solution of thiourea, and the resin can be reused for many cycles. Selectivity, pH effects, capacity, and elution characteristics of the resin are described. A resin-loaded paper composed of 50 percent resin and 50 percent cellulose shows properties similar to those of the loose resin."

https://openalex.org/W2107515324,"There is reason to believe that some old wooden ships on the deep-sea floor have survived for thousands of years without much change. They will not be covered with much sediment, and it will be possible to find them using new searching techniques. These are embodied in the system of the Alcoa Seaprobe, which is also equipped to identify and raise old ships."

https://openalex.org/W2077283730,The changes resulting from this electronic revolution have an impact as great as or greater than those from any of the major instrumental developments of the past. In previous times astronomers could only hope for the observational power that can now be realized by modern electronic instrumentation.
