https://openalex.org/W2017191042,"THE bacterial pathogens of beans are widespread all over the world. In most cases four species of bacterium are the main causal organisms: Pseudomonas phaseolicola (Burkholder) Dowson, Xanthomonas phaseoli (E.F. Smith) Dowson, Corynebacterium flaccumfaciens (Hedges) Dowson, and Xanthomonas phaseoli var. fuscans (Burkholder) Starr et Burkholder. The symptoms, on the seed, of the diseases caused by these four bacteria are similar to such an extent that they can be identified only by means of laboratory methods. Katznelson et al. 1 succeeded in isolating the phages for P. phaseolicola and X. phaseoli. The Canadian authors worked out a rapid phage-count method using these two phages. By means of this procedure they were able to detect the halo-blight organism (P. phaseolicola) and the common blight bacterium (X. phaseoli) in beans. In order to apply this method for all the four important pathogens of beans, it was necessary to isolate also the phages for C. flaccumfaciens and X. phaseoli var. fuscans. This work, which was undertaken because C. flaccumfaciens and X. phaseoli var. fuscans are the major causative agents of bean diseases in Hungary, was recently carried out in our laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W1983730238,"THERE is now considerable evidence to show that the synthesis of isoprenoid compounds in both plants and animals may proceed by the utilization of acetate as the sole primary carbon source1,2, and that the pathways by which the isoprenoid monomer is derived from acetate may have a number of carboxylate intermediates in common, for example, ββ′-dimethyl acrylate and β-hydroxy-β-methyl glutarate1,3. Before taking part in these metabolic reactions acetate first undergoes activation by coupling with coenzyme A, and this form of carboxyl activation is then transmitted through subsequent intermediates arising from acetate. An examination of the latex and tissues of Hevea brasiliensis for such activation systems is briefly reported here."
https://openalex.org/W1986223225,"THE effect of environmental conditions on the activity of small laboratory animals is usually recorded in terms of locomotor activity as indicated by the revolutions of rotating cages. Work in progress with an animal calorimeter1 indicates that a considerable amount of time and energy is spent in other activities such as washing, scratching and gnawing. The apparatus described below has been constructed to record evidence of all types of activity."

https://openalex.org/W2015367893,"THE mucin constituting the gelatinous layer which envelops the eggs of Bufo bufo, if digested with papain and then sulphated, shows a marked anticoagulant activity on the fibrinogen and the whole blood plasma1. A similar anticoagulant activity has now been shown by the ovular mucins of other species of amphibians, sulphated without any previous proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2058562567,"PREVIOUS workers1 have reported that only the male of Schistosoma spindale develops in the guinea pig. Fairley, Mackie and Jesudasan, who carried out a detailed investigation, suggested that “some peculiar host reaction to the less robust female schistosome probably underlies this phenomenon in the case of S. spindale”. A comprehensive study was undertaken of this apparent immunity to only one sex of a metazoan parasite, as a result of which it has been found that female S. spindale also develops in the guinea pig."

https://openalex.org/W2091992669,THE general principle followed so far for the viable count of bacteria in a suspension is either to count the number of colonies produced by a very dilute suspension of bacteria on an agar plate1 or to observe the differential staining behaviour of the living bacterium to distinguish it from the dead one2. No reliable technique has yet been recorded for identifying viable cells in a mixed suspension of viable and non-viable bacteria when counting under the microscope. I have been able to identify living bacteria during the counting process by the haematocytometer method.

https://openalex.org/W2103854119,"CULTURES of Vibrio cholerae are very sensitive to thymol. The addition of 50 mgm. of this substance to 10 ml. of 4-hr. broth cultures results in rapid clearing due to massive lysis of the organisms. This takes about 30–45 min. at 37° C., by which time the cultures are sterile. As thymol is soluble in aqueous media only to the extent of 1 in 1,500, the effective concentration required to lyse V. cholerae may be of this order. The rapidity with which this occurs simulates the phenomenon of ‘induction’ observed in certain lysogenic bacteria, when they are exposed to ultra-violet radiation or X-rays or treated with chemical mutagens. However, lysogenic cultures of V. cholerae exposed to thymol do not reveal any appreciable increase in free phage particles in the lysates. Further, ‘indicator’ strains which have proved useful in the detection of lysogenic strains and which appear to be non-lysogenic themselves are lysed equally effectively by thymol."
