Two modes of damage response have been described: (1) The “oval cell” response emanates from the biliary tree when all hepatocytes are affected by chronic liver disease. (2) A massive, proliferative response of mature hepatocytes occurs upon acute liver damage such as partial hepatectomy (PHx). While the oval cell response has been captured in vitro by growing organoids from cholangiocytes, the hepatocyte proliferative response has not been recapitulated in culture. Here, we describe the establishment of a long-term 3D organoid culture system for mouse and human primary hepatocytes. Organoids can be established from single hepatocytes and grown for multiple months, while retaining key morphological, functional and gene expression features. Transcriptional profiles of the organoids resemble those of proliferating hepatocytes after PHx. Human hepatocyte organoids proliferate extensively after engraftment into mice and thus recapitulate the proliferative damage-response of hepatocytes.

The liver displays a remarkable regenerative capacity in terms of recovery of mass and function upon surgical removal of up to 2/3 of its size partial hepatectomy (PHx), or after liver-wide chemical or infectious injury (Stanger, 2015Stanger B.Z. Cellular homeostasis and repair in the mammalian liver.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77: 179-200Google Scholar). The response to partial removal of the liver is particularly impressive as it involves massive cell cycle entry of remaining mature hepatocytes without an apparent de-differentiation into a progenitor/stem cell-like state (Miyajima et al., 2014Miyajima A. Tanaka M. Itoh T. Stem/progenitor cells in liver development, homeostasis, regeneration, and reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 561-574Google Scholar). The liver will thus grow back to its original size within 2 weeks after damage (Michalopoulos, 2010Michalopoulos G.K. Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy: critical analysis of mechanistic dilemmas.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 2-13Google Scholar). There is good evidence for direct, slow hepatocyte expansion under steady-state conditions in vivo. An Axin2 lineage tracing allele demonstrates that mature hepatocytes located around the pericentral vein (PC) drive homeostatic hepatocyte self-renewal (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Google Scholar). Similarly, genetic lineage tracing approaches have demonstrated that periportal hepatocytes can replenish liver mass upon damage (Font-Burgada et al., 2015Font-Burgada J. Shalapour S. Ramaswamy S. Hsueh B. Rossell D. Umemura A. Taniguchi K. Nakagawa H. Valasek M.A. Ye L. et al.Hybrid Periportal Hepatocytes Regenerate the Injured Liver without Giving Rise to Cancer.Cell. 2015; 162: 766-779Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism of liver repair comes into play when noxious agents (toxins, viruses) chronically affect all hepatocytes. Under these circumstances, small cells near the bile duct tree become proliferative (“oval cells”). The prevailing school of thought states that the cholangiocyte-like oval cells represent activated liver stem cells, capable of regenerating hepatocytes as well as new cholangiocytes (Evarts et al., 1987Evarts R.P. Nagy P. Marsden E. Thorgeirsson S.S. A precursor-product relationship exists between oval cells and hepatocytes in rat liver.Carcinogenesis. 1987; 8: 1737-1740Google Scholar). Indeed, oval cells or atypical ductal cells expressing Epcam or Sox9 have long been regarded as bi-potential facultative stem/progenitor cells (Dollé et al., 2015Dollé L. Theise N.D. Schmelzer E. Boulter L. Gires O. van Grunsven L.A. EpCAM and the biology of hepatic stem/progenitor cells.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2015; 308: G233-G250Google Scholar, Furuyama et al., 2011Furuyama K. Kawaguchi Y. Akiyama H. Horiguchi M. Kodama S. Kuhara T. Hosokawa S. Elbahrawy A. Soeda T.

Finegold M.J. et al.In vitro expansion of single Lgr5+ liver stem cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration.Nature. 2013; 494: 247-250Google Scholar). While the hepatocyte-driven regenerative response dominates most types of liver repair (Grompe, 2014Grompe M. Liver stem cells, where art thou?.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 257-258Google Scholar), the in vivo relevance of the oval cell response as well as its cell-of-origin have remained controversial. Indeed, several recent lineage tracing approaches failed to find support for a stem cell with cholangiocyte characteristics (Schaub et al., 2014Schaub J.R. Malato Y. Gormond C. Willenbring H. Evidence against a stem cell origin of new hepatocytes in a common mouse model of chronic liver injury.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 933-939Google Scholar, Yanger et al., 2014Yanger K. Knigin D. Zong Y. Maggs L. Gu G. Akiyama H. Pikarsky E. Stanger B.Z. Adult hepatocytes are generated by self-duplication rather than stem cell differentiation.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 340-349Google Scholar). Forbes and colleagues very recently provided definitive proof for an in vivo oval cell response, by cleverly obstructing hepatocyte proliferation (Raven et al., 2017Raven A. Lu W.Y. Man T.Y. Ferreira-Gonzalez S. O’Duibhir E. Dwyer B.J. Thomson J.P. Meehan R.R. Bogorad R. Koteliansky V. et al.Cholangiocytes act as facultative liver stem cells during impaired hepatocyte regeneration.Nature. 2017; 547: 350-354Google Scholar). Lineage tracing revealed the cell-of-origin to not be a professional stem cell, but rather a cholangiocyte. We have recently described a long-term 3D liver expansion system of mouse and human adult biliary epithelial-derived progenitor cells that mirrors the in vivo oval cell response (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Dorrell C. Boj S.F. van Es J.H. Li V.S. van de Wetering M. Sato T. Hamer K. Sasaki N.

Fuchs S.A. de Ligt J. et al.Long-term culture of genome-stable bipotent stem cells from adult human liver.Cell. 2015; 160: 299-312Google Scholar). Under these defined 3D organoid culture conditions, up to a third of mature Epcam+ biliary cells are capable to undergo rapid dedifferentiation into bipotent progenitor cells that expand as cystic structures and can be passaged for over 6 months (Huch et al., 2015Huch M. Gehart H. van Boxtel R. Hamer K. Blokzijl F. Verstegen M.M. Ellis E. van Wenum M.

Haft A. Finegold M. Grompe M. Adult Mouse Liver Contains Two Distinct Populations of Cholangiocytes.Stem Cell Reports. 2017; 9: 478-489Google Scholar). Upon removal of growth stimuli (R-spondin and forskolin), the cells regain a biliary fate. However, when Notch signaling is blocked and upon addition of FGF19, BMP7, and dexamethasone, the cells are fated toward a hepatocyte phenotype. The same protocol can be used to establish organoids of various liver cancer types (Broutier et al., 2017Broutier L. Mastrogiovanni G. Verstegen M.M. Francies H.E. Gavarró L.M. Bradshaw C.R. Allen G.E. Arnes-Benito R. Sidorova O. Gaspersz M.P. et al.Human primary liver cancer-derived organoid cultures for disease modeling and drug screening.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 1424-1435Google Scholar). Adult mature hepatocytes can be reprogrammed into proliferative bipotent progenitor cells in response to chronic liver injury (Tanimizu et al., 2014Tanimizu N. Nishikawa Y. Ichinohe N. Akiyama H. Mitaka T. Sry HMG box protein 9-positive (Sox9+) epithelial cell adhesion molecule-negative (EpCAM-) biphenotypic cells derived from hepatocytes are involved in mouse liver regeneration.J. Biol.

Indeed, mature hepatocytes have been demonstrated to display plasticity in vivo by transdifferentiating into cholangiocytes/biliary epithelial cells (Sekiya and Suzuki, 2014Sekiya S. Suzuki A.

Lineage tracing has underscored the existence of hepatocyte-derived progenitor cells (hepPD); yet attempts to culture these in 3D culture initially failed (Malato et al., 2011Malato Y. Naqvi S. Schürmann N. Ng R. Wang B. Zape J. Kay M.A. Grimm D. Willenbring H. Fate tracing of mature hepatocytes in mouse liver homeostasis and regeneration.J. Clin.

Bipotential adult liver progenitors are derived from chronically injured mature hepatocytes.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 605-618Google Scholar). A recent study has described a cocktail of three small molecules that can convert rat and mouse hepatocytes in vitro into small, proliferative bipotent cells, termed “chemically induced liver progenitors” (CLiPs) in 2D. In long-term culture, CLiPs do not resemble hepatocytes morphologically, yet they retain their proliferative capacity and their hepatic differentiation ability and can repopulate a chronically injured liver (Katsuda et al., 2017Katsuda T. Kawamata M. Hagiwara K. Takahashi R.U. Yamamoto Y. Camargo F.D. Ochiya T. Conversion of Terminally Committed Hepatocytes to Culturable Bipotent Progenitor Cells with Regenerative Capacity.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 20: 41-55Google Scholar). Here we probe the direct proliferative ability of mature murine hepatocytes and human hepatocytes and describe a long-term culture system for proliferative hepatocyte organoids (Hep-Orgs), distinct from cholangiocyte derived organoids (Chol-Orgs). We isolated primary hepatocytes from wild-type adult C57BL/6 mouse liver by two-step collagenase perfusion and suspended the cells in Matrigel (Figure 1A). A variety of small molecules and biologicals, including Wnt agonists such as R-spondin1 and CHIR99021; EGF, FGF7 and FGF10; HGF and the TGF-β inhibitor A83-01, were tested for the ability to support growth, (Figure S1A). During the first week of culture, small organoids emerged from Matrigel-embedded hepatocytes in some of the culture conditions. This allowed us to refine conditions, eventually resulting in robust organoid growth (Figures S1A and S1B) in the optimized Hep-Medium (Table S1). Unlike Chol-Orgs, Hep-Orgs were compact with a typical “bunch-of-grapes” appearance (Figure 1B in comparison to Figure 1D: Table S1 gives an overview of all comparisons). Plating efficiency was about 0.5%–1.0% of mature hepatocytes (Figure 1C). This contrasted with the high plating efficiency of biliary epithelial cells (up to 30% of purified cholangiocytes) (Huch et al., 2015Huch M. Gehart H. van Boxtel R. Hamer K. Blokzijl F. Verstegen M.M. Ellis E. van Wenum M.

The organoids expanded to a diameter of ∼400 μm within 15–20 days and could be passaged by mechanical disruption at a ratio of 1:3 every 7–10 days (Video S1). Growth speed tended to slow down after 2–3 months (Figure S1C). Organoids could also be obtained from BALB/c and C57BL/6 x BALB/c mice (Figure S1D).Figure S1Hepatocyte Organoids Originate Mainly from Central Vein Hepatocytes, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Numbers of Hep-Orgs per well in medium of indicated composition.

Growth of Murine Hep-Orgs (P2) in Hep-Medium from Day 2 to 5, Related to Figure 1 Figure 1E gives a confocal image section stained for the adhesion junction marker β-catenin (yellow) and the proliferation marker mKi67 (red), revealing the absence of the large lumen seen in murine Chol-Orgs (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Dorrell C. Boj S.F. van Es J.H. Li V.S. van de Wetering M. Sato T. Hamer K. Sasaki N. Finegold M.J. et al.In vitro expansion of single Lgr5+ liver stem cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration.Nature. 2013; 494: 247-250Google Scholar and Figure 2B). Typical hepatocyte morphology was revealed by transmission EM (Figure 1F). To probe the cell-of-origin, we isolated hepatocytes from Albumin-CreERT2; Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato mice. After tamoxifen induction, ∼99% of albumin-secreting hepatocytes were labeled, whereas no cells of the biliary epithelium showed recombination (Figure S1E). Single, sorted tomato-labeled hepatocytes generated fully labeled organoids, implying that the Hep-Orgs arise from single mature, albumin-expressing hepatocytes (Figure 1G). Hepatocytes in liver lobules differentially express zonation markers along the pericentral (PC)-to-periportal vein (PP) axis (Halpern et al., 2017Halpern K.B. Shenhav R. Matcovitch-Natan O. Toth B.

Wiebrands K. Basak O. Sasaki N. Clevers H. van Oudenaarden A. Single-cell messenger RNA sequencing reveals rare intestinal cell types.Nature. 2015; 525: 251-255Google Scholar). During homeostasis, expression of the Wnt target gene Axin2 marks hepatocytes adjacent to the PC that are the main source of homeostatic self-renewal (Wang et al., 2015Wang B. Zhao L. Fish M. Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Self-renewing diploid Axin2(+) cells fuel homeostatic renewal of the liver.Nature. 2015; 524: 180-185Google Scholar). To investigate the zonal origin of Hep-Orgs, we isolated mature hepatocytes from mice carrying Axin2-CreERT2 and Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato alleles 1 week after Tamoxifen induction by FACS. Axin2+ hepatocytes displayed much higher plating efficiencies than Axin2- hepatocytes (Figure S1F). Control Epcam+ cholangiocytes generated essentially no Hep-Orgs in Hep-Medium (Figure S1G). Additionally, we sorted hepatocytes of different ploidy states (2n, 4n, and 8n) as described (Duncan et al., 2010Duncan A.W. Taylor M.H. Hickey R.D. Hanlon Newell A.E. Lenzi M.L. Olson S.B. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. The ploidy conveyor of mature hepatocytes as a source of genetic variation.Nature. 2010; 467: 707-710Google Scholar). Tetraploid hepatocytes, common in adult mouse liver, surprisingly yielded a comparable plating efficiency to diploid cells, while octaploid cells did not grow out (Figure S1H). Hep-Orgs were then analyzed by immunofluorescence and immuno-histochemical staining. Hep-Orgs showed strong albumin expression (green), yet were negative for the bile duct markers Krt19 or Krt7 (Figures 2A and 2B, Figures S2A and S2C). H&E, E-cadherin and β-catenin staining of paraffin sections revealed a characteristic organization of the Hep-Orgs (Figure 2A and Figure S2B). Hep-Org cells were larger in size (Figures 2A and S2B). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed for the hepatocyte markers Alb, Hnf4a, Cyp1a2, and Cyp3a11, the fetal hepatocyte marker Afp, cholangiocytes/progenitor marker Krt19, and progenitor markers Tbx3 and Sox9 (Figures 2C and 2D). Expression of these markers in Hep-Orgs closely resembled that of primary mouse hepatocytes (Primary-Hep). Yet, the former re-expressed the fetal hepatocyte gene Afp, a feature of hemi-hepatectomy (Engelhardt et al., 1976Engelhardt N.V. Lazareva M.N. Abelev G.I. Uryvaeva I.V. Factor V.M. Brodsky V.Y.

Becker F.F. Leffert H.L. Hepatocyte proliferation and alpha 1-fetoprotein in pregnant, neonatal, and partially hepatectomized rats.Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 865-871Google Scholar). Hep-Orgs showed strong periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining indicative of glycogen accumulation (Figure 2E). Low-density lipoprotein uptake (LDL) was readily visualized by fluorescent probes (Figure 2F). Albumin secretion of Hep-Orgs (Passage 1 (P1) and P3) was only 2- to 4-fold lower compared to primary hepatocytes. Of note, expanding Chol-Orgs secrete at least 1,000-fold less Albumin, and differentiated Chol-Orgs at least 10-fold less (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Dorrell C. Boj S.F. van Es J.H. Li V.S. van de Wetering M. Sato T. Hamer K. Sasaki N. Finegold M.J. et al.In vitro expansion of single Lgr5+ liver stem cells induced by Wnt-driven regeneration.Nature. 2013; 494: 247-250Google Scholar) (Figure 2G). Cytochrome activity (Cyp1a2) was also only 2- to 3-fold lower compared with primary hepatocytes (Figure 2H). Bulk mRNA sequencing was performed for Hep-Orgs and Chol-Orgs from isolates of three different mice and compared to primary hepatocyte RNA. Figure 2I represents a heatmap of the expression for ∼40 hepatocyte genes, 10 cholangiocyte/progenitor genes and a number of proliferation markers (Full gene list given in Figure S2K). Markers of hemi-hepatectomy response (Afp, cell-cycle genes) were high in Hep-Orgs, but not in primary hepatocytes. Notably, genes involved in hepatocyte functions such as Cytochrome P450 activity, glycogen metabolism, lipid metabolism, steroid metabolism, urea cycle and complement activation all displayed similar expression profiles between Hep-Orgs and primary hepatocytes (Figures S2D–S2J). Hep-Orgs expressed PC marker to a higher extent than PP markers (Figures S2L and S2M). Gene expression patterns over time were assessed by mRNA sequencing for two murine Hep-Org cultures (M1 and M2). These remained remarkably similar over time as visualized by PCA plot and assessed at P1, P3 and P7 (Figure 3A). The heatmap of main hepatic markers such as Alb, Hnf4a, Hpx indicated their stable expression during Hep-Orgs passaging, while Krt7 and Epcam were not re-expressed (Figure 3B). While Hep-Orgs display crucial functional aspects of primary hepatocytes, they obviously differ from these hepatocytes by being in cycle and by expressing fetal markers such as Afp (Figure 3B). PHx drives hepatocytes into proliferation, peaking at the third day after damage (Michalopoulos, 2010Michalopoulos G.K. Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy: critical analysis of mechanistic dilemmas.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 2-13Google Scholar). To compare gene expression profiles of Hep-Orgs to the in vivo transcriptional state of proliferating hepatocytes, we isolated hepatocytes by collagenase digestion at day 3 post-PHx as well as control undamaged hepatocytes and performed mRNA sequencing. Hep-Orgs clustered more closely with PHx hepatocytes than with undamaged hepatocytes or Chol-Orgs (Figure 3C and Table S2). A gene set of the top-100 genes differentially expressed between PHx samples and control undamaged hepatocytes was compared to Hep-Orgs by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Table S2). Multiple genes were upregulated in proliferating hepatocytes after partial-hepatectomy that were also activated in the Hep-Orgs; gene enrichment was found in Hep-Orgs of P1, P3 and P7 (Figure 3D). In addition, we independently determined differential gene expression between PHx and control undamaged liver by microarray analysis and from this analysis we generated a gene set list including genes that changed at least 5-fold (Table S2). Significant enrichment was again observed by GSEA. Genes that were downregulated in proliferating post-PHx hepatocytes were repressed in mouse Hep-Orgs. Conversely, upregulated genes in PHx samples were enriched in Hep-Orgs (Figure 3D). We observed that some progenitor markers like Krt8/18 and Spp1 were upregulated during liver regeneration post-PHx. An in vivo study has described hepatocyte-to-biliary epithelial cell conversion after injury (Yanger et al., 2013Yanger K. Zong Y. Maggs L.R. Shapira S.N. Maddipati R. Aiello N.M. Thung S.N. Wells R.G. Greenbaum L.E. Stanger B.Z. Robust cellular reprogramming occurs spontaneously during liver regeneration.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 719-724Google Scholar). Similarly, cholangiocarcinomas can be derived from hepatocytes upon Notch and AKT activation (Fan et al., 2012Fan B. Malato Y. Calvisi D.F. Naqvi S. Razumilava N. Ribback S. Gores G.J. Dombrowski F.

Hepatocytes, rather than cholangiocytes, can be the major source of primitive ductules in the chronically injured mouse liver.Am. J. Pathol. 2014; 184: 1468-1478Google Scholar). When culturing primary hepatocytes from Albumin-CreERT2; Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato mice, cystic organoids occasionally formed when CHIR was removed. Indeed, when Tomato-positive organoids were cultured in Chol-medium for more than 10 days, Krt7/19 were strongly induced while Alb and Hnf4a expression were gradually reduced (Figures S3A and S3C). Inversely, transferring Chol-Orgs into Hep-Medium did reduce the Krt7/19 expression but did not induce expression of hepatocyte-lineage markers. (Figures S3B and S3C). Next, we performed single-cell mRNA sequencing on Hep-Orgs and Chol-Orgs (Figure 4A). We sequenced 384 cells from each and analyzed the results by RaceID2 (Grün et al., 2015Grün D. Lyubimova A. Ke"

However, upon physical or chemical injury to the liver, hepatocytes proliferate extensively in vivo under the direction of multiple extracellular cues, including Wnt and pro-inflammatory signals. Currently, liver organoids can be generated readily in vitro from bile-duct epithelial cells, but not hepatocytes. Here, we show that TNFα, an injury-induced inflammatory cytokine, promotes the expansion of hepatocytes in 3D culture and enables serial passaging and long-term culture for more than 6 months. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals broad expression of hepatocyte markers. Strikingly, in vitro-expanded hepatocytes engrafted, and significantly repopulated, the injured livers of Fah-/- mice.

We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator transition.

A transmission chain experiment validates a model of the emergence of local traditions, indicating that such social transmission may lead initially neutral traits to become adaptive, hence strongly selecting for copying and conformity.

Principal component analysis of the model weights reveals that the most important dimensions of 3D structure are distance and openness. Finally, reconstructions of the stimuli based on the model weights demonstrate that our model captures unprecedented detail about the local visual environment from scene-selective areas. Several scene-selective areas have been identified in the human brain, including the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the retrosplenial complex (RSC), and the occipital place area (OPA; also called the temporal occipital sulcus [TOS]). These areas respond to visual images of rooms, buildings, and landscapes, but it is still unclear what specific scene-related features are represented in these areas. One popular hypothesis is that they represent the 3D structure of the local visual environment (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998Epstein R. Kanwisher N. A cortical representation of the local visual environment.Nature. 1998; 392: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Various studies have reported that these areas might represent several different types of 3D structural features, such as the relative openness of a scene (Harel et al., 2013Harel A. Kravitz D.J.

However, these hypotheses have not yet been formulated as objectively computable models. Consequently, it is not clear how much variance each of these hypotheses explains in scene-selective areas. This leads to problems with reverse inference: if a voxel in a scene-selective area becomes active, how much of that activity should be attributed to each type of feature? Without more precise models, the answer is unclear, and the representation of 3D structure in scene-selective areas remains poorly characterized. In this study, we attempt to resolve this issue by introducing two important innovations. First, we use quantitative encoding models to define the specific features of scenes that we hypothesize to be represented in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in scene-selective areas. Encoding models provide a consistent, objective way to define scene features from stimuli, even if the stimuli are from different experiments. Thus, encoding models provide a way to evaluate hypotheses from one experiment in data from another experiment and thereby to compare results across experiments. Second, we compare models that reflect low-level properties of images to models that reflect high-level scene-related properties. Natural scenes contain substantial correlations between low-level features (such as spatial frequency) and high-level features (such as the openness or size of a scene). Unless models reflecting low-level features are evaluated in tandem with high-level models, it is very difficult to ensure that selectivity for 3D structural features is not simply a confound of selectivity for low-level features. Indeed, several recent studies have suggested that many previous studies of scene-selective areas might suffer from this confound (Lescroart et al., 2015Lescroart M.D. Stansbury D.E. Gallant J.L. Fourier power, subjective distance, and object categories all provide plausible models of BOLD responses in scene-selective visual areas.Front. Comput.

Hartley T. Andrews T.J. Patterns of response to visual scenes are linked to the low-level properties of the image.Neuroimage. 2014; 99: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, this is the first fMRI study to establish a quantitative baseline for performance of 3D structural models relative to 2D models in terms of how much variance they predict in responses to naturalistic images. To investigate the representation of scene structure in PPA, RSC, and OPA, we recorded BOLD fMRI signals evoked by computer-generated videos. The videos consisted of randomly selected objects inserted at random locations and sizes into 3D backgrounds. The resulting scenes contained semi-realistic variation in the categories of objects and scenes present, the expanse of the scenes and the positions of surfaces, and low-level features such as lighting, texture, color, and shadow. We analyzed responses to these stimuli using the voxelwise modeling framework developed in our laboratory (Gallant et al., 2012Gallant J.L. Nishimoto S. Naselaris T. Wu M.C.-K. System identification, encoding models, and decoding models: a powerful new approach to fMRI research.in: Kriegeskorte N. Kreiman G.

Kay K.N. Nishimoto S. Gallant J.L. Encoding and decoding in fMRI.Neuroimage. 2011; 56: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We used metadata from the graphics software that generated the videos to quantify the distance to and orientation of surfaces in each frame of the videos. These features map the stimulus into a 3D structural feature space. In parallel, we used multiple different models to quantify low-level 2D image features (local spatial frequency and orientation) in the same videos. The 3D structural features and the 2D image features formalize different hypotheses about what information is represented in scene-selective areas, and each provides the basis for a different encoding model. We fit each of these models to the measured brain responses and compared models by estimating how much variance each model predicts in an independent dataset. Finally, we analyze the estimated weights of the best model to show how scene structure is represented at both the level of individual voxels and across all the voxels in scene-selective areas. The broad goal of this study was to characterize the scene features that are represented in areas PPA, RSC, and OPA. We hypothesize that these areas represent 3D structure, and we seek to establish whether 3D structural features provide a better model of scene-selective areas than low-level 2D features. We present our results in five sections. First, we describe three feature spaces we used to quantify the 3D structure of the local visual environment, and we determine which of these feature spaces yields the best 3D structural model. Second, we test three models based on low-level 2D image features to determine which provides the best 2D model. Third, we verify that the best 3D structural model provides a better model than the best low-level 2D model. Fourth, we examine how voxels in scene-selective areas are tuned for surface orientation and distance by examining the weights of the 3D structural model. Finally, we generate reconstructions of scene backgrounds using measured brain activity and the weights from the 3D structural model. Figure 1 provides an overview of all analysis procedures. In the voxelwise modeling framework, hypotheses are tested by comparing the amounts of variance that models based each hypothesis explain. However, statistical power for model selection diminishes if many models are compared at once. To circumvent this issue, we split model selection into two steps. In the first step, we separately select the best 3D and 2D models. In the second step, we compare the best models in each domain to each other. To avoid overfitting, models were always estimated and tested based on independent data. Each model selection step uses a different subset of data for testing. The first step (selection of the best 3D and 2D models, described in this section and the next) uses held-out folds of the model estimation data for testing. The second step (comparison of the best 3D and 2D models, described below) uses a separate withheld validation dataset (see STAR Methods for details). To test the hypothesis that scene-selective areas represent the 3D structure of the local visual environment, we developed three feature spaces to quantify different types of 3D scene structure. To quantify the range of distances and surface orientations present in each scene, we defined a distance feature space based on pixelwise distance maps (Figure 2F) and a surface orientation feature space based on pixelwise surface normal maps (Figure 2G). To quantify variation in both distance and surface orientation, we created a feature space based on a conjunction of surface orientation and distance features, which we term the “full 3D structural feature space” (Figure 2H; see Figure 2 and STAR Methods for details of all feature spaces). We used a cross-validation procedure to evaluate each of these models for each voxel. For each of 10 cross-validation splits, nine-tenths of the model estimation data were used to fit model weights, and those weights were used to generate predictions for the remaining one-tenth of the data. We compared the predictions of the withheld data to the actual responses using Pearson correlation (r), and selected the model that gave the most accurate predictions across all folds. Figure 3A shows the average model predictions for the 3D structural models obtained in each of the three regions of interest (ROIs): PPA, RSC, and OPA. V1 and V3 are shown to provide a contrast of relative model performance in scene-selective and early visual areas. Predictions for all models are above chance in all these ROIs (p < 0.05, permutation test). In all ROIs, the full 3D structural model gives more accurate predictions than the distance model (p < 0.05, permutation test). In area RSC, the full 3D structural model also gives more accurate predictions than the surface orientation model (p < 0.05, permutation test). In areas PPA and OPA, the prediction accuracy of the full 3D structural model was higher than that of the distance model (p < 0.05, permutation test), but not significantly different from the prediction accuracy of the surface orientation model (p > 0.05, permutation test). In sum, these data suggest that both surface orientation and distance are represented in scene-selective areas, though the evidence is stronger for surface orientation than for distance. To maintain sensitivity to detect representations of distance in the RSC (and potentially other areas), we use the full model for all subsequent analyses. In natural images, high-level 3D structural features tend to be correlated with low-level 2D features such as orientation and Fourier power. It is therefore possible that apparent tuning for 3D structure could be at least partly confounded with tuning for low-level features. Indeed, a recent study from our lab (Lescroart et al., 2015Lescroart M.D. Stansbury D.E. Gallant J.L. Fourier power, subjective distance, and object categories all provide plausible models of BOLD responses in scene-selective visual areas.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that several previous fMRI studies of 3D structure have suffered from precisely this confound. Therefore, to assess the degree to which variance that the 3D structural model explains can also be explained by a simple 2D visual feature model, we also tested three models that parameterize 2D features: a model of Fourier power (Lescroart et al., 2015Lescroart M.D. Stansbury D.E. Gallant J.L. Fourier power, subjective distance, and object categories all provide plausible models of BOLD responses in scene-selective visual areas.Front. Comput.

Natural scene statistics account for the representation of scene categories in human visual cortex.Neuron. 2013; 79: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Each of these models quantifies 2D orientation and spatial frequency in a slightly different way. This assures that the low-level model we ultimately choose is not simply a model of convenience or a straw man null hypothesis but the best possible model of low-level features among several reasonable alternatives. Figure 3B shows the average model predictions for the low-level 2D models in the same ROIs as for the 3D models. The Gabor model provided significantly better predictions than the other two models in all regions tested (p < 0.05, permutation test). The performance of the Fourier power model is rather poor here, worse than that reported previously (Lescroart et al., 2015Lescroart M.D. Stansbury D.E. Gallant J.L. Fourier power, subjective distance, and object categories all provide plausible models of BOLD responses in scene-selective visual areas.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The gist model also performs poorly. This is likely due to the variance in global luminance contrast across the stimulus frames, which strongly affected the output of these two models. The luminance variation in the stimulus was introduced for precisely this reason: to reduce the correlations between low-level image contrast and 3D structural features. The Gabor model was less sensitive to this variation than the other low-level models, likely because of the local nature of the Gabor filters. Based on these results, we chose to use the Gabor model as the 2D feature model for all subsequent analyses. To compare the 3D structural model to the Gabor model, we first used ridge regression to fit both models to the full model estimation dataset. We then used the fit models to predict responses for each voxel in the withheld validation data. Finally, we used Pearson correlation (r) to compare the predictions of each model to the observed responses in the validation data. If the Gabor model explains the same variance as the 3D structural model in scene-selective areas, then it should predict responses in those areas as well as or better than the 3D structural model. Figures 4A and 4B show the prediction accuracy of the Gabor model and the 3D structural model, respectively, projected onto the flattened cortical surface of one subject. The Gabor model makes accurate predictions in V1 and other early visual areas. The 3D structural model makes accurate predictions in areas PPA, RSC, and OPA and in some regions in the posterior parietal lobe, as well as in some parts of early visual cortex (V1, V2, and V3). Figure 4C shows a direct comparison of the mean noise-ceiling-normalized prediction accuracy for both models for each ROI. The 3D structural model predicts responses more accurately than the Gabor model in all three scene-selective areas. However, as expected, the 3D structural model is less accurate than the Gabor model in V1 and other early visual areas (p < 0.05, permutation test). These results suggest that the 3D structural model provides a better description than the Gabor model of the representation in scene-selective areas. Raw measures of prediction accuracy provide a basis for selecting the best model for each visual area. However, they do not reveal whether different models quantify similar underlying sources of scene variation in different ways. For example, the 3D structural model encodes the presence of sky explicitly in one feature, but the Gabor model may also encode the sky implicitly by coding luminance contrast in the upper visual field. Indeed, this may be the reason that the 3D structural model makes accurate predictions in the parts of V1–V3 that represent the upper visual field, as shown in Figure 4B. This would also imply that some of the variance explained by the full 3D structural model in scene-selective areas could be equally well explained by the Gabor model. To address this potential confound, we conducted a variance partitioning analysis (Çukur et al., 2016Çukur T. Huth A.G. Nishimoto S. Gallant J.L.

Neurosci. 2016; 36: 10257-10273Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Huth et al., 2016Huth A.G. de Heer W.A. Griffiths T.L. Theunissen F.E. Gallant J.L.

Gallant J.L. Fourier power, subjective distance, and object categories all provide plausible models of BOLD responses in scene-selective visual areas.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Variance partitioning determines whether two or more models predict unique or shared variance based on whether they can be combined for a gain in total variance explained. If so, then each model must explain a unique component of the response variance; if not, then the variance explained by the models must be shared (see STAR Methods for details). The variance partitioning analysis reveals both shared and unique variance for the two models. We focus first on the unique variance explained by each model that cannot be explained by the other model. Figure 4D shows a map of the unique variance explained by the Gabor model and the full 3D structural model, projected onto the cortical surface of the same subject shown in Figure 4. The only regions in the brain where the full 3D structural model explains unique variance are the PPA, RSC, OPA, and (in some subjects) parts of the posterior parietal lobe. Thus, the representation of the orientation and distance of 3D surfaces (independent of 2D features) largely coincides with previously reported selectivity for 3D spatial dimensions of scenes (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998Epstein R. Kanwisher N. A cortical representation of the local visual environment.Nature. 1998; 392: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, Kravitz et al., 2011Kravitz D.J. Peng C.S. Baker C.I.

Parametric coding of the size and clutter of natural scenes in the human brain.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; 25: 1792-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Figure 4E shows the results of the variance partitioning analysis by ROI, averaged across subjects. This plot shows both shared and unique variance for all ROIs. The 3D structural model does share a significant amount variance with the Gabor model in scene-selective areas (mean ± SD in PPA, RSC, and OPA, respectively: 53% ± 13%, 55% ± 15%, and 51% ± 16% of the total variance the full model explained and 7.4% ± 1.6%, 7.9% ± 1.5%, and 4.8% ± 1.4% of the total potentially explainable variance; all p < 0.05, permutation test). This analysis agrees with a previous study from our lab showing that low-level features can account for some of the response variance in scene-selective areas (Lescroart et al., 2015Lescroart M.D. Stansbury D.E. Gallant J.L. Fourier power, subjective distance, and object categories all provide plausible models of BOLD responses in scene-selective visual areas.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The shared variance is likely due to natural relationships between low-level 2D features and 3D structural features. For example, images of open landscapes with distant content often have high horizontal spatial frequency power due to the presence of a strong horizon line. However, such correlations between 2D and 3D features are not sufficient to explain the entire performance of the model; the 3D structural model also predicts significant unique variance in all three scene-selective areas (mean ± SD in the PPA, RSC, and OPA, respectively: 54% ± 8.7%, 45% ± 20%, and 52% ± 14% of the total variance the full model explained and 8.4% ± 3.6%, 7.0% ± 3.5%, and 5.1% ± 2.4% of the total potentially explainable variance; p < 0.05, permutation test). Thus, representation of 3D structural features in scene-selective areas cannot be fully accounted for by representation of 2D spatial frequency and orientation. The results presented thus far demonstrate that the full 3D structural model explains unique response variance in scene-selective areas. Next, we investigated what information about 3D structure is captured in the estimated model weights in scene-selective areas. In this section, we examine tuning revealed by the feature weights in individual voxels. The following section describes tuning across the population of voxels in scene-selective areas. To visualize voxel tuning, we first plot the raw weights for individual voxels. This provides the most direct way to visualize which orientations and distances are associated with larger or smaller responses in each voxel (i.e., voxelwise tuning). However, individual feature weight estimates for any given voxel may be noisy, which can make plots of raw voxel weights difficult to interpret. Thus, to generate a more interpretable visualization of tuning for each voxel, we conducted an in silico experiment, in which we used all the weights for each voxel to predict responses to a set of simple stimuli (shown in Figure 5D). These stimuli were never shown to subjects; here, we refer to them as “probe” stimuli, since they are used to probe voxel tuning. The probe stimuli were designed to be similar to stimuli used in previous experiments (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998Epstein R. Kanwisher N. A cortical representation of the local visual environment.Nature. 1998; 392: 598-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, Harel et al., 2013Harel A. Kravitz D.J. Baker C.I.

To the extent that the model is correct, the predicted responses to each of the probe stimuli provide an estimate of how each voxel would have responded to each of these images had the probe stimuli been shown in a real experiment. Each predicted response incorporates all the feature weights for a given voxel and so is less subject to noise in individual feature weights. This in silico analysis is highly interpretable but indirect. Thus, to describe tuning for each voxel, we show both the raw model weights (for transparency and completeness) and the predictions of responses to the probe stimulus set (to facilitate interpretation). Figures 5A–5C show estimated model weights for three voxels from PPA, RSC, and OPA, respectively, plotted using the same conventions as in Figure 2H. The pattern of weights across distances and orientations (opaque red or blue squares) varies by voxel, indicating that each voxel is tuned for a different combination of surface orientations and distances.

Zinc and pH are physiological allosteric modulators of NMDARs, with GluN2A-containing receptors inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of divalent zinc and by excursions to low pH. Despite the widespread importance of zinc and proton modulation of NMDARs, the molecular mechanism by which these ions modulate receptor activity has proven elusive. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy to elucidate the structure of the GluN1/GluN2A NMDAR in a large ensemble of conformations under a range of physiologically relevant zinc and proton concentrations. We show how zinc binding to the amino terminal domain elicits structural changes that are transduced though the ligand-binding domain and result in constriction of the ion channel gate."
https://openalex.org/W2902258211,"Mammalian folate metabolism is comprised of cytosolic and mitochondrial pathways with nearly identical core reactions, yet the functional advantages of such an organization are not well understood. Using genome-editing and biochemical approaches, we find that ablating folate metabolism in the mitochondria of mammalian cell lines results in folate degradation in the cytosol. Mechanistically, we show that QDPR, an enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism, moonlights to repair oxidative damage to tetrahydrofolate (THF). This repair capacity is overwhelmed when cytosolic THF hyperaccumulates in the absence of mitochondrially produced formate, leading to THF degradation. Unexpectedly, we also find that the classic antifolate methotrexate, by inhibiting its well-known target DHFR, causes even more extensive folate degradation in nearly all tested cancer cell lines. These findings shed light on design features of folate metabolism, provide a biochemical basis for clinically observed folate deficiency in QDPR-deficient patients, and reveal a hitherto unknown and unexplored cellular effect of methotrexate."

During adult neurogenesis, newborn neurons release feedback signals into the niches to regulate NSC proliferation and differentiation. However, whether and how NSCs contribute to the niche governing newborn neuron development is still unknown. Using a combination of cell ablation, retrovirus-mediated single-cell labeling, and signaling pathway modulation, we show that adult hippocampal NSCs continuously supply pleiotrophin factor to the newborn neurons. Without this feedforward signal, the newborn neurons display defective dendritic development and arborization. Thus, our findings reveal that NSCs behave as a functional niche for newly generated newborn neurons to regulate their maturation."

Our results provide insights into the diversification of diterpene biosynthesis in the mint family and establish a comprehensive foundation for continued investigation of diterpene biosynthesis in the Lamiaceae. Diterpenoid specialized metabolites are widespread among plants but are particularly diverse and abundant in the Lamiaceae (mint) family.

In the Lamiaceae, the majority of diterpenes share a decalin core, characteristic of labdane-related diterpenes. In angiosperms, biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenes starts with the action of a class II diterpene synthase (diTPS) from the TPS-c subfamily (2Peters R.J. Two rings in them all: the labdane-related diterpenoids.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27 (20890488): 1521-153010.1039/c0np00019aCrossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Chen F. Tholl D. Bohlmann J.

A class I diTPS from the TPS-e subfamily then acts to remove the diphosphate moiety and form additional rings, double bonds, or hydroxyl groups. TPS-c and TPS-e enzymes are ubiquitous in angiosperms, catalyzing the first two steps in the gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis pathway, the conversion of GGPP to ent-CPP and of ent-CPP to ent-kaurene, respectively. Labdane-related diterpene-specialized metabolites may arise from alternative decoration of ent-kaurene after the diTPS-catalyzed reactions, from gene duplication and neo-functionalization of ent-CPP and ent-kaurene synthases (4Zi J.

In the present work, we performed a detailed analysis of the available chemotaxonomic and enzyme function data from the Lamiaceae, showing hundreds of diterpene skeletons that could not be accounted for by known enzymes. We therefore saw an opportunity to mine for diTPSs with previously unknown activities. Using homology searches with known diTPSs from mints (Data set S1), we identified a total of 163 candidate diTPSs from the new transcriptomes (Data set S2). By combining and cross-referencing the transcriptome data, chemotaxonomic data, and earlier enzyme data, we narrowed down the list of candidates to select genes with minimal homology to known enzymes, genes from species where the reported diterpenes could not be explained by known activities, and genes from species where no diterpenes have been reported, but where the transcriptome data show an enlargement of the TPS-c or TPS-e gene families. We report nine class II diTPSs accounting for five diphosphate intermediates and 10 class I diTPSs accounting for a wide variety of additional products. Some of the new enzymes give access to intermediates that were previously difficult or impossible to produce biosynthetically. Specifically, we identified Ajuga reptans ArTPS2 as producing neo-cleroda-4(18),13E-dienyl diphosphate, the likely precursor to a wide variety of bioactive diterpenoids, including antifeedants against insects (22Coll J.

Another class II diTPS, Pogostemon cablin PcTPS1, was found to catalyze the formation of (10R)-labda-8,13E-dienyl diphosphate, a likely precursor to an entire suite of diterpenes from the Lamioideae clade within the Lamiaceae. Further, in Origanum majorana, a culinary herb without reported diterpene accumulation, the characterization of multiple new diTPSs led us to the discovery of some of the corresponding diterpenes in planta. We anticipate that this work will serve as a new foundation for continued discovery of diTPSs in the Lamiaceae. To this end, we have endeavored to make our analyses and results, including gene sequences, raw and processed spectroscopic data, code, and extensive data tables, available in human- and machine-readable formats to be used, adapted, and extended by ourselves and other researchers in the future. To help determine the most promising species to find previously unknown diTPS activities, it was necessary to compile a data set of diterpene occurrence in Lamiaceae species and a data set of functionally characterized diTPS genes from the Lamiaceae. Information about diterpene occurrence was collected from three sources: SISTEMAT, DNP, and NAPRALERT. SISTEMAT (25Vestri Alvarenga S.A. Pierre Gastmans J. do Vale Rodrigues G.

The NCBI Taxonomy database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22139910): D136-D14310.1093/nar/gkr1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). To put structure occurrence into clearer evolutionary context, we annotated each genus as a member of one of the 12 primary, monophyletic clades that form the backbone of Lamiaceae, as delineated by Li et al. (28Li B. Cantino P.D. Olmstead R.G. Bramley G.L.C. Xiang C.-L. Ma Z.-H. Tan Y.-H. Zhang D.-X. A large-scale chloroplast phylogeny of the Lamiaceae sheds new light on its subfamilial classification.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27748362): 3434310.1038/srep34343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) on the basis of chloroplast genome sequence. In the context of diTPSs, examination of skeletons can be helpful because the skeleton often resembles the diTPS product more obviously than a highly decorated downstream product would. We therefore extracted the skeletons from the DNP structures (Fig. S1 shows a graphical example of skeleton extraction). We assigned each skeleton according its reported presence in the 12 clades, as well as to genera, to help distinguish skeletons that may have arisen early in Lamiaceae evolution versus those that arose more recently. A full tabulation of the skeletons from SISTEMAT and DNP can be found as Data set S3. The three databases were relatively consistent in their estimations of the diversity and distribution of diterpenes and diterpene skeletons (Fig. 1, A, B, and E). The data are snapshots of reports in the literature and certainly do not comprehensively reflect the true chemical diversity existing in nature. Some genera, such as Salvia, may be overrepresented due to their large number of species or their use in traditional medicine. A total of 239 skeletons are represented, with five (the kaurane (Sk1), clerodane (Sk2), abietane (Sk3), labdane (Sk4), and pimarane (Sk6)) being, by far, the most widely distributed and accounting for most of the total structures (Fig. 1, C and D). The clerodane skeleton, for example, has the widest distribution, having been reported in 27 genera representing 9 of the 12 primary clades, absent only in Tectona and two clades from which no diterpenes have yet been reported. The large number of less common, taxonomically restricted skeletons, including over 100 skeletons with only one associated compound (Fig. 1D), suggests that new diterpene synthase activities are continuously and independently arising across the Lamiaceae family tree. Therefore, a search across many species and genera should be a good strategy for finding diterpene synthases with new activities. Through a comprehensive literature search, we built a reference set of known Lamiaceae diTPSs and their activities. 54 functional diTPSs have been reported in this family, corresponding to 30 class II and 24 class I enzymes (Data set S1). Combinations of these diterpene synthases account for 27 distinct products accounting for six different skeletons, the five widely distributed skeletons (Sk1–4 and Sk6) as well as the less common atisane (Sk14) skeleton. This leaves 233 skeletons for which the biosynthetic route remains unknown. It is important to note that a single skeleton can correspond to multiple diTPS products, distinguished through stereochemical configuration, position of double bonds, or functionalization, so there is also a possibility of finding new diTPS activities for skeletons already accounted for by known enzymes. We used BLAST searches (29Camacho C. Coulouris G. Avagyan V. Ma N. Papadopoulos J. Bealer K. Madden T.L.

A total of 163 candidate sequences met our search criteria. The count of diTPS candidates was cross-referenced to the count of diterpenes and diterpene skeletons reported from each species and genus (Fig. 2C and Data set S2). Finally, a phylogenetic tree was generated from the peptide sequences from the reference set, alongside those from the new transcriptome data, including established substrates and products for each enzyme (Fig. 2 (A and B) and Fig. S20). We selected candidate genes from species, such as Mentha spicata and O. majorana, where the transcriptome data showed multiple candidate diTPSs but where few or no diterpene structures have been reported. We also selected genes that had relatively low homology to known enzymes, as judged by visual inspection of the phylogenetic trees, and in this way attempted to evenly cover the sequence homology space. Finally, we chose a few candidates from P. barbatus and Salva officinalis, based on the great diversity of diterpenes that have been reported from their genera. Fig. 3 presents a summary of Lamiaceae diTPS activities reported from previous work, together with our newly characterized diTPS activities. Class II activities were established based on comparisons of extracts from Nicotiana benthamiana transiently expressing new genes with those expressing known diTPS combinations. Class II diTPS products retain the diphosphate group from the GGPP substrate. When expressed in vivo, whether in Escherichia coli or N. benthamiana, without a compatible class I diTPS, a diphosphate product degrades to the corresponding alcohol, presumably by the action of nonspecific endogenous phosphatases. Due to difficulties in purifying and structurally characterizing diphosphate class II products, it is customary in the field to instead characterize these derivative alcohols (14Heskes A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2902591574,"Endothelial cells are reported to be glycolytic and to minimally rely on mitochondria for ATP generation. Rather than providing energy, mitochondria in endothelial cells may act as signaling organelles that control cytosolic Ca2+ signaling or modify reactive oxygen species (ROS). To control Ca2+ signaling, these organelles are often observed close to influx and release sites and may be tethered near Ca2+ transporters. In this study, we used high-resolution, wide-field fluorescence imaging to investigate the regulation of Ca2+ signaling by mitochondria in large numbers of endothelial cells (∼50 per field) in intact arteries from rats. We observed that mitochondria were mostly spherical or short-rod structures and were distributed widely throughout the cytoplasm. The density of these organelles did not increase near contact sites with smooth muscle cells. However, local inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ signaling predominated near these contact sites and required polarized mitochondria. Of note, mitochondrial control of Ca2+ signals occurred even when mitochondria were far from Ca2+ release sites. Indeed, the endothelial mitochondria were mobile and moved throughout the cytoplasm. Mitochondrial control of Ca2+ signaling was mediated by ATP production, which, when reduced by mitochondrial depolarization or ATP synthase inhibition, eliminated local IP3-mediated Ca2+ release events. ROS buffering did not significantly alter local Ca2+ release events. These results highlight the importance of mitochondrial ATP production in providing long-range control of endothelial signaling via IP3-evoked local Ca2+ release in intact endothelium."

The study was designed as a multi-centre retrospective cohort study. We approached women with histologically confirmed endometriosis from 2010 until 2016, comparing women satisfied to women dissatisfied with medical support. We analysed data on characteristics of endometriosis, PSwMS and the influence of disease characteristics on PSwMS. Information on satisfaction with medical support was collected through a standardized questionnaire. After exclusion of 73 women because of inchoately filled in questionnaires, data from 498 women was evaluated. Altogether, it was observed that 54.6% (n = 272) of the study participants were satisfied with medical support and 45.4% (n = 226) were not. Feeling adequately informed by the time of diagnosis (p < 0.001), taking women's mental troubles seriously (p < 0.001) and supporting women in handling their pain (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with satisfaction. We found adequate information to be the most distinctive indicator for PSwMS. Further, acknowledging psychological distress and supporting women in handling their symptoms rather than to alleviate them, positively affect PSwMS. To achieve PSwMS, healthcare providers have to give adequate information on endometriosis and its management."
https://openalex.org/W2902707079,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a multidomain cytosolic hydrolase acting mostly on nonhistone protein substrates. Investigations of the substrate specificity of HDAC6 are confounded by the presence of 2 catalytically active deacetylase domains (DD1 and DD2). In this study, acetylome peptide microarrays and peptide libraries were used to map the substrate specificity of DD1 and DD2 of human HDAC6. The results show that DD1 is solely responsible for the deacetylation of substrates harboring the acetyllysine at their C terminus, whereas DD2 exclusively deacetylates peptides with an internal acetyllysine residue. Also, statistical analysis of the deacetylation data revealed amino acid preferences at individual positions flanking the acetyllysine, where glycine and arginine residues are favored at positions N-terminal to the central acetyllysine; negatively charged glutamate is strongly disfavored throughout the sequence. Finally, the deacylation activity of HDAC6 was profiled by using a panel of acyl derivatives of the optimized peptide substrate and showed that HDAC6 acts as a proficient deformylase. Our data thus offer a detailed insight into the substrate preferences of the individual HDAC6 domains at the peptide level, and these findings can in turn help in elucidating the biologic roles of the enzyme and facilitate the development of new domain-specific inhibitors as research tools or therapeutic agents.-Kutil, Z., Skultetyova, L., Rauh, D., Meleshin, M., Snajdr, I., Novakova, Z., Mikesova, J., Pavlicek, J., Hadzima, M., Baranova, P., Havlinova, B., Majer, P., Schutkowski, M., Barinka, C.

We evidenced NOD1 induction in atherosclerotic human and mouse tissues, predominantly in vascular endothelial cells. Accordingly, NOD1 genetic inactivation in Apoe−/− mice reduced not only atherosclerosis burden, but also monocyte and neutrophil accumulation in atheromata. Of note, in the presence of either peptidoglycan or oxidized LDLs, endothelial NOD1 triggered VCAM-1 up-regulation through the RIP2-NF-κB axis in an autocrine manner, enhancing firm adhesion of both sets of myeloid cells to the inflamed micro- and macro vasculature in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2902360204,"Among the vast number of identified protein families, allergens emanate from relatively few families which translates to only a small fraction of identified protein families. In allergy diagnostics and immunotherapy, interactions between immunoglobulin E and allergens are crucial because the formation of an allergen-antibody complex is necessary for triggering an allergic reaction. In allergic diseases, there is a phenomenon known as cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity describes a situation where an individual has produced antibodies against a particular allergenic protein, but said antibodies fail to discriminate between the original sensitizer and other similar proteins that usually belong to the same family. To expound the concept of cross-reactivity, this study examines ten protein families that include allergens selected specifically for the analysis of cross-reactivity. The selected allergen families had at least 13 representative proteins, overall folds that differ significantly between families, and include relevant allergens with various potencies. The selected allergens were analyzed using information on sequence similarities and identities between members of the families as well as reports on clinically relevant cross-reactivities. Based on our analysis, we propose to introduce a new A-RISC index (Allergens'-Relative Identity, Similarity and Cross-reactivity) which describes homology between two allergens belonging to the same protein family and is used to predict the likelihood of cross-reactivity between them. Information on sequence similarities and identities, as well as on the values of the proposed A-RISC index is used to introduce four categories describing a risk of a cross-reactive reaction, namely: high, medium-high, medium-low and low. The proposed approach can facilitate analysis in component-resolved allergy diagnostics, generation of avoidance guidelines for allergic individuals, and help with the design of immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2902830134,"Lactation is a mammalian attribute, and the few known nonmammal examples have distinctly different modalities. We document here milk provisioning in a jumping spider, which compares functionally and behaviorally to lactation in mammals. The spiderlings ingest nutritious milk droplets secreted from the mother’s epigastric furrow until the subadult stage. Milk is indispensable for offspring survival in the early stages and complements their foraging in later stages. Maternal care, as for some long-lived vertebrates, continues after the offspring reach maturity. Furthermore, a female-biased adult sex ratio is acquired only when the mother is present. These findings demonstrate that mammal-like milk provisioning and parental care for sexually mature offspring have also evolved in invertebrates, encouraging a reevaluation of their occurrence across the animal kingdom, especially in invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2903257803,"Aging and neurodegenerative diseases share a condition of neuroinflammation entailing the production of endogenous cell debris in the CNS that must be removed by microglia ( i.e., resident macrophages), to restore tissue homeostasis. In this context, extension of microglial cell branches toward cell debris underlies the mechanisms of microglial migration and phagocytosis. Amoeboid morphology and the consequent loss of microglial branch functionality characterizes dysregulated microglia. Microglial migration is assisted by another glial population, the astroglia, which forms a dense meshwork of cytoplasmic projections. Amoeboid microglia and disrupted astrocyte meshwork are consistent traits in aged CNS. In this study, we assessed a possible correlation between microglia and astroglia morphology in rat models of chronic neuroinflammation and aging, by 3-dimensional confocal analysis implemented with particle analysis. Our findings suggest that a microglia-astroglia interaction occurs in rat hippocampus via cell-cell contacts, mediating microglial cell branching in the presence of inflammation. In aged rats, the impairment of such an interaction correlates with altered distribution, morphology, and inefficient clearance by microglia. These data support the idea that generally accepted functional boundaries between microglia and astrocytes should be re-evaluated to better understand how their functions overlap and interact.-Lana, D., Ugolini, F., Wenk, G.

https://openalex.org/W2901992096,"It has previously been shown that pretreatment of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) promoted increased uptake of fatty acids and increased triacylglycerol accumulation, compared to pretreatment with oleic acid (OA) and palmitic acid (PA). The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty acid metabolism was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled oleic acid as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty acid oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA. Lipid distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty acid re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms “Neutral lipid metabolic process” and “Regulation of lipid storage”. Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty acid accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty acid turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG—FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy metabolism."

Serum laboratory values to include inflammatory biomarkers were measured, and end organ histology was evaluated. Tranexamic acid treatment was associated with a significant decrease in serum IL-1β at six and 24 hours and IL-10 at 24 hours from start of shock compared to vehicle control. Histologic analysis demonstrated mild decreases in both perivascular pulmonary edema and follicular mesenteric lymph node hyperplasia in the tranexamic acid treatment group but also increased myocardial lymphocytic infiltration with necrosis and degeneration. Tranexamic acid was also associated with a small but significant increase in peripheral neutrophil count as well as a significant decrease in neutrophil aggregation in pulmonary tissue at six hours post-injury. These data thus demonstrate a mixed effect of tranexamic acid. While there was an improvement in pulmonary edema and a suppressive effect on several key inflammatory mediators, there was also increased myocardial degeneration and necrosis, which is possibly related to the pro-thrombotic effect of tranexamic acid."

For the first time, the extracts of this plant were assessed for the presence of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants, as well as inhibition of tyrosinase, free radicals scavenging and sunscreen protection. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging (DPPH) and β-carotene bleaching assay. The tyrosinase inhibitory activity was evaluated and calculated the EC50. The photoprotective activity was measured using different concentrations of D. ecastaphyllum extracts. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of the samples was higher than 6, and the sample from Ilhéus showed the most pronounced photoprotective effect. Sample from Canavieiras presented the highest antioxidant activity by free radical scavenging DPPH and β-carotene bleaching method, with 92.41% and 48.34%, respectively. All samples inhibited the tyrosinase, especially the sample from Prado that was most effective (124.62 μg.mL-1). Significant negative correlation was found between flavonoid contents and inhibition of tyrosinase. The overall results provide relevant information about the Dalbergia ecastaphyllum species, indicating as potential material to cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry."
https://openalex.org/W2903341715,"Background The spectrum of motor neuron disease (MND) includes numerous phenotypes with various life expectancies. The degree of upper and lower motor neuron involvement can impact prognosis. Phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) imaging has been shown to detect in vivo gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy in the spinal cord of other patient populations but has not been explored in MND. Methods In this study, total cord, WM and GM areas of ten patients with a diagnosis within the MND spectrum were compared to those of ten healthy controls (HC). Patients’ diagnosis included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis, primary muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy and ALS-Frontotemporal dementia. Axial 2D PSIR images were acquired at four cervical disc levels (C2-C3, C3-C4, C5-C6 and C7-T1) with a short acquisition time (2 minutes) protocol. Total cross-sectional areas (TCA), GM and WM areas were measured using a combination of highly reliable manual and semi-automated methods. Cord areas in MND patients were compared with HC using linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex. Correlation of WM and GM areas in MND patients was explored to gain insights into underlying atrophy patterns. Results MND patients as a group had significantly smaller cervical cord GM area compared to HC at all four levels (C2-C3: p = .009; C3-C4: p = .001; C5-C6: p = .006; C7-T1: p = .002). WM area at C5-C6 level was significantly smaller (p = .001). TCA was significantly smaller at C3-C4 (p = .018) and C5-C6 (p = .002). No significant GM and WM atrophy was detected in the two patients with predominantly bulbar phenotype. Concomitant GM and WM atrophy was detected in solely upper or lower motor neuron level phenotypes. There was a significant correlation between GM and WM areas at all four levels in this diverse population of MND. Conclusion Spinal cord GM and WM atrophy can be detected in vivo in patients within the MND spectrum using a short acquisition time 2D PSIR imaging protocol. PSIR imaging shows promise as a method for quantifying spinal cord involvement and thus may be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and for monitoring disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2902478435,"Heat shock causes proteotoxic stress that induces various cellular responses, including delayed mitotic progression and the generation of an aberrant number of chromosomes. In this study, heat shock delayed the onset of anaphase by increasing the number of misoriented cells, accompanied by the kinetochore localization of budding uninhibited by benzimidazole-related (BubR)1 in a monopolar spindle (Mps)1-dependent manner. The mitotic delay was canceled by knockdown of mitotic arrest defect (Mad)2. Knockdown of heat shock protein (Hsp)105 partially abrogated the mitotic delay with the loss of the kinetochore localization of BubR1 under heat shock conditions and accelerated mitotic progression under nonstressed conditions. Consistent with this result, Hsp105 knockdown increased the number of anaphase cells with lagging chromosomes, through mitotic slippage, and decreased taxol sensitivity more than Mad2 knockdown. Hsp105 was coprecipitated with cell division cycle (Cdc)20 in an Mps1-dependent manner; however, its knockdown did not affect coprecipitation of Mad2 and BubR1 with Cdc20. We propose that heat shock delays the onset of anaphase via the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Hsp105 prevents abnormal cell division by contributing to SAC activation under heat shock and nonstressed conditions by interacting with Cdc20 but not affecting formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex.-Kakihana, A., Oto, Y., Saito, Y., Nakayama, Y. Heat shock-induced mitotic arrest requires heat shock protein 105 for the activation of spindle assembly checkpoint."

They are potentially applicable for the production of useful compounds but may also cause poisoning or at least health problems as they can produce cyanotoxins. The introduction of a fast methodology is important not only for fundamental taxonomic purposes, but also for reliable identifications in biological studies. In this work, we have used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of intact cells to study Chroococcidiopsis strains. A library of the obtained reference mass spectra containing characteristic peptide/protein profiles was examined by software tools to characterize similarities and differences applicable for diagnostics and taxonomy. Both a similarity tree and heat map constructed from the mass spectrometric data proved consistent with 16S rRNA sequencing results. We show as novelty that a binary matrix combining ferulic and sinapinic acids performs well in acquiring reproducible mass spectra of cyanobacteria. Using the matrix solvent, a protein extraction from cells was done. After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the separated protein fractions were in-gel digested and the resulting peptides analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. For the first time, photosystem protein components, phycobilisome proteins, electron transport proteins, nitrogen-metabolism and nucleic acids binding-proteins, cytochromes plus other enzymes and various uncharacterized proteins could be assigned to characteristic peaks in the mass spectrometric profiles and some of them suggested as markers in addition to 30S and 50S ribosomal proteins known from previous studies employing intact cell mass spectrometry of microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2902895232,"Diabetes mellitus causes systemic disorders. We previously demonstrated that diabetic condition forced bone marrow–derived cells (BMDCs) to express TNF-α, leading to the development of diabetic neuropathy in mice. Here, we hypothesized that these abnormal BMDCs are also involved in diabetic nephropathy. To test our hypothesis, mice were irradiated to receive total bone marrow (BM) from the transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein before diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Confocal microscopy showed that the diabetic glomerulus had more BMDCs compared with the nondiabetic glomerulus. Most of these cells exhibited endothelial phenotypes, being negative for several markers, including podocin (a maker of podocyte), α8 integrin (mesangial cell), CD68, and F4/80 (macrophage). Next, the total BM of diabetic mice was transplanted into nondiabetic mice to examine if diabetic BM per se could cause glomerular injury. The recipient mice exhibiting normal glycemia developed albuminuria and mesangial expansion with an increase in capillary area. The number of BMDCs increased in the glomerulus of the recipient mice. These cells were found to exhibit the endothelial phenotype and to express TNF-α. These data suggest that diabetic BMDCs per se could initiate glomerular disease. Finally, eNOS knockout mice were used to examine if residential endothelial injury could attract BMDCs into the glomerulus. However, endothelial dysfunction due to eNOS deficiency failed to attract BMDCs into the glomerulus. In summary, BMDCs may be involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy.—Nobuta, H., Katagi, M., Kume, S., Terashima, T., Araki, S., Maegawa, H., Kojima, H., Nakagawa, T.

https://openalex.org/W2949304638,"We have developed a computational model of gas mixing and ventilation in the human lung represented as a bifurcating network. We have simulated multiple-breath washout (MBW), a clinical test for measuring ventilation heterogeneity (VH) in patients with obstructive lung conditions. By applying airway constrictions inter-regionally, we have predicted the response of MBW indices to obstructions and found that they detect a narrow range of severe constrictions that reduce airway radius to 10%-30% of healthy values. These results help to explain the success of the MBW test to distinguish obstructive lung conditions from healthy controls. Further, we have used a perturbative approach to account for intra-regional airway heterogeneity that avoids modelling each airway individually. We have found, for random airway heterogeneity, that the variance in MBW indices is greater when indices are already elevated due to constrictions. By quantifying this effect, we have shown that variability in lung structure and mechanical properties alone can lead to clinically significant variability in MBW indices (specifically the Lung Clearance Index-LCI, and the gradient of phase-III slopes-Scond), but only in cases simulating obstructive lung conditions. This method is a computationally efficient way to probe the lung's sensitivity to structural changes, and to quantify uncertainty in predictions due to random variations in lung mechanical and structural properties."
https://openalex.org/W2902204506,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have crucial roles in immune-related diseases. However, it is difficult to explore DCs because of their rareness and heterogeneity. Although previous studies had been performed to detect the phenotypic characteristics of DC populations, the functional diversity has been ignored. Using a combination of flow cytometry, single-cell quantitative PCR, and bioinformatic analysis, we depicted the DC panorama with not only phenotypic but also functional markers. Functional classification of DCs in mouse lymphoid tissue (spleen) and nonlymphoid tissue (liver) was performed. The results revealed that expression of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) and C–C motif chemokine receptors (CCR)1, CCR2, and CCR4 were elevated in liver DCs, suggesting increased lipid uptake and migration abilities. The enriched expression of costimulatory molecule CD80, TLR9, and TLR adaptor MYD88 in spleen DCs indicated a more-mature phenotype, enhanced pathogen recognition, and T-cell stimulation abilities. Furthermore, we compared DCs in the atherosclerotic mouse models with healthy controls. In addition to the quantitative increase in DCs in the liver and spleen of the apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE−/−) mice, the functional expression patterns of the DCs also changed at the single-cell level. These results promote our understanding of the participation of DCs in inflammatory diseases and have potential applications in DC clinical assessment.—Shi, Q., Zhuang, F., Liu, J.-T., Li, N., Chen, Y.-X., Su, X.-B., Yao, A.-H., Yao, Q.-P., Han, Y., Li, S.-S., Qi, Y.-X., Jiang, Z.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2903007454,"Self-absorption describes a pathological tendency towards the internal mental world (internalization) that often conflicts with the accurate monitoring of the external world. In performance monitoring, an augmented electrophysiological response evoked by internal signals in patients with anxiety or depressive disorder seems to reflect this tendency. Specifically, the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), an index of error processing based on internal signals, is larger in patients compared to controls. In the present experiment, we investigated whether the preferential processing of internal signals in patients is linked to diminished and inflexible external signal processing. To this end, the electrophysiological response evoked by external signals was analysed in patients with panic disorder and healthy controls. Participants performed a choice-response task, where informative or uninformative feedback followed each response, and a passive viewing task. As a replication of previous studies, patients presented an augmented Ne/ERN, indexing enhanced processing of internal signals related to errors. Furthermore, the vertex positive potential (VPP) evoked by visual stimuli was larger in patients than in controls, suggesting enhanced attention to external signals. Moreover, patients and controls showed similar sensitivity to the feedback information content, indicating a normal flexibility in the allocation of monitoring resources to external signals depending on how informative these signals are for performance monitoring. These results suggest that the tendency towards internal signals in patients with panic disorder does not hinder the flexible processing of external signals. On the contrary, external signals seem to attract enhanced processing in patients compared to controls."

But the leaves were fully almost recovering after re-watering 24h. The activity of SOD and POD were almost doubled under drought stress. The content of osmotic regulating substance proline and soluble sugar were three times than control group. But after re-watering, these indexes were declined rapidly. Three cDNA libraries of control, drought stress, and re-watering treatments were constructed. There were 43,129,228, 47,116,844, and 42,815,454 clean reads with Q20 values of 98.06, 98.04, and 97.88respectively.SRA accession number of raw data was PRJNA498187 on NCBI. A total of 8672, 6043, and 6537 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in control vs drought stress, control vs re-watering, and drought stress vs re-watering, respectively. In addition, 1039, 1016, and 980 transcription factors (TFs) were identified, respectively. Among them, 363, 267, and 299 TFs were identified as DEGs in drought stress, re-watering, and drought stress and re-watering, respectively. These differentially expressed TFs mainly belonged to the bHLH, bZIP, C2H2, ERF, MYB, MYB-related, and NAC families. A comparative analysis found that 1174 genes were up-regulated and 2344 were down-regulated under drought stress and this pattern was the opposite to that found after re-watering. Among the up-regulated genes, 64 genes were homologous to known functional genes that directly protect plants against drought stress. Furthermore, 44 protein kinases and 38 TFs with opposite expression patterns under drought stress and re-watering were identified, which are possibly candidate regulators for drought stress resistance in M. tenacissima. Our study is the first to characterize the M. tenacissima transcriptome in response to drought stress, and will serve as a useful resource for future studies on the functions of candidate protein kinases and TFs involved in M. tenacissima drought stress resistance."

However, the molecular mechanism underlying inner centromere assembly remains elusive. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing in HeLa cells, we disrupted the interaction of Shugoshin 1 (Sgo1) with histone H2A phosphorylated on Thr-120 (H2ApT120) to selectively release Sgo1 from mitotic centromeres. Interestingly, cells expressing the H2ApT120-binding defective mutant of Sgo1 have an elevated rate of chromosome missegregation accompanied by weakened centromeric cohesion and decreased centromere accumulation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), an integral part of the inner centromere and a key player in the correction of erroneous kinetochore–microtubule attachments. When artificially tethered to centromeres, a Sgo1 mutant defective in binding protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is not able to support proper centromeric cohesion and CPC accumulation, indicating that the Sgo1–PP2A interaction is essential for the integrity of mitotic centromeres. We further provide evidence indicating that Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesin to create a binding site for the histone H3–associated protein kinase Haspin, which not only inhibits the cohesin release factor Wapl and thereby strengthens centromeric cohesion but also phosphorylates histone H3 at Thr-3 to position CPC at inner centromeres.

Sgo1 also promotes centromeric accumulation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), an integral part of the inner centromere and a key regulator of KT–MT attachments that consists of Aurora B kinase and the regulatory subunits Survivin, Borealin, and INCENP (38Carmena M.

It is currently unclear whether and how Sgo1 and Haspin cooperate to protect cohesin and localize the CPC at mitotic centromeres (21Morales C. Losada A. Establishing and dissolving cohesion during the vertebrate cell cycle.Curr. Opin.

In this study, we show that selective delocalization of Sgo1 from mitotic centromeres by disrupting the H2ApT120–Sgo1 interaction results in loosened centromeric cohesion, which is accompanied by decreased centromeric localization of CPC and an elevated rate of chromosome missegregation. We further reveal the molecular mechanism by which Sgo1 and Haspin cooperate to allow proper assembly of the functional inner centromere and ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Sgo1 directly binds H2ApT120 through a conserved SGO motif in its C-terminal region (27Kawashima S.A. Yamagishi Y. Honda T. Ishiguro K. Watanabe Y.

To study the role of Sgo1 at centromeres, we set out to make the K492A mutation in endogenous Sgo1 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in HeLa cells (50Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 (24157548): 2281-230810.1038/nprot.2013.143Crossref PubMed Scopus (6409) Google Scholar). We obtained two clones, 3-9 and 3-1, in which the K492A mutation was confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing (Fig. 1A). Unless otherwise stated, we used clone 3-9 as the Sgo1-K492A mutant cells for the following studies. Immunoblotting of lysates from mitotic cells arrested with the microtubule destabilizer nocodazole showed that the Sgo1-K492A mutant protein was expressed at a level comparable with that of WT Sgo1 in control HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the Sgo1-K492A mutant failed to localize at mitotic centromeres, whereas H2ApT120 remained unaffected (Fig. 1C). Inspection of chromosome spreads prepared from nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells showed that the Sgo1-K492A mutant displayed diffuse signals on chromosome arms (Fig. S1A), likely because of its capability of binding cohesin (19Hara K.

We also noticed that sister chromatids in the Sgo1-K492A mutant cells remained paired after 3-h treatment with nocodazole, indicating that loss of centromeric Sgo1 does not prevent the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Moreover, the percentage of cells with partly closed chromosome arms was higher in Sgo1-K492A cells than in control HeLa cells (Fig. 1D), which is in line with the impaired chromosome arm resolution in Bub1-depleted or -inhibited cells (23Tang Z.

We next examined whether Sgo1-K492A cells have defects in sister chromatid cohesion. We found that Sgo1-K492A cells were strongly impaired in maintaining chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate during the sustained metaphase arrest induced by MG132 (Fig. 1, E and F), a proteasome inhibitor that prevents degradation of Cyclin B and Securin and therefore inhibits Separase activation. Inspection of chromosome spreads prepared from MG132-arrested mitotic cells revealed a strong increase in premature sister chromatid separation in Sgo1-K492A cells (Fig. 1, G and H). After 8-h treatment with MG132, the percentage of cells with cohesion loss increased from 1.2% in control HeLa cells to 23.2%-29.0% in Sgo1-K492A cells. Moreover, the percentage of cells with mild premature sister chromatid separation was also obviously higher in Sgo1-K492A cells (33.9%-42.0%) than in control HeLa cells (14.3%). These cohesion defects resemble an accelerated “cohesion fatigue” phenotype (52Daum J.R. Potapova T.A. Sivakumar S. Daniel J.J. Flynn J.N. Rankin S. Gorbsky G.J.

We have used immunofluorescence and time-lapse calcium imaging of cultured explanted embryonic rat kidneys to study the role of calcium signaling for branching morphogenesis. In mesenchymal cells, we recorded spontaneous calcium activity that was characterized by irregular calcium transients. The calcium signals were dependent on release of calcium from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. Down-regulation of the calcium activity, both by blocking the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and by chelating cytosolic calcium, resulted in retardation of branching morphogenesis and a reduced formation of primitive nephrons but had no effect on cell proliferation. We propose that spontaneous calcium activity contributes with a stochastic factor to the self-organizing process that controls branching morphogenesis, a major determinant of the ultimate number of nephrons in the kidney.—Fontana, J.

https://openalex.org/W2902776504,"Background Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) affects the entire cellular network of the organism. Some patients develop cognitive disturbances due to the disease, but several authors have suggested that the brain develops compensatory mechanisms to minimize or prevent neuropsychological decline. The present study aimed to assess the effective connectivity underlying visuospatial working memory performance in young adults diagnosed with T1D using neuroimaging techniques (fMRI). Methods Fifteen T1D right-handed, young adults with sustained metabolic clinical stability and a control group matched by age, sex, and educational level voluntarily participated. All participants performed 2 visuospatial working memory tasks using a block design within an MRI scanner. Regions of interest and their signal values were obtained. Effective connectivity—by means of structural equations models—was evaluated for each group and task through maximum likelihood estimation, and the model with the best fit was chosen in each case. Results Compared to the control group, the patient group showed a significant reduction in brain activity in the two estimated networks (one for each group and task). The models of effective connectivity showed greater brain connectivity in healthy individuals, as well as a more complex network. T1D patients showed a pattern of connectivity mainly involving the cerebellum and the red nucleus. In contrast, the control group showed a connectivity network predominantly involving brain areas that are typically activated while individuals are performing working memory tasks. Conclusion Our results suggest a specific effective connectivity between the cerebellum and the red nucleus in T1D patients during working memory tasks, probably reflecting a compensatory mechanism to fulfill task demands."

https://openalex.org/W2902852069,"Scholarly studies and common accounts of national politics enjoy pointing out the resilience of ideological divides among populations. Building on the image of political cleavages and geographic polarization, the regionalization of politics has become a truism across Northern democracies. Left unquestioned, this geography plays a central role in shaping electoral and referendum campaigns. In Europe and North America, observers identify recurring patterns dividing local populations during national votes. While much research describes those patterns in relation to ethnicity, religious affiliation, historic legacy and party affiliation, current approaches in political research lack the capacity to measure their evolution over time or other vote subsets. This article introduces “Dyadic Agreement Modeling” (DyAM), a transdisciplinary method to assess the evolution of geographic cleavages in vote outcomes by implementing a metric of agreement/disagreement through Network Analysis. Unlike existing approaches, DyAM offers a stable measure for political agreement and disagreement—accounting for chance, statistically robust and remaining structurally independent from the number of entries and missing data. The method opens up to a range of statistical, structural and visual tools specific to Network Analysis and its usage across disciplines. In order to illustrate DyAM, I use more than 680,000 municipal outcomes from Swiss federal popular votes and assess the evolution of political cleavages across local populations since 1981. Results suggest that political congruence between Swiss local populations increased in the last forty years, while regional political factions and linguistic alignments have lost their salience to new divides. I discuss how choices about input parameters and data subsets nuance findings, and consider confounding factors that may influence conclusions over the dynamic equilibrium of national politics and the strengthening effect of globalization on democratic institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2902999802,"The accurate measurement of educational attainment is of great importance for population research. Past studies measuring average years of schooling rely on strong assumptions to incorporate binned data. These assumptions, which we refer to as the standard duration method, have not been previously evaluated for bias or accuracy.We assembled a database of 1,680 survey and census datasets, representing both binned and single-year education data. We developed two models that split bins of education into single year values. We evaluate our models, and compare them to the standard duration method, using out-of-sample predictive validity.Our results indicate that typical methods used to split bins of educational attainment introduce substantial error and bias into estimates of average years of schooling, as compared to new approaches. Globally, the standard duration method underestimates average years of schooling, with a median error of -0.47 years. This effect is especially pronounced in datasets with a smaller number of bins or higher true average attainment, leading to irregular error patterns between geographies and time periods. Both models we developed resulted in unbiased predictions of average years of schooling, with smaller average error than previous methods. We find that one approach using a metric of distance in space and time to identify training data, had the best performance, with a root mean squared error of mean attainment of 0.26 years, compared to 0.92 years for the standard duration algorithm.Education is a key social indicator and its accurate estimation should be a population research priority. The use of a space-time distance bin-splitting model drastically improved the estimation of average years of schooling from binned education data. We provide a detailed description of how to use the method and recommend that future studies estimating educational attainment across time or geographies use a similar approach."

The Hsp90 chaperon has special responsibility for folding of protein kinases including IKKβ. Here, we found that Hsp90 inhibition induced IKKβ degradation, which is partially mediated by Keap1. Geldanamycin (GA), a Hsp90 inhibitor, enhances association of IKKβ with Keap1 through the binding site in KD, and translocates IKKβ to detergent-insoluble fractions leading to its autophagic degradation. An electrophile tBHQ suppressed Keap1-mediated proteasomal Nrf2 degradation but not autophagic IKKβ degradation. Substitution mutation of Leu353 to Ala in the ULD destabilizes IKKβ, enhances its association with Keap1, translocates it to detergent-insoluble fractions, and causes its autophagic degradation. These results suggest that Keap1 is involved in the degradation of structural destabilized IKKβ and negative regulation of NF-κB under proteotoxic stress."

When I arrived in sunny California 2 years earlier to start my Ph.D. studies, I was on top of the world. But that feeling of triumph vanished quickly. The uncertainty that had nagged at me for years grew overwhelming. I loved learning new things and talking about science, yet I couldn't envision working at the bench for the rest of my life. But after building my identity around being a scientist, how could I turn away? Stanford was, in many ways, my Hail Mary. If I was going to be happy, it had to be there—right?

> “I didn't see my problems as legitimate, so I didn't seek help.” 

I loved the students in my program. My classes were marvelously interesting and challenging. I found a mentor who cared about his students. I was pursuing fascinating research questions. I had a nice apartment, the most supportive and wonderful girlfriend imaginable, and loving parents. Despite all this, I was profoundly unhappy.

When you have so much to be thankful for, are you really going through a hard time? I was suffering under the simmering pressure of graduate school. But graduate students are expected to work hard. I didn't see my problems as legitimate, so I didn't seek help.

That was my biggest mistake. I had behaved similarly a few years earlier, when the end of a long-term relationship sent me spiraling into a deep depression. I didn't seek help then either, and I was proud of the fact that I didn't need any. I had more important things to do than focus on my own sadness.

In grad school, I kept giving myself milestones when I thought I would stumble upon happiness. Maybe after I passed my classes, I'd be happy. Maybe after I found the right lab and project, I'd be happy. I tried to kick the proverbial can so far down the road that it would disappear over the horizon. But there it was, staring me in the face: joy, just beyond my reach.

It's difficult to describe what it feels like to reach the end of the road. For me, it meant months of leaving the lab in the middle of the day because I couldn't breathe, anxiety wrapped around my throat and refusing to let go. I would sneak to a secluded corner under a staircase to cry or sit in the pews of the beautiful campus church, hoping that the heavy doors would keep terrible thoughts from breaking in. One day, I stayed home from lab. I made my coffee, answered emails—and prepared to end my life.

But as I talked to my girlfriend that afternoon, I found myself telling her that I was having bad thoughts. She dropped everything, ran home to see me, and called a hotline. The therapist recommended that I go to the emergency room.

The doctors diagnosed me with major depressive disorder, with episodes of anxiety. After 6 days in the psychiatric ward, I spent 3 months going to therapy for 20 hours a week and started to take antidepressants. My graduate school life came to a screeching halt. I felt guilty for leaving the lab so abruptly, but my graduate program director sent a simple, welcome message: Take all the time you need, and we'll be ready to talk when you are.

Hitting a brick wall as fast as I did was a pretty clear sign that I needed to make some changes. A few months after leaving the hospital, I set up a meeting with the program director, bracing myself for what I thought was the inevitable end of my graduate school career. My director, however, proposed a solution I hadn't thought possible: What if I stayed in the program but left the bench and studied what I really love?

Now, that's exactly what I'm doing, exploring the world of science communication research. And before you ask, no, I have no idea where it will lead. But thinking about my future now fills me with a grand sense of adventure—not the dread I used to feel when I considered working another day in the lab. My director has made it clear that my mental health is his priority, and that it should be mine as well. That expectation has made a world of difference.

https://openalex.org/W2903450462,"A new push is underway cure hepatitis B virus (HBV), which chronically infects 300 million people around the world. Although a vaccine exists to prevent infection and drugs can stave off disease, the virus still kills 900,000 people each year from cirrhosis or liver cancer. The recent remarkable success with drugs that cure hepatitis C, which is unrelated but leads to the same life-threatening problems, has spurred hope that HBV, too, can be cured. A key problem is that HBV can exist in a latent form, a minichromosome known in shorthand as cccDNA, that persists even in the presence of powerful treatment. This odd virus can also cause harm in people who have no evidence of infection on standard tests. Nearly one-third of the human population lives with cccDNA of HBV, but they are said to have resolved the infection and suffer no harm—unless their immune systems are compromised by cancer treatments, HIV, or drugs that battle autoimmune disease. In these people, the cccDNA can lead to a sudden, raging infection that can quickly lead to liver failure and death. Several recent scientific advances have led to new drugs that target different parts of the viral life cycle, including cccDNA, and there9s increasing hope that even if they cannot eliminate the virus, they9ll create a functional cure, knocking back the virus so powerfully that people can stop treatment and let their immune systems contain the infection."

Leon Max Lederman passed away quietly on 3 October in Rexburg, Idaho. He was 96 years old. A pioneer in particle physics, Leon shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was an influential public champion for science and science education, a transformational scientific leader, and a role model to generations of scientists young and old.

Leon was born to Russian-Jewish immigrants in New York City on 15 July 1922. Although neither parent had finished school, they instilled in their son a love of learning that he carried with him all his life. Leon's education started at P.S. 92 on Broadway and 95th and ended just a few blocks north of that at Columbia University, where he received a Ph.D. in physics in 1951. In between, he attended New York public schools and earned his undergraduate chemistry degree from the City College of New York in 1943. Columbia University remained his academic home until he left to assume the directorship of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Batavia, Illinois, in 1979.

Leon often spoke with a combination of pride and humor about his early days at Columbia University. In 1956, Leon and collaborators used Brookhaven's Cosmotron to show the existence of the long-lived neutral kaon, the KL, distinct from the short-lived neutral kaon, the KS. This experiment established the weak eigenstates of the neutral kaon that were proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais in 1955. The next year, Leon's group used the Nevis accelerator to discover nonconservation of parity in muon decay. Remarkably, they conceived of the idea during the half-hour drive from the main campus to Nevis one Friday, constructed the experiment that evening, and collected the data by the end of the weekend, demonstrating clear evidence for the fundamental result.

In 1962, Leon and his colleagues led a team that established the existence of a second-generation neutrino, the muon neutrino. He would share the Nobel Prize in recognition of this work. In addition to the importance of the two-neutrino result in the development of the standard model of particle physics, the experiment pioneered the use of neutrino beams to study weak interactions.

In the 1970s, Leon's interests turned to particles produced at high transverse momentum in high-energy proton-proton collisions. A sequence of ever-higher-energy experiments at Brookhaven, the Intersecting Storage Ring at CERN, and finally at Fermilab culminated in the 1977 discovery of the bottom quark, one of six known quarks. Shortly afterward, Leon became the second director of Fermilab. During his three decades as an experimental particle physicist, he supervised 50 Columbia University Ph.D. candidates and was a mentor to many other young students and postdocs.

Influenced by his mentor, physicist and 1944 Nobel Prize winner Isidor Isaac Rabi, Leon thought big. His 1963 paper, “A truly national laboratory,” envisioned a new model for a national accelerator laboratory; the vision was realized in the 1967 founding of the National Accelerator Laboratory (renamed Fermilab). He was also a major proponent and spokesperson for the ill-fated Superconducting Super Collider, a planned 87-km-circumference accelerator that was approved in 1989 and canceled in 1993. He was a founding member of the High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel (to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later to the U.S. Department of Energy) and the International Committee on Future Accelerators.

As director of Fermilab from 1979 to 1989, Leon oversaw the construction of the Tevatron complex, the first superconducting accelerator and the world's most powerful accelerator from 1983 until it was eclipsed by CERN's Large Hadron Collider in 2009. Imagining unification of the inner space of particle physics with the outer space of cosmology, in 1983, Leon started the first astrophysics group at an accelerator laboratory. In addition to scientific leadership, with characteristic charm and humor, Leon transformed Fermilab from a frontier outpost in the cornfields of Illinois into a cosmopolitan center for science and science education.

As a professor at Columbia University, Leon reached many generations of undergraduates in his “physics for poets” class. He transposed his love of teaching to Fermilab, where he instigated Saturday Morning Physics, a weekend class for area high-school students featuring lectures by Leon and other Fermilab scientists. He also started a public education and outreach effort at Fermilab directed toward precollege students. Beyond Fermilab, Leon was a founder of a residential state-sponsored high school for science and mathematics and a Chicago-based teacher academy for math and science. His leadership in education and outreach inspired physicists to communicate with the public. The author of several books for the general public, including The God Particle , Leon wrote with the same humor, wit, and charm that drew people to his public lectures. He had no equal in communicating the joys of physics.

One of the great experiences of Fermilab in the 1980s was dining with the Ledermans in their Fermilab farmhouse. Some guests would be from Fermilab and others would be U.S. senators, cabinet members, Department of Energy officials, writers, artists, and poets. After a wonderful dinner prepared by Leon's wife, Ellen, we would retire to the living room, where there always seemed to be a large fire, even in summer. Over cigars and (a lot of) cognac, Leon would regale us with tales of his life in (and out of ) physics with humor and wit. He made his discoveries sound easy, but we knew they were built on years of experience.

After stepping down as director of Fermilab, Leon was a professor of physics at the University of Chicago and later at the Illinois Institute for Technology in Chicago. In 2012, Leon retired to rural Idaho. The boy from the Bronx transitioned to hiking, skiing, riding horses, and relaxation. Although removed from his previous life, he remained close to his many friends and admirers. Leon was a great physicist, a visionary leader, a generous mentor, and a charismatic inspiration. The world seems a smaller place without him.

https://openalex.org/W2903459851,"The Community Assembly by Trait Selection (CATS) model of community assembly predicts species abundances along environmental gradients in relatively undisturbed vegetation. Here we ask whether this model, when calibrated with data from natural plant communities, can predict the abundances of five dominant grass species (Bouteloua gracilis, Elymus elymoides, Festuca arizonica, Muhlenbergia montana, and Poa fendleriana) in a greenhouse experiment that manipulated light and soil properties. To address this question, we used generalized additive models (GAMs) to model community-weighted mean (CWM) seed mass, mean Julian flowering date, and specific root length (SRL) as non-linear functions of two environmental variables (soil pH and pine basal area) in natural vegetation. The model-fitted CWM traits were then used as constraints in the CATS model to predict the relative abundance of the five grass species that were seeded in a mixture at equal densities into a 2×2 factorial experiment with soil parent material and light level as crossed factors. Light was the most important factor influencing seedling community composition, especially the abundances of Bouteloua gracilis and Poa fendleriana. The model-predicted relative abundances were significantly correlated with the observed relative abundances, and the model accurately predicted the dominant species in every treatment. P. fendleriana was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in both shade treatments and the sun-basalt treatment, and B. gracilis was correctly predicted to be the most abundant species in the sun-limestone treatment. Our results provide experimental evidence that environmental filtering of the species pool occurs in the early stages of community assembly (including germination, emergence, and early growth), and that trait-based models calibrated with data from natural plant communities can be used to predict the outcome of the early stages of community assembly under experimental conditions."
