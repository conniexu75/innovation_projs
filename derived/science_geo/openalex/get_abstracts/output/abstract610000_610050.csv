https://openalex.org/W2800655655,"The blastocyst (the early mammalian embryo) forms all embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues, including the placenta. It consists of a spherical thin-walled layer, known as the trophectoderm, that surrounds a fluid-filled cavity sheltering the embryonic cells1. From mouse blastocysts, it is possible to derive both trophoblast2 and embryonic stem-cell lines3, which are in vitro analogues of the trophectoderm and embryonic compartments, respectively. Here we report that trophoblast and embryonic stem cells cooperate in vitro to form structures that morphologically and transcriptionally resemble embryonic day 3.5 blastocysts, termed blastoids. Like blastocysts, blastoids form from inductive signals that originate from the inner embryonic cells and drive the development of the outer trophectoderm. The nature and function of these signals have been largely unexplored. Genetically and physically uncoupling the embryonic and trophectoderm compartments, along with single-cell transcriptomics, reveals the extensive inventory of embryonic inductions. We specifically show that the embryonic cells maintain trophoblast proliferation and self-renewal, while fine-tuning trophoblast epithelial morphogenesis in part via a BMP4/Nodal–KLF6 axis. Although blastoids do not support the development of bona fide embryos, we demonstrate that embryonic inductions are crucial to form a trophectoderm state that robustly implants and triggers decidualization in utero. Thus, at this stage, the nascent embryo fuels trophectoderm development and implantation. Trophoblast and embryonic stem cells interact in vitro to form structures that resemble early blastocysts, and the embryo provides signals that drive early trophectoderm development and implantation."
https://openalex.org/W3098257270,"Helium is the second-most abundant element in the Universe after hydrogen and is one of the main constituents of gas-giant planets in our Solar System. Early theoretical models predicted helium to be among the most readily detectable species in the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially in extended and escaping atmospheres. Searches for helium, however, have hitherto been unsuccessful. Here we report observations of helium on an exoplanet, at a confidence level of 4.5 standard deviations. We measured the near- infrared transmission spectrum of the warm gas giant WASP-107b and identified the narrow absorption feature of excited metastable helium at 10,833 angstroms. The amplitude of the feature, in transit depth, is 0.049 +/- 0.011 per cent in a bandpass of 98 angstroms, which is more than five times greater than what could be caused by nominal stellar chromospheric activity. This large absorption signal suggests that WASP-107b has an extended atmosphere that is eroding at a total rate of 10^10 to 3 x 10^11 grams per second (0.1-4 per cent of its total mass per billion years), and may have a comet-like tail of gas shaped by radiation pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2800428676,"As conventional electronics approaches its limits 1 , nanoscience has urgently sought methods of fast control of electrons at the fundamental quantum level 2 . Lightwave electronics 3 -the foundation of attosecond science 4 -uses the oscillating carrier wave of intense light pulses to control the translational motion of the electron's charge faster than a single cycle of light5-15. Despite being particularly promising information carriers, the internal quantum attributes of spin 16 and valley pseudospin17-21 have not been switchable on the subcycle scale. Here we demonstrate lightwave-driven changes of the valley pseudospin and introduce distinct signatures in the optical readout. Photogenerated electron-hole pairs in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide are accelerated and collided by a strong lightwave. The emergence of high-odd-order sidebands and anomalous changes in their polarization direction directly attest to the ultrafast pseudospin dynamics. Quantitative computations combining density functional theory with a non-perturbative quantum many-body approach assign the polarization of the sidebands to a lightwave-induced change of the valley pseudospin and confirm that the process is coherent and adiabatic. Our work opens the door to systematic valleytronic logic at optical clock rates."
https://openalex.org/W2801143883,"The formation of condensed matter typically involves a trade-off between structural order and flexibility. As the extent and directionality of interactions between atomic or molecular components increase, materials generally become more ordered but less compliant, and vice versa. Nevertheless, high levels of structural order and flexibility are not necessarily mutually exclusive; there are many biological (such as microtubules1,2, flagella 3 , viruses4,5) and synthetic assemblies (for example, dynamic molecular crystals6-9 and frameworks10-13) that can undergo considerable structural transformations without losing their crystalline order and that have remarkable mechanical properties8,14,15 that are useful in diverse applications, such as selective sorption 16 , separation 17 , sensing 18 and mechanoactuation 19 . However, the extent of structural changes and the elasticity of such flexible crystals are constrained by the necessity to maintain a continuous network of bonding interactions between the constituents of the lattice. Consequently, even the most dynamic porous materials tend to be brittle and isolated as microcrystalline powders 14 , whereas flexible organic or inorganic molecular crystals cannot expand without fracturing. Owing to their rigidity, crystalline materials rarely display self-healing behaviour 20 . Here we report that macromolecular ferritin crystals with integrated hydrogel polymers can isotropically expand to 180 per cent of their original dimensions and more than 500 per cent of their original volume while retaining periodic order and faceted Wulff morphologies. Even after the separation of neighbouring ferritin molecules by 50 ångströms upon lattice expansion, specific molecular contacts between them can be reformed upon lattice contraction, resulting in the recovery of atomic-level periodicity and the highest-resolution ferritin structure reported so far. Dynamic bonding interactions between the hydrogel network and the ferritin molecules endow the crystals with the ability to resist fragmentation and self-heal efficiently, whereas the chemical tailorability of the ferritin molecules enables the creation of chemically and mechanically differentiated domains within single crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2799486656,"A number of publishers and funders, including PLOS, have recently adopted policies requiring researchers to share the data underlying their results and publications. Such policies help increase the reproducibility of the published literature, as well as make a larger body of data available for reuse and re-analysis. In this study, we evaluate the extent to which authors have complied with this policy by analyzing Data Availability Statements from 47,593 papers published in PLOS ONE between March 2014 (when the policy went into effect) and May 2016. Our analysis shows that compliance with the policy has increased, with a significant decline over time in papers that did not include a Data Availability Statement. However, only about 20% of statements indicate that data are deposited in a repository, which the PLOS policy states is the preferred method. More commonly, authors state that their data are in the paper itself or in the supplemental information, though it is unclear whether these data meet the level of sharing required in the PLOS policy. These findings suggest that additional review of Data Availability Statements or more stringent policies may be needed to increase data sharing."
https://openalex.org/W2802313096,"The skull of living birds is greatly modified from the condition found in their dinosaurian antecedents. Bird skulls have an enlarged, toothless premaxillary beak and an intricate kinetic system that includes a mobile palate and jaw suspensorium. The expanded avian neurocranium protects an enlarged brain and is flanked by reduced jaw adductor muscles. However, the order of appearance of these features and the nature of their earliest manifestations remain unknown. The Late Cretaceous toothed bird Ichthyornis dispar sits in a pivotal phylogenetic position outside living groups: it is close to the extant avian radiation but retains numerous ancestral characters1-3. Although its evolutionary importance continues to be affirmed3-8, no substantial new cranial material of I. dispar has been described beyond incomplete remains recovered in the 1870s. Jurassic and Cretaceous Lagerstätten have yielded important avialan fossils, but their skulls are typically crushed and distorted 9 . Here we report four three-dimensionally preserved specimens of I. dispar-including an unusually complete skull-as well as two previously overlooked elements from the Yale Peabody Museum holotype, YPM 1450. We used these specimens to generate a nearly complete three-dimensional reconstruction of the I. dispar skull using high-resolution computed tomography. Our study reveals that I. dispar had a transitional beak-small, lacking a palatal shelf and restricted to the tips of the jaws-coupled with a kinetic system similar to that of living birds. The feeding apparatus of extant birds therefore evolved earlier than previously thought and its components were functionally and developmentally coordinated. The brain was relatively modern, but the temporal region was unexpectedly dinosaurian: it retained a large adductor chamber bounded dorsally by substantial bony remnants of the ancestral reptilian upper temporal fenestra. This combination of features documents that important attributes of the avian brain and palate evolved before the reduction of jaw musculature and the full transformation of the beak."
https://openalex.org/W2801655176,"Nitrogenase is the enzyme that reduces atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) in biological systems. It catalyzes a series of single-electron transfers from the donor iron protein (Fe protein) to the molybdenum-iron protein (MoFe protein) that contains the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) sites where N2 is reduced to NH3 The P-cluster in the MoFe protein functions in nitrogenase catalysis as an intermediate electron carrier between the external electron donor, the Fe protein, and the FeMo-co sites of the MoFe protein. Previous work has revealed that the P-cluster undergoes redox-dependent structural changes and that the transition from the all-ferrous resting (PN) state to the two-electron oxidized P2+ state is accompanied by protein serine hydroxyl and backbone amide ligation to iron. In this work, the MoFe protein was poised at defined potentials with redox mediators in an electrochemical cell, and the three distinct structural states of the P-cluster (P2+, P1+, and PN) were characterized by X-ray crystallography and confirmed by computational analysis. These analyses revealed that the three oxidation states differ in coordination, implicating that the P1+ state retains the serine hydroxyl coordination but lacks the backbone amide coordination observed in the P2+ states. These results provide a complete picture of the redox-dependent ligand rearrangements of the three P-cluster redox states."
https://openalex.org/W2802683838,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of deer, elk, moose, and reindeer (cervids) caused by misfolded prion proteins. The disease has been reported across North America and recently discovered in northern Europe. Transmission of CWD in wild cervid populations can occur through environmental routes, but limited ability to detect prions in environmental samples has prevented the identification of potential transmission ""hot spots"". We establish widespread CWD prion contamination of mineral licks used by free-ranging cervids in an enzootic area in Wisconsin, USA. We show mineral licks can serve as reservoirs of CWD prions and thus facilitate disease transmission. Furthermore, mineral licks attract livestock and other wildlife that also obtain mineral nutrients via soil and water consumption. Exposure to CWD prions at mineral licks provides potential for cross-species transmission to wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. Managing deer use of mineral licks warrants further consideration to help control outbreaks of CWD."
https://openalex.org/W2799357236,"Declining body size has been suggested to be a universal response of organisms to rising temperatures, manifesting at all levels of organization and in a broad range of taxa. However, no study to date evaluated whether deforestation-driven warming could trigger a similar response. We studied changes in fish body size, from individuals to assemblages, in streams in Southeastern Amazonia. We first conducted sampling surveys to validate the assumption that deforestation promoted stream warming, and to test the hypothesis that warmer deforested streams had reduced fish body sizes relative to cooler forest streams. As predicted, deforested streams were up to 6 °C warmer and had fish 36% smaller than forest streams on average. This body size reduction could be largely explained by the responses of the four most common species, which were 43-55% smaller in deforested streams. We then conducted a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that stream warming as measured in the field was sufficient to cause a growth reduction in the dominant fish species in the region. Fish reared at forest stream temperatures gained mass, whereas those reared at deforested stream temperatures lost mass. Our results suggest that deforestation-driven stream warming is likely to be a relevant factor promoting observed body size reductions, although other changes in stream conditions, like reductions in organic matter inputs, can also be important. A broad scale reduction in fish body size due to warming may be occurring in streams throughout the Amazonian Arc of Deforestation, with potential implications for the conservation of Amazonian fish biodiversity and food supply for people around the Basin."
https://openalex.org/W2800219205,"Understanding the space use and movement ecology of apex predators, particularly in mosaic landscapes encompassing different land-uses, is fundamental for formulating effective conservation policy. The top extant big cat in the Middle East and the Caucasus, the Persian leopard Panthera pardus saxicolor, has disappeared from most of its historic range. Its spatial ecology in the areas where it remains is almost unknown. Between September 2014 and May 2017, we collared and monitored six adult leopards (5 males and 1 female) using GPS-satellite Iridium transmitters in Tandoureh National Park (355 km2) along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderland. Using auto-correlated Kernel density estimation based on a continuous-time stochastic process for relocation data, we estimated a mean home range of 103.4 ± SE 51.8 km2 for resident males which is larger than has been observed in other studies of Asian leopards. Most predation events occurred in core areas, averaging 32.4 ± SE 12.7 km2. Although neighboring leopards showed high spatiotemporal overlap, their hunting areas were largely exclusive. Five out of six of leopards spent some time outside the national park, among human communities. Our study suggests that a national park can play an ‘anchoring’ role for individuals of an apex predator that spend some time in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Therefore, we envisage that instead of emphasizing either land sharing or land sparing, a combined approach can secure the viability of resilient large carnivores that are able to coexist with humans in the rugged montane landscapes of west and central Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2802182038,"Background Controlling blood pressure (BP) leads to significant reduction in cardiovascular risks and associated deaths. In Ethiopia, data is scarce about the level and determinants of optimal BP control among hypertensive patients. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of optimal BP control among hypertensive patients attending at a district hospital. Methods A hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 392 hypertensive patients who were on treatment and follow-up at a district hospital. A structured questionnaire adopted from WHO approach was prepared to collect the data. Medication adherence was measured by the four-item Morisky Green Levine Scale, with a score ≥3 defined as “good adherence”. Blood pressure was measured, and optimal BP control was 0DEFined as systolic BP < 140 mmHg and diastolic BP<90 mmHg. Both binary and multivariable logistic regressions models were fitted to identify correlates of optimal BP control. All statistical tests were two-sided and a p values <0.05 was considered for statistical significance. Results The mean age of the participants was 58 years (SD±13 years). Over half (53.8%) were females. Three quarters (77.3%) of the participants were adherent to their medications. The overall proportion of participants with optimally controlled BP was 42.9%.Female sex (Adjusted Odd Ratio(AOR) = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.26), age older than 60 years (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.18, 7.40), consumption of vegetables on most days of the week (AOR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.73), physical activity (AOR = 4.85, 95% CI: 2.39, 9.83), and taking less than three drugs per day (AOR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.51, 6.14) were positively associated with optimally controlled BP. Poor adherence to medications (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.35), having asthma comorbidity (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI:0.12, 0.88) and use of top added salt on a plate (AOR = 0.20, 95% CI:0.11, 0.36) were negatively associated with optimal BP control. Conclusion A higher proportion of hypertensive patients remain with un-controlled BP. Modifiable risk factors including poor adherence to medications, lack of physical exercise, adding salt into meals, being on multiple medications and comorbidities were significantly and independently associated with poor BP control. Evidence-based, adherence-enhancing and healthy life style interventions should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2800612666,"Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) offer an alternate means to consume nicotine in a variety of flavored aerosols. Data are needed to better understand the impact of flavors on use behavior. A natural environment observational study was conducted on experienced ENDS users to measure the effect of e-liquid flavor on topography and consumption behavior. The RIT wPUMTM monitor was used to record to record the date and time and puff topography (flow rate, volume, duration) for every puff taken by N = 34 participants over the course of two weeks. All participants used tobacco flavor for one week, and either berry or menthol flavor for one week. Results provide strong evidence that flavor affects the topography behaviors of mean puff flow rate and mean puff volume, and there is insufficient evidence to support an influence of flavor on mean puff duration and mean puff interval. There was insufficient evidence, due to the low power associated with the limited number of observation days, to establish a relationship between flavor and cumulative consumption behavior. While the results indicate that an effect may be evident, additional observation days are required to establish significance."

Plasma concentrations of tau and neurofilament light chain were analyzed in 16 women who eventually developed preeclampsia and 36 controls throughout pregnancy with single molecule array (Simoa) method and compared within and between groups. S100B and NSE had been analyzed previously in the same study population. A statistical model with receiving characteristic operation curve was constructed with the four biomarkers combined.Plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain were significantly increased in women who developed preeclampsia in gestational week 33 (11.85 ng/L, IQR 7.48-39.93 vs 6.80 ng/L, IQR 5.65-11.40) and 37 (22.15 ng/L, IQR 10.93-35.30 vs 8.40 ng/L, IQR 6.40-14.30) and for tau in gestational week 37 (4.33 ng/L, IQR 3.97-12.83 vs 3.77 ng/L, IQR 1.91-5.25) in contrast to healthy controls. A combined model for preeclampsia with tau, neurofilament light chain, S100B and neuron specific enolase in gestational week 25 displayed an area under the curve of 0.77, in week 28 it was 0.75, in week 33 it was 0.89 and in week 37 it was 0.83. Median week for diagnosis of preeclampsia was at 38 weeks of gestation.Concentrations of both tau and neurofilament light chain are increased in the end of pregnancy in women developing preeclampsia in contrast to healthy pregnancies. Cerebral biomarkers might reflect cerebral involvement before onset of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2802013953,"Serum starvation is a routine protocol for synchronizing nuclear donor cells to G0/G1 phase during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, abrupt serum deprivation can cause serious stress to the cells cultured in vitro, which might result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, chromosome damage, and finally reduce the success rate of SCNT. In the present study, the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an effective ER stress-relieving drug, on the nuclear donor cells under serum deprivation condition as well as following SCNT procedures were first assessed in the bovine. The results showed that TUDCA significantly reduced ER stress and cell apoptosis in those nuclear donor cells. Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of Hdac1 and Dnmt1, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of Hdac1, Dnmt1 and Bax was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group. In conclusion, TUDCA significantly reduced the ER stress of nuclear donor cells under serum starvation condition, and significantly improved the developmental competence of following SCNT reconstructed embryos when these TUDCA-treated cells were used as the nuclear donors."
https://openalex.org/W2801116716,"Facial reconstruction is a technique that aims to reproduce the individual facial characteristics based on interpretation of the skull, with the objective of recognition leading to identification. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy and recognition level of three-dimensional (3D) computerized forensic craniofacial reconstruction (CCFR) performed in a blind test on open-source software using computed tomography (CT) data from live subjects. Four CCFRs were produced by one of the researchers, who was provided with information concerning the age, sex, and ethnic group of each subject. The CCFRs were produced using Blender® with 3D models obtained from the CT data and templates from the MakeHuman® program. The evaluation of accuracy was carried out in CloudCompare, by geometric comparison of the CCFR to the subject 3D face model (obtained from the CT data). A recognition level was performed using the Picasa® recognition tool with a frontal standardized photography, images of the subject CT face model and the CCFR. Soft-tissue depth and nose, ears and mouth were based on published data, observing Brazilian facial parameters. The results were presented from all the points that form the CCFR model, with an average for each comparison between 63% and 74% with a distance -2.5 ≤ x ≤ 2.5 mm from the skin surface. The average distances were 1.66 to 0.33 mm and greater distances were observed around the eyes, cheeks, mental and zygomatic regions. Two of the four CCFRs were correctly matched by the Picasa® tool. Free software programs are capable of producing 3D CCFRs with plausible levels of accuracy and recognition and therefore indicate their value for use in forensic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2801812042,"The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of risk factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in black adult South Africans and to estimate the size of the associated risks.A case-control analysis of 150 black South African patients (aged 18-75 years) with HCC-who were a subset of patients recruited for the Johannesburg Cancer Case Control Study 2000 to 2012-was undertaken. The association between this tumour and hepatitis B/C virus infections, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mono- and co-infections was investigated. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, year of diagnosis, marital status, place of birth and selected modifiable risk factors were calculated.HCC was significantly associated with a rural birthplace (p<0.05), being male and living in an urban area for 14 years or less. The Odds Ratio (OR) for HCC increased significantly with HBV DNA+/HBsAg+ (OR 34.5; CI:16.26-73.13), HBV DNA+/HBsAg- (OR 3.76; CI:1.79-7.92), HBV DNA level >2000 IU/ml (OR 8.55; CI:3.00-24.54) to ≥200,000 (OR 16.93; CI:8.65-33.13), anti-HCV (OR 8.98; CI:3.59-22.46), HBV DNA+/HIV+ co-infection (OR 5.36; CI:2.59-11.11), but not with HBV DNA-/HIV+ (OR 0.34; CI:0.14-0.85). We did not find a synergistic interaction between HBV and HIV. Modifiable risk factors (alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, number of sexual partners, diabetes and hormonal contraceptive use) were nonsignificant.A considerable portion of the HCC burden in Johannesburg and surrounding provinces falls on rural migrants to urban areas, most of whom are men. The HBV will continue to contribute to HCC incidence in older age-groups and in others who missed vaccination. Although we did not find an increased risk for HCC in HIV positive individuals this may change as life expectancy increases due to greater access to antiretroviral therapies, necessitating the addition of hepatitis virus screening to preventive medical care."

Based on sequence variance and structural organization, TNF family ligands have been divided into conventional, EF disulfide, and divergent families (19Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J.

The conventional family members (such as TNF, RANKL, and CD40L) share sequence identity and exist as trimers with a bell-shaped architecture. They bind three cognate monomeric receptors in a similar orientation via conserved hydrophobic interactions. The members of the EF-disulfide group (such as APRIL and TWEAK) contain disulfide bonds between the E and F strands resulting in a more globular shape and bind very small atypical TNFRs (BCMA, TACI, and Fn14). The third group contains TNF ligands (such as OX40L, GITRL, 4-1BBL, and CD30L) that exhibit greater sequence divergence and have a comparably shorter TNF homology domain (THD). Earlier crystallographic studies showed that two members of this group, OX40L and GITRL, exhibit an atypical expanded trimeric organization termed a blooming flower shape (21Chattopadhyay K.

Although h4-1BBL has been thought to be similar to OX40L and GITRL, it has a considerably longer THD, and when crystallized was found in a novel more open trimeric arrangement, described as a three-bladed propeller architecture (24Won E.-Y.

Human and mouse 4-1BBL are only 30% identical in sequence compared with ∼60% sequence identify found in other human and mouse TNF orthologs (22Chattopadhyay K. Ramagopal U.A. Brenowitz M. Nathenson S.G. Almo S.C. Evolution of GITRL immune function: murine GITRL exhibits unique structural and biochemical properties within the TNF superfamily.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Complicating making broad generalizations, our recent biochemical studies also demonstrated that murine 4-1BBL (m4-1BBL) is not naturally a trimer but exists as a covalently linked dimer (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Wang J. Picarda G. Benedict C.A. Croft M. Zajonc D.M. Crystal structure of murine 4-1BB and its interaction with 4-1BBL support a role for galectin-9 in 4-1BB signaling.J. Biol.

These data question whether the complexes of human 4-1BB and its ligand are analogous to mouse 4-1BB and its ligand, and whether they will be structurally related to other TNFRSF–TNFSF complexes. Additionally, whereas 4-1BBL is the only recognized intercellular ligand for 4-1BB, other interactions have the potential to modify the complexes. Galectin-9 is a two-domain carbohydrate binding lectin family molecule with specificity for complex N-linked glycans that contain terminal galactose moieties (12Wada J. Kanwar Y.S. Identification and characterization of galectin-9, a novel β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin.J. Biol.

Galectin-9 was found to bind to N-linked glycans on both mouse and human 4-1BB in a region distinct from the 4-1BBL–binding site, providing a means by which receptor clustering might be promoted when 4-1BB is engaged by 4-1BBL (10Madireddi S.

Chem. 2018; 293 (29242193): 1317-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In mice, galectin-9 is required for 4-1BB to signal strongly and exert a more pronounced activity (10Madireddi S. Eun S.-Y. Lee S.-W. Nemčovičová I. Mehta A.K. Zajonc D.M. Nishi N. Niki T. Hirashima M. Croft M. Galectin-9 controls the therapeutic activity of 4-1BB–targeting antibodies.J. Exp.

However, whether galectin-9 is required for, or can augment the ability of h4-1BB to signal when binding trimeric h4-1BBL has not been tested. Collectively, this suggests that a greater understanding of how 4-1BB forms a complex with 4-1BBL is needed. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the WT h4-1BB–h4-1BBL complex, as well as the complex containing a 4-1BB C121S mutant. We have also crystallized unbound h4-1BBL for comparison. We have observed that in contrast to other TNFRs, human 4-1BB exists as a disulfide-linked dimer. Depending on the rate of disulfide-linked dimerization, 4-1BB can cross-link separate heterohexameric signaling complexes and assemble into a 2D lattice of signaling units, which would promote strong signaling. Our work provides unique insights into the structural and functional properties of the h4-1BBL/h4-1BB interaction and suggests that covalent receptor-dimerization, in addition to previously reported dimerization via the preligand assembly domain (PLAD), could be considered a tunable signal amplifier. h4-1BB is a type I transmembrane receptor with four extracellular cysteine-rich domains followed by a short transmembrane domain and a C-terminal cytoplasmic region (Fig. 1A). 4-1BBL occurs both in soluble form, as well as a cell-bound type II transmembrane protein and is composed of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region, followed by a transmembrane domain, and the extracellular TNF THD, which binds to 4-1BB (Fig. 1B). We expressed the extracellular region of 4-1BB (residues 24–160) in Sf9 insect cells and this was purified using ion metal affinity chromatography using the C-terminal His6 tag, followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Biochemical analysis indicated that h4-1BB was expressed as a mixture of monomer and covalent dimer. The SEC profile of purified h4-1BB yielded two peaks of equal ratio (Fig. 1C). On nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the higher molecular mass peak migrated as two bands of equal intensity (as a result of differential glycosylation at Asn138 and Asn149 positions) with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa, whereas the lower molecular mass peak migrated at ∼24 kDa. Under reducing conditions, h4-1BB from both high and low Mr peaks migrated according to the lower molecular weight band, suggesting that h4-1BB contained in the high Mr peak was a covalent homodimer (Fig. 1D). Dimerization likely occurred through an unpaired cysteine (Cys121) found within CRD4 of h4-1BB. When we mutated Cys121 to Ser121 (C121S), h4-1BB eluted as a monodisperse peak that eluted comparably to the lower Mr peak on SEC and also migrated as a monomer on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D). The unpaired cysteine within CRD4 is unique to h4-1BB, as all other known TNFRSF members lack any unpaired cysteines in their CRDs. For structural studies, the TNF homology domain of h4-1BBL including the C-terminal end of the tail region (residues 80–244) was either co-expressed with the extracellular region of 4-1BB (residues 24–160) or expressed by itself with a C-terminal His6 tag using the baculovirus expression system. Unbound h4-1BBL and the complex was purified similar to h4-1BB as described above. We have obtained crystals of unbound 4-1BBL in the H32 space group, the WT h4-1BBL/h4-1BB complex in the C2 space group, and the complex containing the C121S mutant of h4-1BB in space group P21. The structures were determined by molecular replacement. Data collection and refinement statistics for the different crystals are listed in Table 1. The asymmetric unit (ASU) of the crystals belonging to the C2 space group contained the minimal signaling unit composed of three 4-1BB monomers bound to one trimeric 4-1BBL, whereas the crystals of the complex with the C121S mutant version of h4-1BB contained two heterohexameric complexes. The ASU of unbound h4-1BBL crystals contained one molecule of h4-1BBL.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsh4-1BBLh4-1BB–4-1BBL complexh4-1BB (C121S)–4-1BBL complexPDB ID6D3N6CPR6CU0Data collection statisticsSpace groupH32C2P21Cell dimensiona, b, c, (Å)73.16, 73.16, 162.8115.3, 66.5, 129.472.9, 114.7, 126.0α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 120.0090.00, 103.09, 90.0090.00, 101.24, 90.00Resolution range (Å) (outer shell)59.0–2.70 (2.83–2.70)38.0–2.70 (2.80–2.70)50.0–3.20 (3.31–3.20)No. of unique reflections4,818 (630)25,892 (2,513)32,003 (3,027)Rmeas (%)9.3 (83.2)14.3 (89.6)9.7 (62.8)Rpim (%)3.3 (30.3)6.2 (42.3)4.5 (31.1)Multiplicity9.2 (8.4)5.7 (5.0)4.2 (3.5)Average I/σI11.6 (3.6)7.0 (1.7)20.3 (1.8)Completeness (%)99.6 (99.4)97.8 (95.7)94.9 (89.5)Refinement statisticsNo. atoms1,0176,25711,476Protein1,0016,02211,404Ligand04228Water1014844Glycerol/Na/Cl/sulfate645Ramachandran plot (%)Favored95.396.294.8Allowed3.83.75.1Outliers0.70.10.1R.m.s. deviationsBonds (Å)0.0080.0090.009Angles (°)1.261.341.33B-factors (Å2)Protein61.857.2128Ligand47.2186Water56.753.330Glycerol/Na/Cl/sulfate18.366.4R factor (%)20.724.824.7Rfree (%)25.227.929.5 Open table in a new tab The interactions between 4-1BB and 4-1BBL are conserved in the different complexes and we will describe the structure for the complex containing WT h4-1BB, which has been refined to higher resolution. In the final structure, the N-terminal residues (Asp80–Gln89) of h4-1BBL were disordered. As expected, the three copies of 4-1BB and 4-1BBL were highly similar in structure and superimpose with root mean square deviation values of less than 0.5 Å. Each h4-1BB monomer folded into a long and elongated molecule with the four CRDs arranged in a linear fashion. The ectodomain of h4-1BB contains a total of 21 cysteine residues in which 20 cysteine residues form 10 intra-disulfide linkages to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the protein (Fig. 1E). The additional cysteine at position 121 in CRD4 formed an inter-molecular disulfide bond between all three h4-1BB monomers of one ASU with the three symmetry-related molecules of another ASU, effectively cross-linking two different ASUs (Fig. S1, A and B). The complex containing the C121S mutant of h4-1BB lacks this intermolecular cross-linking of two heterohexameric units (Fig. S1C). The structural data of h4-1BB validated our biochemical data supporting the presence of covalent dimers of 4-1BB in solution. The structure also showed ordered electron density for N-linked glycans at position Asn149 of h4-1BB in all three monomers. The overall structure of h4-1BB in the complex is identical to that of the recently solved m4-1BB structure (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Wang J. Picarda G. Benedict C.A. Croft M. Zajonc D.M. Crystal structure of murine 4-1BB and its interaction with 4-1BBL support a role for galectin-9 in 4-1BB signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29242193): 1317-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except for CRD1 and part of CRD2, which deviate between both species (Fig. S2A). Although both h4-1BB and m4-1BB share 60% sequence similarity, CRD3 and CRD4 are almost identical in topology, whereas CRD1 is the most divergent (r.m.s. deviation of 1.49 Å between 115 Cα atoms from both receptors). However, all 10 disulfide linkages are conserved between m4-1BB and h4-1BB. The CRD1–CRD4 regions of h4-1BB adopt the so-called B2, A1–B2, A2, and A1–B1 modules, where A and B represent the type of module and the numbers denote the intradisulfide linkages in the module. Similar to m4-1BB, h4-1BB also contains a partial CRD1 and lacks the canonical disulfide linkage that is present in all other TNFR members. Additionally, analogous to m4-1BB, h4-1BB also has a bend in the central hinge region that connects CRD2 and CRD3 changing the relative orientation of its CRD3 and CRD4. Hence, h4-1BB is similar to other TNFR members only at its CRD2 region (Fig. S2B). The THD region of h4-1BBL shares only 20–25% of sequence identity with other known TNF ligands, however, the overall structure of h4-1BBL is similar to other noncovalent homotrimeric TNF ligands. This is in contrast to murine 4-1BBL, which we previously reported to form a disulfide-linked homodimer (11Bitra A. Doukov T. Wang J. Picarda G. Benedict C.A. Croft M. Zajonc D.M. Crystal structure of murine 4-1BB and its interaction with 4-1BBL support a role for galectin-9 in 4-1BB signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29242193): 1317-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Each protomer of h4-1BBL adopts a jellyroll-fold composed of inner and outer β sheets. The inner sheet is formed by β strands A, A′, H, C, and F, whereas the outer sheet is formed by B′, B, G, D, and E strands (Fig. 2A). The core residues that form these β strands are conserved among TNF ligands, which is largely confined to internal aromatic residues of assembled monomers, however, they exhibit variation in the loops connecting the β strands. Superposition of a single h4-1BBL protomer with a protomer of the previously published crystal structure of unbound h4-1BBL (e4-1BBL; PDB 2X29) resulted in an r.m.s. deviation value of 0.56 Å between 103 Cα atoms. The core of h4-1BBL formed by inner and outer β sheets are very similar, however, the F strand, DE and EF loops are disordered in the e4-1BBL structure (24Won E.-Y. Cha K. Byun J.-S. Kim D.-U. Shin S. Ahn B. Kim Y.H. Rice A.J. Walz T. Kwon B.S. Cho H.-S. The structure of the trimer of human 4-1BB ligand is unique among members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9202-921010.1074/jbc.M109.084442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). In addition, the two N-terminal strands A′ and B′ of h4-1BBL in the complex are replaced by a long AB loop in the e4-1BBL structure. Both the N-terminal region (AA′ loop) as well as the DE loop of h4-1BBL are in contact with the receptor, which likely limits their flexibility and gives rise to an ordered confirmation. Although the overall jellyroll-fold of an individual protomer of e4-1BBL appears similar to that of the h4-1BBL protomer in the complex, the superimposition of trimeric e4-1BBL with trimeric h4-1BBL results in large r.m.s. deviation values between Cα atoms (24 Å) (Fig. S3). The most striking feature is that the trimeric architecture of h4-1BBL in our complex emerges as a conventional bell-shaped arrangement rather than the extended three-bladed propeller structure observed in the e4-1BBL structure (Fig. 2, C–F, Fig. S3, A and B). In e4-1BBL, the individual protomers are spread out and do not form a typical trimerization interface but rather form a ring-like structure of three monomers, in which each protomer contacts the neighboring protomer linked as a daisy chain (Fig. 2, E and F). Because these differences between both h4-1BBL structures were unexpected and difficult to rationalize, we determined the crystal structure of unbound h4-1BBL produced in the same insect cell expression system. As expected from our complex structure, insect cell-expressed h4-1BBL forms the identical bell-shaped trimeric arrangement found in the complex (Fig. 2, G–I, Fig. S3D). The only structural differences are localized in the EF loop region and the three receptor-binding sites, which are mostly disordered in the unbound h4-1BBL structure, likely due to the flexible nature of these loops (Fig. 2G). Our unbound h4-1BBL structure is much more tightly packed with ∼45 residues involved in the interface rather than the smaller contact surface formed by 14 residues in e4-1BBL (24Won E.-Y. Cha K. Byun J.-S. Kim D.-U. Shin S. Ahn B. Kim Y.H. Rice A.J. Walz T. Kwon B.S. Cho H.-S. The structure of the trimer of human 4-1BB ligand is unique among members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9202-921010.1074/jbc.M109.084442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hence, the total buried surface area of h4-1BBL is now 4137 Å2 compared with 2934 Å2 in e4-1BBL. In our h4-1BBL structure, the trimer is arranged such that residues from the EF loop and the N-terminal and C-terminal portion stabilize the upper and lower part of the trimer, whereas the E and F strands of one protomer packs against the same of the adjacent protomers to stringently assemble the interior portion (Fig. 2, C, D, H, and I). Two hydrophobic residues, Tyr142 and Phe199, of strands C and F form a hydrophobic core that helps to maintain the core integrity of the trimer. Previous data showed that mutation of both of these residues to alanine and the removal of the C-terminal region of h4-1BBL impede the formation of trimers (24Won E.-Y. Cha K. Byun J.-S. Kim D.-U. Shin S. Ahn B. Kim Y.H. Rice A.J. Walz T. Kwon B.S. Cho H.-S. The structure of the trimer of human 4-1BB ligand is unique among members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily.J. Biol.

The extracellular domain of h4-1BB binds at the interface formed by two adjacent protomers (protomer A and protomer B) of h4-1BBL and thereby interacts with two protomers simultaneously (Fig. 3B). Many of the TNF receptors e.g. TNFR1, TNFR2, RANK, and DR5, use CRD2 and CRD3 to interact with their respective ligands (25Mukai Y. Nakamura T. Yoshikawa M. Yoshioka Y. Tsunoda S. Nakagawa S.

https://openalex.org/W2802172982,"Methionine (Met) is an amino acid essential for many important cellular and biosynthetic functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis and S-adenosylmethionine-mediated methylation of proteins, RNA, and DNA. The de novo biosynthetic pathway of Met is well conserved across prokaryotes but absent from vertebrates, making it a plausible antimicrobial target. Using a systematic approach, we examined the essentiality of de novo methionine biosynthesis in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a bacterial pathogen causing significant gastrointestinal and systemic diseases in humans and agricultural animals. Our data demonstrate that Met biosynthesis is essential for S. Typhimurium to grow in synthetic medium and within cultured epithelial cells where Met is depleted in the environment. During systemic infection of mice, the virulence of S. Typhimurium was not affected when either de novo Met biosynthesis or high-affinity Met transport was disrupted alone, but combined disruption in both led to severe in vivo growth attenuation, demonstrating a functional redundancy between de novo biosynthesis and acquisition as a mechanism of sourcing Met to support growth and virulence for S. Typhimurium during infection. In addition, our LC-MS analysis revealed global changes in the metabolome of S. Typhimurium mutants lacking Met biosynthesis and also uncovered unexpected interactions between Met and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Together, this study highlights the complexity of the interactions between a single amino acid, Met, and other bacterial processes leading to virulence in the host and indicates that disrupting the de novo biosynthetic pathway alone is likely to be ineffective as an antimicrobial therapy against S. Typhimurium."

However, we know less about how conformity pressures affect one's deeply held political values and opinions. Using a discussion-based experiment, we untangle the unique and combined effects of information and social pressure on a political opinion that is highly salient, politically charged, and part of one's identity. We find that while information plays a role in changing a person's opinion, the social delivery of that information has the greatest effect. Thirty three percent of individuals in our treatment condition change their opinion due to the social delivery of information, while ten percent respond only to social pressure and ten percent respond only to information. Participants that change their opinion due to social pressure in our experiment are more conservative politically, conscientious, and neurotic than those that did not."

Ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) are a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that link the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and act as scaffolds for signaling transduction. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine proteinase that upon binding to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin on the cell surface and activates intracellular signaling pathways. Early studies indicate that uPA and uPAR expression increase during the recovery phase from an ischemic stroke and that uPA binding to uPAR promotes neurorepair in the ischemic brain. The in vitro and in vivo studies presented here show that either the release of neuronal uPA or treatment with recombinant uPA induces the local synthesis of ezrin in the synapse and the recruitment of β3-integrin to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of cerebral cortical neurons by a plasminogen-independent mechanism. We found that β3-integrin has a double effect on ezrin, inducing its recruitment to the PSD via the intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM-5) and its subsequent activation by phosphorylation at Thr-567. Finally, our data indicate that by triggering the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the postsynaptic terminal, active ezrin induces the recovery of dendritic spines and synapses that have been damaged by an acute ischemic stroke.

https://openalex.org/W2800549472,"Purpose Clinical Trials have emerged as the main force in driving the development of medicine. However, little is known about the current status of clinical trials regarding nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed at providing a comprehensive landscape of NPC-related trials on the basis of ClinicalTrials.gov database. Patients and methods We used the keyword “nasopharyngeal carcinoma” to search the ClinicalTrials.gov database and assessed the characteristics of these trials. Results Up to December 30, 2016, 462 eligible trials in total were identified, of which 222 (48.0%) recruited only NPC (NPC trials) and the other 240 (52.0%) recruited both NPC and other cancers (multiple cancer trials). Moreover, 47 (10.2%) were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related trials and 267 (57.8%) focused on metastatic/recurrent disease. Compared with NPC trials, the multiple cancer trials had a higher percentage of phase 1 (26.7% vs. 6.7%, P < 0.001) studies and more patients with metastatic/recurrent disease (72.5% vs. 41.9%, P < 0.001). Notably, non-EBV trials had more phase 2 or 3 (78.4% vs. 48.8%, P < 0.001) and interventional studies (89.5% vs. 70.7%, P = 0.002) than EBV trials. Obviously, more phase 2/3 or 3 trials were conducted in patients with non-metastatic/recurrent disease (29.4% vs. 4.9%, P < 0.001); however, metastatic/recurrent trials were more likely to be anticancer (94.6% vs. 63.6%, P < 0.001). Conclusions The role of plasma EBV DNA in clinical trials is underestimated, and high-level randomized clinical trials should be performed for patients with metastatic/recurrent disease."

Although previous studies have focused on the effects of spitefulness on the evolution of fairness, they did not consider non-monotonic rejections shown in behavioral experiments. In this paper, we introduce a non-monotonic rejection in an evolutionary model of the Ultimatum Game. We propose strategy intervention to study the evolution of fairness in general structured populations. By sequentially adding five strategies into the competition between a fair strategy and a selfish strategy, we arrive at the following conclusions. First, the evolution of fairness is inhibited by altruism, but it is promoted by spitefulness. Second, the non-monotonic rejection helps fairness overcome selfishness. Particularly for group-structured populations, we analytically investigate how fairness, selfishness, altruism, and spitefulness are affected by population size, mutation, and migration in the competition among seven strategies. Our results may provide important insights into understanding the evolutionary origin of fairness."
https://openalex.org/W2802730721,"The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction-the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment in vitro, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1. Expression analyses confirmed a very low SGPL1 expression in all breast cancer samples, regardless of their subtype. Additionally, we were able to prove a novel SGPL expression in the cytoplasm membrane of non-tumorigenic breast cells by fusing three independent methods. The general SGPL1 downregulation and the loss of the plasma membrane expression resulted in S1P dependent stimulation of migration in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. Not only S1P stimulated migration could be repressed by overexpressing the natural SGPL1 variant not but also more general migratory activity was significantly reduced. Here, for the first time, we report on the SGPL1 plasma membrane location in human, non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines silencing the extracellular S1P siren in vitro, and thereby regulating pivotal cellular functions. Loss of this plasma membrane distribution as well as low SGPL1 expression levels could be a potential prognostic marker and a viable target for therapy. Therefore, the precise role of SGPL1 for cancer treatment should be evaluated."

Broadly speaking, most TNFR superfamily ligands are structurally similar. They are type II transmembrane proteins with a single conserved extracellular domain known as the TNF homology domain (THD). THDs all adopt a jellyroll β-sandwich fold consisting of two β-sheets comprised of strands A′AHCF and B′BGDE lettered alphabetically from the N to C terminus. These THDs trimerize through packing of the A′AHCF (inner) sheet of one monomer with the inner sheet of the neighboring monomer as well as the edge E-strand of the outer B′BGDE sheet in a closed loop arrangement. The overall structure of these trimers is usually a condensed bell shape (Fig. 1A), although in some family members (e.g. OX40, GITRL), monomer units are shorter and more splayed resembling a blooming flower (Fig. 1B) (6Bodmer J.L.

A published crystal structure of human 4-1BBL suggests that it is a notable exception to this architecture (9Won E.Y. Cha K. Byun J.S. Kim D.U. Shin S. Ahn B. Kim Y.H. Rice A.J. Walz T. Kwon B.S. Cho H.S. The structure of the trimer of human 4-1BB ligand is unique among members of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily.J. Biol.

In the reported structure, an altered β-sheet structure is observed in which sheets are comprised by strands A′HCF and ABGDE instead of the typical arrangement described above and trimer assembly is driven by interaction of the A′HCF sheet with a linear stretch of amino acids at the C terminus of the neighboring monomer that lie outside the THD. The result is a highly divergent three-bladed propeller structure (Fig. 1C). TNFR superfamily members canonically bind their ligands at the interface between ligand monomer units (6Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. The molecular architecture of the TNF superfamily.Trends Biochem.

The unusual trimer assembly of 4-1BBL in the reported crystal structure results in monomer–monomer interfaces that are radically different from that in other TNFR superfamily ligands. Thus, the structure of the 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex could also be quite different from what has been observed for other family members. To better understand the 4-1BB/4-1BBL interaction and gain further insight into the signaling mechanism of this receptor system, we set out to solve the crystal structure of the human 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex. Here, we report this structure, solved at 2.4-Å resolution. Notably, we were able to crystallize the complex using a 4-1BBL construct containing only the THD. This construct excludes a significant number of residues that appeared to be involved in trimer formation and/or monomer folding in the previously reported 4-1BBL structure. Despite deletion of these residues, we found that the THD-only 4-1BBL retained a stable trimer structure in solution, bound to 4-1BB, and retained 4-1BB agonist activity. In the crystal structure of the 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex, we did not observe the unusual three-bladed propeller structure previously reported for 4-1BBL, but instead observed a trimer structure that closely resembles that of other bell-shaped TNF superfamily members with receptor interactions that are also largely canonical. Published mutagenesis data as well as data of our own support this structure as being biologically relevant. The findings presented here contribute to our mechanistic understanding of 4-1BB signaling and provide insight for the design of molecules to stimulate or antagonize this signaling for therapeutic or academic purposes. A previously described attempt to crystallize the human 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex was unsuccessful (9Won E.Y. Cha K. Byun J.S. Kim D.U. Shin S. Ahn B. Kim Y.H. Rice A.J. Walz T. Kwon B.S. Cho H.S.

One possible reason for this failure was the inclusion of a substantial number of residues at the N and C termini of the 4-1BBL extracellular domain that are not part of the THD and are disordered in the reported crystal structure of 4-1BBL (9Won E.Y. Cha K. Byun J.S. Kim D.U. Shin S. Ahn B. Kim Y.H. Rice A.J. Walz T. Kwon B.S. Cho H.S.

Minimizing the number of these residues may improve the likelihood of crystallization. Constructs consisting of only the THD have been used successfully in crystallizing other TNF superfamily ligands and ligand/receptor complexes. However, some residues outside the THD of 4-1BBL (comprised by residues 91–240 (6Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. The molecular architecture of the TNF superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27 (11796220): 19-2610.1016/S0968-0004(01)01995-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar)) appear to contribute to the folded monomer structure and trimer formation in the previously reported e4-1BBL structure, specifically, residues 80–90 and 241–246. Despite the apparent contributions of extra-THD residues to trimer formation and monomer folding in the e4-1BBL structure, we considered the possibility that these residues may not, in fact, be required for proper folding and trimer assembly. A cross-species 4-1BBL sequence comparison shows low sequence conservation across residues 80–90 and 241–246 compared with regions within the THD, even at positions that are heavily buried in the e4-1BBL trimer interface or contributing to the e4-1BBL monomer hydrophobic core (Fig. S1). Such low conservation is unexpected at positions that are structurally or functionally important. Furthermore, a structure of the closest sequence homolog of 4-1BBL, LIGHT, published after the e4-1BBL structure, shows a canonical bell-shaped trimer structure (13Liu W. Zhan C. Cheng H. Kumar P.R. Bonanno J.B. Nathenson S.G. Almo S.C. Mechanistic basis for functional promiscuity in the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies: structure of the LIGHT:DcR3 assembly.Structure. 2014; 22 (25087510): 1252-126210.1016/j.str.2014.06.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, we questioned whether 4-1BBL might be capable of forming a canonical trimer structure in which case the previously reported structure could be inaccurate. To further explore our hypothesis, we deleted/mutated the residues flanking the 4-1BBL THD and assessed the structural and functional consequences. We initially explored this question in the context of native cell-surface 4-1BBL using a cell line expressing full-length WT 4-1BBL, or a series of variants in which the residues immediately preceding or following the THD were mutated or deleted, respectively. We co-cultured these 4-1BBL expressing cells with a 4-1BB-dependent NF-κB luciferase reporter cell line to assess any functional impact of the mutations on 4-1BB signaling. We found that most residues upstream of the THD's N-terminal boundary that were included in e4-1BBL could be mutated to Gly/Ser without impact on the ligand's ability to drive 4-1BB signaling (Fig. 2A). Mutation of residues 80–88 had essentially no impact on function versus WT. However, mutation of residues 89–93 appeared to adversely affect function in a progressive manner. This result approximated the N-terminal functional edge of the THD as residue 89. Notably, residues 80–88 appeared to be dispensable in this experiment despite their contribution to the folded monomer structure of e4-1BBL. With residues 80–88 fixed as Gly4SerGly4, we subsequently found that essentially all residues beyond the C-terminal end of the 4-1BBL THD (residues 242–254) could be deleted without functional consequence in the 4-1BB reporter assay (Fig. 2B). Notably, many of these residues appear to contribute substantially to the trimer interface in the e4-1BBL structure. Although inconsistent with the previously reported structure, the collective results from these mutagenesis studies indicated that residues outside the THD of 4-1BBL are not required for productive engagement with 4-1BB. This suggested that a “THD-only” construct might be useful for crystallizing the 4-1BBL/4-1BB complex. Having observed that residues outside the 4-1BBL THD did not appear important for function in native cell-surface 4-1BBL, we next sought to explore whether a soluble THD-only 4-1BBL construct would maintain the trimeric structure and function in solution. We successfully expressed and purified THD-only 4-1BBL (residues 89–242) as a soluble protein from Escherichia coli. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that THD-only 4-1BBL was monodisperse in solution and static light-scattering data indicated an averaged molar mass of 55,300 Da, consistent with a trimeric assembly of the recombinant protein (expected molar mass of 54,897 Da) (Fig. 3A). We also sought to confirm the ability of the THD-only 4-1BBL trimer to form a complex with the extracellular domain of 4-1BB. We expressed the 4-1BB extracellular region for this purpose (residues 24-160), where this construct contained three mutations to eliminate an unpaired cysteine residue and potential N-linked glycosylation sites that could otherwise introduce heterogeneity unfavorable for subsequent crystallization (see “Materials and methods”). We mixed THD-only 4-1BBL with the 4-1BB construct described at an ∼1:1 molar ratio and examined the mixture by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and light scattering. The mixture eluted from the SEC column in a single peak at a shorter retention time versus 4-1BBL alone and light-scattering data gave an increased averaged molar mass of 90,600 Da, consistent with complex formation (Fig. 3B). This value is slightly less than the expected molar mass of 100,196 Da for the 3:3 4-1BBL/4-1BB complex. However, the difference (∼9600 Da) is less than the molar mass of one 4-1BB monomer (15,100 Da) and was likely due to inaccuracy in the mixing stoichiometry, and/or some degree of dissociation during the chromatographic separation. We sought to further confirm that THD-only 4-1BBL adopted a functionally relevant confirmation by testing its activity in the 4-1BB NF-κB reporter cell assay. In this assay, THD-only 4-1BBL successfully drove 4-1BB NF-κB signaling with an EC50 of ∼2 nm, suggesting high-affinity of the 4-1BBL trimer for the cellular 4-1BB receptor (Fig. 3C). Together, SEC/light-scattering data and reporter assay results show that THD-only 4-1BBL forms a stable trimer in solution, maintains its ability to bind 4-1BB, and adopts a functionally relevant conformation. Having confirmed the structural and functional integrity of THD-only 4-1BBL, we crystallized its complex with the 4-1BB extracellular domain and determined its structure at 2.4-Å resolution (Table 1). The monomer structure of THD-only 4-1BBL shows that it is globally quite similar (r.m.s. deviation of 0.7 Å for β-sheet Cα atoms) to the e4-1BBL structure previously reported by Won et al. (9Won E.Y.

Locally, however, there is one notable difference. In the THD-only structure, residues 111–130 adopt a conformation similar to that observed in most other TNF superfamily members. Together, these residues form β-strands A′ and B′ with a short loop connecting them. These A′ and B′ strands dock in antiparallel fashion against strands A and B, respectively and cap the edge of the β-sandwich (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in the e4-1BBL structure, equivalent strands to A′ and B′ are absent. Instead, N-terminal residues outside the THD (residues 80–88) form a unique strand (here termed strand X) that docks onto the edge of strand B in parallel fashion where the antiparallel B′ strand would ordinarily be found in TNF superfamily members (Fig. 4B). This displaces the residues that would typically comprise strands A′ and B′ and results in an extended loop that protrudes off the side of the 4-1BBL monomer in e4-1BBL. This feature is not observed in THD-only 4-1BBL.Table 1Crystallographic data refinement and statisticsData statisticsSpace groupI213Cell parameters (Å, °)a = b = c = 161.57, α = β = γ = 90Mosaicity (°)0.08Resolution limits (Å)aResolution limit estimates are based on CC1/2 > 0.30; Mn(I/σ)>2.00.38.00–2.40 (2.46–2.40)bValues in parentheses are for highest resolution shell.Wavelength (Å)0. 97946Rmerge0.165 (1.449)Rmeas0.173 (1.523)Rpim0.053 (0.467)I/σ(I)12.4 (2.5)CC1/20.99 (0.80)Completeness (%)100 (100)Redundancy20.6 (20.6)Refinement statisticsRwork/Rfree20.3/24.7 (32.7/34.5)No. of non-hydrogen atoms4200B factor (Wilson/mean, Å2)71/64.8Bond lengths (Å)0.013Bond angles (°)1.564Ramachandran (additional allowed, %)0.6a Resolution limit estimates are based on CC1/2 > 0.30; Mn(I/σ)>2.00.b Values in parentheses are for highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Another striking difference between THD-only 4-1BBL and e4-1BBL is in the architecture of the trimer assembly. THD-only 4-1BBL forms a symmetric, bell-shaped homotrimer as observed for other TNF superfamily members (Fig. 4C) (6Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. The molecular architecture of the TNF superfamily.Trends Biochem.

This is in sharp contrast to the atypical three-bladed propeller trimer assembly observed in e4-1BBL (Fig. 4C). The trimer interface in the THD-only 4-1BBL structure is typical for the TNF superfamily with tiled aromatic residues from the “inner” A′AHCF sheets of neighboring monomers packing together to help form the core of the trimer assembly (12Compaan D.M. Hymowitz S.G. The crystal structure of the costimulatory OX40-OX40L complex.Structure. 2006; 14 (16905106): 1321-133010.1016/j.str.2006.06.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Eck M.J.

In e4-1BBL, instead of interacting with one another, these same inner sheet aromatics interact with a linear stretch of residues that extend beyond the C-terminal boundary of the THD (residues 240–246) to form an unusual trimer interface (Fig. 4D). Notably, most of these C-terminal residues are absent in THD-only 4-1BBL. Although THD-only 4-1BBL forms a largely canonical trimer structure, at ∼660 Å2, the size of the THD-only 4-1BBL trimer interface is somewhat smaller than for most other TNF superfamily members (typically 900–1000 Å2). LIGHT is 4-1BBL’s closest homolog by sequence. PDBeFold also identifies LIGHT as the closest structural homolog by monomer structure and PISA identifies the LIGHT trimer as having one of the most similar trimer interfaces to THD-only 4-1BBL (16Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol.

A comparison with LIGHT provides some insight into the reduced trimer interface size in 4-1BBL. In the LIGHT trimer and the trimers of most other canonical TNF superfamily members, inner sheet residues of neighboring monomers pack closely with each other and also with the edge of the neighboring β-sandwich. In LIGHT, E-strand residues at the β-sheet edge bury 370 Å2 of surface out of a total of 915 A2 in the monomer–monomer interface. In contrast in the THD-only 4-1BBL structure, the equivalent E-strand residues bury just 92 Å2. This difference largely accounts for the reduced trimer interface in 4-1BBL as compared with LIGHT. The reduction in E-strand interactions in the 4-1BBL trimer is attributable to a large number of side chain truncating substitutions versus LIGHT at E-strand positions (E178A, L179A, V181A, Q183T, and Q184V using LIGHT numbering) and at positions on the neighboring monomer that normally interact with these E-strand residues (L120G, R232A, and Y234V using LIGHT numbering) (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, two additional residues that contribute to E-strand contacts in LIGHT (Asp-229 and Thr-231) have no structural equivalent in 4-1BBL due to differences in GH loop and H-strand conformations. In both the THD-only 4-1BBL and previously reported e4-1BBL structures, the G- and H-strands of 4-1BBL are longer than in other TNFR superfamily ligands. As a result, the GH loop is positioned adjacent to the CD loop at the bottom of the 4-1BBL monomer. In contrast, for other family members the GH loop is positioned higher and tucks underneath the AA′ loop causing it to protrude out further than in 4-1BBL (Fig. 4F). The end result is a 4-1BBL monomer that is wider at the bottom and narrower at the middle/top than other family members. This in turn gives rise to a trimer that is more box-like than the typical bell-shape observed for the family (e.g. TNFα, Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the change in GH loop conformation pulls GH loop residues away from the trimer interface and, as a result, these residues contribute fewer monomer–monomer contacts than in LIGHT or other family members (Fig. 4F). Loss of these contacts coupled with the side chain truncations described above lead to the reduced trimer interface size observed and a distinct groove between 4-1BBL monomers that is plainly visible when viewing the trimer along its symmetry axis (Fig. 4C). Globally, human 4-1BB is similar to other TNFR superfamily members with an elongated structure comprised by small repeating cysteine-rich motifs constrained by disulfide bonds (Fig. 5A). Naismith and Sprang (18Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Modularity in the TNF-receptor family.Trends Biochem.

A- and B-type modules typically pack together in pairs to yield the canonical cysteine-rich domain (CRD) units characteristic of TNFR superfamily members (18Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Modularity in the TNF-receptor family.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23 (9538693): 74-7910.1016/S0968-0004(97)01164-XAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Using the Naismith/Sprang nomenclature, 4-1BB is comprised from the N to C terminus by modules of types B2, A1, B2, A2, A1, A1, B1, consistent with predictions based on primary sequence. With the exception of the first B2 module, which forms a truncated CRDI, these modules combine in pairs to give CRDs II–IV. PDBeFold identifies TNFR2 as the closest sequence/structural homolog of 4-1BB (17Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (15572779): 2256-226810.1107/S0907444904026460Crossref PubMed Scopus (3155) Google Scholar). CRDII and -IV in 4-1BB are canonical in structure and very similar to CRDII and -IV of TNFR2 (Cα r.m.s. deviation = 1.51 Å for 36/39 residues in CRDI, Cα r.m.s. deviation = 1.20 Å for 31/34 residues in CRDIV) (Fig. 5B). This close resemblance to TNFR2 CRDs also places CRDII and -IV of 4-1BB in the “L-2” and “L-4” structural families identified by Magis et al. (14Magis C. van der Sloot A.M. Serrano L. Notredame C.

TGF-β-mediated c-Abl and Src kinase activation induces strong profibrotic cascade signaling. The purpose of this study was to test in vivo the antifibrotic activity of Bosutinib (SKI-606), a second generation c-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor, on TGF-β induced cutaneous and pulmonary fibrosis. For this purpose, we employed the TBRIcaCol1a2Cre transgenic mice expressing an inducible constitutively active TGF-β receptor 1 constitutively activated by Col1a promoter-mediated Cre recombinase. The mice were treated parenterally with 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg/day of Bosutinib for 42 days. Skin and lungs from control and Bosutinib-treated mice (n = 6 per group) were assessed by histopathology, measurement of tissue hydroxyproline content, PCR analysis of tissue fibrosis associated gene expression, and evidence of myofibroblast activation. Mice with constitutive TGF-β-1 signaling displayed severe cutaneous and pulmonary fibrosis. Bosutinib administration decreased collagen deposition and hydroxyproline content in the dermis and lungs in a dose-dependent manner. Bosutinib also reversed the marked increase in profibrotic and myofibroblast activation-associated gene expression. These results demonstrate that constitutive TGF-β-1-signaling-induced cutaneous and pulmonary fibrosis were abrogated in a dose-related manner following parenteral administration of the c-Abl and Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Bosutinib. These results indicate that Bosutinib may be a potential therapeutic agent for tissue fibrosis in SSc and other fibroproliferative disorders."

The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10-20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5-10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2799991224,"Purpose In two concurrent studies, we aimed to a) confirm the acute effect of 0.3 g·kg-1 body weight (BW) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) supplementation on central and peripheral mechanisms associated with explosive power (Study 1) and b) determine whether chronic NaHCO3 supplementation would improve the adaptive response of the neuromuscular system during a 10-week resistance training program (Study 2). Methods Eight resistance trained participants volunteered after providing written consent. The experimental design consisted of a week of baseline testing, followed by ten weeks of training with progress measures performed in Week 5. Study 1 involved neuromuscular measurements before and after the leg extension portion of a power based training session performed in Week 1. Changes in maximal torque (MVT) and rates of torque development (RTD), along with other variables derived from femoral nerve stimulation (e.g. voluntary activation, neural recruitment) were analysed to determine the extent of fatigue under NaHCO3 or placebo conditions. Changes in these same variables, coupled with functional 1-repetition maximum leg extension strength, were measured in Study 2 from baseline (Week 0) to Week 5, and again at Week 10. Results and conclusion In Study 1, we observed a decline after the leg extension task in both MVT (~ 30%) and rates of torque production (RTD) irrespective of acid-base status, however the decline in maximal RTD (RTDMAX) was nearly 20% less in the NaHCO3 condition when compared to placebo (mean difference of 294.8 ± 133.4 Nm·s-1 (95% CI -583.1 to -6.5 Nm, p < 0.05)). The primary finding in Study 2, however, suggests that introducing NaHCO3 repeatedly during a 10-week RT program does not confer any additional benefit to the mechanisms (and subsequent adaptive processes) related to explosive power production."

Increasing prevalence of Mtb strains resistant to antibiotics represents an urgent threat for global health that has prompted a search for alternative treatment regimens not subject to development of resistance. Immunotherapy constitutes a promising approach to improving current antibiotic treatments through engagement of the host’s immune system. We designed a multi-antigenic and multiphasic vaccine, based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, denoted MVATG18598, which expresses ten antigens classically described as representative of each of different phases of Mtb infection. In vitro analysis coupled with multiple-passage evaluation demonstrated that this vaccine is genetically stable, i.e. fit for manufacturing. Using different mouse strains, we show that MVATG18598 vaccination results in both Th1-associated T-cell responses and cytolytic activity, targeting all 10 vaccine-expressed Mtb antigens. In chronic post-exposure mouse models, MVATG18598 vaccination in combination with an antibiotic regimen decreases the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice, compared with chemotherapy alone, and is associated with long-lasting antigen-specific Th1-type T cell and antibody responses. In one model, co-treatment with MVATG18598 prevented relapse of the disease after treatment completion, an important clinical goal. Overall, results demonstrate the capacity of the therapeutic MVATG18598 vaccine to improve efficacy of chemotherapy against TB. These data support further development of this novel immunotherapeutic in the treatment of Mtb infections."

Previously, we reported that interferon response factor 1 (IRF1) biases alternative splicing (AS) to include the variable exon 7 (E7) in CEACAM1, generating long cytoplasmic isoforms. We now show that IRF1 and a variant of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (Lv1) coordinately silence the CEACAM1 gene. RNAi-mediated Lv1 depletion in IRF1-treated HeLa and melanoma cells induced significant CEACAM1 protein expression, reversed by ectopic Lv1 expression. The Lv1-mediated CEACAM1 repression resided in residues Gly71–Gly89 and Ala38–Gly89 in Lv1’s N-terminal extension. ChIP analysis of IRF1- and FLAG-tagged Lv1-treated HeLa cells and global treatment with the global epigenetic modifiers 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A indicated that IRF1 and Lv1 together induce chromatin remodeling, restricting IRF1 access to the CEACAM1 promoter. In interferon γ–treated HeLa cells, the transcription factor SP1 did not associate with the CEACAM1 promoter, but binding by upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), a known CEACAM1 regulator, was greatly enhanced. ChIP-sequencing revealed that Lv1 overexpression in IRF1-treated cells induces transcriptional silencing across many genes, including DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma), associated with CEACAM5 in colon cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2801770652,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) has significant impacts on mental health. Community-focused interventions have shown promising results for addressing IPV in low-income countries, however, little is known about the implications of these interventions for women's mental wellbeing. This paper analyses data from a community-focused policy intervention in Rwanda collected in 2013-14, including focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with community members (n = 59). Our findings point to three ways in which these community members responded to IPV: (1) reconciling couples experiencing violence, (2) engaging community support through raising cases of IPV during community discussions, (3) navigating resources for women experiencing IPV, including police, social services and legal support. These community responses support women experiencing violence by helping them access available resources and by engaging in community discussions. However, assistance is largely only offered to married women and responses tend to focus exclusively on physical rather than psychological or emotional forms of violence. Drawing on Campbell and Burgess's (2012) framework for 'community mental health competence', we interrogate the potential implications of these responses for the mental wellbeing of women affected by violence. We conclude by drawing attention to the gendered nature of community responses to IPV and the potential impacts this may have for the mental health of women experiencing IPV."
https://openalex.org/W2799607306,"Complex innovations– ideas, practices, and technologies that hold uncertain benefits for potential adopters—often vary in their ability to diffuse in different communities over time. To explain why, I develop a model of innovation adoption in which agents engage in naïve (DeGroot) learning about the value of an innovation within their social networks. Using simulations on Bernoulli random graphs, I examine how adoption varies with network properties and with the distribution of initial opinions and adoption thresholds. The results show that: (i) low-density and high-asymmetry networks produce polarization in influence to adopt an innovation over time, (ii) increasing network density and asymmetry promote adoption under a variety of opinion and threshold distributions, and (iii) the optimal levels of density and asymmetry in networks depend on the distribution of thresholds: networks with high density (>0.25) and high asymmetry (>0.50) are optimal for maximizing diffusion when adoption thresholds are right-skewed (i.e., barriers to adoption are low), but networks with low density (<0.01) and low asymmetry (<0.25) are optimal when thresholds are left-skewed. I draw on data from a diffusion field experiment to predict adoption over time and compare the results to observed outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2803056220,"The GTPases of the immunity-associated proteins (GIMAP) GTPases are a family of proteins expressed strongly in the adaptive immune system. We have previously reported that in human cells one member of this family, GIMAP6, interacts with the ATG8 family member GABARAPL2, and is recruited to autophagosomes upon starvation, suggesting a role for GIMAP6 in the autophagic process. To study this possibility and the function of GIMAP6 in the immune system, we have established a mouse line in which the Gimap6 gene can be inactivated by Cre-mediated recombination. In mice bred to carry the CD2Cre transgene such that the Gimap6 gene was deleted within the T and B cell lineages there was a 50–70% reduction in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Analysis of splenocyte-derived proteins from these mice indicated increased levels of MAP1LC3B, particularly the lipidated LC3-II form, and S405-phosphorylation of SQSTM1. Electron microscopic measurements of Gimap6-/- CD4+ T cells indicated an increased mitochondrial/cytoplasmic volume ratio and increased numbers of autophagosomes. These results are consistent with autophagic disruption in the cells. However, Gimap6-/- T cells were largely normal in character, could be effectively activated in vitro and supported T cell-dependent antibody production. Treatment in vitro of CD4+ splenocytes from GIMAP6fl/flERT2Cre mice with 4-hydroxytamoxifen resulted in the disappearance of GIMAP6 within five days. In parallel, increased phosphorylation of SQSTM1 and TBK1 was observed. These results indicate a requirement for GIMAP6 in the maintenance of a normal peripheral adaptive immune system and a significant role for the protein in normal autophagic processes. Moreover, as GIMAP6 is expressed in a cell-selective manner, this indicates the potential existence of a cell-restricted mode of autophagic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2799629417,"The FRH (frequency-interacting RNA helicase) protein is the Neurospora crassa homolog of yeast Mtr4, an essential RNA helicase that plays a central role in RNA metabolism as an activator of the nuclear RNA exosome. FRH is also a required component of the circadian clock, mediating protein interactions that result in the rhythmic repression of gene expression. Here we show that FRH unwinds RNA substrates in vitro with a kinetic profile similar to Mtr4, indicating that while FRH has acquired additional functionality, its core helicase function remains intact. In contrast with the earlier FRH structures, a new crystal form of FRH results in an ATP binding site that is undisturbed by crystal contacts and adopts a conformation consistent with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Strikingly, this new FRH structure adopts an arch domain conformation that is dramatically altered from previous structures. Comparison of the existing FRH structures reveals conserved hinge points that appear to facilitate arch motion. Regions in the arch have been previously shown to mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions critical for RNA surveillance and circadian clock functions. The conformational changes highlighted in the FRH structures provide a platform for investigating the relationship between arch dynamics and Mtr4/FRH function."
https://openalex.org/W2802943463,"Background The insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) is a crucial component of malaria control programs, and has prevented many malaria cases and deaths due to scale up. ITNs also serve effectively as fishing nets and various sources have reported use of ITNs for fishing. This article examines how widespread the practice of mosquito net fishing with ITNs is. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with fishery personnel and traditional leadership from the Barotse Royal Establishment in Western Province, Zambia, to better understand the presence or absence of the use of ITNs as fishing nets. We then coded the interviews for themes through content analysis. Additionally we conducted a desk review of survey data to show trends in malaria indicators, nutritional status of the population and fish consumption. Results All those interviewed reported that ITNs are regularly used for fishing in Western Zambia and the misuse is widespread. Concurrently those interviewed reported declines in fish catches both in terms of quantity and quality leading to threatened food security in the area. In addition to unsustainable fishing practices those interviewed referenced drought and population pressure as reasons for fishery decline. Malaria indicators do not show a trend in declining malaria transmission, fish consumption has dropped dramatically and nutritional status has not improved over time. Conclusions Despite the misuse of the ITNs for fishing all those interviewed maintained that ITN distribution should continue. Donors, control programs and scientists should realize that misuse of ITNs as fishing nets is a current problem for malaria control and potentially for food security that needs to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2803032352,"Reconfigurations of synchronized large-scale networks are thought to be central neural mechanisms that support cognition and behavior in the human brain. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings together with recent advances in network analysis now allow for sub-second snapshots of such networks. In the present study, we compared frequency-resolved functional connectivity patterns underlying reading of single words and visual recognition of symbol strings. Word reading emphasized coherence in a left-lateralized network with nodes in classical perisylvian language regions, whereas symbol processing recruited a bilateral network, including connections between frontal and parietal regions previously associated with spatial attention and visual working memory. Our results illustrate the flexible nature of functional networks, whereby processing of different form categories, written words vs. symbol strings, leads to the formation of large-scale functional networks that operate at distinct oscillatory frequencies and incorporate task-relevant regions. These results suggest that category-specific processing should be viewed not so much as a local process but as a distributed neural process implemented in signature networks. For words, increased coherence was detected particularly in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and high gamma (60-90 Hz) frequency bands, whereas increased coherence for symbol strings was observed in the high beta (21-29 Hz) and low gamma (30-45 Hz) frequency range. These findings attest to the role of coherence in specific frequency bands as a general mechanism for integrating stimulus-dependent information across brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2802037034,"Although exercise is effective in improving obesity and hyperinsulinemia, the exact influence of exercise on the capillary density of skeletal muscles remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low-intensity exercise training on metabolism in obesity with hyperinsulinemia, focusing specifically on the capillary density within the skeletal muscle. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats were used as animal models of obesity with hyperinsulinemia, whereas Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats served as controls (no obesity, no hyperinsulinemia). The animals were randomly assigned to either non-exercise or exercise groups (treadmill running for 60 min/day, for 4 weeks). The exercise groups were further divided into subgroups according to training mode: single bout (60 min, daily) vs. multiple bout (three bouts of 20 min, daily). Fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats. Among OLETF rats, there were no significant differences in fasting glucose levels between the exercise and the non-exercise groups, but the fasting insulin levels were significantly lower in the exercise group. Body weight and triacylglycerol levels in the liver were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, these levels were significantly lower in the exercise than in the non-exercise group. The capillary-to-fiber ratio of the soleus muscle was significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, the ratio was lower in the exercise group than in the non-exercise group. No significant differences in any of the studied parameters were noted between the single-bout and multiple-bout exercise training modes among either OLETF or LETO rats. These results suggest that low-intensity exercise training improves insulin sensitivity and fatty liver. Additionally, the fact that attenuation of excessive capillarization in the skeletal muscle of OLETF rats was accompanied by improvement in increased body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2800773711,"Disulfide reductases reduce other proteins and are critically important for cellular redox signaling and homeostasis. Methanosarcina acetivorans is a methane-producing microbe from the domain Archaea that produces a ferredoxin:disulfide reductase (FDR) for which the crystal structure has been reported, yet its biochemical mechanism and physiological substrates are unknown. FDR and the extensively characterized plant-type ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase (FTR) belong to a distinct class of disulfide reductases that contain a unique active-site [4Fe-4S] cluster. The results reported here support a mechanism for FDR similar to that reported for FTR with notable exceptions. Unlike FTR, FDR contains a rubredoxin [1Fe-0S] center postulated to mediate electron transfer from ferredoxin to the active-site [4Fe-4S] cluster. UV-visible, EPR, and Mossbauer spectroscopic data indicated that two-electron reduction of the active-site disulfide in FDR involves a one-electron-reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ intermediate previously hypothesized for FTR. Our results support a role for an active-site tyrosine in FDR that occupies the equivalent position of an essential histidine in the active site of FTR. Of note, one of seven Trxs encoded in the genome (Trx5) and methanoredoxin, a glutaredoxin-like enzyme from M. acetivorans, were reduced by FDR, advancing the physiological understanding of FDR's role in the redox metabolism of methanoarchaea. Finally, bioinformatics analyses show that FDR homologs are widespread in diverse microbes from the domain Bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2802326514,"Surveys of restored oyster reefs need to produce accurate population estimates to assess the efficacy of restoration. Due to the complex structure of subtidal oyster reefs, one effective and efficient means to sample is by patent tongs, rather than SCUBA, dredges, or bottom cores. Restored reefs vary in relief and oyster density, either of which could affect survey efficiency. This study is the first to evaluate gear (the first full grab) and survey (which includes selecting a specific half portion of the first grab for further processing) efficiencies of hand-operated patent tongs as a function of reef height and oyster density on subtidal restoration reefs. In the Great Wicomico River, a tributary of lower Chesapeake Bay, restored reefs of high- and low-relief (25–45 cm, and 8–12 cm, respectively) were constructed throughout the river as the first large-scale oyster sanctuary reef restoration effort (sanctuary acreage > 20 ha at one site) in Chesapeake Bay. We designed a metal frame to guide a non-hydraulic mechanical patent tong repeatedly into the same plot on a restored reef until all oysters within the grab area were captured. Full capture was verified by an underwater remotely-operated vehicle. Samples (n = 19) were taken on nine different reefs, including five low- (n = 8) and four high-relief reefs (n = 11), over a two-year period. The gear efficiency of the patent tong was estimated to be 76% (± 5% standard error), whereas survey efficiency increased to 81% (± 10%) due to processing. Neither efficiency differed significantly between young-of-the-year oysters (spat) and adults, high- and low-relief reefs, or years. As this type of patent tong is a common and cost-effective tool to evaluate oyster restoration projects as well as population density on fished habitat, knowing the gear and survey efficiencies allows for accurate and precise population estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2799999193,"Background Bedaquiline, an antimycobacterial agent approved for drug-resistant tuberculosis, is metabolized by CYP3A4, an hepatic enzyme strongly induced by rifampin, an essential part of drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment. We examined the pharmacokinetic interactions of bedaquiline plus either rifampin or rifabutin in 33 healthy volunteers. This sub-study of that trial examined the mycobactericidal activity of these drugs against intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis using ex vivo whole blood culture. Methods Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two single 400 mg doses of bedaquiline, alone, and, after a 4 week washout period, in combination with steady-state daily dosing of either rifabutin 300 mg or rifampin 600 mg. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points subsequently, to measure plasma drug concentrations and bactericidal activity in ex vivo M tuberculosis-infected whole blood cultures (WBA). Results Single oral doses of bedaquiline produced readily detectable WBA ex vivo, reaching a maximal effect of -0.28 log/day, with negative values indicating bacterial killing. Plasma concentrations of 355 ng/ml were sufficient for intracellular mycobacteriostasis. Combined dosing with rifampin or rifabutin produced maximal effects of -0.91 and -0.79 log/d, respectively. However, the activity of the rifabutin combination was sustained throughout the dosing interval, thereby producing a greater cumulative or total effect. At low drug concentrations, rifabutin plus bedaquiline yielded greater mycobactericidal activity than the sum of their separate effects. Neither drug metabolites nor cellular drug accumulation could account for this observation. Conclusions The combination of rifabutin plus bedaquiline produces sustained intracellular mycobactericidal activity that is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Further studies of the treatment-shortening potential of this combination are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2800787347,"Recent studies have concluded that native and invasive species share a common set of trait relationships. However, native species in isolated regions might be functionally constrained by their unique evolutionary histories such that they follow different carbon capture strategies than introduced species. We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen- and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the ‘fast return’ end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen. It remains unclear whether these trait differences translate to an ecological divergence in plant strategy, but these results suggest that ecophysiological tradeoffs are likely constrained by biogeography."
https://openalex.org/W2801973845,"Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W2802844501,"Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP-7) is a multigene family expressed during malaria blood-stage infection. MSP-7 forms complex with MSP-1 prior to merozoite egress from erythrocytes, and could affect merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. To characterize sequence variation in the orthologue in P. vivax (PvMSP-7), a gene member encoding PvMSP-7E was analyzed among 92 Thai isolates collected from 3 major endemic areas of Thailand (Northwest: Tak, Northeast: Ubon Ratchathani, and South: Yala and Narathiwat provinces). In total, 52 distinct haplotypes were found to circulate in these areas. Although population structure based on this locus was observed between each endemic area, no genetic differentiation occurred between populations collected from different periods in the same endemic area, suggesting spatial but not temporal genetic variation. Sequence microheterogeneity in both N- and C- terminal regions was predicted to display 4 and 6 α-helical domains, respectively. Signals of purifying selection were observed in α-helices II-X, suggesting structural or functional constraint in these domains. By contrast, α-helix-I spanning the putative signal peptide was under positive selection, in which amino acid substitutions could alter predicted CD4+ T helper cell epitopes. The central region of PvMSP-7E comprised the 5'-trimorphic and the 3'-dimorphic subregions. Positive selection was identified in the 3' dimorphic subregion of the central domain. A consensus of intrinsically unstructured or disordered protein was predicted to encompass the entire central domain that contained a number of putative B cell epitopes and putative protein binding regions. Evidences of intragenic recombination were more common in the central region than the remainders of the gene. These results suggest that the extent of sequence variation, recombination events and selective pressures in the PvMSP-7E locus seem to be differentially affected by protein secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2799563920,"Populations with obesity are more likely to fall and exhibit balance instability. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, but there is some evidence that sensory function is impaired during obesity. We tested the hypothesis that muscle proprioceptor function is compromised in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. An in vitro muscle-nerve preparation was used to record muscle spindle afferent responses to physiological stretch and sinusoidal vibration. We compared the responses of C57/Bl6 male and female mice on a control diet (10% kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 10 weeks (final age 14-15 weeks old). Following HFD feeding, adult mice of both sexes exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to muscle movement. Muscle spindle afferent firing rates during the plateau phase of stretch were significantly lower in both male and female HFD animals as were two measures of dynamic sensitivity (dynamic peak and dynamic index). Muscle spindle afferents in male mice on a HFD were also significantly less likely to entrain to vibration. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2802482366,"Little is known about people's ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others' quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges' ratings of targets' primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets' self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others."
https://openalex.org/W2799746401,"Adiponectin (ADPN) prevents the development/recurrence of cardiovascular events via its anti-atherogenic effects. However, few long-term studies have examined the changes in serum ADPN levels and arterial calcification seen in renal allograft recipients.The effects of the serum ADPN level on arterial calcification were examined in 51 Japanese renal allograft recipients. Abdominal aorta calcification was evaluated on computed tomography using the aortic calcification area index (ACAI). The change in the ACAI and serum high-molecular-weight (HMW)-ADPN fractions were studied over an 8-year period. The arterial expression of ADPN, ADPN receptors (AdipoR)1 and 2, and T-cadherin (cadherin-13) were also examined by immunohistochemistry.The change in the ACAI were grouped into quartiles and compared with the alterations in the serum levels of each ADPN fraction over an 8-year period. The change in the ACAI was much lower in the patients with highly elevated HMW-ADPN levels.Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that an advanced age at transplant and a history of cardiovascular complications were associated with an increased change in the ACAI, while higher HMW-ADPN concentrations were associated with improvements in the ACAI. Serum HDL-C level was also identified as a positive factor to increase serum HMW-ADPN level.In immunohistochemical examinations, ADPN was detected on CD31-positive arterial endothelial cells from renal allograft biopsy samples. ADPN co-localized with T-cadherin and AdipoR1, but only partially co-localized with AdipoR2.Both HMW-ADPN and HDL-C might inhibit the progression of vascular calcification by promoting ADPN binding to vascular endothelial cells via T-cadherin and AdipoR in Japanese renal allograft recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2799446212,"The P8 stem-loop region of the trnL intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in Aerides rosea to 669 nucleotides in Dendrophylax sallei. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., AgsI, ApoI and TspDTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, Acampe papillosa and Aeranthes arachnites despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths. This is the first report on thorough investigation of the P8 region of trnL intron for search of species specific restriction sites and hence its use as a potential plant DNA barcode."
https://openalex.org/W2803080380,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patient-level genetic assessments can guide therapy choice and impact prognosis. However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the NPM1 type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis."
