https://openalex.org/W2165867905,"Neural stem cells reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult mammalian brain. This germinal region, which continually generates new neurons destined for the olfactory bulb, is composed of four cell types: migrating neuroblasts, immature precursors, astrocytes, and ependymal cells. Here we show that SVZ astrocytes, and not ependymal cells, remain labeled with proliferation markers after long survivals in adult mice. After elimination of immature precursors and neuroblasts by an antimitotic treatment, SVZ astrocytes divide to generate immature precursors and neuroblasts. Furthermore, in untreated mice, SVZ astrocytes specifically infected with a retrovirus give rise to new neurons in the olfactory bulb. Finally, we show that SVZ astrocytes give rise to cells that grow into multipotent neurospheres in vitro. We conclude that SVZ astrocytes act as neural stem cells in both the normal and regenerating brain."

https://openalex.org/W1678800844,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is the nitric oxide synthase isoform responsible for maintaining systemic blood pressure, vascular remodelling and angiogenesis. eNOS is phosphorylated in response to various forms of cellular stimulation, but the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and the kinase(s) responsible are not known. Here we show that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B) can directly phosphorylate eNOS on serine 1179 and activate the enzyme, leading to NO production, whereas mutant eNOS (S1179A) is resistant to phosphorylation and activation by Akt. Moreover, using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, activated Akt increases basal NO release from endothelial cells, and activation-deficient Akt attenuates NO production stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor. Thus, eNOS is a newly described Akt substrate linking signal transduction by Akt to the release of the gaseous second messenger NO."
https://openalex.org/W1675937554,"Changes in neural responses based on spatial attention have been demonstrated in many areas of visual cortex, indicating that the neural correlate of attention is an enhanced response to stimuli at an attended location and reduced responses to stimuli elsewhere. Here we demonstrate non-spatial, feature-based attentional modulation of visual motion processing, and show that attention increases the gain of direction-selective neurons in visual cortical area MT without narrowing the direction-tuning curves. These findings place important constraints on the neural mechanisms of attention and we propose to unify the effects of spatial location, direction of motion and other features of the attended stimuli in a 'feature similarity gain model' of attention."
https://openalex.org/W2141777143,"Analysis of the 140-year historical record suggests that the inverse relationship between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian summer monsoon (weak monsoon arising from warm ENSO event) has broken down in recent decades. Two possible reasons emerge from the analyses. A southeastward shift in the Walker circulation anomalies associated with ENSO events may lead to a reduced subsidence over the Indian region, thus favoring normal monsoon conditions. Additionally, increased surface temperatures over Eurasia in winter and spring, which are a part of the midlatitude continental warming trend, may favor the enhanced land-ocean thermal gradient conducive to a strong monsoon. These observations raise the possibility that the Eurasian warming in recent decades helps to sustain the monsoon rainfall at a normal level despite strong ENSO events."
https://openalex.org/W2084271013,"Ethylene regulates plant growth, development, and responsiveness to a variety of stresses. Cloning of the Arabidopsis EIN2 gene identifies a central component of the ethylene signaling pathway. The amino-terminal integral membrane domain of EIN2 shows similarity to the disease-related Nramp family of metal-ion transporters. Expression of the EIN2 CEND is sufficient to constitutively activate ethylene responses and restores responsiveness to jasmonic acid and paraquat-induced oxygen radicals to mutant plants. EIN2 is thus recognized as a molecular link between previously distinct hormone response pathways. Plants may use a combinatorial mechanism for assessing various stresses by enlisting a common set of signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2079396188,"Layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum requires Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein, and mammalian Disabled (mDab1), a cytosolic protein that activates tyrosine kinases. Here, we report the requirement for two other proteins, cell surface receptors termed very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Both receptors can bind mDab1 on their cytoplasmic tails and are expressed in cortical and cerebellar layers adjacent to layers that express Reelin. mDab1 expression is upregulated in knockout mice that lack both VLDLR and ApoER2. Inversion of cortical layers and absence of cerebellar foliation in these animals precisely mimic the phenotype of mice lacking Reelin or mDab1. These findings suggest that VLDLR and ApoER2 participate in transmitting the extracellular Reelin signal to intracellular signaling processes initiated by mDab1."
https://openalex.org/W2020869819,"We have identified 52 novel human cadherin-like genes organized into three closely linked clusters. Comparison of the genomic DNA sequences with those of representative cDNAs reveals a striking genomic organization similar to that of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene clusters. The N-terminal extracellular and transmembrane domains of each cadherin protein are encoded by a distinct and unusually large exon. These exons are organized in a tandem array. By contrast, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of each protein is identical and is encoded by three small exons located downstream from the cluster of N-terminal exons. This unusual organization has interesting implications regarding the molecular code required to establish complex networks of neuronal connections in the brain and the mechanisms of cell-specific cadherin-like gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1579409009,"From seashells to DNA, chirality is expressed at every level of biological structures. In self-assembled structures it may emerge cooperatively from chirality at the molecular scale. Amphiphilic molecules, for example, can form a variety of aggregates and mesophases that express the chirality of their constituent molecules at a supramolecular scale of micrometres. Quantitative prediction of the large-scale chirality based on that at the molecular scale remains a largely unsolved problem. Furthermore, experimental control over the expression of chirality at the supramolecular level is difficult to achieve: mixing of different enantiomers usually results in phase separation. Here we present an experimental and theoretical description of a system in which chirality can be varied continuously and controllably ('tuned') in micrometre-scale structures. We observe the formation of twisted ribbons consisting of bilayers of gemini surfactants (two surfactant molecules covalently linked at their charged head groups). We find that the degree of twist and the pitch of the ribbons can be tuned by the introduction of opposite-handed chiral counterions in various proportions. This degree of control might be of practical value; for example, in the use of the helical structures as templates for helical crystallization of macromolecules."

https://openalex.org/W2135200381,"We sought to explore the relationship between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activated signaling pathways and the transcriptional induction of immediate early genes (IEGs). Using global expression monitoring, we identified 66 fibroblast IEGs induced by platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFRβ) signaling. Mutant receptors lacking binding sites for activation of the PLCγ, PI3K, SHP2, and RasGAP pathways still retain partial ability to induce 64 of these IEGs. Removal of the Grb2-binding site further broadly reduces induction. These results suggest that the diverse pathways exert broadly overlapping effects on IEG induction. Interestingly, a mutant receptor that restores the RasGAP-binding site promotes induction of an independent group of genes, normally induced by interferons. Finally, we compare the PDGFRβ and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; each induces essentially identical IEGs in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2167754439,"Leaves undergo a sink-source transition during which a physiological change occurs from carbon import to export. In sink leaves, biolistic bombardment of plasmids encoding GFP-fusion proteins demonstrated that proteins with an Mr up to 50 kDa could move freely through plasmodesmata. During the sink-source transition, the capacity to traffic proteins decreased substantially and was accompanied by a developmental switch from simple to branched forms of plasmodesmata. Inoculation of sink leaves with a movement protein-defective virus showed that virally expressed GFP, but not viral RNA, was capable of trafficking between sink cells during infection. Contrary to dogma that plasmodesmata have a size exclusion limit below 1 kDa, the data demonstrate that nonspecific ""macromolecular trafficking"" is a general feature of simple plasmodesmata in sink leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2042180447,"A role for DnaK, the major E. coli Hsp70, in chaperoning de novo protein folding has remained elusive. Here we show that under nonstress conditions DnaK transiently associates with a wide variety of nascent and newly synthesized polypeptides, with a preference for chains larger than 30 kDa. Deletion of the nonessential gene encoding trigger factor, a ribosome-associated chaperone, results in a doubling of the fraction of nascent polypeptides interacting with DnaK. Combined deletion of the trigger factor and DnaK genes is lethal under normal growth conditions. These findings indicate important, partially overlapping functions of DnaK and trigger factor in de novo protein folding and explain why the loss of either chaperone can be tolerated by E. coli."

This malleability creates complex geographic mosaics in interspecific interactions that can evolve rapidly over decades, blurring the distinction between evolutionary time and ecological time and making the study of coevolution crucial for human health and welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2099925982,"D-type cyclins and cyclin E represent two very distinct classes of mammalian G1 cyclins. We have generated a mouse strain in which the coding sequences of the cyclin D1 gene (Ccnd1) have been deleted and replaced by those of human cyclin E (CCNE). In the tissues and cells of these mice, the expression pattern of human cyclin E faithfully reproduces that normally associated with mouse cyclin D1. The replacement of cyclin D1 with cyclin E rescues all phenotypic manifestations of cyclin D1 deficiency and restores normal development in cyclin D1–dependent tissues. Thus, cyclin E can functionally replace cyclin D1. Our analyses suggest that cyclin E is the major downstream target of cyclin D1."

https://openalex.org/W2108328973,"The alpha subunit of the endocytotic AP2 adaptor complex contains a 30 kDa ""appendage"" domain, which is joined to the rest of the protein via a flexible linker. The 1.9 A resolution crystal structure of this domain reveals a single binding site for its ligands, which include amphiphysin, Eps15, and epsin. This domain when overexpressed in COS7 fibroblasts is shown to inhibit transferrin uptake, whereas mutants in which interactions with its binding partners are abolished do not. DPF/W motifs present in appendage domain-binding partners are shown to play a crucial role in their interactions with the domain. A single site for binding multiple ligands would allow for temporal and spatial regulation in the recruitment of components of the endocytic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2029469952,"During C. elegans development, Wnt/WG signaling is required for differences in cell fate between sister cells born from anterior/posterior divisions. A beta-catenin-related gene, wrm-1, and the lit-1 gene are effectors of this signaling pathway and appear to downregulate the activity of POP-1, a TCF/LEF-related protein, in posterior daughter cells. We show here that lit-1 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase homolog related to the Drosophila tissue polarity protein Nemo. We demonstrate that the WRM-1 protein binds to LIT-1 in vivo and that WRM-1 can activate the LIT-1 protein kinase when coexpressed in vertebrate tissue culture cells. This activation leads to phosphorylation of POP-1 and to apparent changes in its subcellular localization. Our findings provide evidence for novel regulatory avenues for an evolutionarily conserved Wnt/WG signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2018696019,"Molecular biology studies of olfaction have identified a multigene family of molecular receptors that are likely to be involved in odor transduction mechanisms. However, because previous functional data on peripheral coding were mainly collected from inferior vertebrates, it has been difficult to document the degree of specificity of odor interaction mechanisms. As a matter of fact, studies of the functional expression of olfactory receptors have not demonstrated the low or high specificity of olfactory receptors. In this study, the selectivity of olfactory receptor neurons was investigated in the rat at the cellular level under physiological conditions by unitary extracellular recordings. Individual olfactory receptor neurons were broadly responsive to qualitatively distinct odor compounds. We conclude that peripheral coding is based on activated arrays of olfactory receptor cells with overlapping tuning profiles."

https://openalex.org/W2086635082,"Interaction between CD2 and its counterreceptor, CD58 (LFA-3), on opposing cells optimizes immune recognition, facilitating contacts between helper T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells as well as between cytolytic effectors and target cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of the heterophilic adhesion complex between the amino-terminal domains of human CD2 and CD58. A strikingly asymmetric, orthogonal, face-to-face interaction involving the major beta sheets of the respective immunoglobulin-like domains with poor shape complementarity is revealed. In the virtual absence of hydrophobic forces, interdigitating charged amino acid side chains form hydrogen bonds and salt links at the interface (approximately 1200 A2), imparting a high degree of specificity albeit with low affinity (K(D) of approximately microM). These features explain CD2-CD58 dynamic binding, offering insights into interactions of related immunoglobulin superfamily receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2155265122,"Circadian clocks consist of three elements: entrainment pathways (inputs), the mechanism generating the rhythmicity (oscillator), and the output pathways that control the circadian rhythms. It is difficult to assign molecular clock components to any one of these elements. Experiments show that inputs can be circadianly regulated and outputs can feed back on the oscillator. Mathematical simulations indicate that under- or overexpression of a gene product can result in arrhythmicity, whether the protein is part of the oscillator or substantially part of a rhythmically expressed input pathway. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used traditional circadian entrainment protocols on a genetic model system, Neurospora crassa."
https://openalex.org/W2084166966,"The diversity of modern herbivorous insects and their pressure on plant hosts generally increase with decreasing latitude. These observations imply that the diversity and intensity of herbivory should increase with rising temperatures at constant latitude. Insect damage on fossil leaves found in southwestern Wyoming, from the late Paleocene-early Eocene global warming interval, demonstrates this prediction. Early Eocene plants had more types of insect damage per host species and higher attack frequencies than late Paleocene plants. Herbivory was most elevated on the most abundant group, the birch family (Betulaceae). Change in the composition of the herbivore fauna during the Paleocene-Eocene interval is also indicated."

Microsamples of the fluid were isolated at the experimental temperature and pressure as fluid inclusions in quartz. Individual fluid inclusions were opened by laser ablation and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results show that gold solubility as sulfide species in supercritical brines is far higher than previously supposed. Dissolved gases such as molecular hydrogen sulfide that are ineffective metal-complexing agents at low pressures evidently become highly effective at high pressures."

https://openalex.org/W2321791250,"Using a mouse model of mammary gland development and tumorigenesis we examined changes in both alternative splicing and splicing factors in multiple stages of mammary cancer. The emphasis was on the SR family of splicing factors known to influence alternative splicing in a wide variety of genes, and on alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding CD44, for which alternative splicing has been implicated as important in a number of human cancers, including breast cancer. We observed step-wise increases in expression of individual SR proteins and alternative splicing of CD44 mRNA during mammary gland tumorigenesis. Individual preneoplasias differed as to their expression patterns for SR proteins, often expressing only a sub-set of the family. In contrast, tumors demonstrated a complex pattern of SR expression. Little difference was observed between neoplasias and their metastases. Alternative splicing of CD44 also changed through the disease paradigm such that tumors produced RNA containing a mixture of variable exons, whereas preneoplasias exhibited a more restricted exon inclusion pattern. In contrast, other standard splicing factors changed little in either concentration or splicing pattern in the same cells. These data suggest alterations in relative concentrations of specific splicing factors during early preneoplasia that become more pronounced during tumor formation. Given the ability of SR proteins to affect alternative processing decisions, our results suggest that a number of pre-mRNAs may undergo changes in alternative splicing during the early and intermediate stages of mammary cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2080641949,"Segmentation of the hindbrain and branchial region is a conserved feature of head development, involving the nested expression of Hox genes. Although it is presumed that vertebrate Hox genes function as segment identifiers, responsible for mediating registration between elements of diverse embryonic origin, this assumption has remained untested. To assess this, retroviral misexpression was combined with orthotopic grafting in chick embryos to generate a mismatch in Hox coding between a specific rhombomere and its corresponding branchial arch. Rhombomere-restricted misexpression of a single gene, Hoxb1 , resulted in the homeotic transformation of the rhombomere, revealed by reorganization of motor axon projections."

https://openalex.org/W2323231231,"We report here a systematic analysis of the effects of different p53 mutations on both spontaneous and radiation-stimulated homologous recombination in mouse L cells. In order to monitor different recombination pathways, we used both direct and inverted repeat recombination substrates. In each line bearing one of these substrates, we expressed p53 proteins mutated at positions: 175, 248 or 273. p53 mutations leading to an increased spontaneous recombination rate also stimulate radiation-induced recombination. The effect on recombination may be partially related to the conformation of the p53 protein. Moreover, p53 mutations act on recombination between direct repeats as well as between inverted repeats indicating that strand invasion mechanisms are stimulated. Although all of the p53 mutations affect the p53 transactivation activity measured on the WAF1 and MDM2 gene promoters, no correlation between the transactivation activity and the extent of homologous recombination can be drawn. Finally, some p53 mutations do not affect the G1 arrest after radiation but stimulate radiation-induced recombination. These results show that the role of p53 on transactivation and G1 cell cycle checkpoint is separable from its involvement in homologous recombination. A direct participation of p53 in the recombination mechanism itself is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2313167421,"The tumor suppressor Bin1 was identified through its interaction with the N-terminal region of Myc which harbors its transcriptional activation domain. Here we show that Bin1 and Myc physically and functionally associate in cells and that Bin1 inhibits cell proliferation through both Myc-dependent and Myc-independent mechanisms. Bin1 specifically inhibited transactivation by Myc as assayed from artificial promoters or from the Myc target genes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and α prothymosin (pT). Inhibition of ODC but not pT required the presence of the Myc binding domain (MBD) of Bin1 suggesting two mechanisms of action. Consistent with this possibility, a non-MBD region of Bin1 was sufficient to recruit a repression function to DNA that was unrelated to histone deacetylase. Regions outside the MBD required for growth inhibition were mapped in Ras cotransformation or HepG2 hepatoma cell growth assays. Bin1 required the N-terminal BAR domain to suppress focus formation by Myc whereas the C-terminal U1 and SH3 domains were required to inhibit adenovirus E1A or mutant p53, respectively. All three domains contributed to Bin1 suppression of tumor cell growth but BAR-C was most crucial. These findings supported functional interaction between Myc and Bin1 in cells and indicated that Bin1 could inhibit malignant cell growth through multiple mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2041490761,"The human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080, clone H4, was used to determine if the transformation suppressive functions of p53 and Egr-1 have the same underlying mechanism. This cell line expresses only mutant p53 and no detectable Egr-1. H4 clones stably expressing Egr-1 are less transformed in proportion to the level of Egr-1 expressed, acting through the induction of the TGFβ1 gene. Here, H4 cells and the highest Egr-1 expressing clone were transfected with a vector expressing normal human p53 to derive stable clones expressing p53. The expression of p53 in H4 cells inhibited transformed growth and reduced tumorigenicity. The effect of co-expression of both p53 and Egr-1 was additive, producing cell lines with 30% of normal growth rate and sevenfold reduced tumorigenicity compared with control lines. These results indicated that each factor may act independently by different pathways, although each additively increased the level of p21WAF1 cell cycle inhibitor. However, exposure of the H4-derived cells to UV-C irradiation produced contrasting effects. Cell cycle analyses showed that the presence of p53 was associated with loss of the G1 and S cells to apoptosis after irradiation. In contrast, the expression of Egr-1 increased entry into S/G2 phase of the cell cycle with little apoptosis via a mechanism involving elevated FAK and low caspase activities. Apoptosis was observed only in the cell lines that expressed no Egr-1, especially those expressing wt-p53, and was preceded by high caspase activity. In summary, Egr-1 suppressed transformation and counteracted apoptosis by the coordinated activation of TGFβ1, FN, p21 and FAK, leading to enhanced cell attachment and reduced caspase activity. In the doubly expressing cell line, the survival effect of Egr-1 was dominant over the apoptotic effect of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2317057093,"Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle is mediated by phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) resulting in the release of essential transcription factors such as E2F-1. The phosphorylation of pRb is regulated positively by cyclin D1/CDK4 and negatively by CDK inhibitors, such as p16 (CDKN2/MTS-1/INK4A). The p16/cyclin D1/Rb pathway plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and many tumor types display a high frequency of inactivation of at least one component of this pathway. In order to determine the overall contribution of these three components to progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we examined p16 inactivation, cyclin D1 amplification, and pRb expression in 23 primary HNSCC tumors and five cell lines. p16 inactivation was detected in 19/23 (83%) primary tumors by detailed genetic analysis and was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Absence of Rb protein expression indicative of pRb inactivation was identified in 2/23 (9%) tumors. In this set of tumors, there was a perfect inverse correlation between p16 and pRb inactivation. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cyclin D1 amplification was identified in 4/5 (80%) cell lines and 4/11 (36%) primary tumors. However, 2/4 cell lines and all four primary tumors with cyclin D1 amplification contained a concomitant alteration of p16. Therefore 21/ 23 (91%) of primary HNSCC contained at least one alteration in the p16/cyclin D1/Rb pathway. Although p16 and Rb alteration are apparently exclusive, cyclin D1 amplification occurs concomitantly with the loss of p16 suggesting an additional role for this amplification in HNSCC."

It is shown that Fourier analysis of the mutual intensity of the field produces projections that are mathematically identical to the projections of x-ray cone-beam tomography. A lensless interferometric camera that captures planes of mutual intensity data is described and used to reconstruct an incoherently illuminated visible object in three dimensions.
https://openalex.org/W2315241706,"Bcl-2 is a key inhibitor of a broad range of apoptotic pathways, yet neither the mechanism of action nor the role of Bcl-2 subcellular localization are well understood. The subcellular localization of Bcl-2 includes the mitochondrial membrane as well as the contiguous membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Most studies suggest that the ability of Bcl-2 to confer cell survival is dependent upon its localization to the mitochondria. In this manuscript, we show that Bcl-2 targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum can inhibit Myc-, but not etoposide-induced apoptosis in the Rat-1 fibroblast cell line. By contrast, wild type Bcl-2 can inhibit apoptosis triggered by either death agonist. We further show both Myc and etoposide trigger disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and induce poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, but release of calcium was not evident. Bcl-2 abrogates apoptosis at or upstream of MMP depletion showing that Bcl-2 does not have to reside at the mitochondria to prevent apoptosis. These results further elucidate the biochemical events associated with Myc- and etoposide-induced apoptosis and significantly advance our understanding of Bcl-2 function."
https://openalex.org/W2332353899,"Recently we have shown that wild-type human p53 protein binds preferentially to supercoiled (sc) DNA in vitro in both the presence and absence of the p53 consensus sequence (p53CON). This binding produces a ladder of retarded bands on an agarose gel. Using immunoblotting with the antibody DO-1, we show that the bands obtained correspond to ethidium-stained DNA, suggesting that each band of the ladder contains a DNA-p53 complex. The intensity and the number of these hands are decreased by physiological concentrations of zinc ions. At higher zinc concentrations, binding of p53 to scDNA is completely inhibited. The binding of additional zinc ions to p53 appears much weaker than the binding of the intrinsic zinc ion in the DNA binding site of the core domain. In contrast to previously published data suggesting that 100 microM zinc ions do not influence p53 binding to p53CON in a DNA oligonucleotide, we show that 5-20 microM zinc efficiently inhibits binding of p53 to p53CON in DNA fragments. We also show that relatively low concentrations of dithiothreitol but not of 2-mercaptoethanol decrease the concentration of free zinc ions, thereby preventing their inhibitory effect on binding of p53 to DNA. Nickel and cobalt ions inhibit binding of p53 to scDNA and to its consensus sequence in linear DNA fragments less efficiently than zinc; cobalt ions are least efficient, requiring >100 microM Co2+ for full inhibition of p53 binding. Modulation of binding of p53 to DNA by physiological concentrations of zinc might represent a novel pathway that regulates p53 activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2332884773,"Activation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinase induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins. Since the PDGF receptor also activates the Src tyrosine kinase, it is possible that Src mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs in PDGF-treated cells. Consistent with a role for Src in STAT activation, we found that a PDGF receptor juxtamembrane tyrosine residue required for Src activation is necessary and sufficient for activation of STATs 1 and 3. To test the Src requirement further, we made other mutations in the PDGF receptor juxtamembrane region that increased or decreased Src binding. In epithelial and fibroblast cells, PDGF activated STAT1, 3 and 6 in the absence of detectable binding and activation of Src. In addition, PDGF induced c-myc RNA expression and DNA synthesis even though Src was not detectably activated. The activation of MAP kinase and the induction of c-fos gene expression both correlated with STAT but not Src activation by the receptor. We conclude that juxtamembrane tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for both Src tyrosine kinase and STAT activation by the betaPDGF receptor, but that both processes are regulated independently by this region."
https://openalex.org/W1992781479,"Using a yeast two-hybrid screening strategy with a common tumour-derived p53 mutant as bait, we identified several mutant p53-interacting partners including the known proteins wild-type (wt) p53, hUBC9 and GBP/PIAS1. In addition, a novel protein partner was identified which we have termed MBP1, for Mutant p53-Binding Protein 1. MBP1 is a new member of the emerging fibulin gene family, which currently comprises fibulin-1, fibulin-2 and S1-5. Expression of MBP1 mRNA is differentially regulated both temporally during development of the mouse embryo and in a tissue-specific manner within the adult. Specific interaction between MBP1 and mutant p53 was illustrated by both two-hybrid analysis in yeast and co-immunoprecipitation in mammalian cells. MBP1 displayed the following order of binding specificity towards different p53 forms: H175 >G281>H273 ⩾W248>wt p53. Thus, MBP1 appears to bind preferentially to p53 mutants of the `structural' rather than `contact' class, reflecting a potential bias towards those mutants having a significant alteration in conformation from that assumed by wt p53. We propose that MBP1 is the product of a candidate oncogene as rates of both neoplastic transformation and tumour cell growth were shown to be significantly enhanced when the protein is ectopically overexpressed. Furthermore, MBP1 may play a role in determining if a `gain of function' effect is seen with certain p53 mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2325794166,Abnormalities in differentiation are common occurrences in human cancers. Treatment of human melanoma cells with the combination of recombinant human fibroblast interferon (IFN-β) and the antileukemic compound mezerein (MEZ) results in a loss of tumorigenic potential that correlates with an irreversible suppression in proliferative ability and induction of terminal differentiation. It is hypothesized that this is associated with the differential expression of genes that may directly regulate cancer cell growth and differentiation. To define the relevant gene expression changes that correlate with and potentially control these important cellular processes a differentiation induction subtraction hybridization (DISH) scheme is being used. A temporally spaced subtracted differentiation inducer treated (TSS) cDNA library was constructed and differentially expressed DISH clones were isolated and evaluated using a high throughput microchip cDNA (Synteni) array screening approach. Verification of differential gene expression for specific cDNAs was confirmed by Northern blotting. The temporal kinetics of regulation and the expression pattern of DISH genes were also evaluated by microchip cDNA array screening. Using this approach with 1000 DISH cDNA clones (∼10% of the DISH library) has resulted in the identification and cloning of both 26 known and 11 novel cDNAs of potential relevance to growth control and terminal differentiation in human melanoma cells.

Key issues related to evolutionary biology include the biotic and physical factors that govern biodiversity dynamics, the developmental and ecological basis for the nonrandom introduction of evolutionary innovations in time and space, rules of biotic response to environmental perturbations, and the dynamic feedbacks between life and the Earth's surface processes.

https://openalex.org/W2325782445,"The expression of the PML gene was investigated in purified early hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) induced to unilineage erythroid or granulocytic differentiation. PML mRNA and protein, while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs, are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage. Thereafter, PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation, whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway. In functional studies, PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA (alpha-PML). Interestingly, early treatment (day 0 HPCs) with alpha-PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies, whereas late treatment (day 5 culture) reduced erythroid, but not granulocytic, clonogenesis. These findings suggest that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid, but not granulocytic maturation. The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105. Combined treatment of HPCs with alpha-PML and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development. Furthermore, PML and pRb 105 were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from erythroid precursors indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis. These results suggest a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis: the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105."

In order to define the cellular mutations cooperating with v-Myb to cause lymphomas, we have infected v-Myb transgenic mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). Tumor formation is significantly accelerated from a mean age of onset of 60 weeks in uninfected vMyb transgenics to 13 weeks in infected vMyb transgenics. We studied the loci into which the M-MuLV had inserted, and found that in 73% of animals, either the c-myc or the N-myc genes had been disrupted and deregulated. Therefore, v-myb and c-myb can cooperate to induce T cell lymphomas."
