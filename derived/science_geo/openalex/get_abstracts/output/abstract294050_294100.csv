https://openalex.org/W2050923523,"Polar orientation of molecules in solids leads to materials with potentially useful properties such as nonlinear optical and electrooptical activity, electrochromism, and pyroelectricity. A simple self-assembly procedure for preparing such materials is introduced that yields multiple polar dye monolayers on solid surfaces joined by zirconium phosphate-phosphonate interlayers. Second harmonic generation (SHG) shows that the multilayers have polar order that does not decrease with increasing numbers (up to a large number) of monolayers in the film. The inorganic interlayers, as determined by SHG, impart excellent orientational stability to the dye molecules, with the onset of orientational randomization above 150°C."

If the 1-micron absorption features are real, both chondritic and acidic rocks are ruled out as primary constituents of the surfaces of the bodies. The reflectance spectrum of Mars matches closely that of an oxidized basalt."

All samples gave concordant or nearly concordant ages, the maximum difference between the Pb206-U238 and Pb207-Pb206 ages being 10 percent. Sphene has more concordant ages than has the coexisting zircon in each of seven rocks in which they were compared. Sphene sometimes has greater ages than does coexisting biotite, although in two metamorphic rocks, in which metamorphism was sufficiently intense to cause redistribution of radiogenic strontium-87 between various mineral phases, sphene dates the time of metamorphism rather than of original crystallization of the rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2006096100,"In Recent surface sediments of the ocean floor Globorotalia truncatulinoides (d'Orbigny) grades from highly conical forms in tropical areas to rather compressed forms in cold-water areas. An interdependence exists between temperature of the surface water and form ratios as defined by mean ratio of width to height and mean ratio of width to the height from keel to ventral extremity. Values of these ratios serve to identify various water masses and thus constitute a potentially useful method in determining paleo-temperatures in Quaternary marine sediments. Subpolar populations, as end members of the cline, are found only in the Southern Hemisphere."

With the chromatographic solvent used, CCC was unlikely to interfere with the expression of the cytokinin response."
https://openalex.org/W1986487781,"Two faunal criteria define the Pleistocene-Recent boundary in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal: there is a marked decrease in the relative abundance of the Globigerina rubescens complex and a significant increase in the radiolarian number in sediments of the Recent epoch. The stratigraphic significance of the faunal criteria is supported by a carbon-14 date (8775 years before the present) obtained from foraminiferal tests in sediment at the faunal boundary, and previous publications on the stratigraphic significance of the radiolarian number in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The Globigerina rubescens complex, with greater relative abundances indicative of glacial substages, is an accurate indicator of cold and warm climatic intervals of the Wisconsin glacial stage."
https://openalex.org/W2071478011,"Ancient Jerusalem has long been known to possess a system of subterranean waterworks by which the spring of Gihon, which issues outside the walls, could be approached from within the city, and its waters diverted to an intramural pool. Most scholars regarded these waterworks as man-made, but the techniques of underground orientation and ventilation employed by the builders, as well as the numerous anomalies and ostensible mistakes in design, mystified investigators. Geological investigation has revealed the waterworks to be part of a well-developed karst system, a network of natural dissolution channels and shafts, in the limestone and dolomite underlying the city. Thus, it was not through primary planning but by means of skillful adaptation of these pre-existing natural features that the city was ensured of a dependable water supply during both war and peace. Likewise, knowledge of the subterranean access may have played a role in David's capture of the Jebusite city."

https://openalex.org/W2077954699,"Electroluminescence from semiconductor diode light sources can occur as a result of the application of a direct current at a low voltage to a suitably doped crystal containing a p-n junction. In recent years, it has become apparent that in some materials the efficiency of conversion of electric energy to visible light can be appreciably high. Since light-emitting diodes are compatible with the present electronic circuitry, they have many potential applications."
