MT1-MMP activated procollagenase-3 via a Mr 56,000 intermediate (Ile36 N terminus) to 48,000 which was the result of the cleavage of the Glu84-Tyr85 peptide bond. We have established that the activation rate of procollagenase-3 by MT1-MMP was enhanced in the presence of progelatinase A, thereby demonstrating a unique new activation cascade consisting of three members of the matrix metalloproteinase family.In addition, procollagenase-3 can be activated by plasmin, which cleaved the Lys38-Glu39 and Arg76-Cys77 peptide bonds in the propeptide domain. Autoproteolysis then resulted in the release of the rest of the propeptide domain generating Tyr85 N-terminal active collagenase-3. However, plasmin cleaved the C-terminal domain of collagenase-3 which results in the loss of its collagenolytic activity.Concanavalin A-stimulated fibroblasts expressing MT1-MMP and fibroblast-derived plasma membranes were able to process human procollagenase-3 via a Mr 56,000 intermediate form to the final Mr 48,000 active enzyme which, by analogy with progelatinase A activation, may represent a model system for in vivo activation. Inhibition experiments using tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, or aprotinin demonstrated that activation in the cellular model system was due to MT1-MMP/gelatinase A and excluded the participation of serine proteinases such as plasmin during procollagenase-3 activation. We have established that progelatinase A can considerably potentiate the activation rate of procollagenase-3 by crude plasma membrane preparations from concanavalin A-stimulated fibroblasts, thus confirming our results using purified progelatinase A and MT1-MMP. This new activation cascade may be significant in human breast cancer pathology, where all three enzymes have been implicated as playing important roles.

Degradation of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion is thought to result from a combined action of several proteolytic enzyme systems, including the collagenases and other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinaseMT1-MMPmembrane type matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-14)CT1399N4-hydroxy-N1-(1-(S-morpholinosulfonylaminoethylaminocarbonyl)-2-cyclohexyl-ethyl)-2-(R)-(4-chlorophenylpropyl)succinamide)PAI-2plasminogen activator inhibitor 2ConAconcanavalin AMcaPLGLDpaAR(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl)Ala-ArgNH2DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.

Human collagenase-3 (MMP-13), a new member of the MMP family, is expressed by breast tumors and is likely to play a crucial role in the modulation of extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interactions involved in metastasis (4Freije J.M.P.

Procollagenase-3 comprises three distinct domains which include an 85-amino acid residue propeptide that is lost during activation (5Knäuper V. López-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), and in which the conserved sequence PRCGVPD is responsible for the latency of the MMPs (6Becker J.W.

This sequence is followed by the catalytic domain containing the active site of the enzyme linked via a short hinge sequence motif to the third, C-terminal domain, that shows homology to vitronectin and which is essential for the collagenolytic activity of collagenase-3. 2V. Knäuper and G. Murphy, unpublished results. Collagenase-3 is a powerful collagenolytic and gelatinolytic enzyme that preferentially cleaves type II collagen, and it can therefore be implied that this enzyme may play a considerable role in connective tissue turnover (5Knäuper V. López-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). One of the key events in the regulation of extracellular collagenolytic activity is the activation of procollagenase-3, but there are currently only limited data available on how this may occur in vivo. We have recently shown that procollagenase-3 can be directly activated by stromelysin (5Knäuper V. López-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar); however, other mechanisms may be of physiological and pathophysiological significance. Increasing evidence is accumulating that the newly discovered membrane associated MMPs (MT-MMPs) act as cell surface activator(s) of progelatinase A (proMMP-2) under physiological or pathophysiological conditions (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 8Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J.

Cancer Res. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism was thought to be specific for progelatinase A, since other MMPs such as progelatinase B, fibroblast procollagenase, neutrophil procollagenase, and prostromelysin are not activated by MT1-MMP (13Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). 3G. Murphy, H. Will, and V. Knäuper, unpublished results. These cell surface MT-MMPs themselves may be activated intracellularly within the constitutive secretory pathway since they contain a RXRXR/KR furin recognition site, and it has been demonstrated that stromelysin-3, which also contains a similar motif, can be activated by furin (14Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Here we describe the activation of procollagenase-3 by recombinant gelatinase A and MT1-MMP which leads to the generation of extracellular collagenolytic activity. MT1-MMP and gelatinase A act by forming a proteolytic activation cascade which results in rapid activation of procollagenase-3. ConA-stimulated fibroblast monolayers expressing MT1-MMP and plasma membranes derived from them both activate procollagenase-3, thus providing evidence for a cell-surface activation cascade mechanism for procollagenase-3 similar to that described for progelatinase A. Human recombinant procollagenase-3 and recombinant wild type and Glu375→ Ala progelatinase A were expressed using stably transfected NSO mouse myeloma cells and purified from serum-free conditioned cell culture medium as recently described (5Knäuper V.

Plasmin was generated by activation of plasminogen (1 mg/ml; Sigma) using streptokinase (10 µg/ml; Sigma) at 37°C for 15 min. Recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were prepared from the culture medium of transfected NSO myeloma cells essentially as described elsewhere (17Murphy G. Houbrechts A.

A protein fragment consisting of the propeptide and catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (Δ289-580 numbering includes the signal sequence) was synthesized in Escherichia coli. In order to generate an expression plasmid the sequence of nucleotides 183-991 of the MT1-MMP cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-CCGCCTCCCTCGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-ATCTTAACCCTGACTCACC-3′, thereby introducing NcoI and BstEII restriction sites (underlined). The amplified cDNA was inserted into the NcoI and BstEII restriction sites of an E. coli expression plasmid derived from pUC 119 which contains a lacZ promoter and synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the pel B leader sequence (pel B: pectate lyase B of Erwinia carotova) and a polyhistidine tag (20Ward E.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus the assembled coding sequence of the vector consisted of 22 codons for the pel B signal sequence joined to the codons for the amino acid residues 24-288 of the MT1-MMP cDNA followed by the sequence LVTHHHHHH and a stop codon. The vector was transfected into the E. coli strain CAG597, and recombinant bacteria were grown for 8 h at 30°C at 250 rpm in 2YT medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and shaken for another 16 h. Cell pellets from 1 liter of bacterial cultures were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mM imidazole in 10% ethylene glycol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer A)) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The suspension was sonicated twice for 20 s at 200 watts. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 20 mM, and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml column of nickel-chelate-nitrilotriacetate. The column was washed sequentially with 80 ml of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mM imidazole, 2.5 mM CaCl2 in buffer A, and 25 ml of 20 mM imidazole, 2.5 mM CaCl2 in buffer A. The recombinant MT1-MMP was eluted with 100 mM imidazole, 2.5 mM CaCl2 in buffer A and appeared as a single band of Mr 31,000 on SDS-PAGE (not shown). N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed the sequence S24LG … which is consistent with the cDNA-derived sequence. Activation of recombinant MT1-MMP was achieved by brief treatment with trypsin, and the activated enzyme displayed the N-terminal sequence Y102AIQG. 4Will, H., Atkinson, S. J., Butler, G. S., Smith, B., and Murphy, G. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 17119-17123. Procollagenase-3 (12 µg) was incubated with 500 ng of active gelatinase A for the time intervals indicated. Treatment of 9 µg of procollagenase-3 with 528 ng of active MT1-MMP was performed at 37°C, for varying times as indicated. Activation of procollagenase-3 (15 µg) in the presence of either 720 ng of wild type progelatinase A or the inactive Glu375→ Ala progelatinase A mutant by 200 ng of MT1-MMP was performed at 37°C for the indicated time intervals. Procollagenase-3 (9 µg) was activated by plasmin (4 µg) in a time-dependent fashion followed by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of aprotinin. Samples for N-terminal sequence determination were purified by reverse phase HPLC prior to automated sequence determination essentially as recently described (5Knäuper V. López-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was determined using a quenched fluorescent peptide substrate (21Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Alternatively, collagenolytic activity was determined either using 14C-labeled type I collagen in a diffuse-fibril assay at 35°C (22Cawston T.E. Mercer E. Tyler J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 657: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or soluble type II collagen analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The concentration of active enzyme was determined using the fluorescent assay by titration against a standard TIMP-1 solution, the concentration of which had been determined by amino acid analysis (23Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the case of MT1-MMP active site titrations were performed using TIMP-2 and the quenched fluorescent peptide substrate as described above. Active MT1-MMP hydrolyzed this substrate with an apparent kcat/Km value of 2.6 × 105M−1s−1 at pH values between 8.5 and 9.5 which was shown to be the pH optimum for the reaction.4 A polyclonal antiserum to human procollagenase-3 was raised as described for rabbit collagenase (24Hembry R.M. Murphy G. Cawston T.E. Dingle J.T. Reynolds J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 81: 105-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by injecting 100 µg of purified recombinant procollagenase-3 into a sheep, followed by two further injections of 50 µg. Immunoglobulins were prepared from the bleed with the highest titer by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The full characterization of this antiserum will be described elsewhere; for the purposes of this report, Western blotting of the antiserum against procollagenase-3 identified a single band of Mr 60,000 (not shown), and procollagenase-3 added to either medium from ConA-stimulated fibroblasts (see Fig. 8A, lane 1) or ConA-stimulated fibroblast membrane preparations (Fig. 8B, lane 1) identified the Mr 60,000 band of the proenzyme and the Mr 48,000 band of the active form. Human foreskin fibroblasts were plated in 24-well Limbro dishes and grown to confluence in DMEM in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, washed with serum-free DMEM, and stimulated for 24 h with 50 µg/ml ConA in serum-free DMEM. The cell monolayers were incubated with either 100 ng of procollagenase-3 alone or in the presence of 100 ng or 10 µg of plasminogen in 300 µl of serum-free DMEM for 24 h at 37°C. In some experiments either TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, the peptide hydroxamate CT1399 (N4-hydroxy-N1-(1-(S-morpholinosulfonylaminoethylaminocarbonyl)-2-cyclohexyl-ethyl)-2-(R)-(4-chlorophenyl-propyl)succinamide)), aprotinin, or PAI-2 were included in order to demonstrate inhibition of processing. The conditioned medium from three wells was concentrated using Amicon microcon concentrators (Mr 10,000 cutoff) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Transferred proteins were then probed with polyclonal antibodies to human procollagenase-3 raised in sheep, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (Dako) using the Pierce enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit and the recommended protocol. Fibroblast membrane preparations were prepared from fibroblast cultures grown to confluence and stimulated with 50 µg/ml ConA essentially as described previously (13Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Slocombe P.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Resuspended membranes (15 µl; 1 mg/ml protein) were incubated with 50 ng of procollagenase-3 alone or in the presence of 50 ng of progelatinase A for 4-16.5 h at 37°C. Procollagenase-3 was incubated either alone or in the presence of progelatinase A in buffer as the appropriate control for processing. The collagenolytic activity of 16.6 ng of activated collagenase-3 was monitored by incubation with 2.5 µg of type II collagen for 16 h at 25°C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molecular mass changes of 33 ng of procollagenase-3 during the membrane-mediated activation were demonstrated by Western blotting as described above. Human procollagenase-3 was processed by active gelatinase A (23:1 molar ratio) which resulted in the rapid generation of enzymatic activity within 60 min (Fig. 1) with a concomitant loss of the propeptide domain, thereby reducing the molecular mass of the proenzyme (Mr 60,000) to 48,000 (Fig. 1, lanes 2-4). N-terminal sequence determination revealed that the Glu84-Tyr85 peptide bond was hydrolyzed during the activation reaction (Fig. 2). Due to the lack of specific MMP inhibitors which would block the activity of each enzyme we have been unable to exclude the possibility that transient intermediate forms may be generated.Fig. 2N-terminal amino acid sequence of human procollagenase-3 (proMMP-13), demonstration of the gelatinase A (MMP-2), MT1-MMP (MMP-14), and plasmin cleavage sites within the propeptide domain of procollagenase-3. Fully active collagenase-3, generated by MT1-MMP, gelatinase A, or plasmin showed a single identical N terminus (Tyr85).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human procollagenase-3 was susceptible to cleavage by the active form of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP which resulted in activation of the proenzyme as demonstrated in Fig. 3. The relative molecular mass of the proenzyme (Mr 60,000) was reduced to 48,000 which coincided with the increase in enzymatic activity (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5). At a 9:1 molar ratio nearly all the proenzyme was converted to the Mr 48,000 active species after 240 min of incubation. The activation of procollagenase-3 by MT1-MMP proceeded without the generation of visible intermediates in the absence of inhibitors. However, activation of procollagenase-3 in the presence of TIMP-1 by MT1-MMP revealed that an intermediate species was generated with an apparent Mr of 56,000 (Fig. 4, lane 2), as also observed in cell activation experiments (see “Processing of Procollagenase-3 (proMMP-13) by ConA-stimulated Fibroblast Monolayers and Influence of Plasmin in the Processing Rate”). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the Gly35-Ile36 peptide bond within the propeptide domain was initially hydrolyzed by MT1-MMP which was followed by the cleavage of the Glu84-Tyr85 peptide bond (Fig. 2). This suggests that either final processing occurs by an autoproteolytic step which is prevented by the presence of TIMP-1 through complex formation with the intermediate collagenase-3 species, or the collagenase-3-TIMP-1 complex is not susceptible to further cleavage by MT1-MMP. It is currently not possible to distinguish between these two processing routes due to a lack of MMP inhibitors which block either collagenase-3 or MT1-MMP specifically. Processing of procollagenase-3 was completely inhibited by recombinant TIMP-2 (Fig. 4, lane 3) or TIMP-3 (not shown) indicating that at least the initial cleavage was due to MT1-MMP. TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are more effective inhibitors of MT1-MMP with kon values comparable to those for gelatinase A while TIMP-1 reacts extremely slowly with an insignificant kon value.4Fig. 4Inhibition of the MT1-MMP (MMP-14) induced Mr reduction of procollagenase-3 (proMMP-13) by TIMP-2 and generation of the intermediate Mr 56,000 collagenase-3 form in the presence of TIMP-1 by SDS-PAGE.

Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) or buffer. Analysis of the reaction mixtures revealed that the activation rate of procollagenase-3 was enhanced in the presence of wild type progelatinase A while activation in the presence of the mutant corresponded to the rate observed with MT1-MMP alone (Fig. 5). The concentration of MT1-MMP activated gelatinase A used to potentiate procollagenase-3 activation was not high enough to lead to detectable substrate hydrolysis in the assay and furthermore the active MT1-MMP showed likewise no hydolysis of McaPLGLDpaAR under these conditions. Analysis of the reaction products by SDS-PAGE revealed that the molecular mass of procollagenase-3 was reduced to Mr 48,000 during activation which corresponds to the active species (Fig. 6, A and B). Activation in the presence of progelatinase A was more rapid and the reaction was completed within about 200 min (Fig. 6A, lane 6). In contrast, MT1-MMP alone (not shown) or in the presence of Glu375→ Ala progelatinase A was much slower and the conversion to the Mr 48,000 species was only partially completed after 380 min (Fig. 6B, lane 8; about 45% conversion). This indicated that MT1-MMP generated active gelatinase A during procollagenase-3 activation reaction,4 which then significantly contributed to the conversion of procollagenase-3 to the active enzyme (Fig. 6A and see also Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The low concentration of active gelatinase A generated in the incubation mixture was not sufficient to initiate substrate hydrolysis, since the appropriate control experiment, i.e. the activation of progelatinase A by MT1-MMP in the presence of buffer, showed no activity (Fig. 5, ♦). The decline in collagenase-3 activity following activation by gelatinase A and MT1-MMP is due to instability of the active enzyme and has also been observed during APMA or trypsin activation (5Knäuper V. López-Otin C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left. The rate of Mr reduction of MMP-13 to the active enzyme was considerably increased in the presence of wild type proMMP-2 that is due to activation of MMP-2 which then significantly contributes to the conversion of proMMP-13 to the active enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human procollagenase-3 was activated by plasmin in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 7), and fully active enzyme was generated after about 120 min as assessed by the synthetic substrate assay. Analysis of the activation process by SDS-PAGE performed under reducing conditions indicated that, concomitant with the increase in activity, there was a drop in Mr of the proenzyme from 60,000 to 48,000 (Fig. 7, lane 2). The procollagenase-3 used in the activation experiments displayed about 5% activity prior to activation, but, as can be seen from Fig. 7, no further activation was observed for the buffer control. Thus the reduction in Mr was due to plasmin activity and could be blocked by plasmin inhibitors such as aprotinin (Fig. 7, lane 3). No intermediate enzyme forms were initially detectable by SDS-PAGE during activation. However, activation in the presence of the synthetic MMP inhibitor CT1399 showed that plasmin generated a transient Mr 56,000 species (Fig. 7, lane 4), and N-terminal sequence determination revealed that plasmin generated two intermediate forms through cleavage of the Lys38-Glu39 peptide bond followed by cleavage of the Arg76-Cys77 peptide bond within the propeptide domain (Fig. 2). It was observed that plasmin activation of procollagenase-3 led to the accelerated release of the C-terminal domain of the enzyme, even in the presence of the MMP inhibitor CT1399 (not shown) at concentrations sufficient to completely inhibit collagenase-3 activity. The final conversion to Tyr85 N-terminal collagenase-3 was inhibited in the presence of CT1399, indicating that this step is due to autoproteolysis, which leads to the release of the rest of the propeptide domain, and this was observed only in the absence of CT1399. Amino acid sequence analysis of the final reaction product revealed that the Glu84-Tyr85 peptide bond was hydrolyzed by collagenase-3. The loss of the C-terminal domain of collagenase-3 was also observed during MT1-MMP, gelatinase A, and p-aminophenylmercuric acetate activation, but at a slower rate. This was due to the autoproteolytic hydrolysis of the Ser245-Leu246 peptide bond2 and could be inhibited by CT1399. Thus plasmin could transiently generate active collagenase-3, which was followed by cleavage within the hinge sequence motif leading to loss of the collagenolytic activity of the enzyme (not shown). Human procollagenase-3 was partially processed via a Mr 56,000 intermediate form to the final Mr 48,000 active enzyme by ConA-stimulated fibroblast mono"

The cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 and its ligand have been recently identified as important mediators of apoptosis. Here, we show that constitutive expression of human heat shock protein (hsp)27 in murine L929 cells blocks Fas/APO-1-mediated cell death. Expression of human hsp27 prevented anti-APO-1-induced DNA fragmentation and morphological changes. These results strongly suggest that human hsp27 acts as a cellular inhibitor of Fas/APO-1-induced apoptosis. We also report that the expression of small stress proteins from different species, such as human hsp27, Drosophila Dhsp27, or human αB-crystallin, confers resistance to apoptotic cell death induced by staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor. Hence, small stress proteins are novel regulators that are able to block apoptosis induced by different pathways.

Recently, a G:U repair reaction has been reconstituted with several purified enzymes from Escherichia coli (Dianov, G., and Lindahl, T. (1994) Curr. Biol. 4, 1069-1076). Using bovine testis crude nuclear extract, we have shown that G:U is repaired efficiently in vitro, and DNA polymerase β (β-pol) is responsible for the single nucleotide gap-filling synthesis (Singhal, R.

To investigate potential interaction of β-pol with other BER protein(s), we developed affinity chromatography matrices by cross-linking purified rat β-pol or antibody against β-pol to solid supports. Crude nuclear extract from bovine testis was applied to these affinity columns, which were then extensively washed. Proteins that bound specifically to the affinity columns were co-eluted in a complex with β-pol. This complex had a molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa and was able to conduct the complete uracil-initiated BER reaction. The BER complex contained both β-pol and DNA ligase I. An antibody to β-pol was able to shift the complex in sucrose gradients to a much larger molecular mass (>300 kDa) that again contained both β-pol and DNA ligase I. Furthermore, DNA ligase I and β-pol were co-immunoprecipitated from the testis nuclear extract with anti β-pol IgG. Thus, we conclude that β-pol and DNA ligase I are components of a multiprotein complex that performs BER. Base excision repair (BER) is a cellular defense mechanism repairing modified bases in DNA.

Activation of fatty acids catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS, 1The abbreviations used are: ACSacyl-CoA synthetasekbkilobase(s)GSTglutathione S-transferaseLS regionsluciferase similar regionsPCRpolymerase chain reaction. EC) is an initial reaction of fatty acid metabolism in eukaryotic cells. This reaction is indispensable in fatty acid utilization; thereby ACS plays a key role in lipid metabolism. Acyl-CoA produced by this enzyme is a key intermediate in two major metabolic pathways: degradation of fatty acids via the β-oxidation system; and synthesis of cellular lipids that include triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters. In addition, acyl-CoA is utilized in numerous reactions, including protein modification (1Grand R.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and intracellular protein transport (2Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1987; 326: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).

The brain is one of the most lipid-enriched organs in the body. Most brain lipids are actively synthesized in the brain itself and deposited in large amounts during the early phase of development of the nervous system (16Kabara J.J. Prog. Brain Res. 1973; 40: 363-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Sastry P.S. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 69-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of lipids in the brain, relatively little is known about lipid metabolism in the brain. In a previous study, we have shown the presence of a brain-specific isozyme designated brain ACS (hereafter referred to as ACS2) by cDNA cloning (18Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). ACS2 resembles the well characterized ACS (hereafter referred to as ACS1) in amino acid sequence (5Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y.

Toh H. Suzuki H. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); approximately 65% of the amino acids in the two enzymes are identical. Although ACS1 and ACS2 are structurally similar and exhibit similar fatty acid specificity, the patterns of tissue expression of the two enzymes are completely different. ACS1 mRNA is most abundant in liver, heart, and adipose tissue and, to a much lesser extent, in brain (5Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ACS2 is predominantly expressed in the brain (18Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem.

However, none of these enzymes have been fully characterized by purification or cDNA cloning. To further extend our studies on ACS in brain, we have isolated a cDNA that encodes a new brain-type ACS distinct from ACS1 and ACS2. We describe here the primary structure, expression, and regulation of this brain-type ACS designated ACS3. We also describe the enzymatic properties of the purified enzyme from COS cells transfected with ACS3 cDNA. Unless otherwise indicated, all restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Takara Shuzo Corp. (Kyoto, Japan). [α-35S]dCTP (∼1000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/ml), [1-14C] palmitic acid (∼50 mCi/mmol), and L-[35S]methionine from Amersham Corp. Rat liver ACS1 was purified from the microsomal fraction as described by Tanaka et al. (25Tanaka T. Hosaka K. Hoshimaru M. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the purified ACS1 was 23 µmol/min/mg protein at 37°C when measured by the isotopic method using palmitate as a substrate. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.; model 381A). Standard molecular biology techniques were carried out essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA fragments were subcloned into pUC vectors in both orientations and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52055) Google Scholar) performed with T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, version 2.0; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [α-35S]dCTP. To sequence the entire region of the cDNA, the cDNA fragments were shortened successively by exonuclease III (28Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pUC vectors. For Northern blotting, total RNA prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (29MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) was denatured with 1 M glyoxal and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, fractionated in a 1.5% agarose gel, and transferred to a Zeta Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). Poly(A) RNA was prepared from adult rat brain total RNA using oligo(dT)-Latex (Takara Shuzo) as described (30Kuribayashi-Ohta K. Tamatsukuri S. Hikata M. Miyamoto C. Furuichi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1156: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A mixture of oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs was synthesized from 3 µg of brain poly(A) RNA using oligo(dT)15 (1.5 µg), 25 units of RNasin, and 400 units of Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 30 µl of standard reverse transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 15 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate) at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction products were then subjected to replacement synthesis of the second strand cDNA (31Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar). The resulting double-stranded cDNA was precipitated in ethanol and dissolved in 20 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA. Five µl of the cDNA were amplified with PCR (32Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13312) Google Scholar) using two highly degenerate primers derived from the most highly conserved amino acid sequences among ACS1, ACS2, and click beetle luciferase (18Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The sequences of the sense primer and the antisense primer were 5′-GG(A/G/C/T)A(G/C)(A/G/C/T)AC(A/G/C/T)GG(A/G/C/T)A(A/T)(A/G/C/T)CC(A/G/C/T)AA(A/G)GG-3′ and 5′-GA(C/T)GG(A/G/C/T)T(A/G)(G/C/T)T(A/T)(A/G/C/T)(A/C)A(A/G/C/T)(A/T)C(A/G/C/T)GG(A/G/C/T)GA-3′, respectively. PCR amplification was carried out using 1 nmol of each primer and 0.75 unit of Taq DNA polymerase in 100 µl of standard PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphopshate). The thermal profile used was 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 1 min, and then 72°C for 2 min. After 30 cycles, the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Major reaction products (0.5-1.0 kb) were eluted from the gel, subcloned into T-vectors (33Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), and sequenced. By sequencing 50 clones, we obtained a cDNA encoding a new type of ACS (pOCT5-5). Rat brain cDNA library (18Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) constructed in Okayama-Berg vector (34Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) was screened using a 290-base pair cDNA fragment from pOCT5-5 as a probe. By screening of 3 × 105 clones, we obtained eight positive clones; one representative clone containing the largest cDNA insert (pACS3) was further characterized. COS-7 cells were grown in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with 10 µg of plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran procedure (35Kluxen F.-W. Lübbert H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three days after DNA transfection, the cells were harvested for measurement of ACS activity. ACS activity was determined at 37°C either by the isotopic method (19Wilson D.B. Prescott S.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3510-3515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the spectrophotometric method (25Tanaka T. Hosaka K. Hoshimaru M. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); the latter was used only for the purified enzyme. The ratio of the activity measured by the spectrophotometric method (with the standard mixture) to that measured by the isotopic method (with the standard mixture) was 0.75. All assays were carried out within the range where the reaction proceeded linearly with time and the initial rate of reaction was proportional to the amount of enzyme added. The protein content of cell extract was measured by the Lowry method (36Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The reaction product of the enzyme reaction was determined as described (25Tanaka T. Hosaka K. Hoshimaru M. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A typical purification is described. All purification procedures were carried out at 4°C. One hundred fifty dishes (100-mm diameter) of COS-7 cells transfected with pACS3 were suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol) containing 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, disrupted by sonication (three pulses of 15 s in an ice bath, 100 watts), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 1 h to obtain microsomes. The microsomal fraction was suspended in 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 200 mM KCl using a Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was gently stirred for 1 h and then centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against buffer B (25 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and applied to a Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with three column volumes of buffer A. The void and wash fractions exhibiting enzyme activities were collected and applied to a Blue-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) column (1.5 × 8 cm) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer C (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 mM ATP and then eluted with a linear gradient between 100 ml of buffer C and the same volume of buffer C containing 2 M NaCl. The pooled fractions exhibiting ACS activities were concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon CF-25. The concentrated enzyme solution was dialyzed against buffer C and stored at −80°C. The results of the purification of ACS3 are summarized in Table I. The overall purification was 11-fold with a yield of 22%. The purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 4.62 µmol/min/mg protein at 37°C when measured by the isotopic method using palmitate as a substrate. The purified enzyme could be stored at −80°C for at least 3 months without loss of activity.Table ISummary of the purification of ACS3 from COS cells transfected with pACS3StepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldmgµmol/minµmol/min/mg%Microsomes66.727.50.41100Triton X-100 extract35.426.90.7698Q-Sepharose10.321.12.0577Blue-Sepharose1.326.14.6222 Open table in a new tab The entire coding region of ACS3 cDNA was introduced into pBluescript SK(+) vector, purified by CsCl banding, and translated in a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 1 µg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 µl and was incubated at 30°C for 1 h. For radiolabeling, the plasmid was translated in a methionine-free amino acid mixture supplemented with [35S]methionine, according to the instruction of the manufacturer. An aliquot (5 µl) of the reaction mixture was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a fragment of ACS3 (see below) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A fusion protein of GST and a fragment of ACS3 was used to immunize rabbits. To produce the GST-ACS3 fusion protein, a cDNA fragment encoding ACS3 amino acids 72-223 was ligated in-frame to a pGEX bacterial expression vector (Pharmacia). The fusion protein was induced in Escherichia coli JM109 with isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. E. coli cells were sonicated in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended with the lysis buffer containing 5 M urea and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The fusion protein recovered in the pellet was then dissolved by boiling in the SDS-sample buffer, purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and used as an antigen. A new type of ACS designated ACS3 was isolated through PCR-mediated DNA amplification by using two degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the conserved amino acid sequences among ACS1, ACS2 and click beetle luciferase (18Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fifty clones isolated by PCR amplification were sequenced, and the sequence of one of them (pOCT5-5) showed 25% amino acid identity with the corresponding regions of ACS1 and ACS2. To obtain a cDNA encoding a complete coding region, an adult rat brain cDNA library was screened by hybridization with a 32P-labeled insert of pOCT5-5 under high stringency conditions. Screening 5 × 105 clones, we obtained eight positive clones. A representative clone (designated pACS3) containing the largest cDNA insert was sequenced. The insert of the cDNA includes a 2160-base pair open reading frame encoding a protein of 720 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of Mr 80,456 (Fig. 1A). The putative initiator methionine was preceded by an in-frame stop codon present 39 nucleotides upstream. In previous studies, we have shown that ACS1 and ACS2 consist of two regions, designated luciferase similar regions 1 and 2 (LS regions 1 and 2) that contain amino acids highly conserved among the members of the ACS/luciferase family (5Suzuki H. Kawarabayasi Y. Kondo J. Abe T. Nishikawa K. Kimura S. Hashimoto T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8681-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Abe T. Fujino T. Fukuyama R.

(Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Between ACS1 and ACS2, the amino acids in the two LS regions and the COOH terminus are highly conserved (18Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similarly, the amino acids in the two LS regions and the COOH terminus are most highly conserved between ACS2 and ACS3 (amino acid identity of 30-38%; Fig. 1B); the NH2-terminal and a linker connecting LS regions 1 and 2 lacked amino acid conservation. Like ACS1 and ACS2, the two LS regions of ACS3 are most similar to the corresponding regions of click beetle luciferase among the members of the ACS/luciferase family (excluding ACSs) from various origins (Fig. 1B). To characterize the fatty acid specificity and kinetic properties of the purified ACS3, the cloned ACS3 cDNA was introduced into COS cells. When measured with palmitate as a substrate, COS cells transfected with the cDNA exhibited 8-10-fold increased ACS activities as compared with those transfected with vector alone (data not shown). Attempts to overproduce the recombinant enzyme in E. coli cells were unsuccessful. In COS cells expressing ACS3, most of the enzyme activity was found in the microsomal fraction (data not shown). Using the microsomal fraction of the ACS3-transfected cells as a starting material, ACS3 was purified to near homogeneity. The purification procedure involved solubilization of the enzyme with Triton X-100 and chromatography on Q-Sepharose and Blue-Sepharose (Table I). When measured by the isotopic method using palmitate as a substrate, the purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 4.62 µmol/min/mg protein at 37°C. This value is 5-fold lower than that of the purified ACS1. The purified ACS3 resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into two major proteins with 79 and 80 kDa (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the purification of the 79-and 80-kDa proteins, cell-free translation of a synthetic mRNA encoding the entire region of ACS3 produced 79- and 80-kDa proteins that were precipitated with the anti-ACS3-GST antibody (Fig. 2B). This indicates that the two isoforms are derived from the same mRNA. Although the synthetic mRNA contains an in-frame stop codon 39 nucleotides upstream of the initiator AUG, a minor protein (87 kDa) copurified with the 79- and 80-kDa proteins was also detected in the cell-free translation. The nature of this 87-kDa protein is currently unknown. Fatty acid specificity of the purified enzyme was determined by the spectrophotometric method using various fatty acids. Fig. 3 compares the fatty acid specificity of the purified ACS3 with that of the purified ACS1. The purified ACS3 utilizes laurate and myristate most efficiently among C8-C22 saturated fatty acids and arachidonate and eicosapentaenoate among C16-C20 unsaturated fatty acids. This fatty acid specificity is completely different from that of the purified ACS1, which uses C10-C18 saturated fatty acids and C16-C20 unsaturated fatty acids with approximately equivalent activities. Unlike the purified ACS1, the purified ACS3 prefers C16-C20 unsaturated fatty acids; the relative activities of ACS3 for these fatty acids are ∼2-fold higher than those of ACS1. Although the purified ACS1 and ACS3 exhibited different fatty acid specificities, the apparent Km values of the two enzymes for myristate and arachidonate were in the same range (10-15 µM). The purified ACS3 has optimal activity at pH 7.0-8.5 and requires ATP (Km = 0.5 ± 0.04 mM), CoA (Km = 0.53 ± 0.08 µM), and fatty acids. The reaction product formed by the enzyme from [14C]palmitate was identified as palmitoyl-CoA by chromatographic analysis of its hydroxamic acid derivative. When adenylate kinase was omitted from the reaction mixture for the spectrophotometric assay, no oxidation of NADH occurred, indicating that AMP was a reaction product. Northern blot analysis using a ACS3 cDNA probe revealed that ACS3 mRNA is expressed as a 3.3-kb transcript in normal adult rat tissues (Fig. 4A). The ACS3 mRNA is predominantly expressed in the brain and appears, to a much lesser extent, in lung, adrenal gland, kidney, small intestine, and adipose tissue but is not detected in heart or liver. Consistent with its predominant expression in the brain, ACS3 mRNA was detected in rat C6 glioma, rat glioma KEG1, and rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (Fig. 4B). During the development of rat brain, ACS3 mRNA was detectable 5 days after birth, increased to a maximum level at 15 days, and then decreased gradually to 10% of its maximum level in the adult (Fig. 5A). In contrast, ACS2 mRNA increased gradually and reached a maximum level in the adult, and no change was observed in ACS1 mRNA levels during brain development (Fig. 5, B and C). The presence in the brain of multiple forms of ACS with different fatty acid specificity is of considerable biological significance for controlling the synthesis of brain lipids. Although the exact nature of the enzyme remains to be elucidated, the availability of the cDNA will allow us to establish a mouse strain lacking this enzyme. This may reveal the role of the enzyme in the brain. We thank Dr. Akihiko Kawaguchi for helpful advice and discussions and Dr. Ian Gleadall for helpful comments on the manuscript."

M., Schlessinger, J., and Sap, J. (1993) Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 2942-2951) and was therefore termed hPTPκ. We show here that hPTPκ expression is dependent on cell density and find it colocalized with two members of the arm family of proteins, β-catenin and γ-catenin/plakoglobin, at adherens junctions. Using both in vitro and in vivo binding assays, we demonstrate specific complex formation between endogenous hPTPκ and β- and γ-catenin/plakoglobin. In addition, we present evidence that suggests that β-catenin may represent a substrate for the catalytic activity of hPTPκ. The identification of specific binding partners for this receptor-like PTP provides insight into the mechanisms of its biological action and suggests a role for hPTPκ in the regulation of processes involving cell contact and adhesion such as growth control, tumor invasion, and metastasis.

A variety of biological signals that regulate cell growth, migration, differentiation, and survival are mediated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

These processes are thought to be counteracted by a family of proteins termed protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseRPTPreceptor-like PTPPCRpolymerase chain reactionCMVcytomegalovirusFCSfetal calf serumGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

Dephosphorylation by PTPs can either inactivate a signal generated by protein phosphorylation (4Klingmüller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F.

Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). PTPs can be subdivided into receptor-like plasma membrane-spanning and soluble cytosolic forms. Their biological function appears to be determined not only by specific target substrates but also by their intracellular localization to distinct compartments (7Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The subfamily of receptor-like PTPs (RPTP) is composed of five different classes based on structural motifs in their extracellular domain (9Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Identification of amino acid motifs that resemble those of cell adhesion molecules in the extracellular domain of class II and III RPTPs has led to the suggestion that these PTPs may be involved in the regulation of cell contact formation. The observation that overexpression of PTPµ and PTPκ can induce cell aggregation by homophilic interaction of their respective extracellular regions supports this hypothesis (10Brady-Kalnay S.M.

The key molecules involved in the formation of cell-cell adhesions are members of the cadherin-catenin family (15Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which connect adjacent cells via cadherin extracellular domain-mediated homophilic, Ca2+-dependent interactions (16Geiger B. Ayalon O.

The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin on the other hand is responsible for the complex formation with the intracellular catenins (18Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

The biological function of cell-cell adhesions, however, extends beyond a mere maintenance of the cellular architecture, and a direct involvement of these specialized molecules in signal transduction events has been postulated. β-Catenin and γ-catenin/plakoglobin are homologous to the Drosophila armadillo (arm) protein (32Riggleman B.

The characteristic feature of these proteins is the presence of a variable number of 42 amino acid repeats (arm motif; 32Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) makes the question as to how PTPs are involved in cell contact formation all the more compelling. In this report, we describe the identification of a human PTP that represents the homolog of murine PTPκ (46Jiang Y.-P. Wang H. D'Eustachio P. Musacchio J.M. Schlessinger J. Sap J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This class II transmembrane phosphatase is expressed in a cell density-dependent fashion and is recruited to areas of cell-cell contact. hPTPκ colocalizes with cell adhesion molecule-associated proteins at adherens junctions and associates in vitro and in intact cells with two members the armadillo family of proteins. Our observations strongly suggest a biological role of hPTPκ in the regulation of cell contact and adhesion.

PCR products were cloned in an eukaryotic expression vector under the control of the CMV promoter and confirmed by sequence analysis. All cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC).

Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered gelatin (PBG: PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.045% fish gelatin). Incubation with primary antibodies was done at room temperature for 2 h after dilution in PBG, 1:100 for polyclonal anti-hPTPκ-JM-1, 1:200 for monoclonal anti-plakoglobin/γ-catenin and monoclonal anti-β-catenin. After three washes in PBG, primary antibody binding was detected with isotype-specific secondary antibody, dichlorotriazinyl-amino-fluorescein-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit IgG (1:200), or Cy3-conjugated donkey-anti-mouse IgG (1:300, Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and coverslips mounted under glycerol-2.5% 1,4-diazo-bicyclo(2.2.2)octan. Transient transfection of human 293 embryonic kidney cells was performed as described (54Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer/10-cm plate (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM NaFl, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate), and lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Prior to immunoprecipitations, lysates were adjusted for equal protein concentrations, and the appropriate antibody and protein A-Sepharose were added to the lysate and incubated for 3 h at 4°C. Precipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and SDS-sample buffer was added. For subsequent Western blot analysis, the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell) and incubated with the respective antibody. The ECL system (Amersham Corp.) in conjunction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) was used to visualize proteins recognized by the antibodies. Before reprobing blots were incubated for 1 h in 67 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol at 50°C. In vitro mutagenesis of PTPκ was performed according to the method described by Kunkel (55Kunkel T. Roberts J. Zakour R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-pTCGTCCAGCACCAGCATCGGCATGTACAACGATGGGGCC-3′ for Cys-Ala mutation of the NH2-terminal PTPase domain (aa 1082) and 5′-pTCGCCCGCCACCATTTAGAGCGTGGATAATCGTCCGGCC-3′ for Cys-Ala mutation in the COOH-terminal PTPase domain (aa 1376). The double Cys mutant was designated hPTPκ-C/A. Plasmids coding for hPTPκ/Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins were constructed by amplification of the sequences between amino acids 783-1439 of hPTPκ; amino acids 783-1439 of hPTPκ-C/A and the juxtamembrane region of hPTPκ, amino acids 783-904, using the PCR method (named GST-hPTPκi, GST-hPTPκi-C/A, and GST-hPTPκ-JM, respectively). PCR products were subcloned in the appropriate pGEX vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and sequenced to confirm the integrity of the sequence. GST fusion proteins were prepared and purified as described (54Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22456-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the in vitro binding assay γ-catenin/plakoglobin and β-catenin were transiently expressed as described above. Lysates were incubated with 5 µg of GST-hPTPκi, GST-hPTPκ-JM, or 8 µg of GST alone, immobilized on Glutathione Sepharose, rotated 3 h at 4°C, and washed three times with HNTG. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blotting. β-Catenin was transiently overexpressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Cells were serum-starved, treated with pervanadate (0.3 mM H2O2, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate) for 10 min and lysed. Immunoprecipitation and washing were performed as described above. PTPase activity toward tyrosine phosphorylated β-catenin was assayed in 100-µl reactions containing 50 mM acetate (pH 5.5), 10 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1% CHAPS (Sigma) with 50 ng of GST-hPTPκi or GST-hPTPκi-C/A added. Enzymatic activity was stopped by addition of 50 µl of SDS sample buffer and immediate boiling. The reaction mix was separated by SDS-PAGE and the tyrosine phosphorylation status analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Ab 116 represents a polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide sequence (residues 60-76) within the extracellular domain of hPTPκ. Additional hPTPκ-specific antisera were generated by subcloning a fragment encoding the 93 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (CT-1), the nucleotides corresponding to the amino acids 783-904 (JM-1) or amino acids 1181-1336 (D2-1), respectively, in the fusion protein expression vector pGEX (Pharmacia). The fusion proteins were purified as described (56Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5017) Google Scholar) and used for immunizing rabbits. Monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., β-catenin, and γ-catenin/plakoglobin antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. The monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody was described before (57Sergienko E.A. Kharitonenkov A.L. Bulargina T.V. Muronetz V.V. Nagradova N.K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 21-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To investigate PTP expression and function in cancer cells, we performed PCR experiments employing mRNA preparations from the human mammary carcinoma cell line SK-BR-3 and degenerated oligonucleotide primer pools corresponding to conserved sequences within the PTP catalytic domains (48Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the cloned PCR fragments revealed the expression of several previously characterized as well as novel PTPs. One of the sequences was highly represented (18%) in the 121 clones examined and was used to screen a λ ZAP II SK-BR-3 cDNA library at high stringency. Eleven overlapping clones were assembled to a full-length clone of 6.1 kb in size (not shown). Its open reading frame, coding for a 1439-amino acid sequence, displayed a high degree of homology (95.4%) with the murine type II transmembrane PTPκ (46Jiang Y.-P. Wang H. D'Eustachio P. Musacchio J.M. Schlessinger J. Sap J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We concluded that our clone represented the human homolog of this previously identified mouse PTP and accordingly termed it hPTPκ. The deduced amino acid sequence of hPTPκ is shown in comparison with mPTPκ in Fig. 1A. Using Northern blot analysis hPTPκ mRNA transcripts were found at high levels in human lung, brain, and colon, and to a lesser extent in liver, pancreas, stomach, kidney, and placenta as well as in mammary carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-453, HBL-100, T-47D, MDA-MB-435, BT-20, BT-474, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 (data not shown). Several structural features suggested that hPTPκ may be involved in cell adhesion, including a MAM domain (13Beckmann G. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 8: 40-41Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar), one possible Ig-like domain, and four fibronectin type III-related domains that match the FNIII-like repeats of LAR (58Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), PTPβ (59Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), PTPσ (60Yan H. Grossman A. Wang H. D'Eustachio P. Mossie K. Musacchio J.M. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24880-24886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RPTPµ (61Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. van Kessel A.G. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To investigate the properties of the hPTPκ gene product, the complete cDNA was cloned into a cytomegalovirus early promoter-based expression vector and transfected into 293 human embryonic kidney cells. Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against a fragment within the extracellular domain (Fig. 1B, left panel) or against the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1B, right panel) of hPTPκ resulted in the detection of three bands of 185 kDa, approximately 115 kDa, and 97 kDa, respectively. Since the calculated mass of hPTPκ was determined to be 163 kDa, it was likely that the 185-kDa band represented the glycosylated form of the entire hPTPκ polypeptide chain, while the 115- and 97-kDa bands could be defined subunits of hPTPκ. Among other possibilities these fragments may be the result of endoprotease furin cleavage in the extracellular domain of hPTPκ (Fig. 1A; residues 640-643) (62Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 63Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.-S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since similar processing events have been described for several other type II PTPases (46Jiang Y.-P. Wang H. D'Eustachio P. Musacchio J.M. Schlessinger J. Sap J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Yan H. Grossman A. Wang H. D'Eustachio P. Mossie K. Musacchio J.M. Silvennoinen O.

Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The 115-kDa band, which was identified to contain extracellular sequences because it could be detected with an antiserum raised against amino acid residues 60-76 in the MAM domain, was termed α-fragment (Fig. 1B, left panel). The 97-kDa fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domain was termed β-fragment (Fig. 1B, right panel). That the RTKR sequence is indeed the cleavage site was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, which demonstrated that alteration of RTKR to LTNR resulted in a noncleaved hPTPκ protein (data not shown). The motifs within the extracellular domain of hPTPκ that resemble those of proteins involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions led us to investigate whether the level of hPTPκ expression was affected by density of cells growing in culture. SK-BR-3 mammary carcinoma cells were harvested at 30, 70, and 100% density, and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared. Northern blot analysis with a probe corresponding to the extracellular domain of hPTPκ revealed an elevation in hPTPκ transcript levels with increasing cell density (Fig. 2A, top). The intensity of the signal obtained with a GAPDH probe was not affected (Fig. 2A, bottom). Thus, expression of the hPTPκ gene appears to be up-regulated by signals triggered upon cell contact. To confirm that the increase in hPTPκ mRNA transcripts is reflected on the protein level, cells were grown as described above, lysed, adjusted for protein concentration, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis with the anti-hPTPκ specific antibody D2-1 revealed a severalfold increase in hPTPκ protein level with increasing cell density (Fig. 2B, top). Reprobing with an anti-GAPDH specific monoclonal antibody revealed comparable amounts of protein (Fig. 2B, bottom). We investigated the localization of PTPκ by immunocytochemical methods in different cell lines such as NBT-II and HT29 cells. Conventional fluorescent microscopy revealed that PTPκ was localized predominantly along the cell-cell contacts of adjacent cells, while only weak fluorescence was detectable at the contact-free cell membranes. A representative staining of NBT-II cells is shown in Fig. 3A. To confirm the specificity of the fluorescent signal, cells were incubated with nonimmuneserum, with anti-hPTPκ antiserum preincubated with GST-hPTPκ fusion protein or without primary antibody (Fig. 3, B, C, and D, respectively). Since intercellular junctions are the predominant localization of the cadherin-associated proteins β-catenin and γ-catenin/plakoglobin, we performed double labeling experiments for PTPκ (Fig. 3, E and G) and β-catenin or γ-catenin/plakoglobin (Fig. 3, F and H, respectively). Using laser confocal microscopy with monoclonal anti-β-catenin or anti-γ-catenin/plakoglobin antibodies and the anti-hPTPκ antibody JM-1, we found colocalization of these proteins at cell-cell contacts as indicated by yellow fluorescence (Fig. 3, I and K, respectively), which arises from the superimposition of the red β-catenin/plakoglobin and the green hPTPκ label. The colocalization of hPTPκ with β-catenin and γ-catenin/plakoglobin prompted us to investigate whether these proteins associate with hPTPκ in vitro. We constructed GST fusion proteins containing either the whole cytoplasmic part of hPT"
https://openalex.org/W2070650327,"We have investigated the cell death of a Chinese hamster ovary mutant (MT-58) with a thermo-sensitive CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (Esko, J. D., Wermuth, M. M., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7388-7393). After MT-58 cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature of 40° C, the cytidylyltransferase was inactivated immediately leading to a decrease in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and cell death. DNA content and number of cells in the S phase decreased significantly in the dying MT-58 cells according to flow cytometrical analyses. The fragmentation of genomic DNA was detected by DNA ladders in agarose gel and release of the prelabeled genomic DNA into cytosolic fractions 14 h after the temperature shift. The dying cells underwent a dramatic reduction of cellular volume while maintaining the membrane containment of cellular contents. These events indicated that the inactivation of cytidylyltransferase triggered apoptosis in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This is the first report that apoptosis was induced in cultured cells, not by an added agent, but by a mutation in phospholipid biosynthesis.

A healthy life requires an intricate balance between cell growth and death. As a part of this cellular balance and a built-in cellular mechanism, apoptosis is controlled precisely by the genetic instructions of its own cell (1Korsmeyer S.J.

Apoptosis has been implicated in many important biological events, such as development, immune defense, differentiation, and growth control (6King K.L. Cidlowski J.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 175-180Google Scholar, 7Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 160-174Google Scholar). Abnormal apoptosis has been linked to many human diseases, including cancer (8Lieberman D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210Google Scholar), AIDS (9Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Google Scholar), Ataxia Telangiectasia (10Meyn M.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5991-6001Google Scholar), Alzheimer's disease (11LaFerla F.M. Tinkle B.T. Bieberich C.J. Haudenschild C.C. Jay G. Nature Genetics. 1995; 9: 21-30Google Scholar), and diabetes (12Baumgartner-Parzer S.M. Wagner L. Pettermann M. Grillari J. Gessl A. Waldhausl W. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1323-1327Google Scholar). Defective apoptosis could cause uncontrolled cell growth and hyperactive apoptosis may lead to premature cell death. In multicell organisms, these internal death mechanisms are also influenced by many extracellular signals and external stimuli. Apoptosis is a two-stage process: condemnation and execution (13Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 217-220Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells share many common characteristics of execution: cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, exposure of phosphatidylserine on cell surface, activation of proteases, activation of endonucleases, and fragmentation of genomic DNA. In the condemnation stage, the events appear more subtle and specific. It is believed that the death signal is recognized by the targeted cell and transmitted along an intrinsic pathway that can only be activated specifically for this event. At the end of this pathway lies the death apparatus that carries out execution upon the arrival of the death signal. It is still not clear how the death message is transduced in mammalian cells.

In addition to its structural role in membranes, PC is the precursor of several second messenger molecules (e.g. diglyceride, phosphatidic acid) in signal transduction pathways (14Tronchère H. Record M. Tercé F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Google Scholar). Most PC is synthesized via the CDP-choline pathway (15Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Google Scholar). MT-58 is a thermo-sensitive mutant of CHO cells generated by chemical mutagenesis (16Esko J.D. Raetz C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5192-5196Google Scholar, 17Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-7393Google Scholar). Lipids analyses revealed that the level of PC was severely reduced at the restrictive temperature. This lipid reduction was accompanied by a significant accumulation of choline phosphate, a substrate for CT. At 40°C, CT activity and incorporation of choline into PC were completely abolished, leading to cell death. The addition of saturated PCs and lysoPCs rescued MT-58 from cell death, suggesting that the lack of the end product of the CDP-choline pathway was responsible for the lethal phenotype (18Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Google Scholar). The death of MT-58 revealed a direct link between PC biosynthesis and cell death. This link appears to be a novel mechanism by which PC, the unique phospholipid, controls cell growth and survival. phosphatidylcholine cytidylyltransferase mutant 58 cells wild type K1 cells; MT-CT mutant cells transfected with the cDNA for CT propidium iodide phosphatidylethanolamine Chinese hamster ovary. In the present studies, we found that the death of MT-58 mutant at the restrictive temperature bore many characteristic events of apoptosis. Inactivation of CT and subsequent decrease of PC apparently activated a specific pathway of programmed cell death in CHO cells. Apoptosis of MT-58 was unique since the cell death was induced not by any added agent, rather by a mutation in PC synthesis. [methyl-3H]Choline chloride (15 Ci/mmol) and [methyl-3H]thymidine (41 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham International. Phospho[methyl-3H]choline was synthesized enzymatically from[methyl-3H]choline and ATP with choline kinase (19Vance D.E. Pelech S.D. Choy P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 576-581Google Scholar). Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture, fetal bovine serum, insulin, calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline, penicillin, streptomycin, trypsin/EDTA solution, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Silica Gel G60 thin-layer chromatography plates were purchased from Merck (Darmstad, Germany). CHO WT-K1, MT-58, and CT-transfected MT-58 (MT-CT) were described previously (20Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16227-16282Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 5% CO2 and Ham's F-12 medium with bovine pancreatic insulin (20 µg/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum. For the growth curve, live cells were counted by the Trypan blue exclusion method. Cells were prelabeled at 33°C for 24 h with [3H]thymidine (0.5 µCi/dish), washed, resuspended in fresh medium, and then shifted to 40°C. At each time point, media were collected. The cells were lysed in 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4°C. The lysed cells were scraped and separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by 50-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4°C. The radioactivities in the medium (M), supernatant (S), and pellet (P) were measured by scintillation counter. The release of DNA was quantitated by the percentage of radioactivity in the soluble fraction ((M + S)/(M + S + P)). The fragmented DNA was preferentially isolated from the apoptotic cells (21Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Google Scholar). The isolated DNA from approximately 5 × 104 cells of each sample was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. λ DNA digested by HindIII was the size standard. In the single label system, cell cycle parameters were determined by the propidium iodide (PI) labeling of nuclear DNA. The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 70% cold ethanol. The membranes were disrupted and the nuclear DNA was labeled with PI (22Vindeløv L. Christensen I.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1990; 33: 127-137Google Scholar). The labeled cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer (Coulter ELITE). In the double label system, the nonpermeant PI (10 µg/ml) was added directly to the culture medium and incubated for 15 min. The cells were then trypsinized and fixed in 70% cold ethanol. The permeant Hoechst 33342 (5 µg/ml) was then incubated with the cells to label total cellular DNA. The labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at 630 nm for PI and 450 nm for Hoechst. The cells, grown on coverslips, were prefixed in 2.5% glutaraldheyde in Millonig's buffer, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 1 h, postfixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 1 h, and dehydrated through an ascending series of ethanol concentrations up to 100%. They were critical point-dried, mounted, and sputter-coated with gold. Micrographs were taken with a Hitachi Electron Microscope S-2500. Phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated by the measurement of their phosphorus content (23Bottcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Google Scholar). To determine the rate of PC synthesis, cells were incubated with 1 µCi/ml [3H]choline in regular medium for 2 h and total lipids were extracted. After separation by thin-layer chromatography, radioactivities in PC spots were measured by liquid scintillation counter. Assays for CT (19Vance D.E. Pelech S.D. Choy P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 576-581Google Scholar) and protein (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) were described previously. To correlate the events of cell death and defective CT, we analyzed the time courses of DNA fragmentation, PC synthesis, and cell growth of three cell lines. K1 is the original wild type cell line from which MT-58 was generated. MT-58-CT is a cell line of the mutant with the stable expression of the functional recombinant CT of rat liver, driven by the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter (20Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16227-16282Google Scholar). At 33°C, a 70% drop of CT activity (Fig. 1A) and a 20% decrease of [3H]choline incorporation into PC (Fig. 1B) had already occurred in MT-58 cells. When MT-58 was shifted to 40°C, the CT activity was inactivated immediately (Fig. 1A) and the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC was shut-down almost completely (Fig. 1B). The concentration of PC was reduced gradually to 60% of wild type level after 24 h at 40°C (data not shown) when cells began to die. Cell count by the Trypan blue exclusion showed growth arrest of MT-58 after 24 h (Fig. 1C) and cell death after 48 h. The expressed wild-type CT was able to recover the synthesis of PC from choline, restore the level of PC and rescue the mutant from cell death (Fig. 1, A-C). Prelabeled with [3H]thymidine at 33°C and then shifted to 40°C, the cells were analyzed for the generation of soluble [3H]DNA. Not found in the wild type cells, DNA release in MT-58 cells began 14 h after the temperature shift to 40°C and peaked at 48 h (Fig. 1D), indicating that about 80% of MT-58 cells underwent apoptosis. The expressed CT in MT-58 prevented the release of DNA fragments, suggesting that defective CT was responsible for the subsequent DNA fragmentation. Since the release of prelabeled DNA could not distinguish DNA fragmentation from random DNA degradation often observed in necrotic or lysed cells, the DNA fragments were also analyzed by an agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA ladder typical of apoptosis occurred in 18 h and peaked about 42 h (Fig. 2). The appearance of the DNA ladder was consistent with the detection of the DNA release.Fig. 2MT-58 cells display genomic DNA fragmentation at the restrictive temperature. WT or MT-58 cells were incubated for 24 h at 33°C, then shifted to 40°C. At each time point, fragmented DNA was analyzed on agarose gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Numbers on the top of the picture indicate the time of incubation at 40°C. HindIII-digested λ DNA was used as size marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) DNA content and cells in each phase of the cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry. In the single label experiments, cell cycle parameters were determined by labeling nuclear DNA with PI (Fig. 3). WT cells at 40°C displayed a typical repartition of growing cells between the different phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3, left column). Of total cells, 40% was in the G1 phase, 20% in the G2/M phase, and 40% in the S phase. In contrast, MT-58 cells with DNA content lower than 2n appeared after 25 h at 40°C and peaked at 72 h (Fig. 3, middle column). Meanwhile the mutant cells in the S phase decreased from 45 to 20% in 24 h (not shown). The recombinant CT rescued MT-58 from these changes efficiently (Fig. 3, right column). The low content of DNA in apoptotic MT-58 was consistent with the fragmentation of DNA detected by the DNA release and DNA ladder. Since necrotic or lysed cells also display lower DNA content in the single label assays, we performed double label experiments to distinguish disrupted cells from apoptotic cells. Unable to penetrate intact membranes, PI only labels the DNA of cells with permeabilized plasma membrane. As a membrane-penetrating fluorescent dye, on the other hand, Hoechst 33342 binds to the DNA of the cells that are undergoing cell cycle. In double labeling with PI and Hoechst 33342, WT and MT-58 cells were incubated with the dyes before and after the temperature shift. In contrast to WT cells at both temperatures and MT-58 at 33°C (Fig. 4a-c), MT-58 cells at 40°C exhibited low content of Hoechst dye (Fig. 4d) indicating the loss of DNA. However, the low level of PI suggests that the cellular membrane remained intact during cell death of MT-58. Necrotic or lysed cells should have displayed a high PI fluorescence. The patterns of MT-58-CT at both 33°C and 40°C were similar to that of WT cells (not shown). Moreover, a significant decrease of S phase MT-58 cells at 40°C was also detected (Fig. 4d). Blockage of apoptotic MT-58 cells at G1 phase is consistent with that choline-deficient medium arrested fibroblasts in G1 phase (25Tercé F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Google Scholar). CT activity is also important at the G1/S transition in a macrophage cell line (26Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Google Scholar). It appears that G1 is an active phase participating in the initiation of apoptosis (7Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 160-174Google Scholar). Thus, PC is likely an important component of a normal progression in the G1 phase of cell cycle. The intact cellular membrane ensures a containment of apoptotic cell debris. Condensation of cellular volume facilitates the process in which the dead cells and apoptotic bodies are engulfed by adjacent cells (27Majno G. Joris I. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-15Google Scholar). The morphological changes of MT-58 cells were observed by scanning electron microscopy. At 40°C, the condensation of MT-58 cells became visible at 36 h (Fig. 5B) and prominent at 72 h (Fig. 5E). The apoptotic contraction of MT-58 cells left the visible trails marking the edges of cells before shrinkage (Fig. 5, C and D). Once the condensation was complete, cells became much smaller and round with intact membrane (Fig. 5E). The morphological changes of dying MT-58 cells were also typical of apoptosis. This study is the first demonstration that apoptosis is induced by a mutation in phospholipid biosynthesis. The events associated with the cell death of MT-58 mutant at the restrictive temperature are characteristic of apoptosis. Inactivation of CT and subsequent decrease of PC apparently activated a specific pathway of programmed cell death in CHO cells. Rescue of the mutant by wild type CT (20Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16227-16282Google Scholar), exogenous PC or lysoPC (18Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Google Scholar) indicated that life and death of CHO cells could be regulated directly by PC via at least one apoptotic pathway. The rescue of cell death by exogenous lipid is also selective for the PC molecular species with saturated acyl chains while polyunsaturated PCs are ineffective (18Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Google Scholar). In contrast, PC generated up to the wild type level by the expressed phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-2 in MT-58 could not rescue the mutant (20Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16227-16282Google Scholar), suggesting that the initial component of the apoptotic pathway in MT-58 may recognize specific PC molecules according to their localization or composition. Moreover, membrane integrity was maintained throughout apoptosis of MT-58 despite the severe decrease in PC and reduction of cellular volume. These results also indicate that the functional involvement of PC in cells may be more prominent than its structural role in providing lipid mass for membranes. The function of PC on the regulation of cell viability may have been achieved via its direct interaction with the mitogenic and apoptotic pathways. It is still not clear how mitogenic pathways recognize PC and how apoptotic pathways detect the depletion of PC. Molecular and biochemical analyses of the apoptotic components will allow us to address these questions in the future. It is also intriguing that a defect in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis resulting in the slight depletion of PE in Drosophila does not induce the death of the mutant animal (28Pavlidis P. Ramaswami M. Tanouye M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 23-33Google Scholar). However, it is not known if defective synthesis of PE causes death in a few of selected cells. More direct comparisons between the genetic defects of PE and PC biosyntheses in cultured cells and in animals may reveal some unique functions of each phospholipid. Without the addition of a foreign agent, MT-58 provides a clearly defined system to study apoptosis. Although some inhibitors of the CDP-choline pathway were found to induce DNA fragmentation (29Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 133-140Google Scholar, 30Boggs K.P. Rocks C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11612-11618Google Scholar), these compounds lack specificity. For instance, diether phosphatidylcholine, a PC analog, also inhibits phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and protein kinase C (31Powis G. Seewald M.J. Gratas C. Melder D. Riebow J. Modest E.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2835-2840Google Scholar, 32Oishi K. Zheng B. White J.F. Vogler W.R. Kuo J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 1000-1006Google Scholar). Therefore, apoptosis induced by these agents might compromise the specificity of the apoptotic pathways under investigation. MT-58 also suggests that apoptosis is a defense mechanism against mutations in animals. DNA damage happens in cells frequently because of the close association of animals with the mutagens in food, drinking water, air, and sunlight. The initial DNA damage can be corrected by the intrinsic repair mechanism. However, if the initial damage in an essential gene escapes repair, apoptosis, similar to that in MT-58, will be activated to eliminate the defective cells and to ensure the overall health of animals. Apoptosis in MT-58 is an event secondary to the defect in PC biosynthesis. In other words, programmed cell death can be triggered by defects outside the apoptotic pathway. Early studies of random mutagenesis (33Busch D. Greiner C. Lewis K. Ford K. Adair G. Thompson L. Mutagenesis. 1989; 4: 349-354Google Scholar) estimated that about 50% of genes in each genome are “essential.” Inactivation of these essential genes leads to cell death. We predict that most, if not all of these cell deaths, like MT-58, could be apoptotic. Apoptotic death may be a widely employed response of cells to mutations. Therefore, in the diseases of abnormal apoptosis, the initial defect may not necessarily occur in the apoptotic pathway but may provoke a defensive response of apoptosis.

To investigate the molecular basis of this action, we have used the recently developed MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 98059 to examine the involvement of the ERK pathway in the regulation of global protein synthesis by growth factors in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). Incubation with PD 98059 blocked angiotensin II (AII)-dependent phosphorylation and enzymatic activity of both MEK1 and MEK2 isoforms, leading to inhibition of the phosphorylation and activation of p44mapk and p42mapk. The compound was found to selectively inhibit activation of the ERK pathway by AII, but not the stimulation of p70 S6 kinase, phospholipase C, or tyrosine phosphorylation. Most importantly, treatment of aortic SMC with PD 98059 potently inhibited AII-stimulated protein synthesis with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.3 µM. The effect of PD 98059 was not restricted to AII, since the compound also blocked to various extent the induction of protein synthesis by growth factors acting through tyrosine kinase receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, or protein kinase C. These results provide strong evidence that activation of ERK isoforms is an obligatory step for growth factor-induced protein synthesis in aortic SMC.

These results provide strong evidence that activation of ERK isoforms is an obligatory step for growth factor-induced protein synthesis in aortic SMC. One of the early obligatory responses elicited by mitogenic and hypertrophic factors is the stimulation of protein synthesis which results from changes at both the transcriptional and translational levels (1Pardee A.B.

While the mechanisms of ERKs regulation are relatively well understood, the precise physiological roles of these enzymes remain to be established. The p44mapk and p42mapk isoforms are rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to virtually all growth factors (14Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J.

However, the observation that a MAP kinase is activated in a specific process does not demonstrate that this enzyme is functionally essential in vivo. Strong evidence for the critical involvement of ERKs in the regulation of cell proliferation were obtained from studies showing a close correlation between ERKs activation and DNA synthesis (28Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kahan C. Seuwen K. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. J. Biol.

The role of the ERK pathway in the regulation of protein synthesis and in many other growth-related processes remains to be clarified. The peptide hormone AII provides a good model system to study the signaling pathways by which growth factors regulate the rate of protein synthesis. In vascular SMC, AII induces cellular hypertrophy as a result of increased protein synthesis, but has no effect on cell division (35Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the involvement of the ERK pathway in the stimulatory effect of growth factors on protein synthesis in vascular SMC. To this end, we used a selective inhibitor of this pathway, PD 98059, which has been shown to inhibit MEK activity in PC-12 (34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) and Swiss 3T3 cells (43Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Most importantly, we demonstrate that the drug inhibitor prevents the increased rate of protein synthesis by AII and other growth factors acting through distinct types of receptors. These results provide the first direct evidence that the ERK pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of global protein synthesis in mammalian cells. AII was purchased from Hukabel Scientific. [3H]IP3, [γ-32P]ATP, [32P]phosphoric acid, and [3H]leucine were from Amersham Corp. Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protease inhibitors and bovine MBP were from Sigma.

Rapamycin was a gift of Wyeth-Ayerst Research. The p70S6K antiserum was generously provided by Dr. Frederick Hall (Children's Hospital of Los Angeles). Antiserum SM1 has been described previously and specifically immunoprecipitates p44mapk protein (44Meloche S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

The anti-MAPKK serum was provided by Drs. Gilles L'Allemain and Jacques Pouysségur (Université de Nice). This polyclonal antibody specifically immunoprecipitates the MEK1 isoform of MAP kinase kinases. The anti-MEK2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories and specifically immunoprecipitates the MEK2 isoform. Anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs 4G10 and PY-20 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and ICN, respectively. Rat aortic SMC were cultured and synchronized in the quiescent state as described previously (38Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For experiments with PD 98059 and rapamycin, the cells were treated with vehicle alone or with the indicated concentrations of agents for 30 min before addition of growth factors. Quiescent aortic SMC were stimulated with 100 nM AII for 5 (ERK assays), 3 (MEK assays), or 15 min (p70S6K assays). The enzymatic activity of ERK isoforms was measured by a specific immune complex kinase assay using MBP as substrate as described (38Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol.

The phosphotransferase activity of p70S6K was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using the S6 peptide RRRLSSLRA (Upstate Biotechnology) as substrate (38Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol.

The enzymatic activity of MEK1 and MEK2 was assayed by measuring their ability to increase the MBP kinase activity of recombinant p44mapkin vitro. Details of the procedure will be described elsewhere. 2E. Giasson, K. Gopalbhai, and S. Meloche, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared as described (38Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and 100 µg (MEK1 assays) or 600 µg (MEK2 assays) of lysate proteins were incubated for 4 h at 4°C with 1 µl of anti-MAPKK serum or 4 µl of anti-MEK2 mAb preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, once with kinase assay buffer (20 mM Hepes, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4), and then resuspended in kinase assay buffer containing 50 µM ATP, 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 300 ng of recombinant p44mapk. After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, bovine MBP (0.25 mg/ml) was added and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels and the band corresponding to MBP was excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Quiescent rat aortic SMC in 100-mm Petri dishes were metabolically labeled for 5 h at 37°C in bicarbonate and phosphate-free Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.75 mCi/ml [32P]phosphoric acid. The cells were then stimulated by addition of 100 nM AII to the medium for 5 min and quickly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. The lysates were then precleared for 1 h with 10 µl of normal rabbit serum and incubated for 4 h at 4°C with either 10 µl of SM1 antiserum, 3 µl of αIIcp42 antiserum, 4 µl of MAPKK antiserum, or 10 µl of anti-MEK2 mAb preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed six times with lysis buffer. Protein complexes were eluted by heating at 95°C for 5 min in denaturating sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels. The intracellular mass of IP3 was measured by a specific radioreceptor assay (46Servant M. Guillemette G. Morisset J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Quiescent aortic SMC in 35-mm Petri dishes were stimulated with AII for 15 s at 37°C. The incubation was terminated by addition of 100 µl of cold 40% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 10%). After extraction for 10–20 min on ice, the cells were scraped and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was extracted five times with 2 ml of water-saturated diethyl ether and neutralized with 30 µl of 1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5). An aliquot of 100 µl of cell extract was then assayed for IP3 mass. For IP3 binding assays, 750 µg of adrenocortical membranes (46Servant M. Guillemette G. Morisset J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were incubated with 1 nM [3H]IP3 and an aliquot of cell extract or varying concentrations of unlabeled IP3 for 30 min at 4°C in a total volume of 500 µl of IP3 binding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Bound [3H]IP3 was separated from free ligand by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the radioactivity in the pellet was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Averages of duplicate determinations of bound [3H]IP3 were used for data analysis. The mass of IP3 is expressed as picomoles of IP3 produced per mg of protein. Quiescent aortic SMC in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed once and stimulated with 100 nM AII at 37°C for 5 min. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.8 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10−4M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10−6M leupeptin, 10−6M pepstatin A, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 4°C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min and equal amounts of lysate proteins (100 µg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 20 µl of agarose-coupled PY-20 mAb for 2 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer prior to electrophoresis on 7.5% acrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 37°C prior to incubation for 1 h at 25°C with mAb 4G10 (1:5,000) in blocking solution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Quiescent aortic SMC in triplicate wells of 24-well plates were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of growth factors in serum-free quiescence medium containing 0.5 µCi/ml [3H]leucine. After 24 h of stimulation, the medium was aspirated and the cells were incubated for a minimum of 30 min in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The wells were then washed once with trichloroacetic acid and three times with tap water. The radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was measured by liquid scintillation counting after solubilization in 0.1 M NaOH. For experiments with drug inhibitors, quiescent cells were pretreated for 30 min with the indicated concentrations of agents and stimulated for 24 h in the continuous presence of the inhibitor. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Dose-response curves were analyzed according to a four-parameter logistic equation using the ALLFIT computer program (47De Léan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PD 98059 is a synthetic drug inhibitor that selectively blocks the activity of the ERK pathway at the level of MEK (34Pang L. Sawada T.

To explore the role of the ERK pathway in the hypertrophic action of AII, we first examined the effect of PD 98059 on AII-dependent phosphorylation and activation of MEK and ERK isoforms in rat aortic SMC. Growth-arrested cells were labeled with 32Pi, stimulated with AII for 5 min, and MEK1, MEK2, p44mapk, and p42mapk were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prior to analysis by gel electrophoresis. Little phosphorylation of MEK1 and MEK2 was detected in resting cells and treatment with AII significantly increased the phosphate content of the two proteins (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of the cells with PD 98059 completely suppressed the phosphorylation of MEK1 and MEK2, thereby suggesting that the inhibitor interferes with the upstream activation of these enzymes. In parallel to these experiments, extracts from similarly-treated cells were used to test the enzymatic activity of MEKs in a reconstitution assay using recombinant p44mapk and MBP as substrate. Addition of AII to quiescent SMC caused a 9-fold increase in both MEK1 and MEK2 activity, which was inhibited approximately 80% by preincubation of the cells with 30 µM PD 98059 (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that the compound exerts inhibitory effects on both isoforms of MEK in intact cells. As previously reported (38Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 41Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ.

Commun. 1992; 188: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), AII strongly stimulated the phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of p44mapk and p42mapk isoforms in quiescent aortic SMC. Pretreatment of cells with PD 98059 prevented the phosphorylation of the two enzymes and, as a consequence, blocked their activation by the growth factor (Fig. 2). Thus, these results confirm that PD 98059 is a valuable tool to inhibit the cellular activity of the ERK pathway in rat aortic SMC.Fig. 2PD 98059 inhibits AII-induced phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of ERK isoforms in rat aortic SMC. A, phosphorylation of ERK isoforms. The phosphorylation of ERK isoforms was analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1A using antibodies specific to each ERK isoform (see “Experimental Procedures”). B, enzymatic activity of ERK isoforms. Quiescent rat aortic SMC were treated with vehicle alone or with 30 µM PD 98059 for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated or not with 100 nM AII for 5 min. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation as above using specific antibodies to ERK isoforms. The immune complexes were washed and phosphotransferase activity was assayed using MBP as substrate.

AII binding to the AT1 receptor rapidly stimulates the activity of phospholipase C in vascular SMC, leading to the formation of IP3 (39Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 582-592PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment of quiescent aortic SMC with 30 µM PD 98059 did not prevent the rapid increase in the production of IP3 induced by AII. We have previously demonstrated that AII potently stimulates the phosphotransferase activity of p70S6K in aortic SMC (38Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine if PD 98059 interferes with p70S6K activation, cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor prior to AII stimulation and the activity of p70S6K was measured by immune complex kinase assay. Fig. 3B shows that treatment with 30 µM PD 98059 had no effect on AII-dependent activation of p70S6K in aortic SMC. Stimulation of vascular SMC with AII also leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including two major bands of apparent molecular mass 65–75 and 120 kDa (49Leduc I. Haddad P. Giasson E. Meloche S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 582-592PubMed Google Scholar, 50Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Shii K. Koide M. Ishida Y. Yokoyama M.

The 65–75-kDa band has been recently identified as the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin, whereas the 120-kDa band may correspond to p125 focal adhesion kinase (52Leduc I. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4401-4404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 53Turner C.E. Pietras K.M. Taylor D.S. Molloy C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 333-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further test the selectivity of PD 98059, rat aortic SMC were treated with or without PD 98059, followed by exposure to AII for 5 min. Cells lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with agarose-linked PY-20 antiphosphotyrosine mAb, prior to analysis by immunoblotting with 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine mAb. Fig. 3C shows that PD 98059 did not affect AII-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the Mr 65,000-75,000 and 120,000 protein bands. Together, these results indicate that PD 98059 selectively inhibits the activation of ERK isoforms in intact SMC. We next examined the effect of PD 98059 on growth factor-stimulated protein synthesis. For these experiments, quiescent rat aortic SMC were preincubated for 30 min with PD 98059 prior to stimulation with growth factors for 24 h in the continuous presence of the drug. PD 98059 was found to potently inhibit AII-induced protein synthesis in these cells, with 70% inhibition observed at a concentration of 30 µM (Fig. 4A). Half-maximal inhibition was observed in the presence of 4.3 ± 1.6 µM PD 98059 (n = 2), which is similar to the concentration required for 50% inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells (43Dudley D."

The growth arrest was partially prevented by addition of high concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the cells, indicating that MVA depletion may inhibit cell growth through decreasing the number of IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) at the cell surface. Such a decrease in receptor number might be a result of a lowered translocation of de novo synthesized receptors to the cell membrane which in turn might be a result of a decreased N-linked glycosylation of the receptor proteins. We could also demonstrate that IGF-1R became underglycosylated and that the amount of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell membrane was drastically decreased upon MVA depletion. Analysis of receptor proteins cross-linked with IGF-1, as well as binding assays and immunocytostaining confirmed that the number of functional membrane-bound IGF-1R was substantially reduced. The N-linked glycosylation and the expression of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell surface as well as the number of IGF-1 binding sites were completely restored upon replenishment of MVA. These effects of MVA were efficiently abrogated by the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. The translocation of IGF-1R to the cell membrane was shown to take place just prior to initiation of DNA synthesis in arrested cells stimulated with MVA. Additionally, there was a clear correlation between IGF-1 binding and initiation of DNA synthesis with regard to the MVA dose requirement.

The formation of MVA from HMG-CoA, which is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, is the principal regulatory step in the pathway (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that the MVA-derived product critical for cell growth is an isoprene of nonsterol type (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Siperstein M.D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Nature. 1994; 366: 14-15Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar).A possible mechanism for MVA-regulated cell growth is the involvement of dolichyl-phosphate in N-linked glycosylation. De novo synthesized dolichyl-phosphate acts as a carrier of oligosaccharides in the assembly of glycoproteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1981: 35Google Scholar, 6Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In a recent study we investigated the potential regulatory role of N-linked glycosylation in initiation of DNA synthesis in human fibroblasts stimulated by serum (7Carlberg M. Hjertman M. Wejde J. Larsson O. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that N-linked glycosylation of proteins of 90-240 kDa in the prereplicative phase may be critical for induction of DNA replication. These high molecular mass glycoproteins may include growth factor receptors. This raises the possibility that MVA may regulate the expression of growth factor receptors through limiting the biosynthesis of dolichyl-phosphate. The existence of such a mechanism would constitute a substantial link between HMG-CoA reductase and cell growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate this issue in detail. Our experiments provide evidence that MVA is critical for the translocation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) to the cell surface.DISCUSSIONOur present study on SK-MEL-2 cells demonstrates that regulation of IGF-1R expression at the cell surface constitutes a MVA-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase rapidly decreased the number of IGF-1R molecules at the cell membrane which occurred simultaneously with a decline in the rate of cell proliferation. Furthermore, initiation of DNA synthesis was preceded by a drastic increase in the expression of IGF-1R when arrested cells were stimulated with MVA. The importance of the IGF-1R for cell cycle progression of SK-MEL-2 cells was confirmed by blocking the IGF-1R binding sites with an antibody against the binding domain of IGF-1R.We provide evidence that MVA through regulating the rate of N-linked glycosylation is limiting for the translocation of IGF-1R from the intracellular compartment (ER and Golgi) to the cell surface. The mechanism by which MVA is limiting for N-linked glycosylation is that intermediates in the metabolism of MVA serve as precursors in the biosynthesis of dolichyl-phosphate. It was also confirmed in our experiments that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase resulted in a rapid and substantial suppression of dolichyl-phosphate synthesis. Only newly synthesized dolichyl-phosphate has in fact been shown to be involved in N-linked glycosylation (37Rip J.W. Rupar C.A. Ravi K. Carroll K.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Kabakoff B.D. Doyle J.W. Kandutsch A.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).N-Linked glycosylation has been shown to be carried out on all proteins that are to be transported to the cell membrane (5Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1981: 35Google Scholar, 39Olden K. Parent J.B. White S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 650: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The core structure of the oligosaccharide complex is commonly composed of two N-acetyl-GlcN molecules, nine mannose and three glucose residues. Dolichyl-phosphate acts as a membrane-bound carrier of this complex inside the ER and makes it available to an oligosaccharyl transferase, which couples it to asparagine residues of de novo synthesized proteins. Only sites containing Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequences (X is any amino acid with the exception of proline) are recognized by the transferase (6Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 40Lennarz W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7205-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since N-linked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally (6Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 33Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 32-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 34Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) only newly synthesized proteins are modified in this manner. In the present study we demonstrate that N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1R was efficiently blocked upon inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, and also that the amount of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell surface was drastically decreased. In fact the expression of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell membrane correlated well with the MVA-dependent changes in IGF-1 binding. This strongly suggests that the MVA-controlled translocation of newly synthesized and glycosylated receptors plays a pivotal role in the expression of functional IGF-1 binding sites.In glycoproteins the carbohydrate moieties attached to the asparagine residues serve several and different specific purposes. For instance, N-linked glycosylation may prevent intracellular protein aggregation in the ER and may in addition be required for correct folding and cleavage of the precursor proteins. The N-linked oligosaccharides may also be needed for the direction of proteins through different compartments of the Golgi network in which they are further processed before the subsequent translocation to the cell surface (39Olden K. Parent J.B. White S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 650: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Deficiency in N-linked glycosylation at certain glycosylation sites may therefore result in incorrect protein folding, suppressed efficiency and decreased rate of intracellular glycoprotein transport, or impaired protein function. Experiments with glycosylation site mutations of transfected cDNA of the insulin receptor suggest that the first four glycosylation sites of the α subunit have to be glycosylated for the subsequent intracellular transport of de novo synthesized receptor proteins (26Collier E. Carpentier J.-L. Beitz L. Caro H.P. Taylor S.P. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When these four glycosylation sites, due to mutations, were not glycosylated, the proteins were retained in the ER (26Collier E. Carpentier J.-L. Beitz L. Caro H.P. Taylor S.P. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data taken together with the fact that a large homology exists between insulin-R and IGF-1R (11Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) suggest that translocation-specific glycosylation sites also exist in IGF-1R. On the other hand, N-linked glycosylation is not critical for the translocation of all glycoproteins destined for the cell membrane. For example, glycosylation is not required for the export of the apoprotein B of the low density lipoprotein (41Struck D.K. Siuta P.B. Lane M.D. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1980; 201: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As was also shown in our experiments, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase only caused a limited decrease in the total amount of de novo synthesized proteins located at the cell membrane. This indicates that glycoproteins on the whole are only slightly inhibited in their translocation to the cell surface.The link between HMG-CoA reductase and IGF-1R expression raises the possibility that a deregulated control of MVA synthesis may contribute to uncontrolled growth of certain malignant cells. It is known that the level of dolichyl-phosphate and N-linked glycosylation is increased in malignant cells and tissues (45Warren L. Fuhrer J.P. Walborg Jr., E.F. Schultz J. Block R.E. Membrane Transformations in Neoplasia. Academic Press, New York1974: 1Google Scholar). The increase in the dolichyl-phosphate synthesis might, at least partially, be a result of the uncontrolled regulation of HMG-CoA reductase which has been proven to be a unique and characteristic feature of malignant cells (2Siperstein M.D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increased biosynthesis of dolichyl-phosphate may also be due to a changed metabolism of MVA. This has been shown to be the case in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A459 in which 40% of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was devoted to nonsterol products, compared to 15-20% in normal fibroblasts (46Bennis F. Favre G. Le-Gaillard F. Soula G. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An increased N-linked glycosylation, due to an up-regulated dolichyl-phosphate biosynthesis, may contribute to an overexpression of growth factor receptors or other functional molecules at the tumor cell membranes. The IGF-1 signaling pathway has been shown to be of particular functional importance for melanoma cells, the cell surface of which contains abundant IGF-1R molecules (31Resnicoff M. Coppola D. Sell C. Rubin R. Ferrone S. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4848-4850PubMed Google Scholar). If IGF-1R was blocked by antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides, growth and motility (47Stracke M.L. Kohn E.C. Aznavoorian S.A. Wilson L.L. Salomon D. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Schiffman E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4848-4850PubMed Google Scholar) of cultured melanoma cells were inhibited. Our present study also provides evidence that MVA is limiting for expression of IGF-1R in other malignant cell types. Therefore our results may offer a novel pharmacological approach to controlling malignant cell growth. This would be envisaged in particular against the group of malignant tumors in which uncontrolled growth and tumor progression are dependent on an overexpression of functional growth factor receptors at the cell surface.

The formation of MVA from HMG-CoA, which is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, is the principal regulatory step in the pathway (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that the MVA-derived product critical for cell growth is an isoprene of nonsterol type (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J.

Our results suggested that N-linked glycosylation of proteins of 90-240 kDa in the prereplicative phase may be critical for induction of DNA replication. These high molecular mass glycoproteins may include growth factor receptors. This raises the possibility that MVA may regulate the expression of growth factor receptors through limiting the biosynthesis of dolichyl-phosphate. The existence of such a mechanism would constitute a substantial link between HMG-CoA reductase and cell growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate this issue in detail.

A possible mechanism for MVA-regulated cell growth is the involvement of dolichyl-phosphate in N-linked glycosylation.

Our experiments provide evidence that MVA is critical for the translocation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) to the cell surface. DISCUSSIONOur present study on SK-MEL-2 cells demonstrates that regulation of IGF-1R expression at the cell surface constitutes a MVA-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase rapidly decreased the number of IGF-1R molecules at the cell membrane which occurred simultaneously with a decline in the rate of cell proliferation. Furthermore, initiation of DNA synthesis was preceded by a drastic increase in the expression of IGF-1R when arrested cells were stimulated with MVA. The importance of the IGF-1R for cell cycle progression of SK-MEL-2 cells was confirmed by blocking the IGF-1R binding sites with an antibody against the binding domain of IGF-1R.We provide evidence that MVA through regulating the rate of N-linked glycosylation is limiting for the translocation of IGF-1R from the intracellular compartment (ER and Golgi) to the cell surface. The mechanism by which MVA is limiting for N-linked glycosylation is that intermediates in the metabolism of MVA serve as precursors in the biosynthesis of dolichyl-phosphate. It was also confirmed in our experiments that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase resulted in a rapid and substantial suppression of dolichyl-phosphate synthesis. Only newly synthesized dolichyl-phosphate has in fact been shown to be involved in N-linked glycosylation (37Rip J.W. Rupar C.A. Ravi K. Carroll K.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Kabakoff B.D. Doyle J.W. Kandutsch A.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).N-Linked glycosylation has been shown to be carried out on all proteins that are to be transported to the cell membrane (5Struck D.K. Lennarz W.J. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1981: 35Google Scholar, 39Olden K. Parent J.B. White S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 650: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The core structure of the oligosaccharide complex is commonly composed of two N-acetyl-GlcN molecules, nine mannose and three glucose residues. Dolichyl-phosphate acts as a membrane-bound carrier of this complex inside the ER and makes it available to an oligosaccharyl transferase, which couples it to asparagine residues of de novo synthesized proteins. Only sites containing Asn-X-Thr/Ser sequences (X is any amino acid with the exception of proline) are recognized by the transferase (6Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 40Lennarz W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7205-7214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Since N-linked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally (6Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 33Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 32-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 34Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) only newly synthesized proteins are modified in this manner. In the present study we demonstrate that N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1R was efficiently blocked upon inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, and also that the amount of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell surface was drastically decreased. In fact the expression of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell membrane correlated well with the MVA-dependent changes in IGF-1 binding. This strongly suggests that the MVA-controlled translocation of newly synthesized and glycosylated receptors plays a pivotal role in the expression of functional IGF-1 binding sites.In glycoproteins the carbohydrate moieties attached to the asparagine residues serve several and different specific purposes. For instance, N-linked glycosylation may prevent intracellular protein aggregation in the ER and may in addition be required for correct folding and cleavage of the precursor proteins. The N-linked oligosaccharides may also be needed for the direction of proteins through different compartments of the Golgi network in which they are further processed before the subsequent translocation to the cell surface (39Olden K. Parent J.B. White S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 650: 209-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Deficiency in N-linked glycosylation at certain glycosylation sites may therefore result in incorrect protein folding, suppressed efficiency and decreased rate of intracellular glycoprotein transport, or impaired protein function. Experiments with glycosylation site mutations of transfected cDNA of the insulin receptor suggest that the first four glycosylation sites of the α subunit have to be glycosylated for the subsequent intracellular transport of de novo synthesized receptor proteins (26Collier E. Carpentier J.-L. Beitz L. Caro H.P. Taylor S.P. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When these four glycosylation sites, due to mutations, were not glycosylated, the proteins were retained in the ER (26Collier E. Carpentier J.-L. Beitz L. Caro H.P. Taylor S.P. Gorden P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7818-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data taken together with the fact that a large homology exists between insulin-R and IGF-1R (11Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Francke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) suggest that translocation-specific glycosylation sites also exist in IGF-1R. On the other hand, N-linked glycosylation is not critical for the translocation of all glycoproteins destined for the cell membrane. For example, glycosylation is not required for the export of the apoprotein B of the low density lipoprotein (41Struck D.K. Siuta P.B. Lane M.D. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5332-5337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the acetylcholine receptors (42Prives J.M. Christian C. Penman S. Olden K. Giacobini E. Vernadakis A. Shahar A.

Kohn E.C. Aznavoorian S.A. Wilson L.L. Salomon D. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. Schiffman E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4848-4850PubMed Google Scholar) of cultured melanoma cells were inhibited. Our present study also provides evidence that MVA is limiting for expression of IGF-1R in other malignant cell types. Therefore our results may offer a novel pharmacological approach to controlling malignant cell growth. This would be envisaged in particular against the group of malignant tumors in which uncontrolled growth and tumor progression are dependent on an overexpression of functional growth factor receptors at the cell surface."

Although talin has been suggested to act as a linkage protein mediating the attachment of GPIIb-IIIa to actin filaments, direct binding of GPIIb-IIIa to this cytoskeletal protein has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we examined the interaction of GPIIb-IIIa with purified talin using a solid-phase binding assay. Soluble GPIIb-IIIa bound in a time- and dose-dependent manner to microtiter wells coated with talin but not with BSA. Time course studies demonstrated that steady-state binding was achieved after 4–5 h incubation at 37°C. Binding isotherms with varying concentrations of GPIIb-IIIa showed that half-saturation binding was achieved at approximately 15 nM GPIIb-IIIa. At saturation, there was 211 ± 8 fmol of GPIIb-IIIa bound per well containing 117 ± 10 fmol of immobilized talin. Besides binding to immobilized talin, GPIIb-IIIa also bound to talin captured by the anti-talin monoclonal antibody 8d4. Moreover, the interaction of GPIIb-IIIa to 8d4-captured talin was blocked by mAb10B2, a monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide encompassing the entire cytoplasmic sequence of GPIIb. The interaction of talin with the cytoplasmic domain of GPIIb-IIIa was further investigated using peptide-coated wells. Purified talin was found to bind to both synthetic peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic sequences of GPIIb (P2b) and GPIIIa (P3a). As expected, the binding of talin to P2b-coated wells was specifically blocked by mAb10B2. Thus, these results demonstrate direct binding of GPIIb-IIIa to talin and suggest a role of the cytoplasmic sequences of both GPIIb and GPIIIa in mediating this interaction.

The high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (FcεRI) in cultured mast (RBL-2H3) cells has been reported to function differently. Here we show to the contrary that engagement of FcεRI with antigen leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the association of Shc with Grb2 and other proteins (p120 and p140). Like the FcεRI-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, these responses are dependent on the tyrosine kinase Syk; they are enhanced by overexpression of Syk and are blocked by expression of dominant-negative Syk. Sos is constitutively associated with Grb2 in these cells but dissociates from Shc on stimulation with antigen. These reactions are rapid, reversible, and associated with the activation of Ras. Therefore, the Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 may provide a pathway through Sos for activation of Ras by FcεRI.

To identify structural targets recognized by LIM domains, we have utilized random peptide library selection, the yeast two-hybrid system, and glutathione S-transferase fusions. Enigma contains three LIM domains within its carboxyl terminus and LIM3 of Enigma specifically recognizes active but not mutant endocytic codes of the insulin receptor (InsR) (Wu, R. Y., and Gill, G.

Interaction of two random peptide libraries with glutathione S-transferase-LIM3 of Enigma indicated specific binding to Gly-Pro-Hyd-Gly-Pro-Hyd-Tyr-Ala corresponding to the major endocytic code of InsR. Peptide competition demonstrated that both Pro and Tyr residues were required for specific interaction of InsR with Enigma. In contrast to LIM3 of Enigma binding to InsR, LIM2 of Enigma associated specifically with the receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret. Ret was specific for LIM2 of Enigma and did not bind other LIM domains tested. Mutational analysis indicated that the residues responsible for binding to Enigma were localized to the carboxyl-terminal 61 amino acids of Ret. A peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of Ret dissociated Enigma and Ret complexes, while a mutant that changed Asn-Lys-Leu-Tyr in the peptide to Ala-Lys-Leu-Ala or a peptide corresponding to exon16 of InsR failed to disrupt the complexes, indicating the Asn-Lys-Leu-Tyr sequence of Ret is essential to the recognition motif for LIM2 of Enigma.

https://openalex.org/W2044732680,"Clustering of several multisubunit receptors on hematopoetic cells results in a signaling cascade involving the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs, or “ITAMs,” and actin polymerization. Recent experiments indicate that direct clustering of the ITAM-binding protein, p72syk (Syk), is capable of transmitting a phagocytic signal in COS cells (Greenberg, S., Chang, P., Wang, D., Xavier, R., and Seed, B. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 1103-1107). However, the possibility of redundant signaling pathways makes it difficult to test the requirement for Syk in ITAM-dependent actin polymerization in hematopoetic cells. We developed a model system to study ITAM-dependent actin assembly. DT40 lymphocytes were transfected with fusion proteins encoding the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the ITAM-containing γ subunit of Fc receptors. Clustering the γ-containing fusion proteins with IgG-coated erythrocytes triggered submembranous actin assembly. This response depended on an intact ITAM, was absent in cell lines that had been engineered to lack Syk, and was augmented in cell lines that stably overexpressed Syk.

Actin assembly is a nearly ubiquitous response to the engagement of a diverse array of cell surface receptors that signal chemotaxis, phagocytosis, cell division, or cell adhesion. In hematopoetic cells, ligation of members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily is accompanied by actin polymerization and several functionally important actin-dependent events.

Since many biochemical events accompany ligation of these multisubunit receptors, it is important to identify those events among the many that are required for triggering actin assembly. A recent clue was provided by studies demonstrating a requirement for tyrosine kinases in lymphocyte effector functions (5Howe L.R. Weiss A. Trends Biochem.

However, it is not clear whether Syk is required for ITAM-mediated actin assembly in hematopoetic cells. To test a requirement for Syk in cytoskeletal alterations mediated by specific ITAM-containing subunits, such as the γ subunit of Fc receptors, we developed an assay of ITAM-dependent actin assembly using the DT40 lymphocyte cell line. The advantages of this cell line are that it lacks endogenous γ subunits, and it undergoes a high rate of homologous recombination. Thus, by gene targeting and cDNA transfection, it is possible to isolate clones of DT40 cells that lack expression of a given gene product (19Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T.

Plasmid constructs encoding the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the γ subunit were expressed in wild-type lymphocyte cell lines, or in cells lines that were engineered to either lack, or stably overexpress, Syk.

DT40 cells, a transformed chicken lymphocyte cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 µMβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. IgG against sheep erythrocytes was from Diamedix (Miami, FL). Fluorescein anti-rabbit-IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-Syk IgG and protein A-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). RC20H, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated recombinant fragment of mAb PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine, was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). mAb C4 against actin was kindly provided by James Lessard (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH).

Resultant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. DT40 lymphocytes expressing either 16:γ or 16:γY → F were isolated following transfection by electroporation (19Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A.

To generate 16:γ-expressing cell lines that also overexpressed Syk (Syk++/16:γ), one clone of WT/16:γ (clone G1) was co-tranfected with pSyk (19Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T.

Between 3 and 30 individual clones were isolated from each transfection, and individual clones were analyzed for surface expression of the CD16 epitope by flow cytometry and by rosetting with IgG-RBCs. Levels of Syk expression were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-Syk IgG and were normalized to actin content by immunoblotting with mAb C4 against actin. 5 × 106 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 µg/ml mAb 3G8 for 30 min at 4°C and further incubated for varying intervals at 37°C with 40 µg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Following addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2), samples were processed for either immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (20Greenberg S.

For anti-Syk immunoblotting, 2 × 106 cells were lysed as above and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Syk IgG. Blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Syk protein expression was quantitated by densitometry of anti-Syk immunoblots using NIH-Image. For in vitro kinase assays, anti-Syk immunoprecipitates derived from 107 cells were washed and incubated with a kinase buffer containing 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. After incubation at 25°C for 5 min, samples were diluted in a buffer containing 10 mM EDTA to inhibit further kinase activity, washed, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Total cellular F-actin was quantitated as described previously (1Greenberg S. El Khoury J. Di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 2 × 105 lymphocytes were allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37°C in 96-well tissue culture plates and were incubated in the presence or absence of 4 × 106 IgG-RBCs for 10 min at 4°C, washed to remove nonadherent RBCs, and incubated further for varying times at 37°C. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 0.33 µM rhodamine-phalloidin. Rhodamine fluorescence (excitation wavelength: 530 nm, emission wavelength: 590 nm) was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (CytoFluor II; Millipore). To normalize for cell number, nucleii were stained with 5 µM YO-PRO, fluorescence was determined (excitation wavelength: 485 nm, emission wavelength: 530 nm), and F-actin content per unit cell was calculated as the ratio of rhodamine to YO-PRO fluorescence. Previous experiments established that fluorescence of rhodamine at excitation wavelength: 485 nm, emission wavelength: 530 nm was negligible and that the F-actin content of IgG-RBCs was less than 0.5% of the F-actin content of DT40 cells. Measurement of localized cortical F-actin content was modified from the methods of Theriot et al. (22Theriot J.A. Mitchison T. Nature. 1991; 352: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and Segall et al. (23Segall J.E. Tyerech S. Boselli L. Masseling S. Helft J. Chan A. Jones J. Condeelis J. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 6.5 × 105 lymphocytes were incubated on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips for 30 min at 37°C and further incubated with 7.5 × 106 IgG-RBCs for 10 min at 4°C to allow particle binding. Following washing and incubation at 37°C for varying intervals, cells were fixed and stained with fluorescein anti-rabbit IgG (to detect bound particles) and with saturating concentrations of rhodamine-phalloidin (to quantitate F-actin) and examined with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal laser scanning system equipped with a Krypton/Argon laser. 1-µm sections were imaged and stored on optical discs and images were analyzed using NIH-Image software. Integrated densities of rhodamine staining were measured using a 4-µm diameter circle placed on regions of lymphocyte cortex beneath attached IgG-RBCs. Since cortical F-actin staining was not necessarily uniform, staining densities were determined for three separate regions of cortex without associated RBCs in the same cells and served as controls. Data were expressed as the ratios of the integrated density of rhodamine staining in cortical areas beneath attached IgG-RBCs to the average of the integrated densities of rhodamine staining of control regions. At least five fields were examined in each experiment. For a given experiment, 16-26 individual cortical F-actin ratios were determined and averaged. To determine the F-actin density per pixel, weighted densities were calculated as the number of pixels of a given density multiplied by that pixel intensity. Data represents measurements taken from 40-57 cortical regions from five microscopic fields of the indicated cell lines. All cell lines transfected with 16:γ or 16:γY → F expressed the CD16 epitope at the cells' surfaces as determined by flow cytometry. We characterized two individual clones, expressing 16:γ or 16:γY → F, in more detail (Fig. 1). WT/16:γ and WT/16:γY → F, but not the parental cell line, WT, bound IgG-RBCs (not shown). To determine whether 16:γ was capable of triggering enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we incubated transfectants or controls with mAb 3G8 followed by anti-mouse IgG. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins was apparent within 1 min of clustering surface-bound mAb 3G8 in WT/16:γ, but not untransfected controls (WT) or WT/16:γY → F cells (Fig. 2). These data indicate a requirement for tyrosine 76 of the γ subunit in transmitting a signal for enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation and are consistent with findings of others that document a similar requirement for an intact γ subunit ITAM in mediating enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation (24Bonnerot C.

Most, but not all, cortical regions underlying attached particles demonstrated a broad-based accumulation of F-actin that was first apparent by 1 min (not shown), appeared maximal at 4 min (Fig. 3), and was no longer detectable after 10 min of incubation (not shown). Using phase-contrast optics, rudimentary pseudopods could be seen beneath many bound IgG-RBCs (not shown). The focal accumulation of F-actin in response to the IgG-bearing ligand was blocked by the presence of 1 µM cytochalasin D (not shown), indicating a requirement for barbed-end filament growth. To test the requirement for an intact ITAM in mediating the focal appearance of F-actin, we performed parallel experiments using WT/16:γY → F cells. Despite obvious IgG-RBC binding, there were no discernible focal accumulations of F-actin present beneath the attached particles (Fig. 3). Although surface expression of 16:γ was somewhat higher than that of WT/16:γY → F (Fig. 1), there was considerable overlap in the extent of surface expression of the two constructs, while there were essentially no detectable focal accumulations of F-actin in cells expressing WT/16:γY → F. Therefore, differences in surface expression could not account for the lack of focal accumulations of F-actin in cells expressing WT/16:γY → F. These results indicate that an intact ITAM is required for the focal accumulation of F-actin mediated by clustered γ subunits. To test the role of Syk tyrosine kinase in 16:γ-mediated signal transduction, we transfected 16:γ in Syk− lymphocytes (19Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar); in addition, we transfected wild-type Syk in one WT/16:γ clone and isolated clones that stably overexpressed Syk. Surface expression of 16:γ was approximately 50% greater in WT/16:γ and Syk++/16:γ cells as compared with Syk−/16:γ cells (Fig. 4). WT/16:γ, Syk−/16:γ, and Syk++/16:γ cells bound 7.9 ± 0.5, 7.5 ± 0.3, and 7.4 ± 0.3 IgG-RBCs, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 7). These differences were not statistically significant. Quantitation of Syk by immunoblotting confirmed the lack of Syk expression in Syk−/16:γ cells and the overexpression of Syk in Syk++/16:γ cells (Fig. 5A). By densitometry, one such clone contained 27 ± 7.9 times more Syk protein than did WT/16:γ cells (mean ± S.E., n = 4). When compared with WT/16:γ cells, Syk++/16:γ cells displayed a higher basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation and an accentuated accumulation of phosphotyrosyl-containing proteins in response to clustering surface-bound 16:γ. In contrast, Syk−/16:γ displayed lower basal levels of phosphotyrosyl-containing proteins, which did not increase further following clustering of 16:γ (Fig. 5B). A similar trend was noted in either the phosphotyrosyl content of Syk, or Syk tyrosine kinase activity, as assessed by autophosphorylation of Syk derived from resting and mAb 3G8-stimulated cells (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, the levels of basal and stimulated accumulation of phosphotyrosyl-containing proteins correlated with the relative expression of Syk.Fig. 5Syk-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation in response to clustered ITAMs. A, anti-Syk immunoblots of lysates derived from the indicated transfected cell lines.

El Khoury J. Di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we developed an assay for F-actin using rhodamine-phalloidin and YO-PRO, a nuclear stain, and quantitated average F-actin content per cell using a fluorescence plate reader. This assay was linear over a wide range of cell concentrations using the same concentration of rhodamine-phalloidin, indicating that all F-actin binding sites were saturated with phalloidin (Fig. 6A). Incubation of WT/16:γ cells by IgG-RBCs led to a small time-dependent increase in F-actin, which peaked at 4 min (not shown). These changes were more easily observed in Syk++/16:γ cells, which produced a greater magnitude of increase in F-actin upon addition of IgG-RBCs (Fig. 6B). The level of Syk expression influenced the magnitude of accumulation of F-actin in response to the IgG-containing ligand. Absence of Syk did not support significant increases in F-actin, while its overexpression led to an augmented ITAM-induced response (Fig. 6C). Cytochalasin D blocked the ITAM-mediated increase in total cellular F-actin in WT/16:γ (not shown) and in Syk++/16:γ cells (Fig. 6C), indicating a requirement for barbed end actin filament growth. While the level of Syk expression influenced the basal quantity of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (Fig. 4), it did not influence the basal F-actin content of the cells (not shown). However, Syk was required for focal F-actin staining beneath the test particles, while overexpression of Syk led to an augmented focal accumulation of F-actin (Fig. 7), which was blocked by cytochalasin D (not shown).Fig. 7Syk-dependent focal accumulations of F-actin induced by IgG-RBCs in transfected DT40 cells. Adherent lymphocytes of the indicated cell lines were incubated with 107 IgG-RBCs at 4°C for 10 min, washed, and further incubated for 4 min at 37°C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We therefore measured cortical F-actin content in transfectants challenged with IgG-RBCs. We compared the F-actin content in lymphocyte cytoplasm subjacent to attached IgG-RBCs with the F-actin content in other cortical areas of the same cell. Depending on the particular clone examined, cortical F-actin beneath attached IgG-RBCs was enriched 4-8-fold (mean 6.2 ± 0.9) in WT/16:γ cells, 10-14-fold (mean 11.7 ± 1.1) in Syk++/16:γ cells, and 1-1.2-fold (mean 1.1 ± 0.1) in Syk−/16:γ cells (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, the density of F-actin staining per pixel was greatest in Syk++/16:γ cells, followed by WT/16:γ and Syk−/16:γ cells (Fig. 8B), suggesting that maximal Syk expression favors the formation of a dense meshwork of actin filaments upon ITAM clustering. Given the multitude of tyrosine kinases present in eukaryotic cells, and the possibility of redundant signaling pathways, it is important to establish functional roles for individual kinases. Previous studies, including those showing that Syk is capable of triggering (18Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or enhancing (28Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Pan X.Q. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1995; 85: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) phagocytosis in COS cells, provided evidence that this kinase can trigger phagocytosis in a cell that is not normally phagocytic. This study demonstrates that Syk tyrosine kinase is required for ITAM-mediated actin assembly and Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis and that no redundant pathways exist in these hematopoetic cells to effect these responses. We did not address the mechanism of Syk-mediated actin assembly in this study, nor did we address the requirement for other kinases in ITAM-mediated signaling pathways. We suspect, however, that one or more members of the Src family is required for these events, since Lyn-negative DT40 cell lines which were transfected with 16:γ were also incapable of supporting 16:γ-mediated actin assembly (not shown). Furthermore, fusion proteins bearing kinase-deficient Syk constructs do not trigger actin assembly in transfected COS cells (18Greenberg S. Chang P. Wang D. Xavier R. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), indicating that an intact Syk kinase domain is required for mediating actin assembly. It is likely that one or more Syk tyrosine kinase substrates enhance the formation of an as yet unidentified actin-nucleating activity. While γ subunit-expressing macrophages are capable of Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, 16:γ-expressing DT40 cells did not support phagocytosis, as assessed by resistance to hypotonic lysis of cell-associated IgG-RBCs. DT40 cells transfected with human FcγR IIA, another ITAM-containing transmembrane protein, were equally potent in inducing actin assembly, but incapable of mediating phagocytosis (not shown). Why are DT40 lymphocyte transfectants capable of ITAM-directed actin assembly, yet incapable of ITAM-mediated phagocytosis? It could be argued that the levels of surface expression of 16:γ fusion proteins were insufficient to support phagocytosis. We were unable to isolate clones of DT40 cells that expressed higher levels of 16:γ to test this hypothesis directly. We think this explanation is unlikely, however, since macrophages are capable of some degree of particle ingestion, even when surface Fcγ receptor expression is decreased by nearly 90% when the cells are plated on adherent immune complexes (29Michl J. Unkeless J.C. Pieczonka M.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1746-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since mammalian B-lymphocytes express FcγRIIB (30Ravetch J.V. Kinet J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), a receptor that transmits an inhibitory signal to antigen receptors (31Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J.R.

Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), we also considered the possibility that DT40 cells express the avian homolog of FcγRIIB. This receptor might be expected to dampen the phagocytic response by its co-ligation of IgG-RBCs. However, this explanation is unlikely, since untransfected DT40 cells were incapable of binding IgG-RBCs. Furthermore, addition to WT/16:γ cells of E-3G8, erythrocytes that bear F(ab)′2 fragments of mAb 3G8 rather than intact IgG (34Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cannot ligate endogenous Fcγ receptors, also resulted in binding, but not ingestion. Finally, overexpression of Syk in 16:γ-expressing cells led to an augmented local accumulation of F-actin in response to IgG-RBCs, but did not confer to the transfected lymphocytes the ability to mediate particle ingestion (not shown), suggesting that the level of Syk tyrosine expression was not the limiting factor in promoting phagocytosis. Although we did not perform a direct comparison between the quantitative increases in F-actin due to the interaction of IgG-containing ligands with DT40 cells and macrophages, it is interesting to note that regional accumulations in F-actin beneath 16:γ-expressing lymphocytes appeared even more prominent than similar regions in FcγR-expressing macrophages (cf. Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 of the current study with Fig. 2 in 1Greenberg S. El Khoury J. Di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). While actin assembly is clearly required for pseudopod extension, these data suggest that actin assembly alone is insufficient for mediating phagocytosis. Other events, such as recruitment of new membrane components to the growing pseudopod, may be required for productive pseudopod extension. Alternatively, the newly formed submembranous actin network may need to be coupled to mechanotransducing proteins in order to achieve a significant degree of pseudopod extension, as suggested in a review of neuronal growth cone motility (35Sheetz M.P. Wayne D.B. Pearlman A.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Candidates for this activity include the MARCKS family of proteins (36Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and members of the myosin I superfamily (37Wolenski J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent experiments have implicated one or both families of proteins in pseudopod extension (38Allen L.A.H. Aderem A. J. Exp.

Because all components of the transcriptional response pre-exist within cells, cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements for the immediate-early genes define convenient end points for analysis of cellular signal transduction pathways. A potentially useful means of subclassifying the growing set of immediate-early genes, and one with apparent mechanistic implications, is to divide the group into genes with “fast” or “slow” kinetics of induction. A well characterized example of a “fast kinetics” immediate-early gene is c-fos.

By both sequence analysis and functional analysis, the regulatory elements defined initially within c-fos have also been detected within other fast kinetics immediate-early genes, and appear to be required for their induction (28Christy B.

The mechanisms underlying serum and growth factor-stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene, however, do not appear to be conserved among all members of the immediate-early gene set. Members of a second subset of immediate-early genes are induced with slower kinetics than c-fos (31Hall D.J. Jones S.D. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell.

Included in the “slow kinetics” subset of immediate-early genes are the c-myc proto-oncogene and the clinically important chemokine gene JE/MCP-1 (for monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, hereafter referred to as MCP-1) (33Cochran B.H.

In contrast to the rapid but transient response exhibited by c-fos, slow kinetics immediate-early genes like c-myc and MCP-1 display a 60-90-min lag period before initiation of transcription in response to serum or growth factor stimulation (7Kelly K.

However, no fos-like regulatory elements are found within several kilobases of 5′- or 3′-flanking sequences of the MCP-1 gene or within its coding sequences. The distinct induction kinetics of the MCP-1 gene, and other slow immediate-early genes such as c-myc, might therefore reflect the action of cis-acting genomic elements distinct from the trio described for c-fos. An obstacle to analysis of cis-acting regulatory elements for the slow immediate-early genes has been achieving regulated expression of these genes in transient transfections. This problem was solved recently for MCP-1 with the discovery of a 7-base motif, TTTTGTA, located in the proximal 3′ MCP-1 untranslated sequences. This 7-mer is essential for regulated expression of MCP-1 in transient transfections (41Freter R.R. Irminger J.C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The discovery of the 3′ 7-mer enabled detection of a 240-bp DNA enhancer fragment located 2.3 kb upstream of the MCP-1 transcription start site. The 240-bp fragment contains a cis-acting regulatory element(s) for serum, double-stranded RNA, interleukin-1α, and PDGF (41Freter R.R. Irminger J.C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When ligated to a truncated MCP-1 reporter gene, the 240-base fragment mediates a slow and sustained induction of the reporter gene, which parallels the response of the endogenous MCP-1 gene to serum and PDGF. DNase I footprinting of the 240-bp MCP-1 enhancer fragment highlights four discrete sequences protected by nuclear extracts prepared from PDGF-treated murine 3T3 fibroblasts. Two of these sequences were described previously (42Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now focus on a novel PDGF response element which binds NF-κB and a 90-kDa phosphoprotein. Recombinant B:B isoform of PDGF was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Ribonuclease A was from Pharmacia. Proteinase K, ribonuclease T1, calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP), and poly(dI-dC) were from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals. Bovine calf serum was obtained from Hyclone. Human defibrinogenated platelet-poor plasma was prepared as described (43Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4481-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies to Rel, Rel A, Rel B, p50, p52, and JunD, and the peptides these antibodies were raised against, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Synthetic oligonucleotides were generated by Macromolecular Resources. NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. NIH-3T3 cells were used for transient transfections because of their significantly greater transfection efficiency compared with Balb/c-3T3 cells. Twenty hours prior to transfection, cells were plated at a density of 1.8 × 106 per 15-cm tissue culture dish. Calcium-phosphate-mediated DNA transfections were performed as described (10Gilman M.Z. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were exposed to DNA-containing precipitates for 6 h followed by a 2-min 20% glycerin shock. Cells were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% platelet-poor plasma. Because of variable background levels of MCP-1 transcripts in transfected cells made quiescent with 0.5% calf serum, we have found it more reliable to use 5% platelet-poor plasma for making transfected cells quiescent after the glycerin shock. Transfection mixtures included 35 µg of tagged MCP-1 reporter constructs together with 3.5 µg of α-globin reference construct (pSVα-1), a gift from M. Greenberg (Harvard Medical School), per 15-cm tissue culture plate. After 40-44 h in 5% platelet-poor plasma, quiescent cells were exposed to the B:B isoform of PDGF (30 ng/ml) for the times indicated in the figure legends. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method and purified on CsCl gradients (44Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. Macdonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples (30 µg) were analyzed by RNase protection assay as described (45Zinn K. DiMaio D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1983; 34: 865-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). RNase treatment was with 60 µg/ml RNase A and 2 µg/ml RNase T1 for 70 min at 35°C. Nuclease-resistant fragments were separated on 0.8-mm 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels. Synthesis of labeled complementary RNA probes was as described (46Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) using pGEM vectors (Promega). Probes were gel purified before use. The probe for “tagged” MCP-1 expression is a 272-bp HincII MCP-1 cDNA fragment spanning portions of the second and third exons. The fragment is elongated by addition of a 33-bp “tag” into a blunted SauI site and inserted into the SmaI site of pGEM 7 (41Freter R.R. Irminger J.C. Porter J.A. Jones S.D. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5288-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The length of the unprotected probe is 377 bases. As a control for equal transfection efficiencies between groups of cells, 15 µg of total RNA was assayed by RNase protection for the presence of a constitutively active co-transfected α-globin construct. Exposure and quantitation of gels for all experiments was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides containing 5′ overhanging GG (top strand) and CC (bottom strand) ends were used. All sequences shown are of the top strand. Mutations of element IV sequences are boldfaced and underlined: element I, 5′-GGGCCTTTCCCTTGGCTGCTCCCAAG; element II, 5′-CCTTTGTTGAGTCATTTCAGATTCTCC; element III, 5′-AGAACTGCTTGGCTGCAGGCCCAGCATC; element IV, 5′-AGAATGGGAATTTCCACGCTCT; element IV, mut1 5′-AATGGGAATTTCCACGCTCT; element IV, mut2 5′-AGGGGAATTTCCACGCTCT; element IV, mut3 5′-AGAATTTTCCACGCTCT; element IV, mut4 5′-AGAATGGGAAACGCTCT; element IV, mut5 5′-AGAATGGGAATTTCCCTCT; element IV, mut6 5′-AGAATGGGAATTTCCACGCT; element IV, mut7 5′-AGAATGGGAATTTCCACGCT; element IV, mut9 5′-AGAATGGGAATTTACGCTCT; element IV (13Hill C.S.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic S100 extracts from Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts (clone A31) were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Chemically synthesized oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled with 32P-nucleotides by fill-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were gel purified prior to use as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Binding reactions contained 10-15 µg of fibroblast nuclear extracts and 10,000 cpm (0.05-0.15 ng) radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. Shifts were performed in a binding buffer of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 5% (v/v) glycerin, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol and final volume of 20 µl. Following 30-min incubations on ice, DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on 4% native polyacrylamide gels at 150 V at room temperature in 0.25 × TBE buffer. For antibody supershift or competition experiments, antibodies or 100-1000-fold excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added for a 30-min incubation on ice prior to addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. UV cross-linking was performed as described with the following modifications (48Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mobility shift reactions were set up in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes on ice. After a 30-min incubation with radiolabeled probe, UV cross-linking was performed directly on the open tubes. Cross-linked complexes were resolved on 4% native gels. A murine MCP-1 genomic clone (pGMJE-1) with 466 bp of 5′-flanking sequences and 1.9 kb of 3′-flanking sequences was a gift from B. Rollins (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). The MCP-1 construct was originally inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEM-1 (34Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A non-inducible tagged MCP-1 construct (construct T in Figs. 1, 2, and 6) was created by blunt ligation of a 33-bp XhoI-ClaI fragment of the pGEM-7 polylinker to a SauI site in the third exon of pGMJE-1 (1049 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site). An identical 33-bp tag was inserted into the RNase protection probe vector described above.Fig. 2PDGF-inducible and constitutive proteins bind element IV. a, radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, corresponding to element IV, was used in mobility-shift assays with 15 µg of nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent fibroblasts (−) or fibroblasts treated with the B:B isoform of PDGF (30 ng/ml) for 1.75 h (+).

Alberta J.A. Lam K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial experiments examined the contributions of each of the four elements compared to the PDGF induction observed with the intact 240-bp MCP-1 5′ enhancer. The four elements were added back individually to a 5′-truncated non-inducible MCP-1 reporter gene and the resulting constructs tested for PDGF-inducibility in transient transfections. MCP-1 addback constructs containing elements II, III, or IV were all PDGF-inducible in these experiments (Fig. 1). Summing the inductions observed with the single element addback constructs at 1.5 or 3 h of PDGF treatment equaled the induction observed with the 240-bp addback construct at either time (Fig. 1). These latter findings suggest that synergistic interactions between the four elements do not occur to a significant degree in transient transfections. Second, the major elements conferring PDGF-inducibility onto the truncated MCP-1 gene are elements II and IV (Fig. 1). Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to element IV were employed as double-stranded DNA probes in mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts prepared from quiescent and PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts. In these experiments both a strongly PDGF-inducible protein complex, and a more rapidly migrating constitutively present complex, bound labeled element IV (Fig. 2a, upper arrow and lower arrow, respectively). Both element IV binding complexes were also observed in nuclear extracts prepared from PDGF-stimulated fibroblasts concurrently treated with cycloheximide (data not shown). Binding of both complexes was specific as it was competed by unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to element IV but not competed by an unrelated oligonucleotide corresponding to MCP-1 element II (Fig. 2a). An oligonucleotide consisting of two tandem NF-κB binding sequences also competed PDGF-inducible binding to element IV. In contrast, the NF-κB oligonucleotide did not compete the constitutively bound complex (Fig. 2a, lanes 6-8), suggesting that the latter is distinct in nature from the PDGF-inducible complex. These data also demonstrate that binding of the constitutive complex occurs independently of PDGF-inducible binding to element IV. To better delineate the precise sequences required for protein binding to the 22-base element IV, we performed mobility shifts using a series of mutant competitors (i.e. seven, 22-base"

https://openalex.org/W2075843810,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) has been implicated in fatty acid regulation of gene transcription. Lipogenic gene transcription is inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We have used the PUFA-sensitive rat liver S14 gene as a model to examine the role PPARα plays in fatty acid regulation of hepatic lipogenic gene transcription. Both PPARα and the potent peroxisome proliferator, WY14643, inhibit S14CAT activity in transfected primary hepatocytes. WY14643 and PPARα target the S14 T3 regulatory region (TRR, −2.8 to −2.5 kilobases), a region containing 3 T3 response elements (TRE). Transfer of the TRR to the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter conferred negative control to the TKCAT gene following WY14643 and PPARα treatment. Gel shift analysis showed that PPARα, either alone or with RXRα, did not bind the S14TRR. However, PPARα interfered with TRβ/RXRα binding to a TRE (DR+4). Functional studies showed that co-transfected RXRα, but not T3 receptor β1 (TRβ1), abrogated the inhibitory effect of PPARα on S14 gene transcription. These results suggest that WY14643 and PPARα functionally interfere with T3 regulation of S14 gene transcription by inhibiting TRβ1/RXR binding to S14 TREs. Previous studies had established that the cis-regulatory targets of PUFA control were located within the proximal promoter region of the S14 gene, i.e. between −220 and −80 bp. Finding that the cis-regulatory elements for WY14643/PPARα and PUFA are functionally and spatially distinct argues against PPARα as the mediator of PUFA suppression of S14 gene transcription. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) has been implicated in fatty acid regulation of gene transcription. Lipogenic gene transcription is inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). We have used the PUFA-sensitive rat liver S14 gene as a model to examine the role PPARα plays in fatty acid regulation of hepatic lipogenic gene transcription. Both PPARα and the potent peroxisome proliferator, WY14643, inhibit S14CAT activity in transfected primary hepatocytes. WY14643 and PPARα target the S14 T3 regulatory region (TRR, −2.8 to −2.5 kilobases), a region containing 3 T3 response elements (TRE). Transfer of the TRR to the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter conferred negative control to the TKCAT gene following WY14643 and PPARα treatment. Gel shift analysis showed that PPARα, either alone or with RXRα, did not bind the S14TRR. However, PPARα interfered with TRβ/RXRα binding to a TRE (DR+4). Functional studies showed that co-transfected RXRα, but not T3 receptor β1 (TRβ1), abrogated the inhibitory effect of PPARα on S14 gene transcription. These results suggest that WY14643 and PPARα functionally interfere with T3 regulation of S14 gene transcription by inhibiting TRβ1/RXR binding to S14 TREs. Previous studies had established that the cis-regulatory targets of PUFA control were located within the proximal promoter region of the S14 gene, i.e. between −220 and −80 bp. Finding that the cis-regulatory elements for WY14643/PPARα and PUFA are functionally and spatially distinct argues against PPARα as the mediator of PUFA suppression of S14 gene transcription.

The suppression of hepatic lipogenesis is due, at least in part, to an inhibition of transcription of several genes encoding proteins involved in both lipogenesis and glycolysis, including fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, L-type pyruvate kinase, and the S14 protein (1Jump D.B.

The S14 gene has been used as a model for PUFA control of lipogenic gene transcription because the developmental, tissue-specific, hormonal, and nutritional control of S14 is similar to that found for several lipogenic enzymes (2Clarke S.D.

For example, transcription of both fatty acid synthase (FAS) and S14 genes is induced during postnatal development and by insulin, high carbohydrate feeding, and triiodothyronine (T3) and suppressed by diabetes, starvation, and hormones that elevate hepatic cAMP levels. Feeding rats diets enriched in n − 3 PUFA rapidly and coordinately inhibits transcription of both hepatic genes (1Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Thelen A. Liimatta M. J.

PUFA administration to primary hepatocytes suppresses mRNAFAS and mRNAS14 levels (ED50≤ 100 µM), as well as inhibiting transcription of S14CAT fusion genes. Transfection analysis has localized PUFA-response elements (PUFA-RE) to the proximal promoter region of the S14 gene, i.e. between −220 and −80 bp upstream from the transcription start site. The targets for PUFA control of S14 are distinct from the cis-regulatory elements involved in T3 (between −2.8 and 2.5 kb) and insulin/glucose (between −1.6 and −1.4 kb) control of S14 gene transcription (3Jump D.B.

Since our goal is to define the molecular basis of PUFA-mediated control of gene transcription, we became interested in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) as a prospective candidate for a PUFA-regulated factor (PUFA-RF) affecting lipogenic gene transcription. PPAR belongs to the steroid/thyroid supergene family and is involved in lipid metabolism (10Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3027) Google Scholar, 11Dreyer C.

In primary rat hepatocytes, the potent peroxisome proliferator WY14643 suppressed hepatic mRNAS14 and S14CAT activity in a dose-dependent manner with ED50≤ 50 µM (42Jump D.B. Ren B. Clarke S. Thelen A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the current study, the effects of WY14643 and PPARα on S14 gene transcription were examined using the S14CAT124 fusion gene containing a 5′-flanking region extending from −4315 to +19 bp of the S14 gene. Primary hepatocytes were co-transfected with S14CAT124 and a rat TRβ1 expression vector (MLVTRβ1) in the presence and absence of co-transfected mPPARα. Hepatocytes were treated with T3 to induce (≥50-fold) CAT activity (3Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). WY14643 was added to cells without and with co-transfected PPARα. WY14643 treatment and mPPARα co-transfection alone suppressed T3-induced CAT activity by 45% and 60%, respectively (Fig. 1). In the presence of its activator (WY14643), mPPARα inhibited S14CAT activity by 84%. Titration studies (data not shown) demonstrated that over a range of 0.1 to 1 µg of pSG5-PPARα/30-mm culture well, PPARα suppressed S14CAT activity (ED50 = 0.25 µg of PPARα/culture). Therefore, ∼0.2 µg/well pSG5-PPARα was used for most co-transfection studies. Substitution of an equivalent amount of the empty vector, i.e. pSG5, or another nuclear receptor, pSG5-RXRα, for pSG5-PPARα was not inhibitory to S14CAT activity (data not shown). Finally, WY14643 only marginally affected RSV promoter activity, and PPARα had no effect on RSVCAT activity (Fig. 1). More importantly, the WY14643 effect on RSVCAT was not enhanced by PPARα co-transfection. These studies show that: 1) WY14643 suppression of S14CAT activity is not due to generalized effects on hepatocytes, 2) elevating hepatocellular PPARα levels through co-transfection inhibits S14 in a promoter- and receptor-specific fashion, and 3) WY14643 augments the inhibitory effect of PPARα on S14CAT activity. This information coupled with the finding that WY14643 suppressed mRNAS14 in primary hepatocytes (42Jump D.B. Ren B. Clarke S. Thelen A. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggests that PPARα inhibits transcription of both the endogenous and transfected S14 genes. The cis-regulatory elements targeted by PPARα and WY14643 were localized by deletion analysis using a strategy similar to the one used to localize the nPUFA-RE within the S14 proximal promoter region (3Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A illustrates the organization of functional elements controlling S14 gene transcription and the promoter deletion constructs used in this study. The S14 gene has three major functional cis-regulatory regions. The proximal promoter (−290/+19 bp) contains the basal elements required to initiate gene transcription and to confer tissue specificity. This region also contains targets for PUFA-mediated suppression of transcription (3Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 44MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The pluripotent response region (PRR, −1.6/−1.4 kb) contains cis-acting regulatory elements required for tissue-specific, insulin/carbohydrate, and glucocorticoid control of transcription (2Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The thyroid hormone response region (TRR, −2.9/−2.5 kb) contains three functional thyroid hormone response elements (TRE) that bind TRβ1/RXR heterodimers and are required for the T3-mediated transactivation of the S14 gene (45Liu H.-C. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1021-1037PubMed Google Scholar). A series of promoter deletions was prepared in which the S14TRR region was retained to ensure high transcriptional activity and to allow for an examination of an inhibitory effect of WY14643 and PPARα on S14CAT activity (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 1, both WY14643 and PPARα inhibited S14CAT124 by ∼50%, and the combination inhibited S14CAT124 activity by 85%. This same pattern of control was seen with all S14 deletion constructs suggesting that the PRR (at −1.6/−1.4 kb) or the PUFA-RE (at −220/−80 bp) was not involved in WY14643/PPARα-mediated control of transcription. The minimal elements required for the S14 gene to be responsive to WY14643 and PPARα were the elements within the proximal promoter region (−80/+19 bp) containing a TATA box and an NF-1 site and the upstream TRR. The S14TRR was tested as the prospective target of WY14643/PPARα control by fusing this element (−2.9/−2.5 kb) to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter (TKCAT222). The specificity of WY14643/PPARα effects on transcription was examined by comparing the CAT activity of TKCAT222 with that of: 1) an enhancer-less TKCAT fusion gene (TKCAT202); 2) a S14CAT fusion gene containing the S14TRR fused upstream from the −290/+19-bp region of the S14 promoter (S14CAT149); and 3) a TKCAT fusion gene containing the AOX-PPRE, TKCAT223 (Fig. 3A). TKCAT202 was not significantly affected by WY14643 or co-transfected PPARα (Fig. 3B). Inserting the S14TRR upstream from the TK promoter conferred high levels of T3-induction (>50-fold) of CAT activity (see legend for Fig. 3 and 3Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Both WY14643 and PPARα and the combination of these treatments inhibited TKCAT222 by ∼50% and >90%, respectively. This pattern of control is identical with that seen with S14CAT149 and suggests that the S14TRR is the target of WY14643/PPARα action. In contrast to TKCAT222, TKCAT223, which contains the AOX-PPRE upstream from the TK promoter, was only marginally induced by WY14643 (2-fold), but significantly induced by co-transfected PPARα (56-fold). The combination of mPPARα co-transfection and WY14643 enhanced CAT activity by 140-fold (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the direction of control and sensitivity to WY14643 and PPARα regulation is enhancer-dependent. While th"

Little is known about structural regions in AKAPs that mediate their attachment to the neuronal cytoskeleton. However, incorporation of AKAP·PKAII complexes into a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of cultured cells is mediated by two targeting domains (T1 and T2) that are located near the AKAP NH2 terminus (8Glantz S.B.

Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar) proposes that this arrangement places a high concentration of PKAIIβ near a signal generator (neurotransmitter-activated adenylate cyclase) and substrate/effector proteins such as microtubule-associated proteins, ion channels, and G-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors. Phosphorylation of co-localized substrates could (a) facilitate signal transmission over substantial distances in neurons via interconnected proteins of the cytoskeletal network, (b) alter the electrical/ionic properties of the cell, and (c) desensitize active synapses to subsequent pulses of neurotransmitter. Thus, AKAP·PKAII complexes create specialized target sites for the efficient reception and propagation of signals carried by the second messenger cAMP. Dissociation of AKAP·RII complexes in hippocampal neurons abrogates PKA-mediated regulation of glutamate-gated ion channels (13Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, AKAP150 and AKAP79 polypeptides are evident in particulate fractions of homogenates of rat lung (1Bregman D.B.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, AKAP·RII complexes may facilitate cAMP-mediated signaling in non-neuronal cells. This proposition raises fundamental questions that can be addressed in model systems. Do AKAPs accumulate at one major intracellular location, or are they dispersed in multiple cell compartments? Which structural domain(s) in AKAPs govern attachment to the cytoskeleton and/or organelles? What proportion of total RII subunits (PKAII isoforms) can be bound and anchored by AKAPs? Do AKAPs dock with microtubules or other structures in non-neuronal cells? HEK 293 cells provide a good system for studying AKAP localization and function. The cells contain RIIα, RIIβ, and AKAP79 (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the anchor protein is excluded from the cytoplasm. However, the content of endogenous anchor protein is low and only 5-8% of RII isoforms are captured in the particulate fraction of cell homogenates (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant AKAP75 proteins can be expressed at high levels (∼15-fold greater than AKAP79) in stably transfected HEK 293 cells. As a result, intracellular targeting of AKAP75 and effects of AKAP75 on the compartmentalization of endogenous RII subunits (PKAII isoforms) can be analyzed in intact cells. Experiments were devised to (a) establish the exact subcellular location of AKAP75, (b) determine whether T1 and/or T2 mediate the immobilization of AKAP75, and (c) test the hypothesis that alterations in AKAP abundance can control the distribution of RII subunits (PKAII) between the cytoplasm and a specific anchoring site in intact cells. We now report that AKAP75 and endogenous RII subunits accumulate selectively on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane in the cortical actin cytoskeleton of transfected HEK 293 cells. AKAP75 mutants that have modified or deleted T1 or T2 domains fail to concentrate in the cortical cytoskeleton and are dispersed in the cytoplasm. Endogenous RII subunits (PKAII) are distributed in parallel with mutant AKAPs. Thus, multisite interactions, involving both the T1 and T2 domains, appear to be essential for targeting AKAP75·PKAII complexes to the cytoskeleton in non-neuronal cells. The generality of these observations was established by demonstrating that AKAP75 also anchors RII subunits in the cortical cytoskeleton of hamster AV12-664 cells. Wild type AKAP75 co-localizes with cortical F-actin. However, disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin D did not alter the location of AKAP75 or fodrin, suggesting that the anchor protein (like fodrin) interacts with a protein complex that includes integral plasma membrane proteins. Cell lines derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and a hamster subcutaneous tumor (AV12-664) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Stably transfected HEK 293 cells that overexpress wild type AKAP75 (H3 cells) were produced as described previously (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells listed above and transfected HEK 293 and AV12 cells that express wild type and mutant AKAP75 polypeptides (see below) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 8% CO2 and 92% air. A segment of DNA that encodes AKAP75 was cloned in the eukaryotic expression plasmid pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate pAKAP75 as described previously (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA insert (1.3 kilobase pairs) from pAKAP75 was excised by digestion with NotI and XbaI, purified by electrophoresis, and subcloned into the plasmid pGEM5Zf (Promega), which was cut with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting recombinant plasmid was named pGAKAP75. Single-stranded template DNA was produced by transforming Escherichia coli with pGAKAP75 and infecting the transformed cells with M13K07 helper phage as described previously (8Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant AKAP75 polypeptides that contain amino acid substitutions or internal deletions were generated by the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis procedure of Kunkel (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Primers used for consecutive double and triple amino acid substitutions contained 10 correct nucleotides at the 5′ end of the mismatched codons and 13 correct nucleotides at the 3′ end of the mutant sequence. The following double and triple amino acid substitutions were made by inserting the indicated codons for the corresponding codons in the wild type AKAP75 sequence (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y.

The primer used to generate a deletion of residues 27-48 contained codons 23-26 fused in-frame with codons 49-53; the primer employed to produce the deletion of residues 74-91 contained codons 70-73 fused in-frame with codons 92-96. Complete DNA and protein sequences of AKAP75 (428 codons) are given in a previous publication (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing as described previously (1Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutated AKAP75 DNA inserts were excised from pGAKAP75 (see above) and cloned into the pRc/CMV expression plasmid that was digested with NotI and XbaI. In addition, wild type AKAP75 DNA was released from pAKAP75 by sequential digestion with XbaI and NotI. The XbaI overhang was made blunt by incubation with Klenow DNA polymerase prior to incubation with NotI. The DNA fragment was ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCis 2 (provided by C.

This placed the AKAP75 coding sequence downstream from a powerful cytomegalovirus promoter and upstream from a polyadenylation signal. The pRc/CMV expression vector contains the bacterial neoR gene under the regulation of a constitutive SV40 promoter. This permits the selection of stable transfectants with the drug G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK 293 cells were transfected, as described previously (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with recombinant pRc/CMV plasmids that contained the mutant AKAP75 DNA inserts listed above. Stably transfected cells were selected with G418 and cloned as described by Ndubuka et al. (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cloned cell lines could be maintained in the absence of G418 without the loss of AKAP75 expression or drug resistance.

The transfection protocol was identical with that used for HEK 293 cells (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since (a) the pCis 2 expression plasmid contains the dihydrofolate reductase gene under the regulation of a constitutive SV40 promoter (17Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar) and (b) AV12 cells are killed by methotrexate (18Berg D.T. McClure D.B. Grinnell B.W. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 972-978PubMed Google Scholar), it was possible to select and clone stable transfectants by adding 0.25 µM methotrexate to the culture medium. Thirteen independent clones that expressed similar levels of AKAP75 were obtained. Cells designated AV12-A75 cells were used for studies presented below. Antisera directed against AKAP75 and RIIβ were produced in rabbits and characterized as described previously (2Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Anti-RIIβ IgGs bind shared epitopes in RIIα. For immunofluorescence experiments anti-RII IgGs were purified by affinity chromatography on a column of RIIβ-Sepharose 4B, using a methodology described in a previous paper (19Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All results obtained with anti-RIIβ IgGs were independently reproduced with anti-RIIα IgGs (data not shown), indicating that both RII isoforms were simultaneously bound and detected at the IgG concentrations used. A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against P58, a protein located in the cytoplasm and at the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus (20Ktistakis N.T. Roth M.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-fodrin antibodies were generously provided by Dr. J. Morrow (Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine). Affinity-purified fluorescein- or rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) or Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA) (see below). Cells were grown on 20-mm glass coverslips that were coated with poly-L-lysine. The coverslips were washed with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl (PBS). Next, cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 20°C. After fixation and three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized by incubation in acetone at −20°C for 10 min. Further manipulations were performed at 20°C. After washing three additional times in PBS, fixed/permeabilized cells were incubated in PBS containing 3% (w/v) albumin for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with either anti-AKAP75 serum (1:100 in PBS) or affinity-purified, anti-RIIβ IgGs at 1:50 dilution (0.1 µg/ml) for 1 h. Following five washes with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, the coverslips were incubated with 10 µg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat IgGs directed against rabbit immunoglobulins. Samples were incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibodies. Next, cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After air drying, 15 µl of 50% glycerol in PBS, containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine (antibleaching agent), was placed on the specimens, and the coverslips were mounted on slides. The same procedure was used for staining with mouse anti-P58 (1:100) and rabbit anti-fodrin (1:100) IgGs. Fluorescein-tagged goat IgGs (10 µg/ml) directed against mouse immunoglobulins were used to detect antibody-P58 complexes. In one series of experiments (see Fig. 8), rhodamine-conjugated goat IgGs (20 µg/ml) directed against rabbit immunoglobulins were used to visualize RII·anti-RII IgG complexes. Fluorescence signals corresponding to antigen-antibody complexes were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Image Analysis Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) as described previously (19Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorochromes fluorescein and rhodamine were excited at 488 and 568 nm, respectively. Emission filters for fluorescein and rhodamine were 622 and 605 nm. Sequential optical sections were recorded at 0.5-µm intervals. Results reported in this paper correspond to optical sections taken 1 µm above the surface of the coverslip. For each series of immunofluorescence experiments, replicate samples of fixed/permeabilized cells were treated as described above except that antibodies directed against AKAP75 or RII were preincubated with saturating amounts of purified recombinant AKAP75 or RII polypeptides (21Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), respectively. No fluorescence signals were obtained from these samples. H3 cells were incubated with 5 µM cytochalasin D (Sigma) for 4 h at 37°C to disrupt actin microfilaments. For visualization of F-actin, cells were processed as described above, except an incubation with 0.6 µM rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) in PBS was substituted for treatments with primary and secondary antibodies. The cells were then washed, mounted, and observed as described above. Cytosolic and particulate fractions of cells were prepared as described in Hirsch et al. (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (40-60 µg) of cytosolic and particulate proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in 9 or 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (1Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared by transferring the size-fractionated polypeptides and molecular weight standards to an Immobilon P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore Corp.) as described by Bregman et al. (1Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of cytosolic and particulate proteins were blocked, incubated with anti-AKAP75 serum (1:3000) or affinity-purified anti-RII IgGs (1:1000 relative to serum), and washed as described previously (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP75 and RII polypeptides were visualized by indirect chemiluminescence using an ECL kit from Amersham Corp. as previously reported (5Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative amounts of antigen were determined by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) of chemiluminescence signals on x-ray film. Standard curves were prepared with 0.5-100 ng of purified AKAP75 or RII. Amounts of AKAP75 and RII protein in experimental samples were obtained from the linear portion of the standard curves. Approximately 90-95% of total PKAIIα and PKAIIβ partitions with the cytosolic fraction of homogenates of HEK 293 cells (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when an AKAP75 transgene is overexpressed in cloned, stably transfected 293 cells (designated H3 cells) >90% of total RII subunits and nearly all of the type II cAMP-stimulated kinase activity are recovered in a pellet fraction containing Triton X-100-insoluble proteins (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine a candidate intracellular anchoring site(s) for RII subunits, permeabilized H3 cells were probed with anti-AKAP75 IgGs. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Intense fluorescence signals corresponding to AKAP75 immunoreactivity are evident near the plasma membrane at sites of intercellular contact (Fig. 1A). The striking “cobblestone” pattern of AKAP75 accumulation parallels results obtained for certain transmembrane proteins (e.g. cadherins) and polypeptides comprising the cortical actin cytoskeleton (e.g. zyxin, cingulin, fodrin, α-actinin) in several types of cells (22Wheelock M.J. Jensen P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 24Crawford A.W.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Several considerations indicate that AKAP75 is not an integral component of the plasma membrane in H3 cells. AKAP75 has no predicted transmembrane domains and, in neurons, the anchor protein is located in the cytoskeleton near the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (4Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). No immune complexes are observed when intact H3 cells are treated serially with anti-AKAP75 IgGs and fluorescein-tagged secondary antibodies. 3Y. Li, S. B. Glantz, and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. Moreover, the size of AKAP75 is not altered by incubating H3 cells with proteases.3 Finally, AKAP75 is not solubilized by a nonionic detergent that disrupts and dissolves the plasma membrane (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, AKAP75 appears to be targeted principally to the cortical cytoskeleton of H3 cells. The T1 (amino acid residues 27-48) and T2 (residues 77-100) anchoring modules of AKAP75 were previously defined operationally, using low resolution subcellular fractionation procedures (14Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both T1 and T2 are required for the maximal accumulation of AKAP75 in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of cell homogenates. The discovery that AKAP75 accumulates in the cortical cytoskeleton (Fig. 1A) enabled a detailed analysis of the roles of T1 and/or T2 in the anchoring of RII·AKAP complexes at a specific site within intact cells. AKAP75 cDNA was mutated to encode anchor proteins that either (a) lack the T1 or T2 domains or (b) contain multiple amino acid substitutions in the T1 or T2 regions. Wild type and mutant cDNAs were inserted downstream from a cytomegalovirus promoter in a mammalian expression vector. The expression plasmid also includes an SV40 promoter that drives the transcription of the neoR gene. Several stably transfected lines of HEK 293 cells were selected (via G418) for each of the mutated versions of AKAP75 cDNA. The names of the cell lines and descriptions of the mutant AKAP75 polypeptides are presented in Table I. Expression of the variant anchor proteins was monitored by Western immunoblot analysis. Scanning densitometry revealed that mutant polypeptide accumulated to a level that was 10-20-fold higher than that of endogenous AKAP79. Examples are shown in Fig. 2. Typically, 60-95% of the wild type and mutant anchor proteins was recovered in particulate fractions from the cells listed in Table I. Only an AKAP75 mutant lacking the entire T1 domain was predominantly cytosolic"
https://openalex.org/W2061296084,"A previous article described the isolation of several λgt22A cDNA clones expressing the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) Cr-PI allergens recognized by both human atopic IgE antibodies and anti-Cr-PI monoclonal antibodies (Wu, C. H., Lee, M. F., and Liao, S. C. (1995) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 96, 352-359). This article presents the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of two cDNA clones encoding major allergens of P. americana. Clones C12 and C20 encode proteins of 685 and 631 amino acids with two potential N-glycosylation sites each. The predicted molecular weights for C12 and C20 cloned proteins are 79,300 and 75,500 with isoelectric point values of 6.26 and 6.63, which are compatible with the determined sizes (Mr 78,000 and 72,000) and isoelectric point value (6.2) of the Cr-PI allergens of P. americana. A high degree of identity (69.1%), including several overlapped predicted central antigenic determinant residues, was found between two allergens. The anti-fusion protein antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was able to detect crude American cockroach extract, Cr-PI, recombinant proteins, and commercial cockroach extracts, which provides further evidence that two allergens share common antigen determinants. Recombinant allergens of clones C12 and C20 both showed 47.4% skin reactivities on 19 cockroach-sensitive asthmatic patients. Unexpectedly, although no sequence similarity was found to other known allergens, two aromatic amino acid-rich allergens were found to have a striking sequence identity to insect storage proteins (20.1-33.9%), insect juvenile hormone-suppressible proteins (30.9-36.4%), and arthropod hemocyanins (29.7-34.6%). Results suggested that two prominent allergens of P. americana are ancestrally related to these insect hemolymph proteins and represent a new group of proteins in the hemocyanin superfamily. These data will now facilitate epitope-mapping studies, and the recombinant allergens may be valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Sequence data were analyzed using the PC/GENE software (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA), and the FASTA program (33Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar) was used for the sequencing homology search. The antigenic index was calculated according to the algorithm of Jameson and Wolf (34Jameson B.A. Wolf H. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 181-186Google Scholar). DNA was prepared from a plaque-purified phage using the plate lysate method (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An insert was ligated into the multiple cloning sites of the pET system (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) (30Wu C.H. Lee M.F. Liao S.C. J. Allergy Clin.

Recombinant proteins were recovered under denaturing conditions from inclusion bodies of the host cells, and purification of fusion proteins under denaturing conditions was performed using rapid affinity column chromatography with the pET His-Tag system as described by Novagen. Refolding was performed using dialysis with gradual removal of the guanidine in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and lyophilization. The purified fusion protein in a range of 1.0-2.0 mg/ml was finally dialyzed in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.8. The fusion protein was used as an immunogen, and polyclonal antibodies were produced from immunized mice by the method described by Mahana and Paraf (38Mahana W. Paraf A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 161: 187-192Google Scholar). Briefly, a female BALB/c mouse, 4-5 weeks of age, was immunized intraperitoneally with 30 µg of purified fusion protein in complete Freund's adjuvant. Subsequent immunization was carried out on days 28, 50, and 73 with antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The mouse was treated intraperitoneally with 0.3 ml of pristane on day 70 and then with 6 × 106 FO myeloma cells on day 77 to maximize ascites induction. Two to 3 weeks after the last injection of antigen, ascitic fluids were harvested and purified by protein A-agarose affinity chromatography (21Wu C.H. Chiang B.T. Fann M.C. Lan J.L. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1990; 20: 675-681Google Scholar) using an Affi-Gel protein A MAPS II kit according to the method described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). CRa-A was prepared by extracting the whole bodies of insects with Coca's solution in our laboratory, and Cr-PI was partially purified from the CRa-A by Sephadex G-150 SF (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) gel filtration (12Wu C.H. Lan J.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1988; 82: 727-735Google Scholar). Commercial cockroach skin test extracts were obtained from Allergy Laboratories, Inc. (Oklahoma City, OK; American cockroach, 1:20 (w/v), lot A5366), Berkeley Biologicals (Berkeley, CA; American cockroach, 1:10 (w/v), lot 624072), Center Laboratories (Port Washington, NY; American cockroach, 10,000 protein nitrogen units, lot 3M00041), Greer Laboratories (Lenoir, NC; American cockroach, 1:20 (w/v), lot GB26-30B-1A5, and German cockroach, 1:20 (w/v), lot GB46-3B-1A3), and Hollister-Stier Laboratories (Spokane, WA; American and German cockroach mix, 1:10 (w/v), lot F63J7104). Microtiter plates (Immunolon II; Daynatech, Alexandria, VA) were coated either with 100 µl of CRa-A (10 µg/ml), Cr-PI (5 µg/ml), Cr-PII (5 µg/ml), and fusion protein (5 µg/ml) or a 1:20 dilution of commercial cockroach extracts in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 2 h at 37°C. After incubation, coated wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (PBS/Tween). The wells were filled with 2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated overnight at 4°C. Wells were washed and incubated either with 100 µl of serial dilutions or a 1:10 dilution of anti-fusion protein antibodies (10 µg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature in triplicate. After washing, peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin (100 µl at 1:4000; Sigma) was reacted with the wells for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed with PBS/Tween, and then the reactions were developed using 100 µl of 2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (55 mg/ml in 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.2, containing 0.03% H2O2). After a 30-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with 50 µl of 5% SDS, and the absorbance was determined at 415 nm on an EAR 400 AT Easy Reader (SLT Labinstruments, Salzburg, Austria). Commercial American cockroach extracts (1:20, w/v, Greer Laboratories), Cr-PI, and recombinant proteins at a concentration of 100 µg/ml in PBS containing 50% glycerol were used for skin testing. Allergens were applied to the test heads with a Dip'N Touch dispenser (Center Laboratories), and epicutaneous skin tests were performed with a sterile, disposable Multi-Test applicator (Lincoln Diagnostics, Decatur, IL) of eight test heads. PBS containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and 1.0 mg/ml histamine were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. The reaction was read at 15 min and graded against the controls. A reaction comparable to the negative control was considered negative. Responses with a wheal 2.0 mm larger or an area of erythema 5.0 mm larger than on the negative control and a wheal 4.0 mm larger or an area of erythema 10 mm larger than on the negative control was graded 1+ and 2+, respectively. A reaction compatible with the positive control, which usually had a wheal of 7-10 mm and an area of erythema larger than 20 mm was graded 3+. A reaction greater than the positive control that was sometimes associated with pseudopodia and itching was graded 4+. Serum IgE antibodies to CRa-A and Cr-PI were determined by fluoroallergosorbent test using an enzyme immunoassay kit (IgE FAST-Plus Test, 3 M; Diagnostic System Inc., Santa Clara, CA), and the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optimal concentrations of CRa-A (4.0 µg/well) and Cr-PI (1.0 µg/well) were determined by checkerboard titration and coated onto blank microtitration wells (3 M; Diagnostic System Inc.) in our laboratory. Fifty microliters of serum was added to the coated wells and incubated 2 h at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled monoclonal anti-human IgE conjugate was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Excess enzyme-labeled anti-IgE was washed away, and fluorescence substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate in 2-amino-2-methyl propanol buffer, pH 9.5) was then added into the wells and incubated at room temperature for 40-60 min. After incubation, IgE concentration (IU/ml) was determined by a 3 M Diagnostic System fluorometer using calibrators containing 0.35, 0.8, 4.0, and 20.0 IU/ml (1.0 IU/ml = 2.4 ng/ml) perennial ryegrass-specific IgE as standards. A class-scoring system based on specific IgE concentration was assigned according to the manufacturer's recommendation as follows: class 0, <0.35 IU/ml; class I, 0.35-0.99 IU/ml; class II, 1.0-2.99 IU/ml; class III, 3.0-6.99 IU/ml; class IV, 7.0-16.9 IU/ml; class V, 17.0-43.99 IU/ml; and class VI, >44.0 IU/ml. A λgt22A cDNA library derived from the Periplaneta americana mRNA was screened initially with anti-CRa-A polyclonal antibody, and 29 cDNA clones were isolated. Subsequently, several clones recognized by anti-Cr-PI or anti-Cr-PII mAb and human IgE antibodies were identified. Recombinant proteins of Mr 78,000 and 72,000 from clones C12 and C20, respectively, were recognized by both anti-Cr-PI mAb and human-specific IgE antibodies (30Wu C.H. Lee M.F. Liao S.C. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 96: 352-359Google Scholar). The cDNA sequences from C12 and C20 inserts are presented in Fig. 1. The complete sequences of C12 and C20 were shown to be 2418 and 2274 bases long. The C12 insert contains a 7-base pair (bp) 5′-proximal end sequence and a 2055-bp open reading frame that begins with a methionine codon (ATG) and ends at the nucleotide position 2063-2065 (TAA stop codon). The 338-bp 3′-untranslated region includes an AATAAA polyadenylation signal and an 18-bp poly(A) tail. The C20 insert includes a 1-bp 5′-proximal end sequence and an 1895-bp open reading frame that begins with a aspartic acid codon (GAT) and terminates at the nucleotide position 1895-1897 (TGA stop codon), a 354-bp 3′-end noncoding region, three AATAAA polyadenylation signals, and a 23-bp poly(A) tail. The alignment of the complete nucleotide sequence reveals 75.65% identity between the C12 and C20 clones (Fig. 1). Sequence data on the other P. americana allergen clones isolated from the cDNA library will be reported elsewhere. Fig. 2 presents the alignment of the complete deduced amino acid sequence of mature C12 and C20. The comparison of deduced amino acid sequence of mature C12 with C20 reveals 69.1% (436 of 631) identities. The complete C12 and C20 inserts correspond to 685- and 631-amino acid polypeptides of calculated molecular weights of 81,175 and 75,511 and the predicted isoelectric point values for mature C12 and C20 are 6.26 and 6.63. The C12-derived protein appears to possess a leader peptide that is indicated in lower case characters in Fig. 2. The 16-amino acid putative leader of C12 (residues 1-16) has features typical of a eukaryotic signal peptide, and the cleavage site conforms to the −3 (valine), −1 (alanine) rule (39Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Google Scholar, 40Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Google Scholar, 41Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Google Scholar). This predicted signal peptide also includes consensus residues alanine, phenylalanine, alanine, and valine at −2, −4, −5 and −6. The calculated molecular weights of mature C12 (excluding leader sequences) and C20 are 79,300 and 75,500, respectively, compatible with the Mr 78,000 and 72,000 of Cr-PI major allergens determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12Wu C.H. Lan J.L. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1988; 82: 727-735Google Scholar). The predicted isoelectric point values of 6.26 and 6.63 for mature C12 and C20, respectively, are also compatible with the determined isoelectric point value of 6.2 for Cr-PI (20Wu C.H. Hsieh M.J. Huang J.H. Luo S.F. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1996; 76: 195-203Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of C12 contains three cysteines and two potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-Phe-Thr and Asn-Thr-Thr, encoded by nucleotides 599-607 and 704-712, respectively. Clone C20 contains four cysteines and two potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-Phe-Thr and Asn-Thr-Thr, encoded by nucleotides 425-433 and 530-538, respectively. Table I presents the amino acid compositions of the two proteins derived from the sequences, and it can be seen that these allergens are rich in aromatic amino acids containing 16.5-17.3% phenylalanine and tyrosine.Table IDeduced amino acid composition (mol %) of clones C12 and C20C12C20Glycine5.115.07Alanine5.404.44Valine8.326.61Leucine5.996.50Isoleucine3.803.96Proline5.405.39Serine4.384.75Threonine3.503.80Phenylalanine5.696.81Tyrosine10.8010.46Tryptophane0.580.63Lysine5.997.45Arginine4.825.39Histidine5.115.71Aspartate7.457.77Asparagine5.263.96Glutamate5.266.18Glutamine3.502.85Cysteine0.440.63Methionine3.211.74 Open table in a new tab A computer-assisted analysis of antigenic sites with the deduced primary amino acid sequences was performed. The peaks reaching an antigenic index in the 1.3-1.7 area represent potential central epitopes recommended by Jameson and Wolf (34Jameson B.A. Wolf H. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 181-186Google Scholar). The 13 and 11 possible central regions of epitopes for clones C12 and C20 are presented in Fig. 2. The predicted central antigenic determinants showed that 9 are overlapped between C12 and C20. The predictions of membrane-associated α helices were performed using the methods of Eisenberg et al. (42Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Google Scholar) and Rao and Argos (43Rao M.J.K. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Google Scholar), and no region could be found to satisfy the criteria recommended by those authors. A computer-assisted homology search of the data base (SWISS-PROT, release 29) revealed that C12 and C20 sequences have significant degrees of identity with several insect storage proteins (20.1-33.9%), insect juvenile hormone-suppressible proteins (30.9-36.4%), and arthropod hemocyanins (29.7-34.6%). Sequencing search results also indicated 29.7% and 31.5% identities in 283- and 92-amino acid overlaps of C12 and C20, respectively, with the fat body specificity of yolk protein (Fbp1) in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). No similarity was found to other known allergens.

The response of Cr-PI to all anti-fusion protein antibodies in the ELISA was dose dependent, and no Cr-PI allergens were detected when preimmunized mouse serum was substituted for anti-fusion protein antibodies as the coating antibody for the ELISA (data not shown). Each of the polyclonal antibodies to the different recombinant fusion proteins was able to detect CRa-A, Cr-PI, and other recombinant proteins. All commercial cockroach extracts contained detectable Cr-PI, although there were differences between the quantity of allergens in the extracts, and no Cr-PI allergens were detected in the German cockroach extract (Table III).Table IIIDetection of cockroach allergens by anti-fusion protein antibody-based ELISACockroach allergenA415nmAnti-C122Anti-C20CRa-A0.7130.979Cr-PI0.9751.182Cr-PII0.0180.014C121.6391.389C131.4712.380C201.1711.611C280.4710.886A (Cockroach mix)0.0930.098B (American cockroach)0.1070.154C (American cockroach)0.1280.110D (American cockroach)0.3120.375E (American cockroach)0.5940.717F (German cockroach)0.0140.018 Open table in a new tab Thirty-nine allergic patients (16-57 years old) with asthma and 10 nonallergic adults were skin tested with the commercial American cockroach extracts and Cr-PI allergens. Of 39 patients, 60% (23 of 39) had CRa-A-positive immediate skin reactions. Among these cockroach-positive patients, 82.6% (19 of 23) were sensitive to Cr-PI allergens. Skin tests were performed on these CRa-A- and Cr-PI-positive patients with recombinant proteins, and C12 and C20 both showed positive skin reactions in 47.4% (9 of 19). In the nonallergic group, positive reactions were found in 10% (1 of 10) of the subjects. CRa-A- and Cr-PI-specific IgEs were also determined in these 19 patients by the fluoroallergosorbent test. All patients were found to contain specific IgE to CRa-A and Cr-PI, ranging from 0.47 to 2.30 and 0.52 to 35.3 IU/ml, respectively, whereas control subjects showed no cockroach-specific IgE (<0.35 IU/ml).

Both authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the nongenomic analogue 1α,25-dihydroxyprevitamin D3 (HF) increased expression of PKCα and PKCδ. PKCα and PKCδ were translocated to the nucleus of the cell in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 or HF. The effects of HF were attenuated by the nongenomic antagonist 1β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, suggesting that changes in PKC expression are mediated by a nongenomic signaling pathway. Consistent with the involvement of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation cascades mediating 1,25-(OH)2D3 action, enhanced phosphorylation of a variety of cellular proteins at serine and threonine residues and the specific enhanced phosphotyrosyl content of a 33-kDa protein (vdrp33) were observed immediately after 1,25-(OH)2D3 addition.

Iodinated recombinant mouse TSP2 bound to NIH 3T3 cells and was internalized and degraded through a chloroquine-inhibitable pathway. TSP2 degradation was saturable, specific, and similar to the kinetics of degradation of TSP1. Human platelet TSP1, recombinant mouse TSP1, and recombinant mouse TSP2 cross-competed with one another for degradation by 3T3 cells. Degradation of TSP2 was less sensitive to inhibition by heparin than degradation of TSP1. This is in agreement with differences in heparin-binding affinity of the two TSPs. Degradation of TSP2 was slower in cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking heparan sulfate proteoglycans than in wild type CHO cells or in cultures of 3T3 cells treated with heparitinase than in untreated 3T3 cells. Degradation of TSP2 was inhibited by antibodies against the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) or by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, a known antagonist of LRP. This study indicates that TSP2 and TSP1 are metabolized by a common internalization and degradation pathway involving heparan sulfate proteoglycan and LRP. Competition for this pathway is a possible mechanism whereby cells can control the levels and ratio of TSP1 and TSP2 in the extracellular milieu.

These TSPs are divided into two subgroups, with TSP1 and TSP2 in one group and TSP3, TSP4, and TSP5 (also known as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, COMP) in the other (17Bornstein P. Sage E.H.

TSP1 is the best studied of the TSPs. It is a trimeric, secreted modular glycoprotein. Each subunit contains an NH2-terminal globular heparin-binding module (also called a PARP module), a domain that mediates disulfide-stabilized trimerization, a procollagen module, three type 1 (properdin) modules, three type 2 (epidermal growth factor) modules, a series of type 3 (Ca2+-binding) repeats, and a COOH-terminal globular domain (1Lawler J.

In contrast to the effects on endothelial cells, TSP1 promotes growth and migration of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (44Majack R.A. Goodman L.V. Dixit V.M. J.

TSP1, when secreted from platelets, can complex with activated TGF-β1. TSP1 also binds and activates latent TGF-β1 (52Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 53Schultz-Cherry S. Lawler J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Since most cell types secrete latent TGF-β and express TGF-β receptors on their surfaces, it is postulated that TSP1 is a key regulator of TGF-β1 activity under physiological conditions (52Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 53Schultz-Cherry S. Lawler J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

The structural modules of TSP2 are similar to those of TSP1, with an increasing gradient of sequence identity from the NH2-terminal module (38% identity) to the COOH-terminal domain (82% identity) (4Bornstein P. O'Rourke K. Wikstrom K. Wolf F.W. Katz R. Li P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12821-12824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Laherty C.D. O'Rourke K. Wolf F.W. Katz R. Seldin M.F. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3274-3281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The patterns of expression of TSP1 and TSP2 mRNAs are distinct in tissues of embryonic and developed mice (56Iruela-Arispe M.L. Liska D.J. Sage E.H. Bornstein P. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 40-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 57Liska D.J. Hawkins R. Wikstrom K. Bornstein P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To compare the structure and function of TSP1 and TSP2, we have expressed mouse TSP2 (mTSP2) in a baculovirus system as a disulfide-bonded homotrimer (58Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mTSP2 supports adhesion for endothelial cells, osteosarcoma cells, and colon carcinoma cells by mechanisms similar but not identical to those of TSP1. Adherence to both TSPs appears to utilize heparan sulfate proteoglycans and αvβ3 integrin, and is regulated by Ca2+ and reduction. One major difference between adhesive activities of TSP1 and TSP2 is the differential sensitivity to inhibition of adhesion by heparin (58Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another adhesion system where adrenocortical cells are used as a source, bovine TSP2 (also known as corticotropin-induced secreted protein, CISP) shows an antiadhesive activity (59Pellerin S. Lafeuillade B. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TSP2, like TSP1, binds TGF-β1 (55Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). TSP2 does not, however, activate latent TGF-β1 (55Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This lack of activity apparently is due to substitution of the activating RFK sequence in TSP1 (55Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) with the trypsin-susceptible, nonactivating RIR sequence in TSP2 (55Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 58Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TSP2 inhibits the activation of latent TGF-β1 by TSP1, presumably through the common TGF-β1 binding sequence GGWSHW present in both TSP1 and TSP2 (55Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Therefore TSP2 may act as a buffer to the activation of latent TGF-β1 by TSP1. Because TSP1 has potent biological activities, and TSP2, besides its own functions, may regulate TSP1 function, one may postulate that the ratio of TSP1 and TSP2, as well as their amount, is regulated by their expression and half-life. TSP1 is secreted from platelet α-granules upon activation (19Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1990; 41: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 60Lawler J.W. Slayter H.S. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8609-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also produced by a variety of normal and transformed cell lines (19Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev.

Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) has been shown recently to synergize with heparan sulfate proteoglycans in mediating internalization and degradation of platelet TSP1 (67Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 68Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One may hypothesize, based on the homology between TSP1 and TSP2, that their metabolism is similar. However, many homologous proteins have different receptors, and the NH2-terminal region that mediates binding to heparin is the part with the lowest sequence identity between TSP1 and TSP2. Thus, one may also hypothesize that the metabolism of TSP1 and TSP2 is different. To evaluate these hypotheses, we carried out experiments to investigate whether recombinant mouse TSP2 is metabolized by a mechanism similar to that of platelet or recombinant TSP1 and whether TSP1 and TSP2 compete for the same degradation pathway. Human platelet TSP1 (hTSP1) and recombinant mTSP2 produced with baculovirus were purified as described previously (58Chen H. Sottile J. O'Rourke K.M. Dixit V.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Production and purification of recombinant mTSP1 were similar to those used for mTSP2. Briefly, mouse TSP1 cDNA including bases 51-3751 flanked by MluI linkers in the pJDM eukaryote expression vector (a generous gift from Dr. Vishva Dixit) (69O'Rourke K.M. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J.

NcoI and EcoRI digestion was used to generate a 5′ mouse TSP1 fragment containing bases 210-1404 which lacked excess 5′-untranslated region. A 3′ fragment was generated by EcoRI digestion and incomplete BamHI digestion which cut at the BamHI site in the pJDM multiple cloning region but not inside the mouse TSP1 3′ cDNA. These two fragments were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcSG2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) linearized by NcoI and BglII, utilizing the compatible cohesive ends of BamHI and BglII. Recombinant mTSP1 virus was generated using the BaculoGold transfection system (Pharmingen) with Lipofectin per the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, recombinant viruses were plaque-purified once, and third passage virus in serum-free medium SF900 II (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to infect Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Receptor-associated protein (RAP) and R777 antibodies against LRP were prepared as described previously (67Mikhailenko I. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Heparitinase, heparinase I, and chondroitinase ABC were from stocks in Dr. Alan Rapraeger's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and purchased originally from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Chondroitinase ABC from Seikagaku (Rockville, MD) was also tested. Purified mTSP2, 30 µg, was transferred to nitrocellulose paper after electrophoresis in SDS. The nitrocellulose paper containing the mTSP2 band was cut out, washed with H2O, air-dried, frozen in a dry ice/isopropanol bath, and crushed into a fine powder with a glass rod. The powder was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into two New Zealand White male rabbits (30 µg each). The rabbits were boosted three times at 1-month intervals with electrophoretically repurified mTSP2, 35 µg, on nitrocellulose in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, followed by boosts with purified soluble mTSP2 every 4–6 weeks. Antibody titers and antibody specificities were checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on 96-well plates coated with hTSP1, mTSP1, or mTSP2. Antibodies to hTSP1 were produced by a similar protocol. The specificities and species cross-reactivities of rabbit antibodies to mTSP2 or hTSP1 were determined by direct ELISA. The anti-mTSP2 antisera had titers against mTSP2 of 1:20,000-1:40,000, against hTSP1 of 1:600 and against mTSP1 of 1:1,500. Anti-TSP1 antisera had a titer against mTSP1 of 1:15,000 and against mTSP2 of 1:1,200. Purified TSP, 100 µg, was iodinated with 0.5 mCi of Na125I in the presence of 0.5 mM chloramine-T as described previously (63McKeown-Longo P.J. Hanning R. Mosher D.F. J.

After 1 min, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-treated bovine albumin was added to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. 125I-TSP was repurified by affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose and eluted by 1 M NaCl in 0.3 mM Ca2+ and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Albumin was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and 125I-TSPs were stored as small aliquots at −70°C until use. Iodinated TSPs had the expected mobilities in autoradiograms of polyacrylamide gels after electrophoretic separation in SDS without and with reduction. Specific activities were 1.2-5.2 mCi/mg TSP. Iodinated TSPs had 2–7% trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity. NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DME) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in an incubator containing 8% CO2. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained as described previously (66Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Westrick L.G. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Cells were grown to confluence on 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and washed three times with DME before assays. Binding and degradation assays were carried out in DME with 0.2% bovine albumin containing 100 units/ml penicillin G and 150 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate according to procedures described before (63McKeown-Longo P.J.

After the incubation, binding medium was removed and mixed with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10%. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The increase in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity above the baseline value during the incubation was taken as TSP that had been degraded by the cells. The negligible increase in trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity during incubation in plates without cells was considered as the baseline. At the end of the incubation, cell layers were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline three times and"

Recent investigation has suggested a role for the enzyme in lipoprotein and/or lipoprotein lipid uptake. To study this, a simple isolated system that mimics the in vivo system would be desirable. The enzyme is secreted by the hepatic parenchymal cell but exists, and presumably exerts its effects, while bound to capillary endothelial cells in the liver, adrenal gland, and the ovary. We constructed a cDNA that encodes the expression of a chimeric protein composed of rat hepatic lipase and the signal sequence for the addition of the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor from human decay-accelerating factor. When transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells this gave rise to a cell population that had immunoreactive hepatic lipase on the cell surface. Cloning of the transfected cells produced several cell lines that expressed the chimeric protein bound to the cell surface by a GPI anchor. This was documented by demonstrating incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into anti-hepatic lipase immunoprecipitable material; in addition, hepatic lipase was released from the cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C but not by heparin. Phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment of cells expressing the anchored lipase released material that comigrated with hepatic lipase on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was immunoreactive with antibody to the cross-reacting determinant of GPI anchors. Cell lysates containing the anchored protein contained salt-resistant lipase activity, a known feature of the secreted hepatic lipase; thus it appears that these cells have a surface-anchored hepatic lipase molecule. Although it was not possible to demonstrate lipolysis by the enzyme while it was on the cell surface for technical reasons, the protein produced by these cells was active when studied in cell membranes. The ability of the cells to take up lipoproteins was studied. The cells demonstrated an increased affinity for low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor mediated uptake of LDL. They did not, however, demonstrate any enhanced binding or removal of chylomicron remnants. With respect to LDL and remnants, the cells expressing anchored lipase behaved similarly to CHO cell that expressed secreted hepatic lipase. The cells expressing anchored hepatic lipase had a marked increase in the uptake of high density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesteryl ester when compared to that seen with CHO cells secreting hepatic lipase. This increase occurred primarily via the selective pathway, and was not reduced by addition of anti-LDL receptor or anti-hepatic lipase antibodies or the receptor-associated protein. Together the results suggest that hepatic lipase, when bound to the cell surface by a GPI anchor, plays a role in enhancing lipoprotein uptake. For LDL this may involve the provision of a second foot for particle binding, thus enhancing affinity for the LDL receptor. For chylomicron remnants an additional molecule or molecules are necessary to mediate this effect. For HDL, the enzyme facilitates uptake of cholesteryl ester primarily by the selective pathway.

In the present study the state of phosphorylation of BSP and OPN was evaluated by in vitro 32P labeling using a series of protein kinases and quantification. Both the purified bovine BSP and OPN were radiolabeled by [32P]ATP and factor-independent protein kinase. Quantification of 32P radioactivity incorporated on dephosphorylated BSP and OPN provided 6.6 and 8.9 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol, respectively. Native OPN incorporated 1.07 and BSP 2.46 mol of phosphate/mol by factor-independent protein kinase. These data led to calculations that OPN and BSP, respectively, contain 7.83 and 4.14 mol of phosphate/mol in their natural state. Thrombin digests of 32P-labeled BSP showed radioactivity to be associated with fragment of ∼molecular mass values 30 kDa (N-terminal half), with no observable radioactivity associated with the 40-kDa fragment (C-terminal half).

The body's major defense against viral infections is mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These cells can sometimes mount an attack on healthy tissue and cause autoimmune diseases, and they are responsible for organ and tissue transplant rejection. Whether the response is appropriate or not, resting T lymphocytes are activated upon recognition of antigen, in the context of major histocompatibility complex molecules (Chien and Davis, 3Chien Y.H. Davis M.M. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 597-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). One approach to understanding the events that occur is to study the specialized set of genes that are induced during the acquisition of killing potential. These include perforin and cytotoxic serine proteinases (granzymes) that are major components of the killing machinery. Granzymes are implicated in granule-mediated target cell death because their expression is closely correlated with killing activity (Prendergast et al., 39Prendergast J.A. Helgason C.D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5090-5095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by their localization in cytolytic granules (Henkart, 22Henkart P.A. Annu. Rev.

Bleackley R.C. Nadeau J.H. Genomics. 1990; 6: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The exact function of granzymes in granule-mediated killing is unclear, but CPP32, a protease believed to be important in apoptosis, has recently been identified as a substrate for granzyme B (Darmon et al., 7Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The granzyme genes provide an excellent system in which to study cell-specific gene induction as their expression is restricted to activated T lymphocytes and NK cells. Studies of the human and murine granzyme B proximal promoters reveal that they share several conserved sequences. These include T cell-specific transcription factor binding sites such as Ikaros and core binding factor (CBF 1The abbreviations used are: CBFcore binding factorCREcAMP response elementCREBCRE-binding proteinCTLcytotoxic T cellsDMSdimethyl sulfatePCRpolymerase chain reactionLMPCRligation-mediated PCRPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePBSphosphate-buffered salineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaybpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)TPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. /PEBP2) (Haddad et al., 16Haddad P.

We are primarily interested in the events that take place at the endogenous granzyme B locus as resting lymphocytes make the transition to activated killers. We have developed a method for the transfection of reporter gene plasmids into primary mouse splenocytes and show that the minimal granzyme B promoter is able to induce significant levels of luciferase activity in activated CD8+ T cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was used to examine the DNA binding activities of transcription factors before and after CD8+ T cell activation. We have precisely established the sequences involved in transcription factor binding by in vitro footprinting studies using nuclear extracts derived from a cytotoxic T cell clone. DNase1 hypersensitivity analysis identified potentially important regulatory regions in the granzyme B promoter in CD8+ cells. Finally, we were able to observe these protein/DNA interactions in the endogenous promoter by in vivo footprinting analysis in resting and activated CD8+ T cells using the dimethyl sulfate (DMS)/LMPCR genomic footprinting method. Together these results have enabled us to probe the status of the endogenous gene before and after T cell activation and in a physiologically relevant system. Primary splenocytes were obtained from 6- to 12-week-old Balb/c mice. Spleen tissue was ground through a fine wire screen in RHFM/IL-2 media, and the cells were pelleted. Red blood cells were lysed with buffered ammonium chloride lysis buffer. The IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T cell line MTL 2.8.2 was generated from CBA/J mice as described (Bleackley et al., 1Bleackley R.C. Paetkau V. Havele C. J.

All cells were cultured in RHFM (RPMI supplemented with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 µMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum (5% for L cells)). Type 1 cells, MTL 2.8.2 cells, and primary splenocytes were cultured in the presence of 60 units/ml human recombinant IL-2. Primary splenocytes were stimulated with 5-10 µg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma), 1:300 to 1:500 dilution of hamster anti-mouse αCD3 monoclonal antibody supernatant (Leo et al., 30Leo O. Foo M. Sachs D.H.

Primary splenocytes were cultured in RHFM plus 60 units/ml IL-2, 1:500 dilution αCD3, and 5 µg/ml concanavalin A for 20-24 h prior to transfection. Basically, 1.0 × 107 logarithmically growing cells (T cell lines) or 2.0 × 107 (whole splenocytes) were washed twice in serum-free media and resuspended in 1.0 ml of TBS (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.6 mM Na2HPO4, 0.7 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.0)) with 500 µg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma), 15 µg of covalently closed circular luciferase reporter plasmid, and 5 µg of β-galactosidase control plasmid. The DNA was adsorbed for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in serum-free media and cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml (cell lines) or 1.0 × 106 cells/ml (splenocytes) in RHFM + 60 units/ml IL-2 and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Primary splenocytes were stimulated with additional αCD3 and concanavalin A following transfection. The cells were harvested after 48 h, washed twice in PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol), and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. L cells were transfected as described (Seldon, 47Seldon R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Three 10-20-µl aliquots of cell lysates were measured for 20 s following the injection of luciferase reagent (Luciferase Assay, Promega) by a LUMAT LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems Inc.). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (Sambrook et al., 44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66Google Scholar). Final activities are given as luciferase/β-galactosidase values. Because the incubation periods for the β-galactosidase assay varied between the various cell types, the luciferase/β-galactosidase values are relative only within each transfection experiment but are not relative between the different cell types. RNA was prepared by acid guanidinium phenol extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 4Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63167) Google Scholar). Total RNA was separated on denaturing formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham) by capillary transfer. The promoterless luciferase reporter gene plasmid p19LUC was obtained from J. R. De Wet (De Wet et al., 8De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). Granzyme B promoter fragments (from our C11 gene clone), obtained by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR amplification, were inserted upstream of the luciferase gene, and orientation was confirmed by sequencing. Two β-galactosidase control plasmids were used. SVβ-gal has the bacterial β-galactosidase gene under the control of the SV2 viral promoter (Promega), and 906 (from A. Puschel) has the bacterial β-galactosidase gene under the control of the human actin promoter. Plasmids were grown in DH5α Escherichia coli, and high quality supercoiled DNA was purified for transfection by CsCl2 density gradient centrifugation. Between 1 × 107 and 1.2 × 107 CD8+ splenocytes per reaction, unstimulated or stimulated for 3 days (RHFM, 60 units/ml IL-2, 1:500 dilution αCD3, 5 µg/ml concanavalin A, and 1:2000 dilution αCD28) and L cells were washed once in solution 1 (150 mM sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 35 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM K2HPO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM EDTA). The cells were permeabilized with 0.05% lysolecithin (Sigma) in solution 2 (150 mM sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 35 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM K2HPO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM CaCl2) by immersion for 90 s in a 37°C water bath (Miller et al., 33Miller M.R. Castellot J.J. Pardee A.B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), washed once with solution 2, and resuspended at 1.2 × 108 cells/ml in solution 2. 90-µl aliquots of permeabilized cells were added to a 10-µl mixture of DNase1 in solution 2 such that the final concentrations of the reactions were between 0 and 10.0 µg/ml DNase1 (Sigma) or 5 mM EDTA as a control. The reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by treating the cells with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 85 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 300 µg/ml proteinase K for 16 h at 37°C. The DNA was phenol:chloroform-extracted 2-3 times and ethanol-precipitated. RNA was removed by incubation with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A at 42°C for 30 min, followed by two phenol:chloroform extractions, one chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. 15 µg of each genomic DNA sample was cut with EcoRI and electrophoretically separated on 1.2% agarose gels. Nucleic acids were transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham) by capillary transfer. Nuclear extracts were performed as in Schreiber et al. (46Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Mobility shift assays were performed as in Lin et al. (31Lin J. Bhat N.K. John S. Queale W.S. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6201-6210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 3-5 µg of nuclear extract was incubated with 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) and approximately 0.1 to 0.5 ng (10-20,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in a 15-20-µl reaction containing 12 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or annealed, and the ends were filled in with Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. Reactions containing antibody or antiserum were preincubated for 30 min at 4°C. The reactions were run on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Antisera to the PEBP2 α and β subunits was kindly provided by Yoshiaki Ito. Anti-αA1N35 serum reacts with the α subunit, and rabbit anti-β2 serum reacts with the β subunit of the PEBP2 complex. Purified c-Fos (K-25) and c-Jun/AP-1 (D) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The sequences of each oligonucleotide used in EMSAs are as follows: granzyme B AP-1 agctTCTCTTCa, granzyme B CBF agctTCTGCTACTTCATa, granzyme B Ikaros agctTACAACCCCCTA, and granzyme B mutant Ikaros GGCTACAACCTCCTATGCCCTT (nucleotides not present in granzyme B are shown in lowercase). Northern blots were probed with a murine granzyme B cDNA and a human γ-actin cDNA [α-32P]dCTP labeled by random priming. Southern blots obtained in the DNase1 hypersensitivity experiments were probed with a TaqI/PstI restriction fragment that extends from −828 to −546 of the granzyme B promoter. A human c-Fos gene fragment that extends 80 bp upstream of the transcription start site to 360 bp into intron A was used as a positive control. All hybridizations were performed in 50% formamide hybridization solution at 42°C. CD8+ primary splenocytes were isolated from whole splenocyte populations by incubation with an αCD8 primary antibody (Serotec) followed by immunomagnetic separation with magnetic Dynabeads® (Dynal®) or by passage over Cellect™ immunocolumns (Biotex Laboratories Inc.). The purity of the selected cell populations were routinely confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared as in Ohlsson and Edlund (37Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Extracts were routinely made from 1 × 109 cells. The footprint reaction consisted of the following components in a 50-µl volume: 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mM KCl, 0.05 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol. The reactions contained approximately 1 ng of end-labeled DNA fragment, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC), and up to 100 µg of extract. The extract was preincubated for 20-30 min at 4°C, after which the end-labeled fragment was added and incubated for an additional 10-15 min at room temperature. DNase1 digestion was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and CaCl2 to final concentrations of 5 mM and 1 mM, respectively. The amount of DNase1 added was empirically determined to give an even pattern of cleavage products. Usually, 500 ng was used per reaction (2.5 ng for controls) and allowed to digest for 45 s. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of stop solution (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1% Sarkosyl, 10 mM EDTA, 100 µg/ml proteinase K, and 25 µg/ml calf thymus DNA). The reactions were phenol-extracted, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The fragments were visualized on a 7% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gel. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS)-piperidine treatment of cells was performed as described in Mueller et al. (35Mueller P.R. Garrity P. Wold B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 15.5.1Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min. Approximately 1 ml of medium was left behind to resuspend cells. They were then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated in a 37°C water bath. 10 µl of a 10% DMS/ethanol solution was added to the cells and incubated for 1 min. The methylation reaction was stopped by transferring cells to 49 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1-2 ml of cold PBS, 49 ml of ice-cold PBS was added, and cells were pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of cold PBS and added to 2.7 ml of lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 200 µg/ml proteinase K, 0.2% SDS). The DNA was purified, and piperidine cleavage was performed. A naked DNA control was prepared at the same time. MTL 2.8.2s were grown on 24 × 24-cm plates to a final cell density of 2.5-4 × 107 cells/plate. The medium was removed, and 100 ml of prewarmed RHFM containing 0.1% DMS was added and incubated for 2 min. The cells were washed three times with prewarmed PBS. Approximately 8 ml of lysis buffer was layered over the cells, and the plates were swirled gently for 5 min. The lysed cells were scraped off the plates into 50-ml tubes and incubated at 37°C for 5 h. DNA was prepared from the lysates, and a naked DNA control was processed at the same time. In vitro DMS treatment of naked DNA and subsequent piperidine cleavage of both in vitro and in vivo DMS-treated DNA was performed. LMPCR genomic footprinting was performed as detailed in Mueller et al. (35Mueller P.R. Garrity P. Wold B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 15.5.1Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used to detect interactions in the noncoding strand of the −243 C11 promoter were as follows. Primer 1, 5′-cctaggtcccagcgtcaagagt-3′ (Tm 61.8°C); primer 2, 5′-gagaggaagaaggcagagggggctct-3′ (Tm 66.3°C), primer 3, 5′-gaggaagaaggcagagggggctctgtgacc-3′ (Tm 69.6°C). The staggered linker (LMPCR.1) was changed by a single base to raise the Tm. The A residue at position 7 was changed to a G residue. The new Tm was 66°C. LMPCR hybridization temperatures were 63°C, 68°C, and 71°C (for primers 1, 2, and 3, respectively). For the end-labeling reaction, 3 cycles of PCR were performed, and the final products were precipitated in duplicate. The PCR products were run on 7% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gels. Fixed and dried gels were exposed on Kodak XAR-5 film without an intensifying screen. To determine the expression pattern of the granzyme B RNA in the various cell types utilized in our experiments, we prepared total RNA and probed with a granzyme B cDNA. Fig. 1 depicts the relative message levels that were produced from two murine cytotoxic T cell lines, the IL-2-dependent MTL 2.8.2 line, the IL-2- and alloantigen-dependent CTL21.9 (type 1) line, and stimulated CD8+ splenocytes. Also included were EL4, a murine thymoma T cell line, L cell fibroblasts, and a granzyme-independent cytolytic hybridoma PMM-1 (Kaufmann et al., 28Kaufmann Y. Berke G. Eshhar Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2502-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The granzyme B mRNA was expressed at high levels in CD8+ splenocytes and our cytotoxic T cell clones but was completely absent in EL4, PMM-1, or L cells. We were not able to further induce the mRNA levels in type 1 T cells or induce transcription in EL4 cells by stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, αCD3, or concanavalin A (data not shown). The granzyme B mRNA was inducible, however, in primary splenocytes stimulated in the presence of IL-2, αCD3, and concanavalin A. We examined this induction in a population of primary lymphocytes by Northern blot analysis after 1, 2, and 3 days following stimulation. On day 3, lymphocytes were isolated by immunomagnetic separation, and total RNA was prepared for analysis. Fig. 2 depicts the induction profile of the granzyme B message in the whole splenocyte population and of the mRNA in the CD8+- and CD4+/CD8+-depleted cells. We believe that the lower band is mature mRNA while the upper corresponds to a processing intermediate. Granzyme B mRNA appeared on day 1, was very high by day 3, and was not observed in the CD4+/CD8+-depleted cell fraction. Even though the control actin band is very low at day 1, the intensities of the 18 and 28 S RNAs were very similar in all lanes. Together, these Northern blot data indicate that this gene is efficiently transcribed, or the mRNA is sufficiently stable, only in cytotoxic T cells. To define important transcriptional regulatory elements in the granzyme B promoter, a series of deletion fragments was constructed and inserted upstream of a promoterless luciferase gene. These constructs were then transfected into a variety of cell types, and the relative levels of reporter gene expression were examined. Two promoter fragments, one that extends 243 bp and another that extends 828 bp upstream from the transcription start site consistently produced the highest levels of luciferase activity in Type 1 CTL cells (Fig. 3A). The Rous sarcoma viral promoter was typically as active as the 828-bp granzyme B (C11 gene clone) promoter in T cells, and no luciferase expression was ever observed from the parental p19LUC plasmid. Larger 5′-flanking sequences were examined (up to 5 kb) and were much less effective in activating luciferase gene expression than the 828-bp or the 243-bp fragments. These larger fragments were active in both T cells and non-T cells (data not shown). We decided to focus our studies on the smaller, but highly active, 243-bp fragment. Fragments extending 108 bp, 169 bp, and 243 bp upstream of the transcription start site were transfected into MTL 2.8.2, EL4, L cells, and whole splenocytes. Splenocytes were activated by stimulation with IL-2, αCD3, and concanavalin A for approximately 20 h prior to transfection and were then re-exposed to stimulus for another 2 days. The immunomagnetic separation of the CD8+ fraction was performed prior to harvest on day 3 post-initial activation. Significant increases in luciferase activity were observed in all cell types, except EL4, as the 3′-CBF and AP-1 binding sites (contained within −169) and the 5′-CBF and Ikaros binding sites (contained within −243, see below) were included in the constructs (Fig. 3B). We did observe, however, a low but significant level of luciferase expression in EL4 cells upon stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. Apparently, two major elements, one between −108 and −169 and another between −169 and −243, seem to be very important for the high levels of reporter gene expression observed from the −243 fragment and for the inducibility by PMA/ionomycin in EL4 cells. These transfection studies indicate that the minimal granzyme B promoter confers high levels of expression in transient assays but is not necessarily restricted to T cells. Within the −243 promoter fragment there exist consensus sequence binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1, core binding factor (CBF), Ikaros, and the cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE). These sites are located at approximately −200 (Ikaros), −180/−126 (CBF), −150 (AP-1) and at −90 (CRE) nucleotides relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 4). Nuclear extracts were prepared from MTL 2.8.2 T cells, L cells, and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated and unstimulated EL4 cells and incubated with oligonucleotides containing the granzyme B AP-1 and CBF sequence elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that both binding sites formed specific complexes with nuclear proteins present in all of these cells (Fig. 5A). These results show that the AP-1 and CBF regulatory factors are present in the nuclei of cells that both express and do not express granzyme B. We then performed mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from purified CD8+ murine splenocytes to compare complexes in resting and activated cells. Fig. 5B shows that the granzyme B AP-1 oligonucleotide formed a complex with nuclear extracts from stimulated CD8+ cells whereas this complex was absent in resting splenocytes. It has been previously observed that c-Fos mRNA is absent in resting T cells (Jain et al., 24Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250PubMed Google Scholar). A supershift was observed in activated cells with a c-Fos antibody although the c-Jun antibody used in this assay had a negligible effect on the complex in activated CD8, EL4, and L cells. These results indicate that in resting splenocytes the AP-1 complex is either absent or does not bind to DNA, and activation through the T cell receptor is required for effective DNA binding activity. The granzyme B CBF oligonucleotide formed two complexes in CD8+ lymphocytes (Fig. 5C). In nuclear extracts obtained from resting splenocytes, a weak, indistinct complex was formed with the CBF oligonucleotide. Upon stimulation of the cells for 45 h with αCD3, a slower mobility complex was observed. The complex was inhibited when the granzyme B CBF oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts in the presence of a 50 or 200 molar excess of unlabeled granzyme B CBF oligonucleotide. An interesting observation was made when antisera to either PEBP2 αA (CBF α-subunit) or PEBP2β (CBF β-subunit) was added to the reaction. The anti-αA serum did not appear to affect the major complex; however, the anti-β serum was capable of disrupting the complex. The αA antiserum cross-reacts with all three of the known α subunits, 2Y. Ito, personal communication. including αB and αC, which are expressed at high levels in T cells. We may be observing an as yet unknown variation of the α subunit or an entirely different protein that is capable of binding to the CBF/PEBP2 binding site and interacting with the β subunit. It has been determined previously that the Ikaros gene gives rise to a lymphoid-restricted family of functionally distinct transcription factor proteins which are involved throughout lymphocyte development (Georgopoulos et al., 14Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.-H. Molnar A. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar; Molar and Georgopoulos, 34Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The Ikaros element in granzyme B formed a specific complex that was present in both unstimulated and αCD3-stimulated CD8+ splenocytes (Fig. 5D). This complex was competed off with an excess of the granzyme B binding site, whereas competition with a mutant Ikaros binding site did not affect the complex. To confirm the binding of regulatory factors along the granzyme B promoter, we performed in vitro DNase1 footprinting.

Metabolic dynamics were monitored by assessing rates of appearance of 18O-labeled phosphoryls of endogenous nucleotides in cells incubated in medium enriched in [18O]water. Most prominent of the metabolic alterations associated with stimulated insulin secretion was the suppression in the rate of adenylate kinase (AK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of AMP by ATP. This was manifest as a graded decrease of up to 50% in the rate of appearance of β-18O-labeled species of ADP and ATP and corresponded to the magnitude of the secretory response elicited over a range of stimulatory glucose concentrations. The only nucleotide exhibiting a significant concentration change associated with suppression of AK activity was AMP, which decreased by about 50%, irrespective of the glucose concentration. Leucine-stimulated secretion also decreased the rate of AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer. This secretory stimulus-related suppression of AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer occurs within 45 s of glucose addition, precedes insulin secretion, depends on the internalization and metabolism of glucose, and is independent of membrane depolarization and the influx of extracellular calcium. The secretory stimulus-induced decrease in AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer, therefore occurs prior to or at the time of K+ATP channel closure but it is not associated with or a consequence of events occurring subsequent to K+ATP channel closure. These results indicate that AK-catalyzed phosphotransfer may be a determinant of ATP to ADP conversion rates in the K+ATP channel microenvironment; secretory stimuli-linked decreased rates of AK-catalyzed ADP generation from ATP (and AMP) would translate into an increased probability of ATP-liganded and, therefore, closed state of the channel.

Expression of a conformation-dependent anti-β1 antibody 15/7 correlates with activation in wild-type β1.

Indeed we discovered that the 15/7 epitope is in fact located in the nonligand binding region of β1 (within residues 354-425).

This treatment increased membrane PLD and PIP kinase activities in the absence of exogenous p21 proteins. Reduction of Arf translocation suppressed the increase in PLD and PIP kinase activities, whereas complete removal of Rho but not Arf from membranes with RhoGDI was without effect on PLD activity but increased PIP kinase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2020838198,"The antifreeze proteins (AFPs) are structurally diverse molecules that share an ability to bind to ice crystals and inhibit their growth. The type II fish AFPs of Atlantic herring and smelt are unique among known AFPs in their requirement of a cofactor for antifreeze activity. These AFPs are homologous with the carbohydrate-recognition domains of Ca2+-dependent (C-type) lectins and require Ca2+ for their activity. To investigate the role of metal ions in the structure and function of type II AFPs, the binding of Ca2+ and other divalent cations to herring AFP was investigated. Binding studies using 45Ca2+ demonstrated that the AFP has a single Ca2+-binding site with a Kd of 9 µM. Proteolysis protection studies and measurement of antifreeze activity revealed a conformational change from a protease-sensitive and inactive apoAFP to a protease-resistant active AFP upon Ca2+ binding. Other divalent metal ions including Mn2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+ bind at the Ca2+-binding site and induce a similar change. A saturatable increase in tryptophan emission intensity at 340 nm also occurred upon Ca2+ addition. Whereas antifreeze activity appeared normal when Ca2+ or Mn2+ were bound, it was much lower in the presence of other metal ions. When Ba2+ was bound to the AFP, ice crystals showed a distinct difference in morphology.

INTRODUCTIONMany marine teleost fishes are protected from freezing in icy sea water by antifreeze proteins (AFPs) 1The abbreviations used are: AFPantifreeze proteinhAFPherring AFPAFGPantifreeze glycoproteinsCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainC-typeCa2+-dependentMBPmannose-binding proteinPVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. or glycoproteins (AFGPs). These proteins lower the freezing points of solutions in a noncolligative manner by inhibiting the growth of ice crystals (Ananthanarayanan, 1Ananthanarayanan V.S. Life Chem. Reports. 1989; 7: 1-31Google Scholar; Davies and Hew, 6Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Four distinct types of antifreezes have been found in fishes, and each has a narrow phyletic distribution. The AFGPs are found in the cods and in the nototheniids (see Davies and Hew (6Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and references therein), and they consist of a series of repeated tripeptide units (Ala-Ala-Thr) with an O-linked disaccharide linked to each Thr residue. The type I AFPs, found in sculpins and in righteye flounders, are Ala-rich amphipathic α-helices (Davies and Hew, 6Davies P.L. Hew C.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2460-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The type II AFPs are larger proteins with a folded structure and are found in smelt (Osmerus mordax), herring (Clupea harengus harengus), and sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus) (Ewart et al., 14Ewart K.V. Rubinsky B. Fletcher G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Ng and Hew, 21Ng N.F.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16069-16075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Ewart and Fletcher, 13Ewart K.V. Fletcher G.L. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1993; 2: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). Type III AFP is a protein with a β sandwich structure and appears limited to eel pouts (Sönnichsen et al., 23Sönnichsen F. Sykes B.D. Chao H. Davies P.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1154-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The type II AFPs from sea raven, smelt, and herring share a high protein sequence identity. All three proteins are homologous to the carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) of Ca2+-dependent (C-type) lectins and correspond to the group VII C-type lectin family (Drickamer and Taylor, 9Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment of the sea raven AFP with C-type CRDs and modeling of the AFP using coordinates from the CRD of rat mannose-binding protein (Weis et al., 25Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254 (a): 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) has confirmed the structural similarity of the type II AFP to the C-type CRD fold (Sönnichsen et al., 24Sönnichsen F. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 460-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the lectins, the AFPs do not bind to carbohydrates (Ewart, 11Ewart, K. V., 1993, Type II Antifreeze Proteins from Smelt (Osmerus mordex) and Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus harengus): Similarities to the c-type Lectin Families. Ph.D. thesis, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.Google Scholar).Two Ca2+-binding sites were identified in the crystal structure of a C-type CRD from rat mannose-binding protein (MBP), and a single site was identified in the CRD of E-selectin (Weis et al., 25Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254 (a): 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar; Graves et al., 15Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding site that is shared by the selectin and the MBP was shown to be the carbohydrate-binding surface in a crystal structure of an oligosaccharide-MBP complex (Weis et al., 27Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Like the C-type lectins, the herring and smelt AFPs require Ca2+ for their activity (Ewart et al., 14Ewart K.V. Rubinsky B. Fletcher G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Ewart and Fletcher, 13Ewart K.V. Fletcher G.L. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1993; 2: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). In order to understand the role of Ca2+ in the structural integrity and activity of these AFPs and the structural alterations underlying the evolution from carbohydrate to ice binding, we examined the role of Ca2+ in the conformation and the antifreeze activity of the herring AFP (hAFP). Our findings show that hAFP contains a single Ca2+-binding site. The protein binds Ca2+ and several other ions which modulate the protein conformation as detected by proteolysis protection assays and by Ca2+-induced fluorescence change. However, fully active AFP is only detected in the presence of Ca2+ and Mn2+.DISCUSSIONAntifreeze proteins depress the freezing temperatures of solutions by binding specific planes of ice crystals and thereby inhibiting crystal growth. The ice-binding mechanism of the type II fish AFPs is not understood, and the surface that forms the ice-binding site has not been identified. In this context, the evolutionary relationship and structural similarity between the type II AFPs and the C-type lectin CRDs may provide a rational approach to the study of AFP function. The AFPs of herring and smelt are unique among all AFPs in their absolute requirement of a cofactor (Ca2+) for activity. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent AFPs provide an interesting model for the study of the specific role of metal ions in ice-binding activity. Their Ca2+-dependent interaction with ice suggests that they represent an intermediate between two different forms of the CRD, the typical C-type lectin CRD with Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-binding activity and the distinct CRD of the sea raven AFP which is a Ca2+-independent ice-binding protein.Blotting experiments using 45CaCl2 and ruthenium red dye showed that Ca2+ is indeed bound directly by the hAFP. In our experiments, excess Mg2+ appeared to displace the dye from the AFP and the positive controls as effectively as did Ca2+ (Charuk et al., 5Charuk J.H.M. Pirraglia C.A. Reithmeier R.A.F. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, under the conditions used in 45Ca2+ binding studies, Mg2+ did not compete with 45Ca2+ binding to the AFP.Binding measurements using 45Ca2+ revealed the presence of a single Ca2+-binding site with a Kd of 9 µM on the hAFP. Sequence analysis and prediction with known (C-type CRDs) crystal structures has also shown that the smelt and hAFPs contain those conserved residues that form the Ca2+-binding site that corresponds to Ca2+-binding site 2 of the galactose-binding C-type lectins (Fig. 7A), whereas CRD Ca2+-binding site 1 does not appear to be conserved in the herring and smelt AFPs (Weis et al., 25Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254 (a): 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 27Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar; Ewart et al., 14Ewart K.V. Rubinsky B. Fletcher G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Ewart and Fletcher, 13Ewart K.V. Fletcher G.L. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1993; 2: 20-27PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these studies argue strongly for the presence of a unique Ca2+-binding site on the hAFP that corresponds to Ca2+-binding site 2 in the structure of rat MBP (Weis et al., 25Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254 (a): 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The presence of site 2 in a C-type CRD without site 1 has also been described in the E-selectin (Graves et al., 15Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Ca2+-binding site 2 forms the carbohydrate-binding site on the C-type CRD (Weis et al., 27Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) and may therefore be more conserved among lectins than site 1.Previous studies on C-type lectin CRDs have shown that other metal ions can substitute for Ca2+. Using various assay methods, E-selectin and chicken hepatic lectin have been shown to bind Sr2+ and Ba2+ (Loeb and Drickamer, 18Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9752-9760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Anostario and Huang, 2Anostario Jr., M. Huang K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8138-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Neither of these proteins appeared to interact with Mg2+ ions. In the case of hAFP, several divalent metal cations, with the exception of Mg2+, displaced Ca2+ from the AFP. Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the most abundant divalent cations in fish blood (McDonald and Milligan, 20McDonald D.G. Milligan C.L. Hoar W.S. Randall D.J. Farrell A.P. Fish Physiology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992: 55Google Scholar). Our results show that in herring blood plasma, Ca2+ is the ion that is bound at site 2 of the AFP.Resistance to proteolysis has been employed as a useful indicator of the modulation of C-type CRD conformation (Loeb and Drickamer, 18Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9752-9760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Weis et al., 26Weis W.I. Crichlow G.V. Murthy H.M.K. Hendrickson W.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8138-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Upon binding Ca2+, CRDs typically undergo a conformational change from a functionally inactive conformation susceptible to proteolysis to one that is protease-resistant and contains a fully functional binding site for a specific carbohydrate or other ligand. The present investigation revealed that hAFP undergoes a similar alteration with the addition of Ca2+. The enhancement of resistance to proteolysis is a good diagnostic indicator of a Ca2+-induced conformational change in the hAFP. Two protease cleavage sites on the AFP are found to be at locations separate from the Ca2+-binding sites. This suggests that a conformational change involving a large region of the herring AFP occurs in response to Ca2+. Metals that conferred protease resistance to the AFP included Mn2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+, but not Mg2+. The Ca2+-induced change in conformation was also detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. This finding corroborates competition data suggesting that Mg2+ does not bind strongly at the Ca2+-binding site.To understand the structure-activity relationship in the hAFP, the response of the antifreeze activity to Ca2+ ions was evaluated. The approximately 1:1 stochiometric molar ratio of Ca2+ to AFP at which maximal activity was attained is in agreement with Ca2+ binding data showing a single site on the AFP. The response of AFP activity to different metals revealed that Mn2+, which results in an ice crystal morphology similar to Ca2+, can be an effective substitute for Ca2+ in forming an active AFP. In contrast, the ice crystals formed in the presence of AFP with Ba2+ contained depressions on the basal planes (Fig. 6) that are not seen with the addition of Ca2+ or other metals. Similar differences among metal ions have been reported for E-selectin. Ba2+ and Sr2+ ions protected the selectin from proteolysis but in each case the resulting apparently stably folded selectin did not interact normally with its carbohydrate ligand (Anostario and Huang, 2Anostario Jr., M. Huang K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8138-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The ice-binding site in the type II AFPs is most likely to have evolved from the Ca2+ site corresponding to site 2 of MPB in a lectin CRD as suggested by Ewart (11Ewart, K. V., 1993, Type II Antifreeze Proteins from Smelt (Osmerus mordex) and Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus harengus): Similarities to the c-type Lectin Families. Ph.D. thesis, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.Google Scholar) and Sönnichsen et al. (24Sönnichsen F. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 460-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of C-type lectins to carbohydrate and binding of AFPs to ice both require a motif that is formed exclusively in the Ca2+-induced “active” CRD conformation. In addition, carbohydrate binding by C-type lectins is mediated primarily through a precise arrangement of hydrogen bond-forming groups which would be an ideal starting point for the evolution of an ice-binding site. The formation of an unusual ice crystal morphology when Ba2+ is added to the AFP further supports the notion that the Ca2+ site is directly involved in ice binding.The residues that form the Ca2+-binding site in the MBP are conserved in hAFP. However, in the AFP, residues 1 and 2 of the Ca2+-binding site are Gln and Asp as in the galactose-binding lectins, and in contrast to the MBP and the E-selectin in which they are Glu and Asn (Fig. 7B). The architecture of the galactose and mannose-binding motifs are expected to be quite similar because simultaneous mutations changing Glu-Pro-Asn to Gln-Pro-Asp in MBP cause it to bind galactose (Drickamer, 7Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The role of Glu-99 in Ca2+ binding is not yet clear. In MPB, this residue is a Ca2+ ligand, whereas its location in the E-selectin is not compatible with a Ca2+-binding role (Weis et al., 1991; Graves et al., 15Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of hAFP will allow a precise identification of the Ca2+ and ice-binding residues in the AFP. The ion-binding site identified here will allow us to generate protein crystals in the presence of heavy atoms suitable for structural determination. Site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues will provide another avenue that will be useful in mapping both the metal and ice-binding site residues.

Histochemistry. 1990; 94: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The noradrenergic chromaffin cell subpopulation but not the adrenergic subpopulation expresses FGF-2 (10Grothe C. Unsicker K. Histochemistry. 1990; 94: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In cultured bovine chromaffin cells, the FGF-2 mRNA is enhanced after stimulation of neurotransmitter and hormonal receptors (11Stachowiak M.K. Moffett J. Joy A. Puchacz E. Florkiewicz R. Stachowiak E.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). FGFs are known to mediate cellular effects via cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (FGF receptors, FGFRs). At present, the cDNAs for four high affinity receptors (FGFR1-4), encoded by distinct genes, have been cloned (12Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 13Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 14McKeehan W.L. Kan M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 39: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, low affinity receptors have been characterized as cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, e.g. the integral membrane proteoglycan syndecan (15Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 16Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The mRNAs for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 are found in extracts of the adrenal gland (17Luqmani Y.A. Graham M. Coombes R.C. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Partanen J. Mäkelä T.P. Eerola E. Korhonen J. Hirvonen H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In the adrenal cortex of the embryonic mouse the FGFR4 mRNA could be demonstrated by in situ hybridization (19Stark K.L. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Development. 1991; 113: 641-651PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat adrenal gland FGFR1 transcript is present in preparations of the cortex and medulla (20Meisinger C. Hertenstein A. Grothe C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The developmental expression pattern of the medullary FGFR1 mRNA matches that of the expression of the FGF-2 immunoreactivity in developing chromaffin cells (20Meisinger C. Hertenstein A. Grothe C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PC12 cells are a catecholamine-secreting pheochromocytoma cell line cloned from the rat adrenal medulla. Since a great number of cells are available, they are a useful model system for detailed studies. PC12 cells express both FGF-2 and FGFR1 transcript (20Meisinger C. Hertenstein A. Grothe C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces a significant increase of FGFR1 mRNA in PC12 cells under serum-containing culture conditions suggesting that NGF enhances the responsivity to FGF (20Meisinger C. Hertenstein A. Grothe C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). With regard to the putative physiological function(s) of the chromaffin cell-derived FGF-2, several possibilities have been proposed. From in vivo studies it was suggested that the medullary FGF-2 could function as a neurotrophic factor for preganglionic sympathetic neurons (21Blottner D. Westermann R. Grothe C. Böhlen P. Unsicker K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Exogenously applied FGF-2 was shown to prevent the lesion-induced death of the preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the spinal cord after adrenomedullectomy (21Blottner D. Westermann R. Grothe C. Böhlen P. Unsicker K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In line with this result was the finding that preganglionic sympathetic neurons possess FGFR1 and are able to specifically and retrogradely transport iodinated FGF-2 which was injected into the medulla (22Stapf C. Shakibaei M. Blottner D. Neuroscience. 1996; 69: 1253-1262Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 3D. Blottner, C. Stapf, C. Meisinger, C. Grothe, submitted for publication. On the other hand, since several FGF-2-mediated effects on cultured chromaffin cells and on PC12 cells were demonstrated, an autocrine/paracrine role of FGF-2 for chromaffin cells has been discussed. FGF-2 stimulates proliferation and neurite outgrowth of embryonic chromaffin precursor cells (23Stemple D.L. Mahanthappa N.K. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), increases chromaffin cell proliferation of neonatal and adult rats synergistically with insulin-like growth factors (24Frödin M. Gammeltoft S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), promotes catecholamine storage and synthesis of early postnatal chromaffin cells (25Unsicker K. Westermann R. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 65: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), induces the expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase and proenkephalin genes of adult chromaffin cells (26Puchacz E. Stachowiak E.K. Florkiewicz R.Z. Lukas R.J. Stachowiak M.K. Brain Res. 1993; 610: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and enhances in combination with ciliary neurotrophic factor the ability of NGF to induce transdifferentiation of postnatal and adult chromaffin cells into neurons (27Ip N.Y. Boulton T.G. Li Y. Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 443-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The responses of PC12 cells to FGF-2 include differentiation into sympathetic-like neurons and development of electrical excitability (28Neufeld G. Ferrara N. Schweigerer L. Mitchell R. Gospodarowicz D. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Pollock J.D. Krempin M. Rudy B. J.

Kuzuya H. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids (GCs), which are synthesized in the adrenal cortex and are present at high concentrations in the medulla, are implicated in the development of medullary chromaffin cells (34Anderson D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is suggested that GCs are essential and sufficient to trigger the differentiation of noradrenergic sympathoadrenal precursor cells to adrenergic chromaffin cells (35Seidl K. Unsicker K. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent study on glucocorticoid-deficient mice by gene targeting suggests the existence of two different cell populations in the adrenal medulla, an adrenergic population which requires glucocorticoids for the development and a noradrenergic population which develops in the absence of the glucocorticoid signal (36Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Monaghan P. Krieglstein K. Schmid W. Aguzzi A. Fantuzzi G. Hummler E. Unsicker K. Schütz G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1608-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Postnatal chromaffin cells in vitro transdifferentiate into sympathetic neurons after exposure to NGF (37Doupé A.J. Landis S.C. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 2119-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lillian L.E. Claude P. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 161: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This NGF-induced transdifferentiation can be antagonized by GCs which maintain the endocrine status (23Stemple D.L. Mahanthappa N.K. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Seidl K. Unsicker K. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Lillian L.E. Claude P. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 161: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Unsicker K. Krisch B. Otten U. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism, however, which causes the effect of GCs on chromaffin cells is not yet clear. With regard to the central nervous system, it was shown that GCs regulate the expression of neurotrophins and FGF-2 (41Lindholm D. Castren E. Hengerer B. Zafra F. Berninger B. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Barbany G. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 43Chao H.M. McEwen B.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 44Riva M.A. Fumagalli F. Racagni G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Smith M.A. Makino S. Kvetnansky R. Post R.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1768-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to examine whether GCs which are important for chromaffin cells could be involved in the regulation of FGF-2 expression. Therefore, we have analyzed the in vivo and in vitro effects of GCs on the expression of FGF-2 and FGFR1 in the adrenal medulla and PC12 cells. In addition, we compared the effect of GCs on FGF-2 expression in other neuronal tissues (brain, Schwann cells) with non-neuronal tissues (adrenal cortex, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, L6 myoblasts). The present results show that GCs enhance FGF-2 protein and mRNA in PC12 cells in vitro and in adrenal medullary cells in vivo. Since the FGF-2 transcript is also elevated in the brain but not in non-neuronal tissue, we suggest that the GC-mediated increase of FGF-2 mRNA is specific for neuronal tissue. PC12 cells (kindly provided by Dr. R. Westermann, Marburg, Germany), L6 rat myoblasts (kindly provided by Dr. T. Braun, Braunschweig, Germany), and immortalized Schwann cells (46Tennekoon G.I. Yoshino J. Peden K.W. Bigbee J. Rutkowski J.L. Kishimoto Y. DeVries G.H. McKhann G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2315-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. B. Seilheimer, Basel, Switzerland), respectively, were grown to confluency in 75-cm2 plastic tissue culture flasks (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum at 37°C in a humidified 6% CO2 incubator. Cells were routinely split in a 1:3 ratio, and the medium was changed twice a week. For experiments cells (2 × 106) were seeded on 75-cm2 flasks in serum-containing (see above) or serum-free (see below) medium. After 1 day medium was changed and cells received the glucocorticoids dissolved in serum-containing or serum-free medium. Serum-free medium was supplemented with N1 additives (47Bottenstein J.E. Skaper S.D. Varon S.S. Sato G.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 125: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Hydrocortisone, progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol were presented at 10 µM and dexamethasone at 10 µM and 1 µM. After various culture periods (1-120 h) cells were dislodged by 0.1% trypsin, 20 nM EDTA for RNA isolation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until used. The number and morphology of cells was checked under microscopic control in sister cultures in the presence of the respective glucocorticoids by counting the cells in suspension, after gentle detachment from the flasks at the end of the experiments. Female Hanover Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were used. Animals received dexamethasone (5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) or vehicle injections and were killed by decapitation 24 h after injection. Tissues were rapidly dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. For the analysis of the adrenal cortex and medulla, adrenal glands of rats from each group were quickly removed. Cortices and medullae were carefully dissected on ice under binocular control, collected in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Riboprobes were transcribed from linearized templates prepared in bluescript plasmid using the T3/T7 in vitro transcription system (Stratagene) and gel-purified immediately before use (specific activity approximately 4-8 × 107 cpm/µg for FGFR1 and for FGF-2 and 1-2 × 106 cpm/µg for 18 S). The length of the 33P-labeled cRNA antisense riboprobes used was 350 bases of FGFR1, 319 bases of FGF-2, and 80 bases of 18 S (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Total RNA was isolated according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (48Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62723) Google Scholar) and quantified by absorption at 260 nm. Ribonuclease protection assay was performed as described previously (20Meisinger C. Hertenstein A. Grothe C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Total RNA was dissolved and heated to 95°C for 10 min in hybridization solution (80% formamide, 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing 100,000 cpm of 33P-labeled cRNA probe. After hybridization overnight at 49°C the solution was diluted in RNase digestion buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) containing RNases A and T1 and incubated for 1 h at 30°C. After adding 6 µl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 20 µl of SDS (10%) and incubation for 25 min at 35°C, phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol/glycogen precipitation were done. The resulting pellets were suspended in loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated for 5 min at 85°C, and separated on a 4% polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gel. After fixation and drying, gels were exposed for several time intervals to Kodak BioMax film. tRNA was used as negative control. 18 S was used as an internal standard for the amount and integrity of RNA preparation. Experiments were performed 3-6 times. PC12 cells and Schwann cells were lysed and homogenized in distilled water. A crude cytoplasmic fraction was received after centrifugation (45 min, 14,000 × g). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and semi-dry blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), immunological detection of FGF-2 was performed using monoclonal FGF-2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system from Amersham (Braunschweig, Germany). Experiments were performed 2-3 times. PC12 cells displayed FGF-2 and FGFR1 mRNA expression under serum-free and serum-containing cultures conditions. FGFR1 mRNA was found to be present at higher levels than the FGF-2 mRNA. Treatment with DEX (10 µM, 1 µM) dramatically increased the FGF-2 mRNA level in serum-containing and serum-free cultures. The DEX effect on the FGF-2 transcript was time-dependent, showing a stimulation 12 and 24 h after application but not before or after this time point (Fig. 1). Further characterization of the steroid hormones which affected the FGF-2 mRNA expression revealed that hydrocortisone elevated the FGF-2 transcript level to the same extent as DEX (Fig. 2). No effects were found after treatment with progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol (Fig. 2). In addition to PC12 cells FGF-2 transcript level was also stimulated in immortalized Schwann cells in the presence of DEX (10 µM) (not shown). Western blot analysis of PC12 and Schwann cells using a monoclonal FGF-2 antibody revealed immunoreactive bands at 18, 21, and 22.5 kDa, which is in good agreement with the previously described rat FGF-2 isoforms. Analyzing the FGF-2 expression under DEX treatment, a dramatic increase of the FGF-2 protein level compared with control culture conditions was found in both PC12 and Schwann cells. Interestingly, this increase was confined to the 21-kDa FGF-2 isoform (Fig. 3). The weakly expressed 18- and 22.5-kDa isoforms remained unchanged (Fig. 3). The FGFR1 mRNA level was not affected by the steroid hormones tested (not shown). To verify that this regulatory mechanism observed in PC12 cells is also operative in vivo, DEX (5 mg/kg) was systemically injected intraperitoneally. In preparations of the adrenal medulla the FGF-2 mRNA level was dramatically enhanced 24 h after injection of DEX (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis of adrenal medullary extracts revealed a significant increase of the 21-kDa FGF-2 isoform level after DEX treatment (Fig. 5). In addition, in vivo treatment with DEX also revealed an increase of the medullary FGFR1 transcript level (Fig. 6). In the forebrain FGF-2 mRNA level was significantly enhanced, whereas FGFR1 mRNA level remained unchanged (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). To clarify whether the DEX-induced increase of the FGF-2 mRNA level is a general effect on FGF-2 expressing tissues, non-neuronal tissues were analyzed. In vivo, treatment with DEX produced no elevation of the FGF-2 transcript level in adrenal cortex, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle, respectively (Fig. 7). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of adrenal cortical extracts revealed no increase of the FGF-2 protein level after DEX injection (Fig. 9). Since these tissues were prepared from the same rats that were also used for the preparations of the adrenal medulla and brain, where the FGF-2 mRNA was increased, the DEX treatment was successful and effective. With regard to the FGFR1, this transcript level was enhanced in the adrenal cortex after DEX treatment (Fig. 10). In the other tissues the FGFR1 mRNA expression was unchanged (Fig. 8). In vitro, application of DEX to cultured L6 myoblasts revealed no increase of the FGF-2 mRNA and protein level (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). In the present study we demonstrate for the first time that glucocorticoids mediate an increase of the FGF-2 mRNA and protein level in PC12 cells and in the adrenal medulla. In addition we show that the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids on FGF-2 expression is confined to neuronal tissues. From in vitro studies it is known that FGF-2 is involved in development and maintenance of chromaffin cells. In response to FGF-2 embryonic, neonatal, and/or adult, chromaffin cells show proliferation (23Stemple D.L. Mahanthappa N.K. Anderson D.J.

Stachowiak M.K. Brain Res. 1993; 610: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These FGF-2-mediated effects could be modulated by glucocorticoids. More complicated, however, is the interpretation of our results with regard to the known cooperation of exogenously administered FGF-2 in the differentiation of chromaffin and PC12 cells into sympathetic-like neurons (23Stemple D.L.

Since glucocorticoids maintain the endocrine status of chromaffin cells (23Stemple D.L. Mahanthappa N.K. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Seidl K. Unsicker K. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38Lillian L.E.

Biol. 1981; 82: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it must be assumed that there is a difference between the reported effects of exogenously applied FGF-2 and the effect of elevated intracellular FGF-2 induced by glucocorticoids. In the present study we show that the previously reported FGF-2 isoforms (5Giordano S. Sherman L. Lyman W. Morrison R. Dev.

Sci. 1991; 638: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) are differentially regulated in PC12 cells and in the adrenal medulla after DEX stimulation. Exclusively, the expression of the 21-kDa isoform level is dramatically enhanced, whereas the other ones remain unchanged. One possible explanation could be that the individual FGF-2 proteins are differentially translated. Although the biological significance of the function of the different isoforms is still unclear, it could be suggested that exogenously applied 18-kDa FGF-2 mediates effects other than the intracellular 21-kDa isoform. In accordance with this suggestion is the finding that the overexpression of 18-kDa FGF-2 has a different effect on cell growth and tumorigenic potential than the overexpression of the higher molecular weight isoforms (57Couderc B. Prats H. Bayard F. Amalric F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 58Quatro N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R. Rifkin D.B.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The present results could help to elucidate the mechanism that causes the effect of glucocorticoids on the establishment of the endocrine status of chromaffin and PC12 cells. Possibly the 21-kDa isoform could be involved in modulating the glucocorticoid-mediated effect. Further studies, however, are necessary to verify this hypothesis. The expression of FGF-2 isoforms during rat brain development, an 18- and 21-kDa isoform is present in the embryo whereas in the adult brain a 22-kDa form is found in addition to 18 and 21 kDa, also suggests that the different FGF-2 isoforms are involved in different functions (5Giordano S. Sherman L. Lyman W. Morrison R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). With regard to the role of FGF-2 in the brain and in Schwann cells where FGF-2 is also dramatically enhanced after DEX treatment, several possibilities are discussed. Within the central nervous system FGF-2 appears to be involved in the development and de-/regeneration of neurons (4Baird A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 8Unsicker K. Grothe C. Westermann R. Wewetzer K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Since at certain steps of development glucocorticoids play a major role in neuronal birth and death (60Gould E. McEwen B.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it is likely that the synthesis of FGF-2 is modulated by glucocorticoids during this phase. FGF-2 protein and mRNA are expressed in the embryonic and newborn nervous system (5Giordano S. Sherman L. Lyman W. Morrison R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6Weise B. Janet T. Grothe C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 442-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 61Ernfors P. Lönnerberg P. Ayer-LeLievre C. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids are also important for adult central neurons. The specific degeneration in the hippocampal dentate gyrus induced by adrenalectomy (62Sapolsky R.M. Stein-Behrens B.A. Armanini M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1991; 114: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), for example, could be the result of a reduced trophic factor production after depletion of glucocorticoids. In the postnatal and adult brain FGF-2 protein and mRNA are found in astrocytes and in distinct neuronal populations (63Gomez-Pinilla F. Lee J.W.-K. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 345-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64Grothe C. Zachmann K. Unsicker K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1991; 305: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 65Grothe C. Janet T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 353: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies have shown that the FGF-2 increase after DEX treatment is induced in astrocytes (44Riva M.A. Fumagalli F. Racagni G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it cannot be ruled out that the DEX-mediated FGF-2 increase in vivo also takes place in neurons. In addition to FGF-2 the biosynthesis of other trophic factors such as neurotrophins is regulated in the brain and in cultured neurons and astrocytes by glucocorticoids (41Lindholm D. Castren E. Hengerer B. Zafra F. Berninger B. Thoenen H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Barbany G. Persson H. Eur. J.

For Schwann cells several physiological functions of steroids are proposed. In vitro studies showed that progesterone that is synthesized in Schwann cells increases the myelination of axons (66Koenig H.L. Schumacher M. Ferzaz B. Thi A.N.D. Ressouches A. Akwa Y. Baulieu E.-E. Science. 1995; 268: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids are potent co-mitogens for proliferation of Schwann cells of the postnatal rat (67Neuberger T.J. Kalimi O. Regelson W. Kalimi M. De Vries G.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 300-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to the FGF-2 protein shown in this study, the FGF-2 transcript is also found in immortalized and in clonal Schwann cells.2 Exogenously applied 18-kDa FGF-2 stimulates its own expression in immortalized Schwann cells2 but is not acting as a mitogen for isolated adult Schwann cells (68Zhang S.-M. Marsh R. Ratner N. Brackenbury R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Po, a myelin-specific protein, is regulated by exogenously administered 18-kDa FGF-2 (69Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Development. 1994; 120: 1399-1409PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the 21-kDa FGF-2 isoform which is increased after DEX treatment in immortalized Schwann cells mediates functions other than the 18-kDa form remains to be elucidated. An additional important result from this study is the specificity of the glucocorticoid effect. Although non-neuronal tissues such as adrenal cortex, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and L6 myoblasts express FGF-2 and possess glucocorticoid receptors (70Evans R.M. Arriza J.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1105-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the FGF-2 expression is not regulated after DEX treatment. In untreated and DEX-stimulated non-neuronal tissues (L6 myoblasts, adrenal cortex), the 21-kDa FGF-2 isoform displays a high expression. In chromaffin cells and Schwann cells the 21-kDa isoform is weakly expressed and increases dramatically after DEX treatment. This result could suggest that a stress- or damage-induced high glucocorticoid concentration increases FGF-2 in neuronal tissue. Further studies have to elucidate whether the 21-kDa FGF-2 isoform mediates an effect different from those mediated by the 18-kDa form. The regulation of the FGFR1 seems to be more complex since in vitro the transcript level remains unchanged in PC12 cells after DEX stimulation, whereas in vivo DEX induced a dramatic increase of the FGFR1 mRNA level both in the cortex and the medulla of the adrenal gland. Previous studies also suggested that several molecules are acting synergistically on the FGFR1 expression. Under serum-containing but not under serum-free culture conditions NGF induced an increase of the FGFR1 mRNA level in PC12 cells (20Meisinger C. Hertenstein A. Grothe C. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we show here that glucocorticoids enhance FGF-2 protein and mRNA in PC12 cells and in the adrenal medulla in vivo. This effect is specific for neuronal tissue. Moreover, the individual FGF-2 isoforms appear to be regulated independently. Exclusively the 21-kDa FGF-2 form is increased after DEX treatment. This may account for a specific function of the 21-kDa form in neuronal tissue. We thank Dr. A. Baird for kindly providing the FGF-2 cDNA and Dr. J. Milbrandt for the FGFR-1 cDNA. We also thank M. Schuckert and C. Micucci for excellent technical assistance and help in preparing the figures. We are very grateful to Dr. K. Wewetzer for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2055937049,"Abstract Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5) interacts with the 40 S initiation complex (40S·mRNA·MettRNAf·eIF-2·GTP) to promote the hydrolysis of bound GTP with the concomitant joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to the 40 S initiation complex to form a functional 80 S initiation complex. In this paper, the multiple mRNAs that encode mammalian eIF-5 have been characterized. In rat tissues, three major eIF-5 mRNAs of 3.5, 2.8, and 2.2 kilobases in length are detected. All major eIF-5 mRNAs are initiated from a single transcription initiation site, contain identical 5′-untranslated and coding regions, but differ from one another only in the length of their 3′-untranslated regions. The different lengths of the 3′-untranslated region of eIF-5 mRNAs are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation signals. Additionally, we demonstrate tissue-specific variations in eIF-5 mRNA expression as well as preference for polyadenylation sites. These results should lead to increased understanding of the regulation of eIF-5 gene expression."

DNA is replicated during bacteriophage T4 infection by a protein complex that is composed entirely of viral proteins. This “protein machine” serves as a universal model for the apparatus that catalyzes DNA replication (1Alberts B.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc.

The gene 43, 44, 62, and 45 proteins combine to form the DNA polymerase holoenzyme. Two molecules of this holoenzyme are required during replication, one on the leading strand and one on the lagging strand. The gene 43 protein is the DNA polymerase while the other three proteins are “accessory” proteins, forming an ATP-dependent sliding clamp that greatly increases the processivity of the polymerase (4Capson T.L.

Chem. 1981; 256: 4087-4094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene 32 protein binds in cooperative clusters to single-stranded DNA and is required for any replication of double-stranded DNA in the absence of a helicase (6Alberts B.M. Barry J. Bedinger P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the 41 protein unwinds the double helix ahead of the DNA polymerase on the leading strand, translocating in the 5′→3′ direction along the opposite strand (the lagging strand template). The 41 protein promotes DNA synthesis on the leading strand at a rate of ∼400 nucleotides/s in vitro (9Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), close to the rate observed in vivo (10Werner R. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The newest addition to the T4 in vitro DNA replication system, the gene 59 protein, greatly facilitates the loading of the 41 helicase onto 32 protein-covered single-stranded regions of the double-stranded DNA template (9Barry J.

The T4 gene 41 and 61 proteins together form the primosome. Although the 41 protein is required for the gene 61 DNA primase to recognize its priming sites efficiently (14Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7001-7010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is the primase alone that synthesizes the RNA primer (15Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 28Google Scholar). DNA helicases that are part of the primosome, including this one, have been shown to stay with a single replication fork for a substantial period before dissociating (20Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 275Google Scholar). However, in this report, we present the first quantitation of the processivity of a DNA helicase that is associated with a DNA replication fork, demonstrating that the 41 protein remains with the replication fork long enough to replicate the entire 169-kb 1The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase(s). T4 chromosome without dissociating. kilobase(s). Nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., human serum albumin from Worthington, and [α-32P]dCTP from Amersham Corp. The bacteriophage T4 gene 32, 41, 43, 44/62, 45, 59, and 61 proteins were purified to homogeneity as described elsewhere (9Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morris C.F. Hama-Innaba H. Mace D. Sinha N.K. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6787-6796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins were free of detectable nuclease activity. The 44/62 proteins were prepared from T4-infected cells, whereas the other proteins were the products of cloned T4 genes expressed on plasmids in Escherichia coli. The purified template DNA used for replication was circular double-stranded DNA, isolated after growing plasmid pJMC110 in E. coli (22Bedinger P. Hochstrasser M. Jongeneel C.V. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A specific DNA 3′ end, produced by treating plasmid DNA with bacteriophage fd gene 2 protein, serves as the primer to start strand-displacement DNA replication on a double-stranded circular DNA template (9Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bedinger P. Hochstrasser M. Jongeneel C.V. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Reactions contained assay buffer (33 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 66 mM potassium acetate, and 10 mM magnesium acetate), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml human serum albumin, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (0.3 mM each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, plus 0.08 mM [α-32P]dCTP at a specific activity of 1200 Ci/mol), and ribonucleoside triphosphates (1.25 mM ATP and 0.5 mM GTP). The DNA concentration before dilution was 0.8 µg/ml (0.26 nM plasmid). Unless otherwise noted, the 32 protein concentration was 40 µg/ml and the concentrations of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme components were: 3 µg/ml 43 protein, 16 µg/ml 44/62 proteins, and 10 µg/ml 45 protein. The gene 41, 59, and 61 proteins were used at the concentrations specified in each experiment. In reactions containing the 61 protein, 0.25 mM UTP and CTP were added. DNA synthesis was stopped by the addition of alkaline electrophoresis loading buffer to produce a final concentration of 8 mM NaOH, 20 mM Na3EDTA, 10% w/v sucrose, and 0.04% w/v bromcreosol green. The radioactive DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through alkaline agarose gels, as described elsewhere (23Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were soaked in two changes of 7% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min each to remove residual [α-32P]dCTP. The gels were dried under vacuum onto Whatman DE81 DEAE-cellulose paper and autoradiographed at −80°C using an intensifying screen. In addition, the dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager SF with ImageQuant software, IQ 3.3β C15 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The sizes of the radioactively labeled DNA strands were determined by comparison with 5′-end-labeled 32P standards (T7 DNA at 40 kb and restriction fragments of λ DNA of known size). Our experimental approach to assess the processivity of the 41 protein relies on establishing a moving replication fork in vitro and then diluting the mixture enough to prevent all further 41 protein associations with the DNA. Double-stranded DNA, nicked at a unique sequence by the bacteriophage fd gene 2 protein (22Bedinger P. Hochstrasser M. Jongeneel C.V. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1983; 34: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), served as both the primer and template for this DNA replication reaction. Synthesis begins at the 3′ OH side of the nick. Initially, a double-stranded rolling circle with a 5′ single-stranded tail is produced by the polymerase holoenzyme in a relatively slow strand-displacement reaction requiring the 32 protein. The 5′ single-stranded tail then provides a “loading zone” onto which the 59 protein assembles the 41 helicase (9Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a brief period of DNA synthesis in the presence of all of these proteins, the samples are diluted 10-fold into solutions that maintain the original protein and reagent concentrations, except for DNA and the 41 and 59 proteins. Before dilution, the 59 protein very rapidly loads the 41 helicase onto the DNA template, whereas after dilution no more loading occurs. Therefore, by observing the course of DNA synthesis after dilution, we could determine the degree of 41 protein processivity at the replication fork (how long it stays on the DNA without dissociating). In our initial experiments, rolling circle DNA replication was performed in the absence of primase (61 protein), so that only leading strand DNA synthesis occurred (Fig. 1A). The template was first incubated with the DNA polymerase holoenzyme and 32 protein for 1 min, and the slowly elongating leading strand was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. This pulse labeling of DNA was terminated by the addition of excess dCTP at the same time that the 41 and 59 proteins were added to begin rapid leading strand synthesis. The rate of replication fork movement was then determined by measuring the increase in the length of the pulse-labeled DNA products with time, using a denaturing agarose gel. Without the 41 and 59 proteins, replication forks produced DNA on the leading strand at a rate of about 10 nucleotides/s (Fig. 1B, lanes A-C). When the 41 and 59 proteins were present at 5 and 0.3 µg/ml, respectively, the rate of the DNA replication fork increased 40-fold to 380 nucleotides/s (Fig. 1B, lanes D-F). This rapid rate of replication was not decreased by a dilution of the 41 and 59 proteins; it even increased slightly to 430 nucleotides/s (Fig. 1B, lanes G-I). The percentage of replication forks that contained a helicase could be determined by comparing the amount of radioactivity in the fast-moving band (representing forks with helicase) with the total amount of radioactivity in each lane. As shown in Fig. 1C, the percentage of replication forks that contained a helicase after dilution of the 41 and 59 proteins remained constant throughout the 75-s incubation. This result was expected, inasmuch as controls show that none of the slow-moving replication forks can acquire a DNA helicase at the diluted concentration of the 41 and 59 proteins (0.5 and 0.03 µg/ml, respectively; Fig. 1B, lanes J-L). We conclude that, once loaded, a 41 protein molecule can function for at least 75 s at a single replication fork without dissociating. To determine the half-life of the gene 41 helicase at a complete replication fork, we performed a rolling circle replication reaction in which the primase (61 protein) was included, resulting in both leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. In addition, we needed a way to measure 41 protein association for much longer times after dilution. Since dilution of the 41 and 59 proteins does not decrease the rate of movement of replication forks with a helicase (see Fig. 1), any change in the rate of dCTP incorporation into the leading strand after dilution of these two proteins can be attributed to a slowing of forks due to helicase dissociation. An experiment like that in Fig. 1 was therefore performed, except that after the 10-fold dilution, the dCTP incorporation was measured between 2 and 16 min of incubation. When products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a denaturing agarose gel, the very long leading strand products (>40 kb) migrated through the gel as a sharp band and were easily separated from any lagging strand products (data not shown). The total amount of [α-32P]dCTP incorporated into the leading strand at each time point was quantitated and used to determine the effect of 41 and 59 protein dilution. As shown in Fig. 2A, without dilution of these proteins (•), the rate of dCTP incorporation was linear for 16 min, revealing that there was no measurable decrease in the number of replication forks with helicase. However, after a 10-fold 41 and 59 protein dilution (Fig. 2, panels A and B; □) there was a small but detectable decrease in the rate of dCTP incorporation throughout the 16 min time course. This indicated a very slow decrease in the number of functional replication forks due to a loss of helicase. The rate of fork loss obeyed the first-order rate law: d[F]dt=−k[F](Eq. 1) [F]=[F]0e−kt(Eq. 2) where k = rate constant, t = time after dilution, F = number of forks at a given time. F0 = initial number of forks at t = 0. If y = total dCTP incorporated into DNA, then y=∫0t[F]⋅Rdt(Eq. 3) where R = rate of fork. After substituting [F]0e−kt for [F], integrating, and assuming that at t = 0, y = 0, we find that y=F0Rk(1−e−kt)(Eq. 4) The equation of the best fit line shown in Fig. 2B fit the following equation: y=3.09(1−e−0.063t)(Eq. 5) As time t becomes very large, y approaches a maximum incorporation of 3.09 pmol. To find the half-life, we solved the equation for t when y = one half of 3.09 pmol, revealing a half-time for 41 protein association of 11 min at 37°C. We wanted to prove directly that, once loaded, the helicase-led replication fork is processive enough to replicate the length of the T4 genome (169 kb). We performed a DNA replication reaction in which the 41 and 59 proteins were diluted 10-fold, stopped after 8 min, and the samples then immediately spread for electron microscopy. Although these very long DNA products were tangled and prone to breakage, 20% of the molecules had 5′ double-stranded tails in the range of 165-197 kb (data not shown). Although the 59 protein has no measurable effect on the rate of replication fork movement once the 41 protein has become engaged (9Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 59 protein could remain associated with the DNA replication fork and affect its processivity. To test this possibility, we raised the 41 protein concentration in our assays to levels that allow some loading of this helicase onto DNA in the absence of the 59 protein. Under these conditions, we were able to load the 41 protein onto only ∼10% of the 5′-tailed templates (Fig. 3, lanes G-I), in contrast to the >80% of templates that obtain a 41 protein molecule when 59 protein is present (Fig. 3, lanes D-F). However, when such a DNA replication reaction with 41 protein and no 59 protein was diluted 10-fold, those helicase-driven replication forks present were as processive as those in the undiluted control reaction (Fig. 3, compare lanes M-O with lanes G-I). These replication forks also move as rapidly and processively as forks formed in the presence of 59 protein (Fig. 3, compare lanes D-F with lanes M-O). We conclude that, as far as can be determined from a 75-s incubation, the 59 protein is not required for the high processivity of the 41 helicase at the replication fork. In this report we measured the degree of processivity of the 41 protein DNA helicase during DNA replication by diluting this protein after establishing a moving replication fork. We have shown that, at a rate of ∼400 nucleotides/s and a half-life of 11 min, the 41 protein is processive enough to participate in replicating the entire 169-kb T4 genome without dissociating. In addition, the 59 protein is not needed for the high processivity of the 41 protein. We cannot rule out the possibility that the 59 protein travels with the replication fork, but it seems likely that the most important role for this protein is in the initiation phase of DNA replication, when the protein machine is first being assembled. DNA helicases that are associated with the replication fork have been found to be processive in other replication systems as well. Richardson and co-workers found that the bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein, the single polypeptide that is both the helicase and primase in the T7 system, is resistant to dilution in vitro and therefore highly processive (24Debyser Z.

Chem. 1988; 267: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In E. coli, the replicative helicase is DnaB. Both DnaB and DnaG (primase) are needed to make the primers utilized for Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand template (20Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 275Google Scholar). Marians and co-workers found that limiting concentrations of DnaB did not affect the size of Okazaki fragments, yet limiting the primase increased their size, indicating that the helicase functions processively but the primase does not (26Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Is the 41 protein stabilized by other proteins in the replication machinery? The extent of processivity of the 41 helicase alone translocating along naked single-stranded DNA or 32 protein-covered single-stranded DNA is under debate. A half-life of 1 min was reported by Liu and Alberts, with an estimated translocation rate of 400 nucleotides/s (27Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2813-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Young et al. (28Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) reported an average distance translocated per 41 protein binding event of only 60-700 nucleotides. No matter which assessment is correct, the half-life we measure for the 41 helicase of 11 min when it is part of the replication fork is considerably longer than the half-life of the 41 protein on single-stranded DNA. One explanation for the increase in half-life is that the components of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme stabilize the helicase. There is evidence for protein-protein interactions between the polymerase accessory proteins (44/62 and 45 proteins) and the 41 protein. Richardson and Nossal found that the polymerase accessory proteins partially relieved the 32 protein-induced inhibition of primosome-catalyzed pentaribonucleotide synthesis on a single-stranded DNA template (29Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4725-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since both the 41 and 61 proteins are needed to synthesize pentaribonucleotides, they reasoned that the accessory proteins were able to load the 41 helicase onto 32-covered single-stranded DNA, albeit not as efficiently as the 59 protein. In addition, they found that a proteolytic fragment of the 41 protein that is missing the C terminus was unable to interact with the accessory proteins (30Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4732-4739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of this fragment were normal on DNA in the absence of 32 protein. Barry and Alberts (9Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported supporting results: the 44/62 and 45 proteins increased the 41 protein single-stranded DNA-dependent GTPase activity 4-fold over the activity of 41 protein alone on 32 protein-covered single-stranded DNA. In addition to interacting with the 44/62 and 45 proteins, the 41 helicase may also interact with the DNA polymerase (43 protein). Spacciapoli and Nossal found that a mutant form of 43 protein (A737V) had an absolute requirement for the 59 protein to maintain replication forks with a helicase (13Spacciapoli P. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 447-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They suggested that a domain in the polymerase interacts with the helicase; if this domain is not functional, then the helicase requires the 59 protein for continuous reloading or for stabilization. In addition, there is ample evidence that two 43 protein molecules are present at the replication fork (2Nossal N.G. Karam J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43Google Scholar). The simplest model of the replication fork would include a 43 protein dimer. However, sedimentation equilibrium analysis unambiguously shows that the 43 protein exists as a monomer in solution under the conditions used in our in vitro replication experiments. 2R. D. Schrock and B. Alberts, unpublished data. This suggests the 43 protein must interact with DNA and/or other components of the DNA replication machine to hold the two 43 protein molecules at the replication fork. The interactions of the 41 protein with other replication proteins, together with the increased half-life of the helicase on DNA as part of the replication complex, point to the helicase as a central protein around which the other proteins assemble. The highly processive nature of the 41 helicase makes it a prime candidate for the cornerstone of the replication machinery, perhaps providing a physical link between the two polymerase molecules at the replication fork.

https://openalex.org/W2098354179,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced in mammalian cells in a variety of pathophysiological states and have an important role in cytoprotection in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we report that the calcium ionophore A23187, a glucose-regulated protein (GRP) inducer, dramatically inhibits HSP70 synthesis and HSP70 mRNA transcription after induction by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or prostaglandin A1 treatment in human K562 cells. A23187 does not suppress, and it actually prolongs, the DNA-binding activity of the human heat shock transcription factor (HSF), while it alters HSF1 phosphorylation in heat shock-treated cells. To inhibit HSP70 expression, A23187 needs to be present during heat shock, while treatment before or after heat shock does not affect HSP70 mRNA transcription. The GRP inducer thapsigargin, which specifically inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, has no effect on heat-induced HSP70 synthesis, indicating that A23187 inhibitory activity is not due to depletion of intracellular calcium stores and is independent of the concomitant induction of GRP genes. Inhibition of HSP70 expression is correlated with alterations in HSF1 phosphorylation in heat-shocked cells, but not in sodium arsenite-treated cells, indicating that different mechanisms may be involved in mediating A23187 inhibitory activity.

Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells exposed to temperatures a few degrees above the physiological level exhibit a finely regulated and highly conserved cellular response by inducing the synthesis of a specific set of proteins referred to as heat shock proteins (HSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPsheat shock proteinsHSFheat shock transcription factorHSEheat shock elementGRPglucose-regulated proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGAPDHglyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPGA1prostaglandin A1. (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, several HSPs are expressed during normal growth conditions and can be induced by biologically active molecules like hemin (2Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and prostaglandins (3Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shyy T.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C1-C17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glucose deprivation (5Pouyssegur J. Shiu R.P.C. Pastan I.

Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the presence of transition metal ions, sulfhydryl reagents, or amino acid analogs (1Lindquist S. Craig E.A.

Induction requires the activation and translocation to the nucleus of a transregulatory protein, the heat shock transcription factor (HSF), which binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoters of heat shock genes (9Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast cells, HSF is constitutively bound to DNA and undergoes stress-dependent phosphorylation associated with transcriptional competence. On the other hand, in vertebrate cells, HSF exists as an inactive non-DNA-binding form, which is rapidly converted to the DNA-binding form upon heat shock or other environmental stresses (9Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several HSFs have been identified in mammalian cells (9Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), which is the primary component of the HSF DNA-binding activity present in cells exposed to heat shock, requires oligomerization, acquisition of DNA-binding activity, and localization to the nucleus (9Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSF1 has also been shown to be phosphorylated upon heat stress in different types of cells (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

The molecular mechanisms responsible for signal transduction that leads to HSF activation and phosphorylation in heat-shocked cells have not been completely elucidated. It has been suggested that a calcium-dependent metabolic process is involved in the generation of the heat shock signal, and calcium has been shown to activate HSF DNA-binding activity in vitro (11Mosser D.D.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Increased Ca2+ mobilization has also been recently shown to be an early event in the signal transduction pathway mediating the activation of HSP70 gene expression by prostaglandin A2 (14Choi A.M.K. Tucker R.W. Carlson S.G. Wiegand G. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The calcium ionophore A23187, which is known to permeabilize the plasma membrane and to induce the leakage of Ca2+, has been shown to increase the expression level of the αB -crystallin in chondrocytes (15Bennardini F. Juliano C. Benetti D. Mian M. Chiesi M. Mattana A. Franconi F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and is known to induce the expression of a set of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) genes, but not HSP70, through the depletion of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (16Drummond I.A.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the effect of A23187 treatment on HSP70 gene expression and HSF activation by heat shock and other inducers in K562 human erythroleukemia cells. We demonstrate that the calcium ionophore dramatically inhibits HSP70 gene expression in heat-shocked cells as well as after treatment with sodium arsenite or prostaglandin A1. The calcium ionophore does not suppress HSF DNA-binding activity induced by either heat shock or the other inducers, while it inhibits the formation of the phosphorylated high molecular mass form of HSF1 in heat shock-treated cells. In the presence of A23187, HSF remains in an activated DNA-binding state for a longer period than in the heat shock-treated control. K562 human erythroleukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For heat shock treatment, flasks were submersed in a temperature-controlled water bath (Grant Instruments Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) at 45 ± 0.01°C for 20 min (immersion depth, 4 cm; t1/2 = 1.5 min). The A23187 calcium ionophore (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol as a 1 mM stock solution and stored at −20°C. Control medium contained the same concentration of ethanol diluent. Prostaglandin A1 (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (10 mg/ml) and diluted to the appropriate concentration in culture medium immediately before use. Sodium meta-arsenite and thapsigargin were obtained from Sigma. K562 cells were labeled with L-[35S]methionine (5 µCi/106 cells) as described previously (3Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After cell lysis, the radioactivity incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was determined, and samples containing the same amount of radioactivity were separated by SDS-PAGE in a vertical slab gel apparatus (3% stacking gel, 10% resolving gel) and processed for autoradiography and densitometric analysis as described (3Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein for each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% resolving gel) and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Alternatively, whole cell extracts (50 µg/sample), prepared as described (20Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), were resuspended in 25 µl of reaction mixture containing 2.5 µl of 10 × phosphatase buffer (500 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.0), 10 mM MgCl2), and 12 units of calf intestinal phosphatase in the presence or absence of the phosphatase inhibitor NaH2PO4 (10 mM) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by adding 25 µl of 2-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and samples were heated at 100°C for 5 min. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (8% resolving gel) and blotted onto nitrocellulose as described (3Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The filters were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against HSF1 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Morimoto, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL), and the bound antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies as described previously (3Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated following the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar), fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred to nylon membranes as described previously (19Elia G. Santoro M.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes, prepared by random-primed DNA synthesis of the human HSP70 gene (plasmid pH2.3) (19Elia G. Santoro M.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After stripping, filters were rehybridized with a 32P-labeled probe derived from a cDNA fragment (1400 base pairs; PstI) of the rat glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene as a loading control. Whole cell extracts (107 K562 cells) were prepared, and binding reactions were performed using a specific heat shock element oligonucleotide as described (20Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts (10 µg/sample) were mixed with 0.1 ng of a 32P-labeled HSE oligonucleotide and 0.5 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 25 µl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, HSF·HSE complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (20Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the amount of shifted HSE probe was quantified by Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager analysis. For in vitro HSF DNA binding inhibition experiments, extracts from 107 K562 cells, either kept at 37°C or heat-shocked at 45°C for 20 min and then allowed to recover for 1 h at 37°C, were added to the binding reaction mixture pretreated for 15 min at room temperature with 5, 10, or 20 µM A23187 or the corresponding amount of ethanol diluent. After an additional 30-min incubation at room temperature, HSF·HSE complexes were detected as described above. In vitro run-on transcription reactions were performed in isolated K562 nuclei as described (21Banerji S.S. Theodorakis N.T. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2437-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled RNA was used for hybridization with nitrocellulose filters containing plasmids for the HSP90 (pUCHS801; StressGen Biotechnologies Co., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), HSP70 (pH2.3) (22Wu B. Hunt C. Morimoto R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), HSC70 (pHA7.6) (20Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), GRP78/BiP (pHG23.1) (20Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), or the GAPDH gene as a control. Following hybridization, filters were visualized by autoradiography, and the radioactivity was quantitated by a PhosphorImager. To investigate the effect of the A23187 calcium ionophore on HSP70 synthesis and mRNA accumulation, K562 cells were treated with A23187 (5 µM) or ethanol diluent and either kept at 37°C or heat-shocked at 45°C for 20 min. A23187 was kept during the recovery period at 37°C. At different times (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h) after heat shock, aliquots of cells (107 cells) were collected from each culture, and total RNA was extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The same amount of RNA was fractionated on agarose gels, blotted onto nylon filters, and hybridized to 32P-labeled probes for human HSP70 mRNA and rat GAPDH mRNA as a control. Fig. 1A shows that in heat-shocked K562 cells, HSP70 mRNA starts accumulating 30 min after heat treatment, reaching a maximum at 4 h of the recovery period at 37°C. HSP70 mRNA levels were found to be dramatically decreased in heat-shocked K562 cells treated with A23187, while no difference in GAPDH transcript accumulation was found. In a parallel experiment, immediately after heat shock in the presence of 5 µM A23187 or ethanol diluent, the culture medium was replaced with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum and A23187 or control diluent. After 15 min, L-[35S]methionine (5 µCi/106 cells) was added, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C for the following 6 h. While it moderately affected protein synthesis in unstressed K562 cells, A23187 was found to further decrease heat shock-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis in these cells. Samples containing an equal amount of radioactivity were processed for SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and synthesis of HSP70 was determined by densitometric analysis as described (19Elia G. Santoro M.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As expected, A23187 treatment induced GRP78 synthesis in unstressed K562 cells (Fig. 1B). In heat-shocked K562 cells, accordingly to the decrease in the HSP70 mRNA level shown above, A23187 was found to dramatically suppress heat shock-induced HSP70 synthesis (Fig. 1, B and C). To investigate whether treatment with the calcium ionophore affected HSF activation and HSP70 mRNA transcription, K562 cells, treated with A23187 or control diluent, were either kept at 37°C or subjected to heat shock (45°C, 20 min), and at different times during the recovery period at 37°C, aliquots of cells were collected for determination of HSF DNA-binding activity by EMSA. In the same experiment, the transcription rate of the HSP70 gene as well as of the HSC70, HSP90, GRP78, and GAPDH genes was analyzed by run-on assay. Under the conditions examined, HSF·HSE complex formation was detected as early as 20 min after heat shock, continued for at least 1 h, and declined 3 h after the return to the physiological temperature (Fig. 2A). A23187 did not induce HSF DNA-binding activity in the absence of heat shock (data not shown). In heat shock-treated cells, treatment with A23187 did not alter either the kinetics or the extent of HSF·HSE complex formation up to 60 min after heat treatment, while it appeared to maintain HSF in an activated DNA-binding state up to 3 h after heat shock (Fig. 2A). The transcription rates of the HSP90, HSP70, HSC70, and GRP78 genes in isolated nuclei from heat-shocked untreated or A23187-treated cells are shown in Fig. 2B. Heat shock rapidly induced the transcription of all heat shock genes tested and, to a lesser extent, also induced GRP78 gene transcription. A23187 treatment was found to suppress HSP90, HSC70, and HSP70 gene transcription, while it enhanced the GRP78 gene transcription rate as expected (Fig. 2, B and C). In A23187-treated cells, HSP70 gene transcription was inhibited by ∼50% at 20 min after heat shock and by 90% after 30 min at 37°C (Fig. 2C). In the same experiment, the level of HSP70 mRNA accumulation was dramatically decreased in A23187-treated cells as determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2D). To determine whether A23187 treatment could be affecting HSF1 phosphorylation, K562 cells, treated with A23187 or control diluent, were either kept at 37°C or subjected to heat shock (45°C, 20 min), and at different times during the recovery period at 37°C, aliquots of cells were collected for determination of HSF DNA-binding activity by EMSA or for Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-HSF1 antibodies. As described above, HSF·HSE complex formation was detected 20 min after heat shock and declined 3 h after the return to 37°C (Fig. 3A). As previously shown in different cell lines (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), HSF DNA-binding activity in heat shock-treated K562 cells was associated with a significant increase (∼12 kDa) in HSF1 molecular mass as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). A unique band of HSF1 of ∼78 kDa was detected in unstressed K562 cells. Immediately after the 20-min heat shock, HSF1 consisted of two closely sized proteins (82 and 86 kDa); a third form of HSF1 with a slightly higher molecular mass (∼90 kDa) was found from 30 to 60 min after heat shock. Three hours after the return to the physiological temperature, no difference in the molecular mass of HSF1 in unstressed and heat shock-treated K562 cells was found, concomitant with the loss of HSF DNA-binding activity. The increase in HSF1 molecular mass has been previously shown to be the result of HSF1 phosphorylation during activation (10Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the increase in HSF1 molecular mass in heat-shocked K562 cells was due to HSF1 phosphorylation, K562 cells were either kept at 37°C or subjected to heat shock (45°C, 20 min) and allowed to recover at 37°C for 1 h. Whole cell extracts were then treated with calf intestinal phosphatase for 1 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of the phosphatase inhibitor NaH2PO4. In the absence of calf intestinal phosphatase, the high molecular mass form (90 kDa) of HSF1 was detected in heat-shocked cells. Fig. 3E shows that when cell lysates were treated with phosphatase, the 90-kDa HSF1 band almost completely disappeared, while the 78-kDa band could be detected. The addition of the calf intestinal phosphatase inhibitor NaH2PO4 to the reaction mixture prevented the decrease in HSF1 molecular mass, indicating that the high molecular mass band represents a phosphorylated form of HSF1 in K562 cells. As shown above, A23187 did not alter the extent of HSF·HSE complex formation, while it maintained HSF in an activated DNA-binding state up to 3 h after heat shock (Fig. 3, A and C). A23187 treatment had no effect on the heat-induced modification of HSF1 at 20 min after heat shock (time 0), while the third form of HSF1 with a higher molecular mass was not detected in the presence of A23187 between 30 and 60 min after heat exposure, suggesting that HSF1 phosphorylation is a multistep process and that A23187 could be selectively affecting some of these events. A23187 treatment also appears to moderately decrease the amount of HSF1, starting at 60 min after the return to the physiological temperature (Fig. 3B). Similar results were recently shown by Nagai et al. (23Nagai N. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in HeLa cells after treatment with the flavonoid quercetin, which was also found to inhibit HSF1 phosphorylation and to decrease the amount of HSF1. The decrease in the HSF1 level is unlikely to be related to the A23187-induced inhibition of protein synthesis since cycloheximide treatment was found not to significantly reduce the amount of HSF1 for up to 12 h (23Nagai N. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It was suggested that inhibition of HSF1 phosphorylation could lead to a more rapid HSF1 degradation in heat-shocked cells (23Nagai N. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that, different from the control, the molecular mass of the two forms of HSF1 appeared to be constant in the presence of A23187 up to 3 h after heat shock (Fig. 3B). This was associated with the maintenance of the HSF DNA-binding state. The addition of A23187 (5–20 µM) in vitro during the EMSA binding assay had no effect on heat shock-induced HSF activation (Fig. 3D). To determine whether the effect of A23187 on HSF activation and HSP70 mRNA accumulation was reversed upon removal of the drug or was due to irreversible cell damage, K562 cells were treated with A23187 (5 µM) or ethanol diluent for 30 min. After repeated washings to remove the calcium ionophore, cells were exposed to a temperature of 45°C for 20 min. In the same experiment, cells that had not been pretreated with A23187 were exposed to the calcium ionophore either during the 20-min heat shock or during both the heat shock and the recovery period at 37°C. At 1 h after the return to the physiological temperature, aliquots of cells were collected for determination of HSF DNA-binding activity and Western blot analysis using the HSF1 antiserum. HSP70 mRNA levels were also determined in the same samples, collected 3 h after heat shock. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of K562 cells with 5 µM A23187 before heat shock had no effect on HSP70 mRNA accumulation, HSF DNA-binding activity, or the heat-induced modification of HSF1 protein, indicating that the effects described above are not due to generalized irreversible cell damage caused by the calcium ionophore. As described above, treatment with A23187 during and after heat shock did not alter HSF DNA-binding activity, while it decreased the level of HSP70 mRNA accumulation at 3 h after heat shock treatment. Similar dramatic effects were obtained when K562 cells were treated with A23187 only during the 20-min heat shock (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 4), indicating that A23187 affects an early event in the signaling pathway for HSP70 induction and that the presence of the calcium ionophore during the recovery period at 37°C is not necessary in order to achieve maximal inhibition of HSP70 expression. Treatment with A23187 only during or during and after heat shock resulted in an alteration in the electrophoretic mobility of the HSF1 stress-induced form. In fact, in the absence of A23187 treatment or in cells that had been treated with A23187 before heat shock, a highly phosphorylated form of HSF1 with a molecular mass of ∼90 kDa was detected (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, in cells that had been treated with A23187 during or during and after heat shock, HSF1 consisted of two closely sized proteins (82 and 86 kDa), again indicating that HSF1 is not fully phosphorylated in the presence of the calcium ionophore (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). Finally, treatment with A23187 only after heat shock had no effect on HSP70 mRNA accumulation up to 3 h after heat treatment (data not shown). Synthesis of HSP70 can be induced by a variety of molecules, including sodium arsenite (7Levinson W. Opperman H. Jackson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 606: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), amino acid analogs (8Hightower L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 102: 402-427Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), hemin (2Sistonen L. Sarge K.D. Phillips B. Abravaya K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4104-4111Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and cyclopentenone prostaglandins (3Santoro M.G. Garaci E. Amici C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8407-8411Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Amici C. Sistonen L. Santoro M.G. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6227-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of HSP70 gene expression by A23187 is limited to induction during heat shock or could be obtained also at 37°C, the ability of A23187 to interfere with HSP70 gene expression was tested in K562 cells treated with prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) or sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO2). Soon after the addition of 5 µM A23187 or ethanol diluent, K562 cells were treated with PGA1 (6 µg/ml), NaAsO2 (2 × 10−5M), or control diluent. Three hours after treatment with PGA1 or NaAsO2, aliquots of cells were collected for determination of HSF DNA-binding activity and HSP70 mRNA accumulation. Fig. 5 shows that both PGA1 and sodium arsenite treatment induced HSF DNA-binding activity in K562 cells. Levels of HSP70 mRNA were increased severalfold in PGA1- and NaAsO2-treated cells as compared with control cells 3 h after treatment, while no difference in GAPDH levels was found. A23187 treatment dramatically reduced the levels of HSP70 mRNA in both PGA1- and NaAsO2-treated cells (Fig. 5B), while, as previously shown for heat-shocked cells, it did not affect HSF DNA-binding activity (Fig. 5A). The kinetics of HSF activation was then studied in K562 cells treated with NaAsO2 in the presence or absence of the calcium ionophore. HSF DNA-binding activity was detected by 60 min and was unmodified up to 3 h after the beginning of NaAsO2 treatment (Fig. 6A). Western blot analysis of the same samples showed the presence of a unique band of ∼78 kDa in unstressed K562 cells. The presence of higher molecular mass forms of HSF1 (∼82, 88, and 90 kDa) was detected at 1, 2, and 3 h after the beginning of NaAsO2 treatment, respectively. A23187 did not affect HSF DNA-binding activity and did not appear to affect HSF1 phosphorylation in this case. Only a modest change (∼88 kDa, as compared with 90 kDa in the control) in the molecular mass of the stress-induced form of HSF1 was detected in the presence of the calcium ionophore at 3 h after treatment (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the reduced HSP70 mRNA accumulation in A23187-treated cells could be a consequence of an increased turnover of the HSP70 mRNA, K562 cells were treated with NaAsO2 or control diluent in the presence or absence of A23187. The heat shock genes were allowed to transcribe for 3 h after NaAsO2 addition. At this time, the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (10 µg/ml) was added to the cultures, and the total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted at different times and processed for Northern blot analysis. As expected, levels of HSP70 mRNA at 3 h after NaAsO2 addition were much lower in A23187-treated cells compared with untreated"

DNA between −320 and +72 base pairs (bp) is DNase I-hypersensitive in hepatic nuclei from fed but not starved chicks (Ma, X. J., and Goodridge, A. G. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 4997-5002). A polypyrimidine/polypurine (PPY/PPU) tract lies within the DNase I-hypersensitive region. In hepatocytes transiently transfected with plasmids containing triiodothyronine response elements and a minimal promoter from the malic enzyme gene linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, deletion of the PPY/PPU tract inhibited chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity by about 90% with or without triiodothyronine. Fine mapping of S1 nuclease-sensitive sites suggests that the PPY/PPU tract can assume different isoforms of non-B-DNA, some of which may be triplex structures. The PPY/PPU tract contains specific binding sites for single- and double-stranded DNA binding proteins and, with 8 bp 3′ of the tract, can function as a promoter. A (CT)7 repeat binds single-stranded DNA-binding protein and is essential for promoter activity. Two C-rich elements bind single-stranded DNA-binding proteins and may mediate inhibition of promoter function. The single- and double-stranded DNA-binding proteins that interact with the PPY/PPU tract may regulate transcription of the malic enzyme gene. Starvation inhibits and refeeding stimulates transcription of the malic enzyme gene in chick liver. DNA between −320 and +72 base pairs (bp) is DNase I-hypersensitive in hepatic nuclei from fed but not starved chicks (Ma, X. J., and Goodridge, A. G. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 4997-5002).

Two C-rich elements bind single-stranded DNA-binding proteins and may mediate inhibition of promoter function. The single- and double-stranded DNA-binding proteins that interact with the PPY/PPU tract may regulate transcription of the malic enzyme gene. Transcription of eukaryotic genes is regulated by the interactions of specific DNA sequence elements, their cognate transcription factors, and the general transcription machinery. Genes that encode proteins have two types of DNA elements (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 2Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 3Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). One element involves DNA sequences that are specific to certain genes. Binding of transcription factors to these elements and the subsequent interaction of those factors with other parts of transcription machinery regulate gene expression tissue-specifically and in response to exogenous agents such as hormones. The other sequences are promoter elements common to most genes; they provide a site for assembly of the transcription initiation complex, identify the start site for transcription, and endow the gene with a basal rate of expression. The most common type of promoter in genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II contains TATA-box elements. In promoters with TATA-boxes, binding of the general transcription factor TFIID to the TATA-box represents the first step in transcription initiation. There is, however, a growing number of promoters that lack TATA-box elements (4Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mavrothalassitis G.J. Watson D.K. Papas T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These promoters are usually GC-rich, have multiple transcription start sites, and use initiator sequences to identify where the initiation complex should bind and initiate transcription. How transcription is initiated and regulated on promoters that lack TATA-boxes is not clear. Regulation of promoter activity likely involves changes in conformation of the trans-acting proteins when they bind to their specific sequence elements and/or when a ligand, such as a hormone or another protein, binds to a DNA-bound factor. Binding of a trans-acting protein to its specific sequence elements also may cause the DNA to undergo changes in conformation (8Van Holde K. Zlatanova J. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein-induced changes in the secondary structure of promoter DNA may regulate transcription. For example, binding of protein to DNA may stimulate or stabilize the formation of a functionally significant non-B-DNA structure. Alternatively, productive binding of a regulatory protein to DNA may require prior formation of a particular non-B-DNA structure. One of the earliest reports to suggest a role for non-B-DNA in gene regulation showed that in actively transcribed chicken globin genes, DNA in the chromatin of the promoter region was sensitive to S1 nuclease treatment (9Larsen A. Weintraub H. Cell. 1982; 29: 609-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Active transcription was correlated with the formation of an unusual DNA structure with a single-stranded region. One of the non-B-DNA structures that has drawn a great deal of attention in the last 10 years is the triple helix (10Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 11Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). DNA triplexes are formed by polypyrimidine/polypurine (PPY/PPU) 1The abbreviations used are: PPY/PPUpolypyrimidine/polypurinebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTKthymidine kinaseDTTdithiothreitol. sequences. In this structure, a DNA strand (donor strand) from one half of the sequence folds into the major groove of the other half-duplex, forming Hoogsteen base pairs and leaving the other strand in a single-stranded state. A triplex can be either H-DNA if the pyrimidine strand is the donor, or H*-DNA if the purine strand is the donor. A number of different triplex isoforms may form along a long PPY/PPU sequence (12Kohwi Y. Kohwi-shigematsu T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1090-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Formation of specific isoforms, or stabilization of those structures once formed, may contribute to the regulation of transcription (13Morgan A.R. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 3: 83-87Google Scholar). polypyrimidine/polypurine base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase dithiothreitol. There are several reasons to believe that PPY/PPU tracts may have important functional roles. On a statistical basis, PPY/PPU sequences are overrepresented in eukaryotic genomes (14Birnboim H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 541-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Behe M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7870-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Manor H. Rao B.S. Martin R.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Second, triplex-forming PPY/PPU sequences have been discovered in the promoters of several genes that lack TATA-boxes; the protooncogenes hEGFR, c-ets-2, and c-Ki-ras are examples (6Mavrothalassitis G.J. Watson D.K. Papas T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Johnson A.C. Jinno Y. Merlino G. Mol. Cell.

A. 1990; 87: 2705-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PPY/PPU sequences from these promoters decreases their promoter activities in transient transfection assays. Third, when the triplex-forming sequence of the c-myc gene is connected to a heterologous promoter, it enhances expression of a linked reporter gene. In a series of mutant PPY/PPU sequences, the degree of transcription enhancement correlated with ability of the sequence to adopt triplex structure (19Firulli A.B. Maibenco D.C. Kinniburgh A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, naturally occurring point mutations in the triplex-forming sequence of the promoter of human γ-globin gene cause abnormalities in regulation of transcription of the genes of the hemoglobin locus (20Ulrich M.J. Gray W.J. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18649-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bacolla A. Ulrich M.J. Larson J.E. Ley T.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24556-24563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Point mutations that decrease the potential of the sequence to form triplex cause persistent expression of γ-globin in adults. Despite the evidence cited above, the involvement of these unusual DNA structures in regulation of gene expression remains controversial. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which triplexes and related structures might regulate function remain unclear. Malic enzyme (L-malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating), EC) catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate and CO2. At the same time, it generates NADPH, much of which is used for synthesis of fatty acids. Transcription of the malic enzyme gene in liver is regulated by nutritional state and endocrine status in vivo and by insulin, glucagon, triiodothyronine (T3), glucocorticoids, and unesterified fatty acids in hepatocytes in culture (22Goodridge A.G. Klautky S.A. Fantozzi D.A. Baillie R.A. Hodnett D.W. Chen W. Thurmond D.C. Xu G. Roncero C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 52: 89-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transition from a low transcription rate in the starved state to a 40-fold higher transcription rate in the refed state is accompanied by a profound change in chromatin structure in the region from −320 to +72 bp, hypersensitive to DNase I and certain restriction enzymes in livers from fed chicks and resistant in starved ones. The maximum increase in DNase I hypersensitivity occurs within 6 h, the same time required for the transcription rate to reach its highest level. Sensitivity to DNase I and transcription rate are rapidly and simultaneously decreased when food is removed from fed chicks (23Ma X.-J. Goodridge A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Ma X.-J. Salati L.M. Ash S.E. Mitchell D.A. Klautky S.A. Fantozzi D.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18435-18441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region (5.8 kb) of the chicken malic enzyme gene has been cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of 4.4 kb has been determined. 2D. W. Hodnett, D. A. Fantozzi, D. C. Thurmond, S. A. Klautky, K. G. MacPhee, S. T. Estrem, G. Xu, and A. G. Goodridge, submitted for publication. The promoter of the malic enzyme gene is GC-rich, does not contain a TATA-box, and has multiple transcription start sites. Like many promoters that lack a TATA-box (11Mirkin S.M. Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 541-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), the promoter of the malic enzyme gene contains a PPY/PPU tract; it is located between −134 and −86 bp. This PPY/PPU tract is S1 nuclease-sensitive in the supercoiled state (25Ma, X.-J., (1991) Nutritional Status Regulates Transcription and Chromatin Structure of the Chicken Malic Enzyme Gene. Ph.D thesis, University of Iowa.Google Scholar) and is a potential candidate for involvement in the nutritional regulation of chromatin structure and transcription rate. Here, we report an analysis of the structure and function of this PPY/PPU tract. To our surprise, the PPY/PPU tract plus an 8-bp 3′ extension can function as an independent promoter. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a PPY/PPU tract with the potential to form triplex structures can be utilized to direct transcription initiation in a promoter lacking a TATA-box. Routine subcloning was performed by standard methods (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 1.1Google Scholar). Our initial reporter plasmid, p[ME-5800/+31]CAT was made by inserting 5.8 kb of 5′-flanking DNA plus 31 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence of the chicken malic enzyme gene upstream of the bacterial reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) in the promoterless construct, pKS-CAT.2 pBH147CAT (Fig. 1) was made by inserting a BstXI/HindIII fragment from pME[−5800/+31]CAT upstream of a minimal promoter for malic enzyme linked to CAT (pME[−147/+31]CAT). pBH147ΔPPYCAT is a mutated version in which the sequence between −134 and −90 bp (all but 4 bp of the PPY/PPU tract) was deleted using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy (28Higuchi R. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Application. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177Google Scholar). To construct pME[−3903/−3703]TKCAT, a 201-bp malic enzyme fragment from −3903 to −3703 bp was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the reporter plasmid pBLCAT2 (29Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) between the SphI and BamHI sites. The promoterless construct, pME[−3903/−3703]ΔTKCAT was made by removing the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter from pME[-3903/−3703]TKCAT by digestion with BamHI and BglII, followed by blunt-end ligation. DNA fragments containing various parts of the PPY/PPU tract were made by annealing two synthetic oligonucleotides and inserting the double-stranded DNA into pME[−3903/−3703]ΔTKCAT in place of the TK promoter. pME([−3903/−3703]ME-147/+31)CAT was constructed by replacing the TK promoter of pME[−3903/−3703]TKCAT with malic enzyme promoter sequence between −147 and +31 bp. The sequence of each reporter plasmid was confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method. DNA fragments used in constructing the reporter plasmids and in other experiments are named by designating the 5′ and 3′ ends of each fragment relative to the major transcription start site of the endogenous malic enzyme gene. For deletion constructs, a “Δ” precedes the deleted part of the DNA. This procedure was carried out essentially as described (30Baillie R.A. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were prepared from 19-day-old embryos of white Leghorn chickens, plated at a high density (22 µl of packed cells/35-mm plate), and incubated in Waymouth medium 705/1 supplemented with streptomycin (100 µg/ml), penicillin G (60 µg/ml), corticosterone (1 µM), and insulin (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) (50 nM). At about 20 h of incubation, the medium was changed, and the cells were transfected with supercoiled reporter plasmids using LipofectAce™. In addition to the components named above, each plate contained 40 µg of LipofectAce, 1.3 µg of pBH147CAT or an equimolar amount of another reporter plasmid, 0.5 µg of pCMVβ-GAL, and sufficient pBluescriptKS(+) to make the total amount of transfected DNA 4.5 µg/plate. On day 2 (day 0 = day cells were prepared), the transfection medium was removed, and hepatocytes were treated with or without T3 (1.6 µM) in the medium described above. After a 48-h incubation, hepatocytes in duplicate plates were harvested into one tube and suspended in 200 µl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 µg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.174 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by three cycles of freezing-thawing. Freshly prepared cell extracts were used to measure protein and β-galactosidase activity (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Before measuring CAT activity, extracts were heated to 60°C for 30 min, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. Samples of heat-stable extract containing the equivalent of 5–50 µg of unheated soluble protein were incubated for 15 h at 37°C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 12 µM14C-chloramphenicol, 2 mM acetyl-CoA (150 µl total volume). The products of the reaction were extracted with ethyl acetate and separated by thin layer chromatography. Radioactivity in substrate and products was visualized by autoradiography and measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry or measured by direct autoradiography using an InstantImager™ (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). The CAT activity was expressed initially as the percentage of substrate converted to acetylated product per microgram of unheated soluble protein and then normalized as described in the figure legends. pBH147CAT or pBH147ΔPPYCAT (20 µg) were digested with 1 or 10 units of S1 nuclease at 37°C for 15 min in a 100-µl reaction containing 30 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM ZnCl2. The reaction was stopped by phenol extraction, and the DNA was precipitated. DNA was then digested with BamHI. Some DNA was treated with BamHI before digesting with S1 nuclease. The resulting DNA fragments (about 1 µg) were separated by size on 1% agarose gels. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the DNA fragments were visualized with UV light. Supercoiled pME637 (−413 and +224 bp in the PstI site of plasmid pIBI31) (20 µg) was partially digested with 0, 0.05, or 0.2 units of S1 nuclease for 5 min at 37°C in the S1 nuclease buffer described above or with 1 unit of P1 nuclease for 0, 1, or 4 min at 37°C in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM ZnCl2. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 M EDTA (1 µl) and extracting with phenol. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and used for the following manipulations. To detect nicks on the top strand, DNA (1 µg) was incubated with 10 pmol of biotinylated oligonucleotide 5′-+136CTACCTTGATGAGGTGCGGGTC+115-3′ at 95°C for 5 min and then at 45°C for 15 min in 19 µl of 10 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100 µM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. To detect nicks on the bottom stand, DNA was incubated with biotinylated oligonucleotide 5′-−367CACAAAAATAAGCGTGAGGAGGCAGG−342-3′ at 95°C for 5 min and then at 50°C for 15 min. Primer extension reactions containing 1 µl (2 units) of Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase were incubated for 10 min at 76°C and stopped by chilling on ice. The reaction mixture was then added to 50 µl of 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 M NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA containing 200 µg of streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin) that had been pretreated as described (32Quivy J. Becker P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2779-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out for 30 min at room temperature. DNA bound to the beads was separated from unbound DNA on a magnetic stand, and the unbound DNA was discarded. The DNA template strand and the extended immobilized strand were denatured in 50 µl of 150 mM NaOH at 50°C for 5 min. The extended immobilized strand was then separated from the template strand by centrifugation or on a magnetic stand, and the extended strand was discarded. The supernatant solution containing the templates was neutralized with 50 µl of 150 mM HCl, and 10 µl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Yeast tRNA (5 µg) was added to the mixture, and the nucleic acids were precipitated. The DNA-RNA pellet was dissolved in 36 µl of 10 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100 µM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP; 18 µl of this mixture were then added to 1 µl of 32P-labeled primer (1 pmol; top strand, 5′-−11CCTGCGGGAGCGGAGGCG−28-3′; bottom strand, 5′-−194CGGTGGGTGACTCAGCG−178-3′). The mixture was incubated at 95°C for 1 min, then at 45°C (bottom strand) or 50°C (top strand) for 15 min. Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase (2 units) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 10 min at 76°C. The reaction was stopped by chilling on ice. After precipitating the DNA with ethanol, the extension products were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gels. A PstI fragment (−413 and +224 bp) was subcloned into plasmid M13mp19 at the PstI site, and a clone containing the top strand of the malic enzyme sequence was isolated and named pM13ME−413/+224(+). The StuI-PstI fragment (−236 and + 224 bp) was subcloned into M13mp19 at the PstI and SmaI sites. The resulting plasmid, pM13ME−236/+224(−), contains the bottom strand of the malic enzyme sequence. To prepare the top strand probe, 32P-labeled universal sequencing primer, 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′, was extended on single-stranded pM13ME−236/+224(−) using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. The extension product was digested with AvaII. To prepare the bottom strand probe, 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, 5′-−11CCTGCGGGAGCGGAGGCG−28-3′, was extended on pM13ME−431/+224(+), and the extension product was digested with StuI. Single-stranded probes were isolated after electrophoresis through alkaline-agarose gels (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 1.1Google Scholar). About 100,000 cpm of probe was preincubated with various amounts of nuclear protein in a 50-µl binding reaction containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 µg/µl poly(dI-dC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 4% glycerol, 0.04 µg/µl bovine serum albumin. After a 1-h preincubation on ice, 5 µl of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM MgCl2, RQ-1 RNase-free DNase I (1 unit) was added. After 15 min in ice water, the reaction was stopped by 0.5 M EDTA (5 µl), followed by phenol extraction and precipitation with ethanol. The resulting DNA fragments were separated by size on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gels. DNA fragments containing the malic enzyme promoter were excised from plasmid pME−413/+224 by digestion with either KpnI and HindIII or AvaI and PstI. The top strand was labeled at the HindIII site of the KpnI/HindIII fragment; the bottom strand was labeled at the AvaI site of the AvaI/PstI fragment. About 0.5 ng of DNA probe was incubated with 70 µg of nuclear proteins for 40 min on ice in 100 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.03 µg/µl poly(dI-dC). DNase I and 5 mM MgCl2 were then added, and the incubation continued for another 10 min on ice. Digestion was stopped with 10 mM EDTA, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. The resulting DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol and separated by size on 5% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gels. Single-stranded probes were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Double-stranded probes were labeled using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase. 32P-labeled probe (0.01 pmol) was mixed with competitor DNA and then incubated with about 0.1 (single-stranded DNA as probe) or 3 (double-stranded DNA as probe) µg of nuclear protein in 20 µl of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 µg/µl poly(dI-dC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 4% glycerol, 0.04 µg/µl bovine serum albumin. The binding reaction was performed on ice for 45 min. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Nuclear extracts were prepared from livers of 2-week-old chicks. To prepare nuclear extracts from the livers of intact chicks, two livers were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in 40 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% sucrose. The homogenate (20 ml) was layered over 25 ml of the same buffer with 10% sucrose. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 1700 × g and washed with 20 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 0.15 mM spermine, and 0.5 mM spermidine. After a second 15-min centrifugation at 700 × g, the pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM DTT. To extract nuclear protein, the KCl concentration was increased to 300 mM, and the mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 min (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 1.1Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were dialyzed extensively against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and stored at −80°C. Unmodified oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by the DNA Core Facility of the University of Iowa. Oligonucleotides biotinylated at their 5′-ends were purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). For the gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay, double-stranded oligonucleotides were made by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides (purified on 8% polyacrylamide gels and collected using an Elutrap device (Schleicher & Schuell)).

PPY/PPU tracts play important functional roles in several promoters (6Mavrothalassitis G.J. Watson D.K. Papas T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We tested the functional significance of the PPY/PPU sequence in the malic enzyme promoter by comparing transcription from a promoter containing the wild-type sequence (pBH147CAT) with that in a construct lacking all but 4 bp of the PPY/PPU tract (pBH147ΔPPYCAT). pBH147CAT contains a T3 response unit and a minimal promoter from the chicken malic enzyme gene linked to a CAT reporter gene (Fig. 1B).2 In hepatocytes in culture transfected with the wild-type and deletion constructs, T3 caused 8- and 20-fold stimulations of CAT activity, respectively (Fig. 1"
https://openalex.org/W2041411033,"The large subunit of herpes simplex virus type 2 ribonucleotide reductase (ICP10) is a multifunctional protein. It consists of a ribonucleotide reductase and a serine/threonine protein kinase (PK) domain, which has three proline-rich motifs consistent with SH3-binding sites at positions 140, 149, and 396. We used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acids required for kinase activity and interaction with signaling proteins. Mutation of Lys176 or Lys259 reduced PK activity (5-8-fold) and binding of the 14C-labeled ATP analog rho-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5'-adenosine (FSBA) but did not abrogate them. Enzymatic activity and FSBA binding were abrogated by mutation of both Lys residues, suggesting that either one can bind ATP. Mutation of Glu209 (PK catalytic motif III) virtually abrogated kinase activity in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions, suggesting that Glu209 functions in ion-dependent PK activity. ICP10 bound the adaptor protein Grb2 in vitro. Mutation of the ICP10 proline-rich motifs at positions 396 and 149 reduced Grb2 binding 20- and 2-fold, respectively. Binding was abrogated by mutation of both motifs. Grb2 binding to wild type ICP10 was competed by a peptide for the Grb2 C-terminal SH3 motif, indicating that it involves the Grb2 C-terminal SH3."
https://openalex.org/W2062919637,"Acting in cis with the β-globin locus control region, the CAAT box of the β-globin gene promoter stimulates transcription 10-fold in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells but is without effect in K562 cells. Our previous studies suggested that of four proteins from MEL cells that bind to this CAAT box region (CP1, GATA-1, and two factors that were denoted DSFr and DSF1) DSFr is involved in the up-regulation of transcription. In the present report, the DSFr protein in MEL cells was identified as C/EBPγ through expression cloning and antibody studies. C/EBPγ DNA binding activity could not be detected in K562 cells. However, K562 cells, but not MEL cells, were found to express LIP, which is a truncated form of C/EBPβ and is an inhibitor of transcription. Thus, the differential expression of C/EBP members could account for the ability of the β-globin CAAT box to stimulate transcription in MEL cells, but not function in K562 cells. Juxtaposing a specific C/EBP binding sequence next to the β-globin promoter, in constructs in which the CAAT box had been rendered inactive by mutation or deletion, restored full promoter activity in MEL cells only if CP1 still bound to the promoter. In conjunction with previous mutation analyses, these results suggest that C/EBPγ may collaborate with CP1 to enhance transcription through the β-globin CAAT box.

The human β-globin locus (Fig. 1) contains five active genes that are expressed specifically in red blood cells at different times during development (reviewed in 1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nienhuis A.W. Developmental Control of Globin Gene Expression. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). ε-Globin is only expressed early in embryogenesis, the two γ-globin genes are transcribed at high levels during fetal life, while the δ- (a minor contributor) and β-globin genes are expressed in late fetal life and throughout adult life. To express at high levels, all of these genes rely on the activity of the LCR 1The abbreviations used are: LCRlocus control regionGMSgel mobility shiftMELmurine erythroleukemiaCPScarbamyl phosphate synthetaseC/EBPCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. that is situated upstream of the ε-globin gene (see Fig. 1). The LCR is a powerful, erythroid-specific enhancer that has the additional property of being able to confer position-independent, copy number-dependent expression onto globin transgenes under its control (reviewed in 2Dillon N.

Epner E.M. Forrester W.C. Groudine M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Bungert J. Davé U. Lim K.-C. Lieuw K.H. Shavit J.A. Liu Q. Engel J.D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 3083-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), have shown that the globin genes compete for activation by the LCR during development. Investigations have also indicated that the LCR can only activate one gene at a time and that the LCR interacts directly with the gene it is enhancing through a looping mechanism (3Behringer R.R. Ryan T.M. Palmiter R. Brinster R.L. Townes T.M. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 6Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Fraser P. Yannoutsos N. Greaves D. Dillon N.

Intercept Ltd., Andover, United Kingdom1995: 23Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the developmental switching of globin gene expression is regulated, at least in part, through a competition between the genes for interactions with the LCR. In this model, regulatory sequences surrounding each gene would interact with the LCR and, therefore, would play a direct role in determining the affinity each gene has for the LCR during the different stages of development. Using MEL cells as a model system, Antoniou and Grosveld (10Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only a minimal β-globin gene promoter, containing the TATA box, the CAAT box, and the proximal CACC box sequences (Fig. 1), is necessary for the LCR to enhance high levels of transcription onto a H-2K reporter gene. In conjunction with the TATA box, the CAAT, and the proximal CACC motifs can each stimulate activity 10-fold higher than the TATA box alone in MEL cells. Thus, both the CAAT and proximal CACC elements and the cognate transcription factors that bind to these sequences play an important role in regulating the β-globin promoter in the presence of the LCR and, thus, may be involved in LCR interactions. Recent work by other groups has implicated an erythroid-specific kruppel-like factor in the involvement of the β-globin proximal CACC box in LCR activated transcription (11Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice in which the erythroid-specific kruppel-like factor gene has been crippled though homologous recombination die at the fetal stage of development due to a severe anemia. This may be caused by the specific absence of expression of the mouse β-globin gene (13Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 14Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Our studies on the β-globin CAAT box have shown that four distinct factors in MEL cells can bind to this region; the erythroid-specific protein GATA-1, the ubiquitous CAAT-binding protein CP1 (also called NF-Y), and two DNA binding activities that were denoted DSF1 and DSFr (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DSF1 DNA binding activity is only detectable in MEL cells that are induced to terminally differentiate, while DSFr activity is present in both uninduced and induced cells. A mutation analysis that was done suggested that DSFr is involved in regulating the activity of the β-globin CAAT box in MEL cells. However, in these same studies it was also found that the CAAT box, in cis with the LCR, was completely unable to increase transcription from the β-globin promoter in K562 cells (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, it appeared that K562 cells did contain DSFr DNA binding activity. These results suggested that there might be a difference in the way the LCR functions in MEL versus K562 cells and/or that there are differences in the CAAT box-binding factors that were not detected in the previous studies. Therefore, we sought to identify the DSFr and DSF1 proteins to be able to determine if there exist important differences between the proteins in MEL cells versus K562 cells. The C/EBP family of transcription factors belong to the basic-ZIP class of DNA-binding proteins (16Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar and 17Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, and references therein). C/EBP members contain a domain in their C-terminal half that is rich in basic amino acids. This basic domain is followed by a leucine zipper motif (4 to 5 repeats of leucine at every seventh amino acid) through which the C/EBP members form homodimers or heterodimerize with one another. Dimerization is required for the proteins to interact with DNA through the basic domains. At least six distinct members of the C/EBP family in mammals have been identified: C/EBPα, C/EBPβ (also known as NFIL6 and LAP), NF-IL6β, C/EBPγ (also called IgEBP), C/EBPδ, and CHOP (16Cao Z.

A. 1992; 89: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). With the exception of CHOP, which does not appear to bind DNA (22Ron D. Habner J.F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), all C/EBP members have a nearly identical DNA-binding specificity. Although the DNA sequence consensus recognized by these proteins is highly redundant, a CAAT-like sequence is frequently observed. In the present report we have identified DSF1 and DSFr as C/EBPβ and C/EBPγ, respectively, and we have found that these DNA binding activities are differentially expressed in MEL and K562 cells. Moreover, our studies suggest that C/EBPγ may act in collaboration with CP1 to up-regulate LCR enhanced β-globin gene expression through the β-globin CAAT box in MEL cells. Custom cDNA libraries, representing dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells, in λgt11 (random primed) and λgt10 (mixed random and oligo(dT) primed) vectors were purchased from Clontech. For screening λgt11 expression libraries, approximately 50,000 plaque-forming units were grown on each 10-inch square plate and these were screened by the Southwestern method (25Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson W.H. Landschultz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Filters were probed with the synthetic oligonucleotides GAGCCCTAGGGTTGGCCAATCTACTCCCAG and GCTCCTGGGAGTAGATTGGCCAACCCTAGG, which were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, annealed to form GAGC and GCTC 5′ overhangs, and then ligated to form concatamers. GMS assays and nuclear extract preparation were done as described previously (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were used at a protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml in the final reaction mixtures unless indicated otherwise. Antisera were diluted 3-fold in phosphate-buffered saline and then extracts were mixed with equal amounts of diluted antisera and incubated on ice for 30 min. Antibodies to C/EBPγ were kindly provided by Kathryn Calame (26Cooper C. Johnson D. Roman C. Avitahl N. Tucker P. Calame K. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3225-3231PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Antibodies to GATA-1 were as described (27Aumont F. Trudel P. Wall L. Differentiation. 1993; 52: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The β-CAAT oligonucleotide used and mutants 1, 3, 5, and 7 of this sequence have been described previously (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CPS oligonucleotide was (both strands are given 5′ to 3′) ATTTGTTATGTTGCAACTTGTATGACA/ATGTCATACAAGTTGCAACATAACAAA. Plasmid constructs containing the β-globin promoter from position −87, which is just upstream of the CAAT box (Fig. 1), to +32 linked to a H-2K reporter gene and cloned into the β-globin microlocus vector, which contains the β-globin LCR, have been described previously (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A promoter containing a deleted CAAT box was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction using a 5′ primer with the sequence 5′-CGCGGTACTCCCAGGAGCAGGG-3′. The underlined sequence represents a BamHI site that was added for cloning purposes and the T following this represents the start of the sequence of the β-globin promoter beginning two nucleotides 3′ to the CAAT sequence. The DNA product was linked to the H-2K reporter and cloned into the microlocus vector as described (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To clone the CPS sequences 5′ to the various β-globin promoters, the CPS oligonucleotides (given above) were re-synthesized to contain a 5′ CG overhang on the first strand and a 5′ GATC overhang on the second strand. The oligonucleotides were annealed and then cloned juxtaposed 5′ to the promoters using BamHI and ClaI restriction sites that are unique when the promoter fragments are cloned into BlueScript vector before they are transferred to the microlocus vector (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final products were sequenced to ensure only one copy had inserted and that it was in the correct orientation. The rat LIP expression vector was kindly provided by Ueli Shibler (21Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Fifty µg of proteins from nuclear extracts were separated on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes were probed with a 1:2000 dilution of C/EBPβ antibodies using the ECL system of Amersham Life Sciences. To clone the corresponding cDNAs for the DSF proteins, a λgt11 expression library was screened with a DNA probe representing the CAAT box of the β-globin promoter. One positive clone was obtained from 0.8 × 105 recombinants screened. This clone contained part of the open reading frame and 3′ sequences of the C/EBPγ cDNA that was previously cloned from mouse and rat cells (18Nishizawa M. Wakabayashi-Ito N. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Roman C. Platero J.S. Shuman J. Calame K. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1404-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Thomassin H. Hamel D. Bernier D. Guertin M. Belanger L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A λgt10 cDNA library was screened to isolate the complete coding sequences for C/EBPγ. Interestingly, the 5′ end of the longest cDNA isolated extended to the G 39 base pairs upstream from the C that was suggested to be the site of transcription initiation for the C/EBPγ gene (18Nishizawa M. Wakabayashi-Ito N. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, data not shown). This result agreed with studies on rat C/EBPγ, in which the 5′ end of the longest cDNA isolated is highly homologous to the mouse gene and extends 5′ to just 2 nucleotides before our longest clone (20Thomassin H. Hamel D. Bernier D. Guertin M. Belanger L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3091-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, either the transcription start site for the mouse C/EBPγ gene was incorrectly mapped or multiple start sites are used. To determine if DSF1 and/or DSFr represent C/EBP members, MEL nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies against various C/EBP proteins before performing GMS assays with the β-globin CAAT box oligonucleotide as the labeled DNA probe. To identify the CP1, DSF1, GATA-1, and DSFr bands on the autoradiograms, competition assays were performed (Fig. 2a) with various mutations of the CAAT box that were previously described (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These can be summarized as follows: CP1, GATA-1, DSF1 and DSFr bind to the wild type β-CAAT sequence; only GATA-1 recognizes mutant 1; mutant 3 is recognized by DSFr and DSF1, and, to a greatly reduced degree, by CP1; while only CP1 binds to the mutant 7 sequence. Each oligonucleotide will only compete binding of those proteins that bind to it. With uninduced MEL extracts (Fig. 2b, lanes 1-6) the C/EBPγ antisera inhibited formation of the DSFr protein-DNA complex and caused a supershift to form, but it did not affect either GATA-1 or CP1 (lane 3). None of the bands were affected by antisera against C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ, or by preimmune serum (lanes 4, 5, and 6, respectively), while GATA-1 antibodies specifically inhibited formation of the GATA-1 complex (lane 2). With induced MEL extracts (Fig. 2b, lanes 7-12) formation of the DSFr complex was again only inhibited by the antibodies against C/EBPγ. The C/EBPγ antiserum also partially inhibited formation of the DSF1 complex (lane 9). In addition, the DSF1 band was completely inhibited by the C/EBPβ antiserum (lane 10). However, the DSF1 signal was not affected by GATA-1 antiserum, C/EBPδ antiserum, or preimmune serum (lanes 8, 11, and 12, respectively), which demonstrated that the effects were specific. To extend these results, we determined if the DSF1 and/or DSFr factors could recognize DNA sequences known to interact with C/EBP members. A GMS analysis using a sequence from the promoter of the CPS gene, which interacts strongly with C/EBP proteins (28Lagace M. Goping I.S. Mueller C.R. Lazzaro M. Shore G.C. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 3. Two bands were detected in induced MEL extracts (Fig. 3a, lane 2) that showed exactly the same competition profile as DSFr and DSF1 detected with the β-CAAT probe (compare lanes 2 to 7 in Figs. 2a and 3a). The faster migrating band was virtually completely inhibited by the anti-C/EBPγ serum, but this band was not affected by any of the other sera tested, while the upper band was partially affected by the anti-C/EBPγ serum and was completely inhibited by the anti-C/EBPβ serum (Fig. 3b, lanes 6-10). The apparent slight reactivity of the upper band to anti-C/EBPδ and the slight decrease in the lower band in response to anti-C/EBPβ and anti-C/EBPδ was not reproducible. Thus, the two factors in induced MEL extracts that bound to the CPS oligonucleotide gave the same DNA-binding specificity and the same antibody reactivity as DSFr and DSF1 that bind to the β-globin CAAT sequence. Surprisingly, the CPS oligonucleotide also formed two DNA-protein complexes in GMS assays with uninduced MEL extracts (Fig. 3a, lane 1). However, the slower migrating band seen with uninduced extracts migrated at a slightly higher position than the slower migrating band seen with induced extracts (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3a), and antibody studies indicated that the upper band obtained with uninduced extracts was likely due to two molecules of DSFr binding to a single molecule of the CPS DNA probe. For example, both of the DNA-protein complexes detected with uninduced extracts were almost completely blocked by the anti-C/EBPγ serum, whereas neither was affected by the other sera tested, including the C/EBPβ antiserum (Fig. 3b, lanes 1-5 and compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 8 and 9). This was in contrast to the upper band obtained with induced extracts, which was completely reactive to C/EBPβ antiserum. In summary, both DSFr and DSF1 DNA binding activities can be detected with C/EBP-binding sites, as well as with the β-globin CAAT sequence, in GMS assays. DSFr is specifically reactive to C/EBPγ antibodies. DSF1 is partly reactive to C/EBPγ antibodies and it is completely reactive to C/EBPβ-specific antibodies. These data suggest that DSFr is C/EBPγ in MEL cells, while DSF1 is likely C/EBPβ. If DSF1 is C/EBPβ, it must be present in part as a homodimer and in part as a heterodimer with the C/EBPγ (DSFr) protein. This would explain why it is partly reactive to the C/EBPγ antiserum. This interpretation is exactly the same conclusion drawn by Cooper et al. (26Cooper C. Johnson D. Roman C. Avitahl N. Tucker P. Calame K. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3225-3231PubMed Google Scholar) for mouse B-cells. Both early and mature B-cells contain active C/EBPγ, but only more mature cells contain detectable C/EBPβ DNA binding activity and a large proportion of the C/EBPβ protein is present as a heterodimer with C/EBPγ, as appears to be the case here for MEL cells. K562 cells were also studied using antisera and GMS assays as outlined above for MEL extracts. In panel a of Fig. 4, the identity of the various radiolabeled bands obtained in GMS assays of K562 extracts using the β-CAAT oligonucleotide as the probe was established by competition assays, while the effect of preincubation with the various antibodies is shown in panel b of this figure. Previously (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that GATA-1, CP1, and a band migrating near the position of and showing the same competition pattern as DSFr (C/EBPγ) can be detected with K562 extracts. However, the band migrating at the position of DSFr was not at all reactive to the C/EBPγ antiserum and treatment with this serum did not cause any super shift to form (lane 3 in Fig. 4b). This indicated that none of the complexes seen with K562 extracts is related to C/EBPγ (DSFr). On the other hand, the protein-DNA complex seen at the DSFr position was strongly inhibited by the C/EBPβ antiserum and supershifted bands were observed upon treatment with this antiserum (Fig. 4b, lane 4). With the CPS oligonucleotide as probe, only one major labeled protein-DNA complex was obtained in GMS assays of K562 extracts (Fig. 4c; minor bands observed were not reproducible). This complex gave the competition profile expected for a C/EBP protein (Fig. 4, compare results in panel c to those in panel a) and again, this DNA-protein complex was reactive to the C/EBPβ antibodies specifically (Fig. 4d). Thus, the DSF related complex observed with K562 extracts is related to C/EBPβ (DSF1), not to C/EBPγ (DSFr). The C/EBPβ mRNA contains three in-frame methionines that can be used as protein initiation codons in vivo (21Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The first two ATGs are near the 5′ end of the message and code for proteins in the 35-40-kDa range. The third ATG is near the center of the open reading frame and codes for a protein of only 16 kDa. This protein, called LIP, migrates upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis near 20 kDa. Since in the GMS assays the C/EBP-related DNA binding activity in K562 extracts co-migrates with C/EBPγ (DSFr) from MEL cells, and C/EBPγ itself is a 16.3-kDa protein (18Nishizawa M. Wakabayashi-Ito N. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it was suspected that the K562 DNA binding activity might represent LIP. In Western blots probed with C/EBPβ antibodies (Fig. 5a) a prominent band migrating near 20 kDa was seen with K562 extracts, whereas no protein at this position was detected with MEL extracts. Moreover, in a K562 clone that was stably transfected with an expression vector for the LIP protein of rat, the intensity of this 20-kDa protein detected in Western blots with the C/EBPβ antibodies was increased substantially (Fig. 5b). In GMS assays of extracts prepared from this clone, an intense DNA-protein complex, migrating near the position of the DSF related band seen with normal K562 extracts, was obtained with both the β-CAAT and CPS sequences as probes (Fig. 5c). Note that the major band seen with the LIP expressing clone migrated slightly above the position of the DSF related activity seen with normal K562 cells. This likely represents a difference in migration between the transfected rat LIP protein and the endogenous human K562 protein. Taken together, these data conclusively show that the DSF related DNA binding activity in K562 extracts represents the LIP protein. LIP is present in K562 cells but not in MEL cells. In the Western blot analyses, the C/EBPβ antiserum also detected major protein bands in the 35-40-kDa range with both K562 and MEL extracts and these were detected equally well with uninduced and induced extracts from either cell type (Fig. 5a). It is expected that these represent the larger C/EBPβ proteins (see above). Yet, C/EBPβ (DSF1) DNA binding activity can only be detected with induced extracts of MEL cells. It cannot be detected with uninduced MEL extracts, nor with any K562 extracts (see Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 for example). Thus, it was thought that only induced MEL cell extracts would contain full-length C/EBPβ proteins. However, the Western blot analyses suggest that both K562 and MEL cells, whether they are induced or not, contain the full-length proteins. One possibility is that the C/EBP proteins are not active for DNA binding. For example, it has been shown that the DNA binding activity of C/EBP proteins can be modified by phosphorylation (29Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.-C. Huang K.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19396-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, a minor band migrating near 35 kDa is detected with induced MEL extracts by the C/EBPβ antibodies in the Western blot analysis, but this band is not detected with uninduced MEL or any K562 extracts (arrow in Fig. 5a). Thus, it may be that it is a specific form of the C/EBPβ protein that is active for DNA binding in induced MEL cells. Further studies will be required to address this possibility. Our previous results (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had suggested that C/EBPγ is involved in LCR enhanced activation of transcription through the β-globin CAAT box in MEL cells. We, therefore predicted that a DNA sequence that binds specifically to C/EBP proteins in MEL cells, such as the CPS oligonucleotide (Fig. 3), may be able to reconstitute transcriptional activity to a β-globin promoter in which the CAAT box had been inactivated. Previously, we had derived several multiple point mutations of the β-globin CAAT sequences (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were investigated using constructs that contained the LCR in cis to the β-globin promoter (from −87 to +32, which includes just the TATA box and CAAT box motifs (Fig. 1)) linked to a H-2K reporter gene. Two of the CAAT box mutations studied, mutant 5, which no longer binds to any proteins, and mutant 7, which only retains CP1 binding, had a 10-fold reduced activity in LCR enhanced transcription in MEL cells, suggesting that in these two cases the β-globin CAAT box is not at all functional (15Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; a summary of these two mutations is shown in Fig. 7). In addition, here we derived an additional construct in which the CAAT box and further upstream sequences were deleted from the β-globin promoter (−71 to +32). This deleted promoter, denoted deleted CAAT, also had a 10-fold reduced activity in MEL cells (see below). We tested whether juxtaposing the CPS oligonucleotide 5′ of the mutant 5, mutant 7, or deleted CAAT promoters could restore transcription in MEL cells to the levels seen with the wild type promoter extending to −87. The promoter fragments (wi"

The triple mutant, like Ras2p R80D/N81D, did not interfere with the action of GEF on Ras2p wt (or H-Ras p21) and was unable to form a stable complex with GEF. The GEF stimulation of the nucleotide dissociation of the triple mutant was virtually abolished and strongly decreased with the double mutant. The affinity of Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D for GDP and GTP was decreased 3 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively, like that of Ras2p S24N, whereas the double mutant behaved as Ras2p wt. Like Ras2p S24N and unlike Ras2p R80D/N81D, the GTP-bound triple mutant did not activate adenylyl cyclase. Thus, the triple mutant and Ras2p S24N have opposite properties toward the binding to GEF but similarly modified behaviors toward GDP, GTP, and adenylyl cyclase.

Ras proteins are GTPases that regulate cell growth and differentiation by cycling between the active GTP-bound and the inactive GDP-bound states.

Although no definite conclusions could be drawn concerning the location of the binding site of Ras proteins for GEF, site-directed mutagenesis of Ras proteins has given useful information on the role played by the various regions of the Ras molecule in the action of GEF. Specific substitutions in the phosphoryl binding I region, the switch I and II regions of human c-H-Ras p21 and Ras2p were identified that influence negatively the action of GEF; some of them have little effect on the affinity for GEF (Mistou et al., 27Mistou M.-Y.

In S. cerevisiae, adenylyl cyclase is a major target of the GTP-bound form of Ras proteins and constitutes the first element of a cascade of kinases influencing the activity of transcription factors. Experimental evidence obtained from the yeast system indicates that substitutions in the distal switch II region induce little, if any, effect on the activation of adenylyl cyclase (Verrotti et al., 40Verrotti A. Créchet J.-B. Di Blasi F. Seidita G. Mirisola M.G. Kavounis C. Nastopoulos V. Burderi E. De Vendittis E. Parmeggiani A. Fasano O.

Marbach I. Willumsen B.M. Lewitzki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of this region concerning the response to GEF, the mechanism of interference of dominant negative mutations, and the activation of adenylyl cyclase, we have constructed a Ras2p mutant that combines substitutions of dominant (S24N) and recessive type (R80D/N81D). The biochemical analysis of this mutant, as compared with Ras2p wt, Ras2p S24N, and Ras2p R80D/N81D, 2Some of the designations used are: Ras proteins, the products of RAS genes in general including human H-Ras p21 and yeast S. cerevisiae Ras2p; Ras2p, the product of S. cerevisiae RAS2 gene; Ras2p S24N, the product of the RAS2 S24N dominant allele; Ras2p R80D/N81D, the product of the ras2 R80D/N81D recessive allele; Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D, a construct derived from Ras2p S24N and Ras2p R80D/N81D; CDC25Mm-C, the catalytic domain of a mouse brain-specific GEF; Cdc25p-C, the catalytic domain of the S. cerevisiae GEF Cdc25p; Sdc25p-C, the catalytic domain of the S. cerevisiae GEF Sdc25p; CDC25GEF, a general term designing Cdc25p, Sdc25p, and CDC25Mm. emphasizes the importance of the conserved distal switch II region of Ras2p for the action of GEF action and the specific properties of the mechanism of interference of Ras2p mutants. Ras2p wt and mutants were produced in Escherichia coli strain SCS1 as recombinant protein fused with glutathione S-tranferase using the pGEX2T vector. Ras2p S24N was constructed as reported (Poullet et al., 31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ras2p R80D/N81D was obtained by cloning the NdeI-SalI fragment from pAVD80D81 (Verrotti et al., 40Verrotti A. Créchet J.-B. Di Blasi F. Seidita G. Mirisola M.G. Kavounis C. Nastopoulos V. Burderi E.

Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D was engineered by inserting the NdeI-PstI fragment of pAV1 carrying the S24N mutation (Poullet et al., 31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as replacement for the homologous wild type segment in pGEX2T R80D/N81D. The NdeI-SalI fragment from pSKc-Hras (Gross et al., 12Gross M. Sweet R.W. Sathe G. Yokohama S. Fasano O. Goldfarb M. Wigler M. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), containing the open reading frame of human c-H-ras p21 was cloned into the SmaI site of pGEX2T to express the glutathione S-transferase-H-Ras p21 fusion. The transformed E. coli strains were grown at 28°C in 2 liters of LB-rich medium containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin. Cell cultures were induced at a density of 0.3 A600 units with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. After 12-15 h of growth, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and sonicated thrice at 4°C, at which temperature all the subsequent steps were carried out (Poullet et al., 31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose and the thrombin treatment to remove the fused glutathione S-transferase were carried out as reported (Poullet et al., 31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The faster the purification procedure, the higher was the content of the intact Ras2p products. The purified preparations contained ∼65% of full-length form plus ∼30 and ∼5% of the 29- and 37-kDa proteolytic forms, respectively. Mono-Q HR 5/5 chromatography (fast protein liquid chromatography, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using a linear 20-300 mM KCl gradient (50 ml) in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM MgCl2, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 µM GDP allowed the separation of nearly homogeneous full-length Ras2p from the 29-kDa form. The p21 was purified on Mono-Q HR 5/5 using the same gradient. After concentration in an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus (Diaflo membrane PM10), the Ras proteins were stored at −20°C in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 30 mM KCl, 50% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 10 µM GDP. Cdc25p-C (509 amino acids), Sdc25p-C (550 amino acids), and CDC25-CMm (285 amino acids) expressed in E. coli strain SCS1 as glutathione S-transferase fusions were purified after removal of glutathione S-transferase by thrombin treatment (Jacquet et al. (18Jacquet E. Parrini M.C. Bernardi A. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); Poullet et al. (31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants (Kd) and the dissociation rate constants (k−1) of Ras-nucleotide complexes were determined by the nitrocellulose binding assay using 0.45-µm Sartorius SM 11 306 filters (Créchet and Parmeggiani, 4Créchet J.B. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All tests were performed at 30°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (buffer A) containing MgCl2 as indicated in the legends to figures. The preformed labeled Ras·[3H]GDP complexes were prepared by incubating for 20 min at 30°C 3 µM Ras2p·GDP in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 5 µM [3H]GDP (200 GBq/mmol, Du Pont NEN). MgCl2 (10 mM) was then added. The dissociation rates of the Ras·[3H]GDP complexes were determined in 165 µl of buffer A containing 68 nM Ras·[3H]GDP, MgCl2, and GEF, as indicated in the legends to figures, and a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled nucleotide. The reaction was started with preformed Ras·[3H]GDP complex. At time intervals, 25-µl aliquots were filtered on nitrocellulose discs that were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The K′d of Ras2p·GTP and Ras2p·GDP complexes were calculated by Scatchard plots according to the equation: r[Nucleotide free]=1K′d(n−r)(Eq. 1) where r is the average mol of GTP or GDP bound per mol of Ras2p and n is the number of binding sites. To eliminate traces of GDP from commercial GTP preparations, the concentrated solution of labeled or unlabeled GTP used was incubated for 10 min at 30°C in a 40-µl solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM DTT, 20 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, and 30 µg of pyruvate kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 40 mM nucleotide. 200 µl of buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) containing GDP-free Ras2p in the 29-kDa form (∼250 pmol) and CDC25-CMm in a 2-fold molar excess over Ras2p with or without GDP or GTP were loaded on a AcA 44 Ultrogel column (57 × 0.9 cm) equilibrated with buffer B at 4°C. The flow rate controlled by the fast protein liquid chromatography system was 0.04 ml/min, and 200-µl fractions were collected 250 min after loading. Ras2p and CDC25-CMm were detected by determining the bound [3H]GDP and the [3H]GDP release activity, respectively. In the former case, 20-µl aliquots were incubated for 10 min at 30°C with 2 µM [3H] GDP (25-180 GBq/mmol) in a 50-µl reaction mixture (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4 and 1 mM DTT). In the latter case, the reaction was started by adding 3 pmol of preformed Ras2p [3H]GDP in 30 µl of buffer B to a 20-µl aliquot, to which 3 µl containing 9 nmol of cold GDP were added. The decrease in radioactivity was measured after 15 min at 30°C. Immunostained Western blot using 140-µl lyophilized fractions was performed according to Poullet et al. (31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with Ras2p-specific antibodies and CDC25-CMm antibodies obtained from rabbit immunized against purified CDC25-CMm. The Ras2p·GDP- and Cdc25p-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity was measured at 30°C (Créchet et al., 7Créchet J.-B. Poullet P. Bernardi A. Fasano O. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 30 µg/100 µl of membranes (as a source of adenylyl cyclase) from S. cerevisiae strain AAT3B-Δ1(genotype: a ade2 cdc25::LEU2 CRI4 his3 leu2-3, 112 lys 1-1 ras1-Δ ras2::URA3 ura3-52; Mirisola et al., 26Mirisola M.G. Seidita G. Verrotti A.C. Di Blasi F. Fasano O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15740-15748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were prepared according to Mirisola et al. (26Mirisola M.G. Seidita G. Verrotti A.C. Di Blasi F. Fasano O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15740-15748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cells, grown at 30°C in YEPD (2% bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% glucose) medium, were collected at 1.2 A595 nm units, disrupted in 2 volumes of 50 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.2, 0.05 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim): 2 mM Pefablock-Sc (4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride), 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 60 µg/ml antipain. The membranes were stored in the same buffer with 10% glycerol. The purity of proteins was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by the Bradford method (Bradford, 2Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar), and for Ras proteins their concentration was estimated by their ability to bind [3H]GDP in the presence of a saturating concentration of the labeled substrate (0.7-1 mol/mol of Ras as compared with the Bradford method). In mammalian cells, the mutation S17N induces a dominant negative phenotype (Stacey et al., 37Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This was also the case with the S. cerevisiae homologous substitution S24N, as was shown by genetic analysis of the RAS2 S24N phenotype. 3J.-B. Créchet and O. Fasano, unpublished observations. To characterize the interfering properties of Ras2p S24N in vitro in a quantitative manner, we examined its effect on the dissociation rate of Ras2p wt·[3H]GDP induced by Sdc25p-C (Fig. 1A), Cdc25p-C (Fig. 1B), and CDC25Mm-C (Fig. 1C) or on p21·[3H]GDP in the presence of CDC25Mm-C (Fig. 1D). In all cases the response of Ras wt to GEF was inhibited by Ras2p S24N in a concentration-dependent manner. Because the Km for the exchange reaction of the three GEFs are different (Jacquet et al., 18Jacquet E. Parrini M.C. Bernardi A. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), their concentrations (50 nM Sdc25p-C, 2.2 nM Cdc25p-C, or 70 nM CDC25Mm-C) were chosen to give a dissociation rate 12-20 times higher than the intrinsic dissociation of the [3H]GDP·Ras complex. In order to avoid any interference between the intrinsically fast GDP dissociation of Ras2p S24N (see below) and the Ras wt·[3H]GDP dissociation rate dependent on GEF, increasing concentrations of the 42-kDa form of Ras2p S24N·GDP were first preincubated with the various GEFs. A 1000-fold excess of cold GDP was then added, and the reaction was started with Ras2p wt·[3H]GDP. The IC50 of Ras2p S24N (Fig. 1E) was similar for all three GEFs used (45 nM for Sdc25p-C, 70 nM for Cdc25p-C, and 80 nM for CDC25Mm-C), showing that its affinity for these GEFs lies in the same range. The last 112 C-terminal residues of Ras2p were not necessary for the interaction with the GEFs, because the 42- and 29-kDa forms of Ras2p S24N induced the same interfering effect (Fig. 1F). Substitution R80D/N81D was reported to abolish the Ras2p response to Sdc25p without affecting the intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange (Verrotti et al., 40Verrotti A. Créchet J.-B. Di Blasi F. Seidita G. Mirisola M.G. Kavounis C. Nastopoulos V. Burderi E. De Vendittis E. Parmeggiani A. Fasano O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The introduction of these two substitutions in Ras2p S24N (Fig. 2) caused the loss of the ability to interfere with the Cdc25p-C-mediated Ras2p wt·[3H]GDP dissociation rate even at concentrations as high as 1.5 µM, whereas in the same conditions 0.5 µM Ras2p S24N reduced 12 times the dissociation rate of Ras2p wt·[3H]GDP. This shows that the nature of residues Arg80 and Asn81 is essential for the interfering properties of Ras2p S24N. The ability of the various Ras2p species to form stable complexes with Cdc25p on gel filtration was also analyzed. For these experiments, we used the truncated form of Ras2p to improve the resolution of the eluted products. CDC25Mm-C was preferred to Cdc25p-C or Sdc25p-C, because unlike the purified forms of these two yeast GEFs (Poullet et al., 31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it does not display hydrophobic interactions with the acrylamide-agarose matrix, leading to a retention on filtration chromatography. CDC25Mm-C was added in a 2 to 1 molar excess over Ras2p. In these conditions, as deduced from the ability of the eluted fractions to bind [3H]GDP and stimulate the dissociation of Ras2p·[3H]GDP, more than 80% of the GDP free-Ras2p wt was engaged in a stable complex with CDC25Mm-C (Fig. 3A). In contrast to Ras2p wt, the triple mutant did not form a complex with CDC25Mm-C, even in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 3B), like Ras2p R80D/N81D (Fig. 3C). As was previously shown with Sdc25p-C (Poullet et al., 31Poullet P. Créchet J.-B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the complex Ras2p S24N·CDC25Mm (Fig. 3D) required for dissociation much higher concentrations of nucleotide (0.1 mM GDP (Fig. 3E) or GTP (Fig. 3F)) than Ras2p wt (1 µM, not shown). The effect of the R80D/N81D to relieve the S24N effect stresses the importance of Arg80 and Asn81 for the binding to GEF. The existence of a 1:1 stoichiometry between Ras2p and GEF in the stable complex was proved by immunotransfer Western blot analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The analysis of the interaction between the various mutants and GTP or GDP was carried out in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2. The stabilization by this cation of the Ras-nucleotide complex (De Vendittis et al., 8De Vendittis E. Zahn R. Fasano O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161 (a): 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; Hall & Self, 13Hall A. Self A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10963-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was required to obtain dissociation rates measurable by the nitrocellulose binding assay in the case of high concentrations of GEF or fast intrinsic dissociation rates as found for Ras2p S24N (see below). Table I shows that the intrinsic dissociation rate of the GDP complex of the triple mutant was 300 times faster than that of the Ras2p wt complex, corresponding to the fast intrinsic dissociation of Ras2p S24N·GDP, whose rate could, however, still be enhanced by CDC25Mm, to a 10-fold smaller extent than Ras2p wt, whereas the rate of the triple mutant was virtually insensitive to GEF.Table IThe dissociation rate constants (k−1) of the GDP complexes of Ras2p wt, Ras2p R80D/N81D, Ras2p S24N, or Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D as a function of increasing concentrations of CDC25Mm102k′−1Ras2p wtRas2p R80D/N81DRas2p S24NRas2p S24N/R80D/N81Dmin−1&− GEF0.55&±&0.030.79&±&0.03161&±&5160&±&4.2+ CDC25Mm-C (100&nM)10.3&±&0.20.98&±&0.04336&±&11160&±&4.8+ CDC25Mm-C (280&nM)31.1&±&1.42.39&±&0.08NM191&±&6.3+ CDC25Mm-C (830&nM)135&±&3.34.86&±&0.06NM237&±&3.6 Open table in a new tab Because even in the presence of 10 MgCl2 the dissociation rates of the GTP complexes of the triple and S24N mutants were too fast to be measured by the nitrocellulose binding assay, the analysis of these complexes was limited to the calculation of the dissociation constants (K′d) from Scatchard plots, obtained with nucleotide-free Ras2p and GTP concentrations varying between 4 and 80 µM (Table II). The K′d values of the GTP complex of Ras2p S24N (14.4 µM) and the triple mutant (97 µM) lay in the same range and were much higher than that of Ras2p wt (3 nM, Créchet et al., 5Créchet J.-B. Poullet P. Camonis J. Jacquet M. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265 (a): 1563-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The K′d values of their GDP complexes, as determined for concentrations of GDP between 0.2 and 6 µM, were close (1.6 µM for Ras2p S24N and 2.5 µM for the triple mutant) and 1 order of magnitude smaller than those of the GTP complexes.Table IIComparison of the interaction parameters of Ras2p S24N and Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D with GDP and GTPComplexes102k′−110−4k′+1K′dmin−1min−1 m−1µmRas2p S24N·GDP161&±&599.41.6&±&0.08Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D·GDP160&±&4.8642.5&±&0.22Ras2p S24N·GTPNMNM14.4&±&1.6Ras2p S24N/R80D/N81D·GTPNMNM97.0&±&6.2 Open table in a new tab In agreement with our previous observations (Verrotti et al., 40Verrotti A. Créchet J.-B. Di Blasi F. Seidita G. Mirisola M.G. Kavounis C. Nastopoulos V. Burderi E. De Vendittis E. Parmeggiani A. Fasano O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the double mutant displayed virtually the same intrinsic GDP “off” rate as Ras2p wt. As shown in Table I, its response to GEF was not totally abolished, unlike that of the triple mutant. A concentration of 0.83 µM CDC25Mm-C, stimulating 250 times the dissociation rate of Ras2p wt·GDP, was found to increase six times the dissociation rate of the GDP complex of the double mutant. Therefore, the strength of its interaction was 40 times weaker than that of Ras2p wt. To study the effect of the various mutants on the Ras2p wt-dependent adenylyl cyclase activity, cell membranes were prepared from the mutated S. cerevisiae strain AAT3B-Δ1, carrying deletions in RAS1, RAS2, and CDC25 genes (Mirisola et al., 26Mirisola M.G. Seidita G. Verrotti A.C. Di Blasi F. Fasano O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15740-15748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viability of this strain is ensured by the adenylyl cyclase CRI4 mutation that bypasses the requirement for RAS and CDC25 due to a higher intrinsic activity. Because the CRI4-encoded adenylyl cyclase activity is enhanced by the Ras protein much more than the wild type adenylyl cyclase (De Vendittis et al., 9De Vendittis E. Vitelli A. Zahn R. Fasano O. EMBO J. 1986; 15 (b): 3657-3663Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the sensitivity of the assay is increased. It is known that the addition of Ras2p·GDP to yeast membranes from this strain strain as a source of adenylyl cyclase is ineffective in stimulating the cAMP production (Créchet et al., 7Créchet J.-B. Poullet P. Bernardi A. Fasano O. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of GEF restores the adenylyl cyclase activity via the conversion of Ras2p·GDP to Ras2p·GTP. Fig. 4 illustrates the capacity of the various Ras2p mutants to interfere with the action of Ras2p wt in a reconstituted system for adenylyl cyclase activity. Ras2p S24N hinders in a concentration-dependent manner the reconstitution of adenylyl cyclase activity dependent on the regeneration of Ras2p wt·GTP by Cdc25p-C. No difference in the inhibitory effect was observed between the 42-kDa native form and the 29-kDa C-terminal truncated form of Ras2p S24N, further confirming that the C-terminal region of Ras2p, at least if not post-translationally processed, is irrelevant for the interaction with the catalytic domain of GEF.

https://openalex.org/W1493422331,"Through the use of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis we have generated variants of a recombinant human parathyroid (PTH) hormone-(1-34)-homoserine (RPTH) in which a positively charged residue (Arg or Lys), a negatively charged residue (Glu), or a neutral residue (Gly) has been substituted at every position throughout the peptide. These 106 PTH analogs have been tested for their ability to stimulate cAMP production in the rat osteosarcoma cell line, UMR106. Analysis of these peptides led to the construction of several analogs containing multiple substitutions at sites of potential structural importance. Several of these analogs were shown to have 3-5-fold enhanced activity and receptor affinity. Circular dichroism (CD) and lipid binding studies were then performed on these analogs. Circular dichroism demonstrates enhanced helical content in the presence of lipid vesicles, particularly anionic lipid. The [Arg15,19,22,Lys29]RPTH (+6RPTH) analog requires higher concentrations of trifluoroethanol to attain enhanced helicity. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the peptides are blue shifted more in the presence of the anionic lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) than with the zwitterionic lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). Effects of the peptides on the phase transition behavior of DMPC shows that +6RPTH has less effect on the lipid than does RPTH. This difference in lipid interaction is also exhibited with isothermal titration calorimetry, in which RPTH reacts exothermally with DMPG, while +6RPTH shows little or no heat change. The pH dependence of binding of the hydrophobic probe 1,1'-bis(4-anilino)-naphthalene-5,5'-trisulfonic acid, also shows a difference in exposure of hydrophobic sites between RPTH and +6RPTH. The +6RPTH has about a 5-fold greater affinity for receptor binding. We suggest that this enhanced activity is a consequence of the altered lipid interaction of +6RPTH, combined with increased conformational flexibility, particularly in the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecule."

To determine the substrate requirements for this cleavage, we have constructed a series of mutations in the cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, and juxtamembrane region of CSF-1256 and stably expressed the mutated genes in NIH 3T3 cells. Our results demonstrate that membrane association of the CSF-1 precursor is required for cleavage of its growth factor ectodomain and furthermore that the juxtamembrane region Pro161-Gln162-Leu163-Gln164-Glu165 (PQLQE) (residues 161–165 of the ectodomain) is an essential determinant of cell surface CSF-1256 cleavage and that the cleavage site is partially sequence-specific. Furthermore, a mechanism of steric hindrance, which likely involves interference with protease accessibility, is postulated to explain the observed decreases in the cleavage efficiency in certain CSF-1 mutants. Finally, our results strongly suggest that the CSF-1 ectodomain is cleaved at or very near the cell surface by a membrane-associated proteolytic system.

Certain cell surface proteins are proteolytically cleaved to release their ectodomains into the extracellular compartment. These proteins vary greatly in structure and function and include cell surface growth factors, ectoenzymes, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), 1The abbreviations used are: β-APPβ-amyloid precursor proteinCSF-1 or M-CSFmacrophage colony-stimulating factorTGFtransforming growth factorTNFtumor necrosis factorPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTMtransmembrane domainWTwild type. which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Ehlers and Riordan, 8Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10065-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage allows for switching from the membrane-localized activity of certain cell surface growth factors and ectoenzymes to the diffusible activity associated with soluble growth factors and enzymes (Ehlers and Riordan, 8Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10065-10074Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar; Massagué and Pandiella, 23Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Furthermore, membrane receptors and cell adhesion molecules undergo cleavage with subsequent release of their extracellular domains, which can then act as soluble antagonists of the factors they bind (Fernández-Botran, 9Fernández-Botran R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar; Gordon, 10Gordon M.Y. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar; Rose-John and Heinrich, 35Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C.

CSF-1256 (M-CSFα) is one of the growth factors that is cleaved from the cell surface to yield biologically active soluble growth factors (Rettenmier et al., 34Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A.

CSF-1 is a disulfide-linked dimeric glycoprotein regulating the growth, differentiation, and survival of cells of monocytic lineage (Stanley et al., 42Stanley E.R. Guilbert L.J. Tushinski R.J.

It also plays an important role in the regulation of placental development and in bone osteoclast survival (Arceci et al., 2Arceci R.J. Shanahan F. Stanley E.R. Pollard J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The largest human CSF-1 precursor of 554 amino acids (CSF-1544, CSF-1β) is not expressed on the cell surface but is proteolytically cleaved within the cell and released into the extracellular compartment as both a soluble glycoprotein and a proteoglycan form with glycosaminoglycan chains (Rettenmier and Roussel, 32Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5026-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Price et al., 29Price L.K.H. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L. Stanley E.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4345-4348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the smallest CSF-1 precursor of 256 amino acids (CSF-1256) is stably expressed on the cell surface (Rettenmier et al., 34Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Ralph P. Price K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and it is cell surface CSF-1256 that is biologically active in stimulating adjacent cells that express CSF-1 receptors (Stein et al., 45Stein J. Borzillo G.V. Rettenmier C.W. Blood. 1990; 76: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the growth factor domain of CSF-1256 is released from the cell surface into the extracellular medium by a regulated process of proteolytic cleavage. The rate of this cleavage is slow in unstimulated cells, but it is accelerated when cells are stimulated by certain agonists such as protein kinase C activators (Stein and Rettenmier, 44Stein J. Rettenmier C.W. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, no protease(s) responsible for ectodomain cleavage of cell surface proteins has been identified. Furthermore, the structural determinants that specify such cleavage have not been clearly elucidated. We have therefore used the cell surface CSF-1256 cleavage system as a model to define the structural determinants that are required for cell surface protein ectodomain cleavage. In this study, we show that cell membrane association of CSF-1256 is required for its cleavage and that the CSF-1 juxtamembrane region (residues 150–165) is essential in determining the cleavage. In addition, a mechanism of steric hindrance, which likely involves interference with protease accessibility, might explain the observed decreases in the cleavage efficiency in certain CSF-1 mutants. Finally, we show that the cleavage of CSF-1256 occurs at or very near the cell surface and is mediated by a membrane-bound proteolytic enzyme system. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mM glutamine, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 µg/ml). Human WT CSF-1256 cDNA (Kawasaki et al., 16Kawasaki E.S. Ladner M.B. Wang A.M. Van-Arsdell J. Warren M.K. Coyne M.Y. Schweickart V.L. Lee M.-T. Wilson K.J. Boosman A. Stanley E.R. Ralph P. Mark D.F. Science. 1985; 230: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescriptIISK(PD), a vector modified from pBluescriptIISK(−) (Stratagene) by deleting part of the polylinker region (674–719) to facilitate subcloning. A polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis technique was used for generation of each mutation (Steffan et al., 43Steffan N.H. Henry D.H. Robert M.H. Jeffrey K.P. Larry R.P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Two internal mutagenizing primers and two external nonmutagenizing primers were used to generate two mutant DNA fragments having overlapping ends. These fragments were purified and used to serve as the template for a secondary polymerase chain reaction with the two external primers to produce the appropriate length of mutant DNA fragment. The secondary polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned back into pBluescriptIISK(PD) CSF-1256. Only one internal mutagenizing primer containing the restriction enzyme site and one external nonmutagenizing primer were used if there was an appropriate restriction enzyme site near the site to be mutated. All sequences produced by polymerase chain reaction were confirmed by DNA sequencing using Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutant forms of CSF-1 cDNA in the pBluescriptIISK(PD) vectors were subcloned into an expression retroviral vector PSM, which is a replication-defective vector derived from the SM strain of feline sarcoma virus (Roussel et al., 36Roussel M.F. Dull T.J. Rettenmier C.W. Ralph P. Ullrich A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1987; 325: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Restriction mapping was used to confirm the correct orientation of the inserts for expression. To generate stable transfectants, NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with circular plasmid DNA and pSV2neo by the CaPO4 coprecipitation technique. G418-resistant cell lines were screened by immunoprecipitation to identify stable cell lines that express mutant CSF-1 forms. Cells expressing WT or mutant CSF-1 forms were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min and chased with complete medium containing 20 × methionine for 1 h for CSF-1256 to express on cell surface. Then the 35S label was chased in the same medium for variable amounts of time in the absence or presence of 0.5 µM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) as indicated. The medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with 2% aprotinin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors for immunoprecipitation. For metabolic labeling under tunicamycin treatment, cells were preincubated for 4 h in medium with tunicamycin (2 µg/ml) and labeled and chased in the continued presence of the drug. Cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM glucose. The cells were incubated in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mMD-glucose, 1.0 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Corp.), 75 µg of lactoperoxidase, and 8.8 µg of glucose oxidase (Sigma) for 5 min at 22°C and another 5 min at 4°C with occasional gentle agitation. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, the cells were incubated at 37°C for variable amounts of time in complete medium with or without 0.5 µM PMA as indicated (Stein and Rettenmier, 44Stein J. Rettenmier C.W. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar). The medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer with 2% aprotinin and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors for immunoprecipitation. The primary antibody used was the YYG-106 rat monoclonal antibody (Stanley, 41Stanley E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 116: 564-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) precoated with a goat anti-rat IgG (Cappel) as immunoadsorbant. The control for nonspecific precipitation was performed using an isotype-matched rat myeloma protein. Washed immune precipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Anderson et al., 1Anderson S.J. Gonda M.A. Rettenmier C.W. Sherr C.J. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 730-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were detected by fluorography and quantitated with Betascope 603 (Betagen). Murine CSF-1 produced by parental NIH 3T3 cells was not detected by immunoprecipitation (Rettenmier et al., 34Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Ralph P. Price K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weights of the labeled proteins were determined by comparison with the mobilities of protein molecular weight standards. The CSF-1256 precursor consists of an amino-terminal signal peptide, a growth factor domain, a small juxtamembrane region, and a transmembrane domain (TM) followed by a short cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). CSF-1256 is synthesized as a 68-kDa disulfide-linked dimeric glycoprotein whose two identical subunits undergo sequential cleavage to yield a 56-kDa membrane-associated heterodimeric intermediate and a final soluble 44-kDa dimeric growth factor. The cleavage can be accelerated by PMA (Fig. 1B) (Stein and Rettenmier, 44Stein J. Rettenmier C.W. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether the cytoplasmic tail is required for the cleavage, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with mutant CSF-1256 cDNA encoding CSF-1256-TC31 in which the carboxyl terminus (31 amino acids) of the cytoplasmic region (36 amino acids) was truncated. CSF-1256-TC31 was expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 1B). Similar to the cleavage of wild type (WT) CSF-1256, it was cleaved slowly under basal conditions, and the cleavage was accelerated by the addition of PMA (Fig. 1B). To define the role of the transmembrane domain in the cleavage, a CSF-1 mutant with the deletion of 16 amino acids (residues 170–185) in the transmembrane domain (CSF-1256-ΔTM16) was produced and stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. CSF-1256-ΔTM16 was not expressed on the cell surface as demonstrated by cell surface radioiodination (data not shown). After metabolic labeling of cells expressing CSF-1256-ΔTM16, full-length CSF-1256-ΔTM16 with a molecular mass of 64 kDa was secreted into the medium without cleavage (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the secretion of CSF-1256-ΔTM16 was not stimulated by PMA (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that membrane association of the CSF-1256 precursor is required for the cleavage. To define the role of the juxtamembrane region in the cleavage process, four deletion mutants spanning this region were constructed and stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Deletion of 156–160 (CSF-1256-Δ156-160), containing the cleavage site 157–159 (Halenbeck et al., 13Halenbeck R. Shadle P.J. Lee P.J. Lee M.T. Koths K. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 8: 45-58Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), reduced the rate of cleavage to about 30% of the rate of WT as determined by quantitative fluorography (Fig. 2). Deletion of residues 150–156 (CSF-1256-Δ150-156), N-terminal to the cleavage site, reduced the rate of cleavage to about 20% of the rate of WT (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). In marked contrast, deletions of 5 or 7 amino acids, C-terminal to the cleavage site and immediately N-terminal to the start of the transmembrane domain, CSF-1256-Δ159-165 or CSF-1256-Δ161-165, completely abolished the cleavage (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Abolished or reduced cleavage of these mutant CSF-1 proteins was not due to transport deficiency of these proteins, since all of these mutants were expressed on the cell surface with similar efficiency to WT CSF-1256 as demonstrated by cell surface radioiodination (data not shown). These studies strongly suggest that the juxtamembrane region PQLQE (residues 161–165) is essential for cleavage and that region 150–160 contributes to the efficiency of the cleavage.Fig. 3Effect of mutations in the juxtamembrane region on PMA-activated CSF-1256cleavage. NIH 3T3 cells expressing CSF-1256 mutants were metabolically pulse-labeled for 20 min, chased for 1 h in complete medium for maturation (Time 0), and chased in fresh medium for 3 h in the presence of 0.5 µM PMA (Time 3 h). Cell lysates (Time 0 and 3 h) and medium (Time 3 h) were harvested and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to CSF-1. The products were resolved by SDS-PAGE with disulfide reduction followed by fluorography. C, cell lysate; M, medium. The apparent molecular masses of CSF-1 bands are noted in kDa on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the PQLQE region, a series of deletions were constructed and stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2). Deletion of region 161–162 (CSF-1256-Δ161-162) or region 163–165 (CSF-1256-Δ163-165) dramatically reduced the rate of cleavage (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Furthermore, deletion of even one amino acid, Pro161 or Gln162, also substantially reduced the cleavage efficiency (Fig. 2). A series of substitution mutants were also constructed and stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells to test the effects of amino acids with different side chain size and/or charge and amino acids that might change the normal secondary structure of the juxtamembrane region in CSF-1256 protein (Fig. 2). Pro161 was mutated to Ala, Gly, or Ser. Each of these three substitutions interfered with the cleavage process. Of the three mutations, Pro161Ser reduced the rate of cleavage the most as compared with that of WT (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Gln162 was mutated to Glu, Lys, or Pro. Each of the three mutant CSF-1256 forms was cleaved as efficiently as WT (Fig. 2). Substitutions, including change of Leu163 to Pro, Gln164 to Glu, Gln164 to Lys, and Glu165 to Gln, did not interfere with cleavage (Fig. 2). However, substitution of Leu163-Gln164 with Ile-Pro substantially reduced the rate of cleavage (Fig. 2). These results are summarized in Fig. 2 and show that the PQLQE region (residues 161–165) is essential for cleavage, that the length of this PQLQE region is critical, and that the amino acid sequence requirement in this PQLQE region is partially specific. Results from a previous study suggest that cell surface CSF-1256 is cleaved at or near Ser158 (Halenbeck et al., 13Halenbeck R. Shadle P.J. Lee P.J. Lee M.T. Koths K. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 8: 45-58Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A deletion encompassing the cleavage site (CSF-1256-Δ156-160) substantially reduced the rate of cleavage but did not completely abolish the cleavage, suggesting that the cleavage is partially sequence-specific in this region. To test this point further, we changed Ser158-160 to amino acids with different side chain size and charge, including CSF-1256-Lys158-160, CSF-1256-Ala158-160, CSF-1256-Asp158-160, and CSF-1256-Leu158-160. All of these amino acid replacements reduced the cleavage efficiency (Fig. 2). Asp substitution reduced the rate of cleavage to about 20% of the rate of WT. Leu and Lys substitutions reduced the rate of cleavage to about 40% of the rate of WT, whereas Ala substitution had the least effect on cleavage. These studies therefore show that the cleavage site of CSF-1256 is partially sequence-specific. Deletion of region 150–156 in CSF-1256 severely impaired cleavage (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). This deletion is located N-terminal to the cleavage site as well as the essential PQLQE region. One possible explanation for the marked decrease in cleavage when residues 150–156 are deleted is that this deletion may bring the CSF-1 growth factor domain closer to the plasma membrane, which interferes with the protease accessibility. To test this, we analyzed the effects of reducing the size of the CSF-1256 globular structure on the cleavage. CSF-1256 is a heavily glycosylated protein, which contains only N-linked oligosaccharides with terminal sialic acids (Rettenmier and Roussel, 32Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5026-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The canonical sugar attachment sites are Asn122 and Asn140, which are located near the cleavage site (Fig. 1A). Therefore, tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation (Kuo and Lampen, 20Kuo S.C. Lampen J.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 58: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was used to reduce the size of the CSF-1256 globular structure by removing the N-linked oligosaccharides. The ectodomain cleavage of WT CSF-1256 with tunicamycin treatment is similar to that without tunicamycin treatment. In the presence of tunicamycin, WT CSF-1256 was synthesized as 46-kDa homodimeric polypeptide, and its two subunits were cleaved slowly into 41-kDa membrane-bound heterodimeric intermediate and 37-kDa soluble CSF-1 (Fig. 4). The cleavage was activated by PMA (Fig. 4). Similarly, the cleavage rate of CSF-1256-Pro161Ser was not changed by tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 4). Furthermore, CSF-1256-Δ161-165 was still not cleaved in the presence of tunicamycin, which further demonstrates the essential role of the PQLQE region in the cleavage (Fig. 4). In marked contrast, the cleavage rate of CSF-1256-Δ150-156 was increased from 20% to more than 90% of the rate of WT by tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 4). Likewise, the cleavage rate of CSF-1256-Δ156-160 was increased by tunicamycin treatment (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the N-linked oligosaccharides in CSF-1 mutants with a shorter juxtamembrane region sterically interfere with the accessibility of the protease(s), therefore reducing the cleavage rate. Calcium ionophores have been shown to activate the cleavage of certain cell surface proteins such as pro-TGFα (Pandiella and Massagué, 25Pandiella A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5769-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test their role in CSF-1256 cleavage, NIH 3T3 cells expressing CSF-1256 were metabolically labeled and chased with medium containing calcium ionophores. In contrast to PMA, the calcium ionophores A23187 (Fig. 5) and ionomycin (500 nM, data not shown) did not stimulate the cleavage of CSF-1256. Cell surface radioiodinated CSF-1256 can be cleaved into soluble CSF-1 (Fig. 1), which demonstrates that cell surface CSF-1256 can serve as the immediate precursor for cleavage. This raised the question of whether or not the cleavage occurs at or near the cell surface or in the lysosomal compartment, which is the cellular site of general membrane protein degradation. Cell surface detection of the heterodimeric intermediate of 56 kDa that contains one proteolyzed polypeptide chain (22 kDa) assembled through disulfide bonds to an intact subunit (34 kDa) (Fig. 1) favors the first explanation. To further test this, the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine (Kornfeld and Mellman, 18Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar) was used. Chloroquine did not prevent either constitutive or PMA-induced cleavage of CSF-1256 (Fig. 5). These studies suggest that the lysosomal compartment is not involved in the cleavage process. We also asked whether CSF-1256 is cleaved before it is transported to the cell surface. To answer this question, we used brefeldin A, an agent that blocks Golgi functions by inducing a resorption of the Golgi apparatus into the endoplasmic reticulum, and fusion of the trans-Golgi network with the endosomal system (Klausner et al., 17Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Normal CSF-1256 maturation was blocked under brefeldin A treatment, and an underglycosylated CSF-1256 with a smaller molecular mass (62 kDa) was detected (Fig. 6A). Both constitutive and PMA-induced cleavage of CSF-1256 were blocked if brefeldin A was present from the start of labeling (Fig. 6A). In contrast, brefeldin A did not prevent the cleavage if CSF-1256 had been chased to the cell surface (Fig. 6B). Resistance of CSF-1256 to ectodomain cleavage was not due to underglycosylation of this protein by brefeldin A treatment, since nonglycosylated CSF-1256 can be cleaved (Fig. 4). Thus, brefeldin A prevents the cleavage by blocking the transport of CSF-1256 to the cell surface, suggesting that the cleavage occurs in subcellular sites post Golgi compartment. Collectively, these results indicate that the cleavage system operates at or near the plasma membrane and outside the Golgi or lysosomal compartments. We have used CSF-1256 as a model system for the ectodomain cleavage of cell surface transmembrane proteins. Previous work has shown that CSF-1256 is expressed on the cell surface, where it contacts and activates CSF-1 receptors on adjacent cells (Rettenmier et al., 34Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Ralph P. Price K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar; Stein et al., 45Stein J. Borzillo G.V. Rettenmier C.W.

The growth factor domain is released very slowly by proteolytic cleavage, and this process is activated by phorbol ester (Rettenmier et al., 34Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Ralph P. Price K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2378-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar; Stein and Rettenmier, 44Stein J. Rettenmier C.W. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar). The present results identify and characterize the structural determinants required for the release of the CSF-1256 extracellular growth factor domain and demonstrate that the proteolytic cleavage system operates at or very near the cell surface. The PQLQE region (residues 161–165) is the essential determinant of the cleavage, and the region 150–160 encompassing the cleavage site contributes to the cleavage efficiency. The coding regions for all of the three CSF-1 cDNA forms isolated so far share a common amino-terminal domain of 149 amino acids that contains the entire CSF-1 cytokine module, forming a globular structure (Bazan, 3Bazan J.F. Cell. 1991; 65: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; Pandit et al., 27Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, CSF-1256 is cleaved at or near Ser158 (Halenbeck et al., 13Halenbeck R. Shadle P.J. Lee P.J. Lee M.T. Koths K. J. Biotechnol. 1988; 8: 45-58Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, native conformation including dimer formation of CSF-1256 growth factor domain is not required for the cleavage. 2P. Deng, Y.-L. Wang, P. K. Pattengale, and C. W. Rettenmier, submitted for publication. Therefore, we hypothesize that the juxtamembrane region from Gly150 to Glu165 might play an important role in the cleavage. To test this hypothesis a series of mutants with systematic structural alterations were constructed: first, deletions to identify the regions required for cleavage; second, substitutions of amino acids with different side chain size and/or charge; and third, amino acid substitutions that might change the local secondary structure. These substitution mutants were constructed to define the amino acid specificity. We show that deletions of PQLQE region 161–165 or region 159–165 abolish the cleavage, whereas deletions of region 150–156 or 156–160 only reduce the rate of the cleavage. Further deletions and substitutions show that the length of this region is critical and that the amino acid requirement in this region is partially sequence-specific. It should be noted that substitution of residue Gln162 or Leu163 with proline had no inhibitory effect on the cleavage. Since proline places a higher constraint on the polypeptide backbone than any other amino acid and disrupts the regular secondary structure features of proteins (Yaron and Naider, 49Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that distortion of the native secondary structure of CSF-1256 in this region does not interfere with the ectodomain cleavage. We propose that the PQLQE region may serve as a binding site for the unidentified protease(s) to CSF-1256 prior to the cleavage process (Fig. 7). Our data show that the deletion of region 156–160 encompassing the cleavage site as well as the substitutions of Ser158-160 with different amino acids reduces the rate of the cleavage but does not abolish it completely. This suggests that this region is not essential but contributes to the cleavage efficiency and that there is partial sequence specificity required for cleavage. The fact that the cleavage is only partially dependent on the amino acid side chain identity in the region 156–165 containing the cleavage site and putative enzyme binding site may reflect the involvement of multiple proteases with distinct sequence specificities. Alternatively, cleavage may be caused by a single protease with a relaxed amino acid sequence specificity. Experiments utilizing glycosylation inhibitors coupled with experiments using mutants with altered length of the juxtamembrane region suggest that steric hindrance of protease accessibility interferes with the cleavage of certain CSF-1 mutants. This finding may provide an explanation for the mechanism by which the extracellular domains of certain cell surface proteins such as low density lipoprotein receptor are rapidly released from the cell surface by the proteolytic system in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells with a defect in protein O-glycosylation (Kozarsky et al., 19Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; Reddy et al., 31Reddy P. Caras I. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17329-17336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By inference from our findings, it is possible that the stalk-associated O-linked oligosaccharides in these cell surface proteins do not directly protect them from the ectodomain cleavage but interfere with the cleavage by steric hindrance of protease accessibility. Existence of critical juxtamembrane determinants might be a general mechanism for cell surface transmembrane protein cleavage. Mutations in the cleavage site or its surrounding region inhibit or abolish the cleavage of certain cell surface proteins such as TGFα (Wong et al., 48Wong S.T. Winchell L.F. McCune B.K. Earp H.S.

Deletion and substitution mutants in the juxtamembrane region of β-APP, including a deletion of amino acids 5–24 (numbered from the start of Aβ) within Aβ as well as a deletion of amino acids 11–28, still allow for efficient cleavage (Sisodia, 39Sisodia S.S.

Commun. 1991; 179: 1670-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By inference from our results, the explanation may be that β-APP has a very long exposed juxtamembrane stalk region. After 18 or 20 amino acid deletions in this region, the mutant β-APPs may still have the appropriate length of the exposed stalk region, which contains the enzyme binding site and cleavage site and allows for the steric accessibility of the protease as well. Consistent with our assumption, it has been documented that more extensive deletions of juxtamembrane region in a modified β-APP (APP770Δ35) abolish the cleavage (Sisodia et al., 40Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Significant differences might exist between some components of the proteolytic system responsible for the cleavage of various groups of proteins. The cytoplasmic C-terminal valine of pro-TGFα is essential for the cleavage (Bosenberg et al., 4Bosenberg M.W. Pandiella A. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1157-1165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the cytoplasmic domains of cell surface CSF-1256, β-APP (Hung and Selkoe, 15Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) are not. In addition, calcium ionophores activate the cleavage of pro-TGF-α (Pandiella and Massagué, 25Pandiella A. Massagué J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, protease inhibitors blocking the cleavage of pro-TGFα, KL-1, and KL-2 (Pandiella et al., 26Pandiella A. Bosenberg M.W. Huang E.J. Besmer P. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24028-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) do not inhibit the cleavage of either CSF-1256 (data not shown) or ACE (Ramchandran et al., 30Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that TNFα protease inhibitor does not affect the proteolytic processing of CSF-1554 while abolishing the ectodomain cleavage of the interleukin-6 receptor and the p60 TNF receptor (Müllberg et al., 24Müllberg J. Durie F.H. Otten-Evans C. Alderson M.R. Rose-John S. Cosman D. Black R.A. Mohler K.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5198-5205PubMed Google Scholar). It would have been more informative to test the effect of TNFα protease inhibitor on the cleavage of CSF-1256, since it is CSF-1256, not CSF-1554, that belongs to the family of cell surface proteins undergoing ectodomain cleavage (Rettenmier and Roussel, 32Rettenmier C.W. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5026-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Stein and Rettenmier, 44Stein J. Rettenmier C.W. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 601-605PubMed Google Scholar). The results in this study strongly suggest that the extracellular growth factor domain of CSF-1256 is cleaved and released into the extracellular compartment by a membrane-associated proteolytic enzyme(s). First, a mutant CSF-1256 precursor lacking a functional membrane-anchoring domain is released intact without being cleaved, although it still contains the essential cleavage determinant PQLQE, the authentic cleavage site, and the appropriate length of juxtamembrane stalk region. Second, direct phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of CSF-1256 by a PMA-activated protein kinase C appears not to be the mechanism for activation of the cleavage, since deletion of the cytoplasmic domain does not interfere with the cleavage. Therefore, it is possible that the protease(s) involved is a transmembrane protein(s), the cytoplasmic domain of which directly or indirectly interacts with protein kinase C. We have synthesized the results of this study in the proposed model for CSF-1256 ectodomain cleavage (Fig. 7). Homodimeric CSF-1256 of 68 kDa is expressed on the cell surface with the 16-amino acid juxtamembrane region (residues 150–165) being long enough to allow for the accessibility of the putative membrane-associated proteolytic enzyme(s) to the CSF-1256 substrate. One domain of the proteolytic enzyme(s) recognizes and binds to the essential determinant PQLQE (residues 161–165). This binding leads to certain conformational changes of the enzyme(s) and brings the cleaving domain of the enzyme(s) close to the cleavage site (residues 157–159) suitable for cleavage and located at a specified distance of approximately 7–9 amino acids from the plasma membrane. Subsequently, the 44-kDa extracellular growth factor domain of CSF-1256 is cleaved and released into the extracellular compartment. Since the two identical subunits are not always cleaved at the same time, a membrane-bound 56-kDa heterodimeric intermediate is often detectable on the cell surface. Mutations that change the essential binding determinant of the protease(s), mutations that change the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site, or mutations that sterically interfere with the enzyme accessibility can reduce or abolish the cleavage.

Under high light conditions, the translation rate of D1 mRNA is 50-100 times greater than those of other PS II proteins, and defective PS II is repaired by inserting newly synthesized D1 into photoinhibited PS II (9Kyle D.J.

Light-induced degradation of D1 is retarded by photoaccumulation of plastoquinol at the QB site (17Zer H. Pràšil O. Ohad I. J. Biol.

Therefore, it has been proposed that degradation of damaged D1 is regulated by conformation of the acceptor side of PS II, which is affected by QB site occupation by plastoquinone or herbicides (23Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21293-21299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for changes in the conformation of the QB site induced by herbicide binding includes the apparent influence of herbicides on the accessibility of trypsin to the target arginine residue located near the QB site in D1 (18Jansen M.A.K.

Therefore, it has been hypothesized that D1 with conformationally modified QB sites is selectively degraded by a further proteolytic process. Degradation of D1 is initiated by cleavage at specific sites, resulting in several distinct fragments.

However, the precise site of cleavage has not been determined. Since this loop domain serves as the binding site for QB plastoquinone as well as various kinds of herbicides, primary cleavage in this region appears consistent with a conformational change around the QB site, leading to subsequent degradation of photodamaged D1. The effects of various herbicides and PS II inhibitors on the stability of D1 were studied in an attempt to demonstrate that its degradation can be induced in the absence of photoinhibitory conditions through changes in the conformation of the D-E loop domain. Recently, we demonstrated that under dark conditions, D1 is selectively and specifically cleaved into two fragments with apparent molecular masses of 23 and 9 kDa when the QB site is occupied by PNO8, a highly potent PS II inhibitor that specifically inhibits electron transport between QA and QB (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). PNO8 belongs to the category of phenol-type PS II inhibitors (32Yoneyama K. Konnai M. Honda I. Yoshida S. Takahashi N. Koike H. Inoue Y. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1990; 45: 317-321Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) because it contains the characteristic phenol nucleus and other structural features essential for phenol-type inhibitors (33Trebst A. Donner W. Draber W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1984; 39: 405-411Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PS II of atrazine-resistant plants has increased sensitivity both to phenol-type inhibitors and to PNO8 due to replacement of Ser-264 by Gly in the D1 protein (32Yoneyama K. Konnai M. Honda I. Yoshida S. Takahashi N. Koike H. Inoue Y. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1990; 45: 317-321Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PNO8 has a quite unique chemical structure due to its phloroglucinol nucleus. In a previous study, PNO8-dependent cleavage of D1 was suppressed at low temperatures and by inhibitors of serine-type proteases, but was not inhibited by the absence of oxygen (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The 23- and 9-kDa fragments are also generated as degradation products by photoinhibitory illumination in the absence of PNO8 (27Salter A.H. Virgin I. Hagman Å. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3990-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28De Las Rivas J. Andersson B. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, binding of PNO8 to the QB site seems to induce conformational changes that are similar to those induced by photodamage in the D-E loop domain, triggering proteolytic cleavage. However, the population of D1 cleaved by PNO8 was limited to a minor fraction of the total PS II, despite PNO8 binding at QB sites in all PS II centers (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This suggests that PNO8-dependent cleavage of D1 requires certain specific conditions. In this study, the selective and specific cleavage of D1 induced by PNO8 is further characterized. It is demonstrated that PNO8 binding to the QB site leads to cleavage of the fraction of D1 that has been modified during illumination before the addition of PNO8. Possible mechanisms to explain the effects of preillumination are discussed. In addition, the site of PNO8-induced cleavage in D1 was studied to further characterize the proteolytic mechanism. Thylakoid membranes were prepared from market spinach as described previously (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). They were resuspended in 400 mM sucrose, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 40 mM MES/NaOH (pH 6.5) and stored in liquid nitrogen. BBY-type O2-evolving PS II membranes were prepared from spinach and seedlings of wheat by solubilization with Triton X-100 as described previously (34Ono T. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 443-449Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). O2-evolving PS II core particles were fractionated by centrifugation following solubilization of the PS II membranes with n-heptyl thioglucoside according to the method of Enami et al. (35Enami I. Kamino K. Shen J.-R. Satoh K. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 33-39Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with modifications. PS II reaction center complexes were prepared from PS II membranes following Triton X-100 solubilization according to the method of Nanba and Satoh (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. After thawing, samples were washed and suspended in assay buffer containing 400 mM sucrose, 20 mM NaCl, and 40 mM MES/NaOH (pH 6.5). All procedures were carried out under a dim green light or in complete darkness, unless otherwise noted. The samples were then incubated in the dark for at least 2 h at 0°C, after which further treatments were applied. The sample suspension was incubated with PNO8 in complete darkness at 25°C. PNO8 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and this was added to the sample such that the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the suspension mixture was <1% (v/v). For preillumination, the sample suspension at 25°C was illuminated with white light (50 mW/cm2 unless otherwise noted) filtered through heat-absorbing and neutral density filters prior to the addition of PNO8 in the dark. The sample concentrations during PNO8 treatment were 400, 200, 80, and 4 µg of Chl/ml for thylakoid membranes, PS II membranes, O2-evolving core particles, and reaction center complexes, respectively. The following buffers were used to treat the samples with PNO8 at various pH values: 40 mM MES/NaOH for pH 4.5-6.8, HEPES/NaOH for pH 7.1-7.5, and Tricine/NaOH for pH 8.0-8.5, supplemented with 400 mM sucrose and 20 mM NaCl. After incubation, the treated membranes were quickly frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until protein analysis. Digestion of wheat PS II membranes by lysylendopeptidase was carried out according to the methods described by Miyao et al. (15Miyao M. Ikeuchi M. Yamamoto N. Ono T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10019-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A 120-µl sample of a suspension consisting of 200 µg of Chl/ml of PS II membranes was supplemented with 6 µl of 1.0 M Tris, 1.8 µl of 0.2 M EDTA, 18 µl of 1% (w/v) SDS, and 30 µl of 4 units/ml lysylendopeptidase (Acromobacter; Wako) and then was incubated at 30°C for 1 h in the dark to allow digestion. SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis was carried out according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) with a 13% (w/v) polyacrylamide separation gel containing 5 M urea (1-mm thickness). The sample was solubilized in 60 mM Tris, 60 mM dithiothreitol, 3% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate, 0.003% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 6% (w/v) sucrose at 0°C for 30 min in the dark. The separated polypeptides were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane with a pore size of 0.2 µm (Schleicher & Schuell), as described by Towbin et al. (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.05% (w/v) SDS with a semidry-type blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 10 V at room temperature for 2 h. D1 and its fragments were probed with four different rabbit antisera, raised against D1 from spinach (provided by Dr. M. Ikeuchi, University of Tokyo) and against synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to Thr-227-Glu-235, Phe-239-Asn-247, and Glu-333-Ala-344 of spinach D1. Each oligopeptide was designed to have an extra cysteine residue at its N terminus, through which a peptide was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). Immunoreacted polypeptide bands were immunodetected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibody raised against rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and visualized by reaction with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and bromochloroindolyl phosphate (Sigma). Densitometric determination of immunoreacted bands was carried out using an image scanner (ATTO densitograph system). O2 evolution was measured at 25°C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode placed in assay buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM phenyl-p-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor. PNO8 was synthesized and separated using a silica gel column (38Honda I. Yoneyama K. Konnai M. Takahashi N. Yoshida S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 1071-1072Crossref Google Scholar). PNO8 was then highly purified by high performance liquid chromatography with an octadecyl silica gel column (Pegasil ODS, Senshu Pack) using acetonitrile/H2O/formic acid (87.5:12.4:0.1, v/v) as the solvent system. The structure of synthesized PNO8 was confirmed by 1H NMR, IR, and mass spectroscopy. No derivatives were detected during storage in dimethyl sulfoxide. Fig. 1 shows the effects of preillumination on PNO8-induced cleavage of D1. PS II membranes were illuminated under white light at 50 mW/cm2 for 0.5 s in the absence of PNO8. PNO8 was added, and the membranes were further incubated for 60 min in the dark. The treated membranes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and D1 and its cleavage products were detected immunologically using D1 antiserum. As reported previously, incubation in the dark of membranes with PNO8 but without preillumination induced cleavage of D1, yielding two fragments of 23 and 9 kDa (Fig. 1, lane c) (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The band of the 23-kDa fragment appeared as a doublet due to interference of the psbS gene product (39Wedel N. Klein R. Ljungberg U. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) superimposed on the fragment. When the PS II membranes were illuminated prior to the addition of PNO8, the quantity of the two bands of the fragments increased markedly to at least five times greater than the quantity induced without preillumination (lane d). Since the positions of the fragments in the preilluminated membranes were exactly the same as those without preillumination and no new fragments were detected in the preilluminated membranes, probably in both cases, D1 is cleaved at the same site. D2 was not cleaved by PNO8 treatment even after preillumination (data not shown). As shown in lanes c and d, PNO8 treatment induced the formation of a heterodimer between D1 and D2 revealed as a 60-kDa band, and preillumination also stimulated accumulation of the heterodimer. It is worthwhile to note that photoinhibitory illumination also leads to the formation of this heterodimer band (8Andersson B. Ponticos M. Barber J. Koivuniemi A. Aro E.-M. Hagman Å. Salter A.H. Dan-Hui Y. Lindahl M. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis: From Molecular Mechanisms to the Field. β-IOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford1994: 143-159Google Scholar, 14Miyao M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9722-9730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the effect of preillumination on the cleavage of D1 induced by PNO8 in thylakoid membranes, PS II membranes, O2-evolving PS II core particles, and PS II reaction center complexes. Preillumination was as described for Fig. 1. Preillumination stimulated the accumulation of the two fragments in the thylakoid membranes (Fig. 2, lane c) and core particles (lane i) as in the PS II membranes (lane f), but no other new fragments were induced by preillumination. In contrast, D1 was not cleaved in the reaction center complexes, even in the presence of PNO8, irrespective of preillumination. It is unlikely that loss of D1 cleavage is due to the absence of O2 evolution capability in the complexes because preillumination enhances PNO8-dependent D1 degradation in PS II membranes depleted of the manganese cluster (data not shown). It has been reported that the reaction center complexes bind some phenol-type herbicides, diuron and atrazine, with somewhat lower affinity compared with thylakoids (40Giardi M.T. Marder J.B. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 934: 64-71Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It therefore might be assumed that PNO8 binds to the reaction center complexes, but does not induce the cleavage of D1. Perhaps this is due to large perturbations on the acceptor side of PS II that occur during preparation, but we cannot rule out the possibility that PNO8 is incapable of binding to the QB site in the reaction center complexes. Alternatively, some proteinaceous factor responsible for D1 degradation may be absent in these preparations. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the PNO8-dependent D1 cleavage on the light intensity of preillumination. The quantity of the 23-kDa fragment induced by preillumination was plotted against the light intensity. The quantity of the 23-kDa fragment band increased rapidly with increasing light intensity and reached saturation at ∼100 mW/cm2. At this intensity, O2 evolution by PS II membranes was only 8% saturated. Clearly, the light intensity required for PNO8-dependent cleavage is much lower than that needed for O2 evolution. It has been proposed that active oxygen species including 1O2, superoxide, and H2O2 are responsible for the damage to D1 (13Mishra N.P. Francke C. van Gorkom H.J. Ghanotakis D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 81-90Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Miyao M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9722-9730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Miyao M. Ikeuchi M. Yamamoto N. Ono T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13244-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It might be assumed that such species are generated during preillumination and are responsible for the stimulation of the PNO8-dependent cleavage of D1. However, O2 does not directly participate in the mechanism of D1 cleavage induced by PNO8 (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Active oxygen species are generated at the acceptor side (41Ananyev G. Renger G. Wacker U. Kilimov V. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or at the reaction center of PS II (16Telfer A. Bishop S.M. Philips D. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13244-13253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to reduction of molecular oxygen or charge recombination. Since their yields increase in proportion to the rate of the electron transport reaction in PS II and show the same dependence on light intensity as does O2 evolution, active oxygen species do not play a direct role in the preillumination effect. In the above experiments, PNO8 was added to the membrane suspension immediately after preillumination. The lifetime for predisposition to PNO8-dependent D1 cleavage was estimated by illuminating the membranes for 10 s, incubating the membranes in the dark for various periods of time, and then adding PNO8. As shown in Fig. 4, the stimulation effect of preillumination persisted for a surprisingly long time even at room temperature and decayed exponentially, with a decay half-time of ∼1 h at 25°C (Fig. 4, inset). No D1 fragments were detected following preillumination or during incubation in the dark in the absence of PNO8. Fig. 5A shows the effect of repetitive illumination on the PNO8-dependent cleavage of D1. PS II membranes were preilluminated for 0.5 s and then incubated in the dark after the addition of PNO8. During incubation in the dark, the sample suspension was illuminated intermittently every 30 min for 0.5 s. The quantity of the 23-kDa fragment that accumulated during each 30-min incubation period in the dark was nearly the same after the first and second illuminations, decreased progressively after each successive illumination, and showed virtually no change after the fifth illumination. The quantity of D1 decreased to ∼40% of the original after the fifth illumination, but no fragments other than the 23- and 9-kDa fragments were detected. It should be noted that no fragments were detected even after incubation for 6 h in the absence of PNO8 (data not shown). Fig. 5A also shows the accumulation of the 23-kDa fragment following a single preillumination. The 23-kDa fragment appeared with no lag time and reached a constant level after 150 min, in good agreement with the kinetics for its formation in the absence of preillumination (31Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Inoue Y. Yoneyama K. Ono T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 38-44Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This indicates that preillumination does not stimulate the rate of the cleavage reaction, but instead increases the number of PS II susceptible to PNO8 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5B, the quantity of the 23-kDa fragment that accumulated during repetitive illumination showed an inversely proportional relationship to the quantity of D1. It therefore can be concluded that the PNO8-dependent cleavage of D1 at a single site is solely the direct cause of the decrease in the quantity of D1. The results also show that the effect of repetitive illumination is cumulative with respect to stimulating the cleavage of D1. Since the light intensity of each illumination was near the saturation level for cleavage, the cumulative nature of the preillumination effect may imply that modification of D1 can be reversibly and repeatedly effected by illumination, thus resulting in a state that is cleaved upon binding of PNO8. The first illumination was in the absence of PNO8, but successive illuminations were in the presence of PNO8, a potent PS II inhibitor. This indicates that preillumination stimulates the PNO8-dependent cleavage of D1 even when electron transfer from QA− to QB is interrupted. This is consistent with the finding that preillumination stimulated the cleavage of D1 in core particles that had been depleted of a plastoquinone molecule at the QB site, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 6 shows the pH dependence of the cleavage of D1 and the inhibition of O2 evolution activity by PNO8. In this experiment, PS II membranes were incubated with PNO8 for 60 min with no preil"
https://openalex.org/W2084197978,"Engagement of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) with a multimeric antigen leads to immediate tyrosine phosphorylation of its β and γ subunits, recruitment, and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk, and later to cell degranulation. Monovalent hapten treatment reverses these events, resulting in receptor dephosphorylation and an abrupt arrest of cell degranulation. Thus far, it has been assumed that there is a direct linkage between receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, Syk activation and phosphorylation, and cell degranulation. However, we show here that when FcεRI receptors are cross-linked for extended periods of time, hapten-mediated receptor dephosphorylation is delayed. These receptors, which remain tyrosine-phosphorylated despite the addition of hapten, are progressively targeted to a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, suggesting their progressive association with the membrane skeleton. In contrast to FcεRI receptors, hapten-induced Syk dephosphorylation and the consequent arrest of degranulation are not affected by prolonged cross-linking. Thus, some tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors persist in deactivated cells. We propose that, with time, some tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors become unaccessible to phosphatases and, in addition, unable to activate Syk. This inactive status of tyrosine-phosphorylated FcεRI may be the result of membrane skeleton compartmentalization. However, another population of clustered receptors that includes the ones most recently formed is still immediately sensitive to hapten deactivation. This latter population is critical in maintaining Syk activity and cell degranulation. The shift from a transiently active state of phosphorylated receptors toward an inactive state could be a general mechanism of desensitization also utilized by other antigen receptors.

INTRODUCTIONActivation of mast cells and basophils with allergens results in cell degranulation and the release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators of the allergic reaction (1Adamczewski M.A. Kinet J.-P. Chem. Immunol. 1991; 59: 173-190Crossref Google Scholar, 2Beaven M.A. Metzger H. Immunol. Today. 1991; 14: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This process is initiated by the binding of multivalent allergens or antigens to receptor-bound immunoglobulin E, which induces the aggregation of the tetrameric (αβγ2) high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expressed on these cells. Receptor aggregation is the critical event in the initiation of the signaling cascade leading to cell degranulation (3Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have used a multivalent antigen and the corresponding antigen-specific IgE to study FcεRI-mediated activation of mast cells. The utilization of a multivalent antigen as triggering tool allows one to study the reversibility of activation events because the addition of an excess of the corresponding monovalent hapten after multivalent antigen induces an immediate arrest of the ongoing early and late activation events (4Benhamou M.

Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this arrest is that the monovalent hapten disaggregates previously aggregated and active receptors. However, morphological studies by Oliver et al. (8Seagrave J.C. Deanin G.G. Martin J.C. Davis B.H. Oliver J.M. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that, when cells are triggered with a multivalent antigen for a long period of time (more than 10 min), the addition of monovalent hapten does not result in a rapid receptor disaggregation, even though cell signaling is halted abruptly. Thus, aggregated receptors remain on the cell surface of apparently inactive cells. These authors and others have proposed a model in which continuous formation of new aggregates is required to maintain cell activation, and hapten simply prevents the formation of new aggregates (8Seagrave J.C. Deanin G.G. Martin J.C. Davis B.H. Oliver J.M. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Robertson D. Holowka D. Baird B. J.

They have shown that when receptor aggregation is induced by small oligomers of chemically cross-linked IgE, the addition of excess monomeric IgE (which should prevent the formation of new aggregates) does not arrest ongoing signaling events. Therefore, under these conditions, small clusters of receptors remain active despite no new clusters being formed.Interest in the question of the mechanism of hapten action has been renewed by recent findings about early events in FcεRI signaling. One of the earliest events following FcεRI aggregation is the activation of tyrosine kinases such as the Src family kinase Lyn and the Syk/ZAP70 family kinase Syk (15Eiseman E. Bolen J.B.

Cell treatment with monovalent hapten after multivalent antigen triggering (which halts mediator release) leads to a rapid receptor dephosphorylation (5Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, when cells are triggered with IgE dimers or trimers, the subsequent addition of monomeric IgE results in only a moderate decrease in the phosphorylation of the β and γ chains and of Syk, as well as in only a moderate decrease in mediator release (13Kent U.M.

With both modes of triggering, there seems to be a direct relationship between the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the receptors and the activation state of the cells, as defined by their capacity to release mediators, although the effects of adding a monovalent ligand (hapten or monomeric IgE) are dramatically different. In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of hapten disengagement after periods of stimulation longer than in the past study (5Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), thereby creating conditions of cellular inactivation which should leave some receptors aggregated. We anticipated that the state of cellular activation would be correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the receptors. To our surprise, we found that in these conditions of inactivation, tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors persist in cells even though cell degranulation has ceased.DISCUSSIONExperimental data from many laboratories have contributed to a model of FcεRI-mediated cell activation in which FcεRI aggregation results in both receptor and cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation which leads to cell activation and degranulation. Subsequent hapten-mediated cell deactivation results in receptor and protein dephosphorylation and cessation of degranulation (Fig. 1 and 1Adamczewski M.A. Kinet J.-P. Chem. Immunol. 1991; 59: 173-190Crossref Google Scholar, 2Beaven M.A. Metzger H. Immunol. Today. 1991; 14: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 3Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, cellular tyrosine phosphorylation is tightly linked to the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the receptor through activation of Syk, as Syk is thought to require an interaction with a phosphorylated ITAM to become activated (19Jouvin M.-H. Numerof R.P. Kinet J.-P. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Jouvin M.-H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, this model fails to explain the inhibition of degranulation that occurs when too strong a cross-linking stimulus is applied (reviewed in 38Kinet J.-P. Metzger H. Metzger H. Fc Receptors and the Action of Antibodies. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 239Google Scholar).Here, we have been able to create experimental conditions where phosphorylated receptors persist despite a cessation of degranulation induced by hapten treatment. One explanation for the inactive yet persistently phosphorylated receptors could be that their phosphorylation state is qualitatively different from those of active receptors. For example, other non-ITAM phosphorylation could result in tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs that are unable to activate Syk. However, phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analyses of the receptor subunits show identical qualitative phosphorylation patterns for both short and prolonged cross-linkings and no difference in qualitative dephosphorylation patterns following haptenization (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). These results suggest that after prolonged stimulation the phosphorylated receptors are somehow unable to access the cellular activation machinery.Results from other studies suggest that the tyrosine kinase Syk could be the signaling molecule that these phosphorylated receptors cannot access. Treatment of RBL cells with piceatannol or with N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibits antigen-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (and its kinase activity) and that of most other cellular proteins, whereas Lyn-induced receptor phosphorylation is maintained (39Oliver J.M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). At the same time, receptor-mediated downstream events including secretion are abrogated. These experiments demonstrate that Syk activation is essential to FcεRI-mediated cellular responses and, together with our more recent experiments using overexpression of active and dominant negative Syk (32Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), show that receptor phosphorylation is upstream of Syk activation. In our current experiments, the reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and the abrupt cessation of Syk activation and cellular degranulation despite the persistence of receptor phosphorylation are compatible with the hypothesis that these receptors are unable to access Syk (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the similarity in tryptic phosphopeptide maps of Syk after short and long periods of triggering suggests that the inability of persistently phosphorylated receptors to activate Syk is not due to a different pattern of Syk phosphorylation (Fig. 8).Our results imply that access of aggregated receptors to some components of the cell activation machinery, particularly Syk and the tyrosine phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylating β and γ, is controlled. This could be mediated by a number of different mechanisms that may rely in particular on the size and the configuration of receptor aggregates, as outlined in the following model. Receptor engagement with antigen initially induces the formation of small and relatively mobile aggregates that are capable of mediating intracellular signaling and are sensitive to disaggregation and inactivation by monovalent hapten. However, with time, or with higher concentrations of antigen, large aggregate formation is superimposed on the continuous formation of small aggregates. These large aggregates are immobile, detergent-insoluble and are not immediately disaggregated by hapten. Existing data on detergent solubility and FcεRI aggregate size are consistent with this interpretation (12Holowka D. Baird B. Cell. Mol. Mech. Inflamm. 1990; 1: 173-197Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show here that the persistently tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors present after long periods of stimulation are associated with a Triton-insoluble cellular fraction (Fig. 5). These data support our model according to which only small aggregates are able to recruit and activate Syk. Large aggregates are not able to access Syk, possibly because of their known interaction with the membrane skeleton. For the same reason, phosphorylated receptors present in large aggregates cannot access the phosphatases responsible for FcεRI dephosphorylation and remain phosphorylated despite hapten treatment. However, hapten disaggregates the small proportion of small aggregates present, induces receptor dephosphorylation, and thereby arrests the activation of Syk and of downstream events. This model would also explain the results of Kent et al. (13Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Wofsy C. Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Goldstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20264-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IgE oligomers induce formation of small aggregates of a defined size that are capable of activating Syk. Addition of monomeric IgE, while preventing the formation of new aggregates, does not influence the size of the already formed aggregates. Therefore, these small aggregates remain active, as observed. Recently developed microscopy and molecular techniques, like confocal microscopy and chimeric green fluorescent proteins (41Olson K.R. McIntosh J.R. Olmsted J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), should provide the tools required to test this model further. INTRODUCTIONActivation of mast cells and basophils with allergens results in cell degranulation and the release of preformed and newly synthesized mediators of the allergic reaction (1Adamczewski M.A. Kinet J.-P. Chem. Immunol. 1991; 59: 173-190Crossref Google Scholar, 2Beaven M.A. Metzger H. Immunol. Today. 1991; 14: 222-226Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This process is initiated by the binding of multivalent allergens or antigens to receptor-bound immunoglobulin E, which induces the aggregation of the tetrameric (αβγ2) high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expressed on these cells. Receptor aggregation is the critical event in the initiation of the signaling cascade leading to cell degranulation (3Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have used a multivalent antigen and the corresponding antigen-specific IgE to study FcεRI-mediated activation of mast cells. The utilization of a multivalent antigen as triggering tool allows one to study the reversibility of activation events because the addition of an excess of the corresponding monovalent hapten after multivalent antigen induces an immediate arrest of the ongoing early and late activation events (4Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 5Paolini R. Jouvin M.-H. Kinet J.-P.

Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this arrest is that the monovalent hapten disaggregates previously aggregated and active receptors. However, morphological studies by Oliver et al. (8Seagrave J.C. Deanin G.G. Martin J.C. Davis B.H. Oliver J.M. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that, when cells are triggered with a multivalent antigen for a long period of time (more than 10 min), the addition of monovalent hapten does not result in a rapid receptor disaggregation, even though cell signaling is halted abruptly. Thus, aggregated receptors remain on the cell surface of apparently inactive cells. These authors and others have proposed a model in which continuous formation of new aggregates is required to maintain cell activation, and hapten simply prevents the formation of new aggregates (8Seagrave J.C. Deanin G.G. Martin J.C. Davis B.H. Oliver J.M. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Robertson D. Holowka D. Baird B. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20264-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) challenged this interpretation. They have shown that when receptor aggregation is induced by small oligomers of chemically cross-linked IgE, the addition of excess monomeric IgE (which should prevent the formation of new aggregates) does not arrest ongoing signaling events. Therefore, under these conditions, small clusters of receptors remain active despite no new clusters being formed.Interest in the question of the mechanism of hapten action has been renewed by recent findings about early events in FcεRI signaling. One of the earliest events following FcεRI aggregation is the activation of tyrosine kinases such as the Src family kinase Lyn and the Syk/ZAP70 family kinase Syk (15Eiseman E. Bolen J.B.

https://openalex.org/W2089868886,"YPF1, a heterodimeric protein from Drosophila melanogaster, is a homolog to Ku, the DNA binding subunit of human DNA-dependent protein kinase. This kinase is crucial in transcriptional activation, V(D)J recombination, double-strand break repair, and both topoisomerase and helicase activities. To investigate functional homology between YPF1 and Ku, we examined DNA binding properties of YPF1. Like Ku, at 100 mM KCl, YPF1 binding has no detectable DNA sequence specificity, requires a DNA terminus, and has a concentration-dependent stoichiometry consistent with subsequent translocation along DNA. YPF1 differs from Ku by having a 105-fold higher affinity. At 400 mM KCl, YPF1 still prefers DNA termini but shows binding specificities not observed previously with Ku. In descending order of affinity, YPF1 binds to: specific DNA sequences with a specific polarity and spacing relative to DNA termini; nonspecific linear DNA; and circular DNA. At this higher ionic strength, binding stoichiometry is concentration independent, indicating that YPF1 remains bound to ends. These results demonstrate a strong functional homology between YPF1 and Ku at physiological ionic strength.

Ku, and by implication the kinase, have since been shown to activate transcription and to be necessary for repair of radiation-induced double-stranded breaks in DNA, for V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin genes, and for the activities of topoisomerase II and human helicase II (19Smider V.

Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11484-11491Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Early studies showed that in binding buffers containing 400 mM KCl, YPF1 binds specifically to the HBS1 site located a short distance downstream of the Yp1 promoter (24Mitsis P.G. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5195-5202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When this site is mutated, steady state levels of Yp1 mRNA decrease, suggesting that HBS1 is a regulatory site and that YPF1 may regulate transcription from this site (25Mitsis P.G. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5188-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we investigate the DNA binding specificity of YPF1. This specificity is crucial to the function of Ku because both kinase activity and assembly of the holoenzyme depend on binding to DNA (26Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Two hallmarks of Ku binding are its DNA sequence independence and its requirement for a DNA terminus. This DNA terminus can be either an end where the phosphate backbone of both strands are broken or a transition from double- to single-stranded structure (2Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 14: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 27Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This transition, in turn, can be either a nick or gap in one strand or a fork separating the two strands. Another feature of the binding interaction is that once Ku has bound a terminus, it then can translocate along the DNA helix (7de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These binding specificities are likely to be related to the unusual DNA structures at which Ku functions, namely those occurring during recombination, transcription, repair, and replication.We report here that YPF1 shares many DNA binding properties with Ku but also has substantial differences. In the expected physiological range of ionic strength, like Ku, YPF1 binds nonspecifically to DNA. Also like Ku, a DNA terminus is required, and the protein:DNA stoichiometry increases as protein concentration is increased. However, unlike Ku, this binding is extremely tight (KD≤ 5 × 10−16M), approximately 105-fold higher than for Ku (2Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 14: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Higher ionic strength reveals underlying DNA sequence and structural specificities of the binding interaction. These differences suggest that the two related proteins may have different DNA specificities or function differently in response to cellular cues.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have shown that the Drosophila YPF1 and the human Ku proteins share many properties. Both are abundant DNA binding proteins that have similar heterodimeric subunit structures and molecular weights (24Mitsis P.G. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5195-5202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2274-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural similarity extends to the sequence level because the sequences of the small subunits are 24% identical and 51% similar over their entire 631 amino acid length, and those of the large subunits yield the same antigenic epitopes (23Jacoby D.B. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11484-11491Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Furthermore, the roles of the subunits in DNA binding are similar between the two proteins. The small subunit of each can bind DNA independently of the large subunit, and both small and large subunits are in contact with DNA when the heterodimers are bound to DNA (23Jacoby D.B. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11484-11491Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).In this report, we have tested the functional similarity between YPF1 and Ku by examining the DNA binding specificities of YPF1. Previous studies with Ku have shown that binding DNA is necessary for assembly of Ku into the DNA-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme. DNA binding by Ku is also necessary for activity of the kinase. Thus, DNA binding is tightly linked to Ku function, and examining binding properties of YPF1 should test similarity in crucial functions.Nonspecific Binding to DNA at 100 mM KClWe have used the mobility shift assay to examine YPF1 binding under the same ionic strength conditions as used previously for Ku. The Ku studies led to a model that it binds initially to double-stranded DNA termini with no DNA sequence specificity and then translocates along the DNA helix (1Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 2Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We find that at this ionic strength, YPF1 properties match this model for Ku binding and translocation. However, we also find that YPF1 dramatically differs from Ku in its binding affinity. YPF1 affinity is 105-fold higher.As with Ku, YPF1 binds with no DNA sequence specificity among the Drosophila and Escherichia coli DNAs tested either in qualitative assays (Fig. 1) or in quantitative assays of association and dissociation rates (Table I). Previously, it was observed that YPF1 bound much less strongly to poly(dA)· poly(dT) than to naturally occurring DNA (24Mitsis P.G. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5195-5202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the current study indicates that poly(dA)·poly(dT) is an exceptional case, perhaps due to its unusual secondary structure (34Nelson H.C.M. Finch J.T. Luisi B.F. Klug A. Nature. 1987; 330: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar).Like Ku, YPF1 prefers DNA termini. Quantitative data indicate that binding to linear DNA is at least 9-fold stronger than to circular DNA (Table I). However, this is a lower limit for selectivity because the circular DNA preparation used contained a small amount of linear DNA as well as larger amounts of nicked and gapped circles that would bind Ku as tightly as would double-stranded termini (4May G. Sutton C. Gould H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A better measure of end preference is the observation that binding is proportional to the number of DNA termini (Fig. 5), an observation also made with Ku (4May G. Sutton C. Gould H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3052-3059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, both YPF1 and Ku form multimeric complexes with DNA under conditions of protein excess (Fig. 1; 7de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 12Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 29Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, and 30). This observation, along with an inherent recognition of DNA termini, is consistent with the translocation of Ku and YPF1 away from the DNA terminus.The only difference we found between Ku and YPF1 at 100 mM KCl is its extremely high affinity for DNA ends. This affinity is approximately 105-fold higher than the sequence-specific binding affinity of regulatory proteins such as LacI, CRP, and AraC of E. coli and the sequence-nonspecific binding of Ku protein itself (27Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 38Martin K.J. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Taken together, the similarities between in vitro binding activities of YPF1 and Ku give further support to the hypothesis that the two proteins are homologous, not only in structure but also in function. Since binding of Ku to DNA is critical for the activity of DNA-dependent protein kinase, the similarity of YPF1 binding specificities suggests that it also associates with a Drosophila protein kinase and serves to locate it at appropriate substrates. Interestingly, a DNA-dependent protein kinase has recently been detected in Drosophila embryos (39Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), a stage at which YPF1 and its transcript have been shown to be most highly abundant (23Jacoby D.B. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11484-11491Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 25Mitsis P.G. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5188-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a stage at which replication activity is very high.Specific Binding to DNA at 400 mM KClThe extremely tight binding at 100 mM suggested that YPF1 has interactions with DNA beyond those of Ku and may recognize additional structures in DNA. To examine this possibility, we studied its DNA binding at a higher ionic strength that is likely to reduce nonspecific interactions between YPF1 and DNA.At 400 mM KCl, YPF1 has binding specificities not previously observed with other members of the Ku family. (a) YPF1 binds to the ends of long linear DNA molecules with an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1, independent of large changes in YPF1 concentration. (b) YPF1 binds most tightly to a particular structure at a DNA end: a specific sequence with a specific polarity to a DNA end and at a specific distance from that end. This suggests that at the higher ionic strength, YPF1 makes contact with a specific DNA site and also with the adjacent downstream terminus. Such a YPF1 structure must be fairly rigid because addition of as few as 8 base pairs to the end of the DNA abolishes binding. However, at lower ionic strength, this rigidity must be lost because YPF1 recognizes DNA ends and appears to translocate to internal positions, thus allowing more than two protein complexes to interact with a single linear DNA molecule. It is worth noting that even the weakest binding specificities we have observed are in the range of proteins that operate at specific DNA sites. Thus, it is likely that even these interactions are physiologically relevant to YPF1 interaction with DNA.These observations indicate that more subtle interactions with DNA may take place, although the general model for Ku binding still applies to YPF1. The in vivo structures of the DNA ligands for YPF1 and Ku are unknown. In the case of Ku, there is indirect evidence that it is a non-helical intermediate of reactions that require both single and double strands. These reactions include replication (10Feldmann H.

Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8929-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 50Beall E.L. Admon A. Rio D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12681-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), recently identified as the small subunit (p70 or β subunit) of YPF1 (50Beall E.L. Admon A. Rio D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12681-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast to the binding behavior of the heterodimeric YPF1 protein that we report in this study, the purified p70 subunit binds to specific DNA sequences at low salt concentration and with no apparent requirement for an adjacent downstream terminus. The specific DNA sequences bound are the terminal inverted repeats of the P-element transposon, target sites consistent with some of the proposed functions of Ku. It is most likely that the different binding specificities observed are due to the modulating effects of the p86 subunit present in the heterodimeric YPF1, although they could be due to subtle effects of binding conditions and DNA sequence.As mentioned above, Ku appears to play a crucial role in such diverse cellular processes as protein phosphorylation, immunoglobulin gene maturation, DNA repair, site-specific recombination, DNA unwinding, and signal transduction. As a means of identifying the functions of the Drosophila Ku, the p70 subunit has been cytologically mapped (23Jacoby D.B. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11484-11491Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 50Beall E.L. Admon A. Rio D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12681-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recent mutant rescue results demonstrate that the cytological location is in the mus309 gene at position 86E2-3 rather than the 34C position we reported (23Jacoby D.B. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11484-11491Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 51Beall E.L. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This localization allowed Drosophila molecular genetics to be used to determine that double-strand DNA break repair is one of the in vivo functions of the smaller subunit and, presumably, of the heterodimeric YPF1/Drosophila Ku (51Beall E.L. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

It was initially implicated in transcriptional regulation because it phosphorylates several transcription factors (Sp1, Oct-1, Oct-2, c-Myc, p53, and the large T-antigen of SV40) as well as the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (13Jackson S.P.

Ku, and by implication the kinase, have since been shown to activate transcription and to be necessary for repair of radiation-induced double-stranded breaks in DNA, for V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin genes, and for the activities of topoisomerase II and human helicase II (19Smider V.

Turnover in kinase-negative mutant cells was about three times faster than in stimulated wild-type cells and appeared to involve a unique 47-kDa intermediate. Levels of catalytic subunit protein revealed by Western immunoblotting were consistent with the measured differences in turnover, but whereas the protein was mostly soluble in wild-type cell extracts, it was almost entirely insoluble in the mutant cell extracts. A substantial fraction of the catalytic subunit labeled in a 5-min pulse was soluble in kinase-negative cell extracts, but most of this material was rendered insoluble by incubating the cells for an additional 30 min before extraction. Degradation of the catalytic subunit in kinase-negative, but not in wild-type, cells was inhibited strongly by two specific peptide aldehyde inhibitors of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity. An inhibitor of the proteasomal protease that prefers branched-chain amino acids had less of an effect on catalytic subunit degradation in the mutant cells."
