https://openalex.org/W4312065796,"Post-translational histone modifications modulate chromatin activity to affect gene expression. How chromatin states underlie lineage choice in single cells is relatively unexplored. We develop sort-assisted single-cell chromatin immunocleavage (sortChIC) and map active (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) histone modifications in the mouse bone marrow. During differentiation, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) acquire active chromatin states mediated by cell-type-specifying transcription factors, which are unique for each lineage. By contrast, most alterations in repressive marks during differentiation occur independent of the final cell type. Chromatin trajectory analysis shows that lineage choice at the chromatin level occurs at the progenitor stage. Joint profiling of H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 demonstrates that cell types within the myeloid lineage have distinct active chromatin but share similar myeloid-specific heterochromatin states. This implies a hierarchical regulation of chromatin during hematopoiesis: heterochromatin dynamics distinguish differentiation trajectories and lineages, while euchromatin dynamics reflect cell types within lineages."

We aimed to study the role of appendectomy in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk through causing gut microbial dysbiosis. Population-based longitudinal study (cohort 1, n = 129,155) showed a 73.0% increase in CRC risk among appendectomy cases throughout 20 years follow-up (Adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.49–2.01, P &lt; 0.001). Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on fecal samples from cohort 2 ( n = 314). Gut microbial dysbiosis in appendectomy subjects was observed with significant enrichment of 7 CRC-promoting bacteria ( Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella ruminicola, Prevotella fucsa, Prevotella dentalis, Prevotella denticola ) and depletion of 5 beneficial commensals ( Blautia sp YL58, Enterococcus hirae, Lachnospiraceae bacterium Choco86, Collinsella aerofaciens, Blautia sp SC05B48 ). Microbial network analysis showed increased correlation strengths among enriched bacteria and their enriched oncogenic pathways in appendectomy subjects compared to controls. Of which, B. fragilis was the centrality in the network of the enriched bacteria. We further confirmed that appendectomy promoted colorectal tumorigenesis in mice by causing gut microbial dysbiosis and impaired intestinal barrier function. Collectively, this study revealed appendectomy-induced microbial dysbiosis characterized by enriched CRC-promoting bacteria and depleted beneficial commensals, signifying that the gut microbiome may play a crucial role in CRC development induced by appendectomy."
https://openalex.org/W4312064779,"Generation of functional transcripts requires transcriptional initiation at regular start sites, avoiding production of aberrant and potentially hazardous aberrant RNAs. The mechanisms maintaining transcriptional fidelity and the impact of spurious transcripts on cellular physiology and organ function have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that TET3, which successively oxidizes 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and other derivatives, prevents aberrant intragenic entry of RNA polymerase II pSer5 into highly expressed genes of airway smooth muscle cells, assuring faithful transcriptional initiation at canonical start sites. Loss of TET3-dependent 5hmC production in SMCs results in accumulation of spurious transcripts, which stimulate the endosomal nucleic-acid-sensing TLR7/8 signaling pathway, thereby provoking massive inflammation and airway remodeling resembling human bronchial asthma. Furthermore, we found that 5hmC levels are substantially lower in human asthma airways compared with control samples. Suppression of spurious transcription might be important to prevent chronic inflammation in asthma."

https://openalex.org/W4312060033,"Legacy arsenic (As) contamination from past mining operations remains an environmental concern in lakes of the Yellowknife area (Northwest Territories, Canada) due to its post-depositional mobility in sediment and potential for continued remobilization to surface waters. Warmer temperatures associated with climate change in this subarctic region may impact As internal loading from lake sediments either by a direct effect on sediment porewater diffusion rate or indirect effects on microbial metabolism and sediment redox conditions. This study assessed the influence of warmer temperatures on As diffusion from contaminated sediment of two lakes with contrasting sediment characteristics using an experimental incubation approach. Sediments from Yellowknife Bay (on Great Slave Lake) contained predominately clay and silt with low organic matter (10%) and high As content (1675 μg/g) while sediments of Lower Martin Lake had high organic matter content (~70%) and approximately half the As (822 μg/g). Duplicate sediment batches from each lake were incubated in a temperature-controlled chamber, and overlying water was kept well-oxygenated while As flux from sediment was measured during four weekly temperature treatments (7°C to 21°C, at ~5°C intervals). During the experiment, As diffused from sediment to overlying water in all cores and temperature treatments, with As fluxes ranging from 48-956 μg/m2/day. Arsenic fluxes were greater from Yellowknife Bay sediments, which had higher solid-phase As concentrations, compared to those of Lower Martin Lake. Short-term warming did not stimulate As flux from duplicate cores of either sediment type, in contrast with reported temperature enhancement in other published studies. We conclude that warmer temperatures were insufficient to strongly enhance sediment As diffusion into overlying oxic waters. These observations are relevant for evaluating climate-warming effects on sediment As mobility in subarctic lakes with little or no thermal stratification and a well-oxygenated water column."
https://openalex.org/W4311987427,"The regulation of cell-cell junctions during epidermal morphogenesis ensures tissue integrity, a process regulated by α-catenin. This cytoskeletal protein connects the cadherin complex to filamentous actin at cell-cell junctions. The cadherin-catenin complex plays key roles in cell physiology, organism development, and disease. While mutagenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans cadherin and catenin shows that these proteins are key for embryonic morphogenesis, we know surprisingly little about their structure and attachment to the cytoskeleton. In contrast to mammalian α-catenin that functions as a dimer or monomer, the α-catenin ortholog from C. elegans, HMP1 for humpback, is a monomer. Our cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of HMP1/α-catenin reveals that the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of HMP1/α-catenin are disordered and not in contact with the remaining HMP1/α-catenin middle domain. Since the carboxy-terminal HMP1/α-catenin domain is the F-actin-binding domain (FABD), this interdomain constellation suggests that HMP1/α-catenin is constitutively active, which we confirm biochemically. Our perhaps most surprising finding, given the high sequence similarity between the mammalian and nematode proteins, is our cryoEM structure of HMP1/α-catenin bound to F-actin. Unlike the structure of mammalian α-catenin bound to F-actin, binding to F-actin seems to allosterically convert a loop region of the HMP1/α-catenin FABD to extend an HMP1/α-catenin FABD α-helix. We use cryoEM and bundling assays to show for the first time how the FABD of HMP1/α-catenin bundles actin in the absence of force. Collectively, our data advance our understanding of α-catenin regulation of cell-cell contacts and additionally aid our understanding of the evolution of multicellularity in metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W4312003332,"Severe sepsis and septic shock are the leading cause of in-hospital death. As sepsis progresses, expression and activity of endogenous mediators of inflammation change. Early detection of biomarkers can play a role in sepsis screening and in improvement of patient outcomes. Recent studies suggest that increase in monocyte volume may be helpful in early detection of sepsis. Therefore, we evaluated the utility of monocyte distribution width (MDW) for the early assessment of sepsis compared with the blood culture and other inflammatory biomarkers.Medical records of 1,404 patients (aged ≥19 years) who were admitted to the emergency department owing to clinically suspected infectious disease and requested blood cultures from Oct 2019 to Jan 2021 were reviewed. The patients were grouped based on Sepsis-3 criteria. They had undergone other laboratory tests to evaluate their clinical status. MDW was analyzed using DxH900 hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). To determine the diagnostic performance of MDW, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) for sepsis, the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics curves and their sensitivity and specificity were measured.Among 1,404 patients, 520 patients were designated the sepsis group based on Sepsis-3 criteria. In the sepsis group, MDW value was 24.1 (median, IQR 21.6-28.1); AUC values for MDW, CRP, and PCT were 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64-0.69), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.68), and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72-0.77), respectively. For diagnosis of the sepsis, the cut-off value of MDW was 21.7 (sensitivity 74% and specificity 54%). Measured values of MDW were higher for the blood culture positive group than that of the blood culture contamination group (P<0.001, 95% CI, -5.9 to -3.0) or blood culture negative group (P<0.001, 95% CI = -5.8 to -4.2).MDW is a new hematological parameter that is simultaneously calculated during complete blood cell counting by Beckman Coulter hematology analyzer. MDW is expected to serve as a useful indicator for early screening of sepsis in conjunction with CRP and PCT. MDW is especially useful for sepsis assessment in patients with a suspected infection. MDW can also assist in discriminating false positive blood cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4312061312,"Climate change is a potent threat to human society, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability. Yet a 2021 Gallup poll found that only 43% of Americans see climate change as a serious threat over their lifetimes. In this study, we analyze college biology textbook coverage of climate change from 1970 to 2019. We focus on four aspects for content analysis: 1) the amount of coverage, determined by counting the number of sentences within the climate change passage, 2) the start location of the passage in the book, 3) the categorization of sentences as addressing a description of the greenhouse effect, impacts of global warming, or actions to ameliorate climate change, and 4) the presentation of data in figures. We analyzed 57 textbooks. Our findings show that coverage of climate change has continually increased, although the greatest increase occurred during the 1990s despite the growing threats of climate change. The position of the climate change passage moved further back in the book, from the last 15% to the last 2.5% of pages. Over time, coverage shifted from a description of the greenhouse effect to focus mostly on effects of climate change; the most addressed impact was shifting ecosystems. Sentences dedicated to actionable solutions to climate change peaked in the 1990s at over 15% of the passage, then decreased in recent decades to 3%. Data figures present only global temperatures and CO2 levels prior to the year 2000, then include photographic evidence and changes to species distributions after 2000. We hope this study will alert curriculum designers and instructors to consider implicit messages communicated in climate change lessons."
https://openalex.org/W4312069029,"Water is a vital, finite resource whose quantity and quality are deteriorating as the world population increases. The current study aims to investigate the concentration of heavy metals (HM) in surface water for irrigation purposes with associated human health risks and pollution sources near the marble industry in Malakand, Pakistan. Twenty-seven water samples were randomly collected and analyzed for HM concentration by inductively coupled plasma‒optical emission spectrometry (ICP‒OES). pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were measured using standard methods of American Public Health Association (APHA). Irrigation suitability was assessed using specific water quality parameters. The associated health risks from ingestion and dermal exposure to heavy metals were calculated by USEPA health risk indices. Pollution sources and spatial distribution mapping were studied using compositional data analysis (CoDa) and the application of a geographic information system (GIS) to understand the changing behavior of heavy metals in surface waters. The concentrations of BOD (89%), COD (89%), Al (89%), Ca (89%), Cr (56%), Cu (78%), Fe (56%), K (34%) Mg (23%), Mn (56%), Na (89%), Ni (56%), P (89%), and Zn (11%) exceeded the safety limits of National Environmental Quality standards (NEQs) of Pakistan. The results of Kelly's ratio (KR) classified surface water as unsuitable for irrigation. The average daily doses (ADD, mg/kg/day) for Al, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn were higher in children than in adults. The hazard index (HI) for children and adults was above the threshold (HI > 1), indicating a significant risk of non-carcinogenic toxicity. The carcinogenic risk values for Cr and Ni were above the USEPA limit (1 × 10-6 to 1 × 10-4), suggesting a potential carcinogenic risk for the target population. Principal component analysis (PCA), biplot (CLR), and the CoDa-dendrogram allowed for the identification of elemental associations, and their potential source was anthropogenic rather than natural in origin. Regular monitoring and phytoremediation strategies are proposed to safeguard crops and human health."

Neuronal function further depends on membrane specialization through polarized distribution of specific proteins to distinct neuronal compartments such as axons. Voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, a threshold channel for firing action potentials in nociceptors, plays a major role in human pain, and its abundance in the plasma membrane is tightly regulated. We have recently characterized the anterograde axonal trafficking of NaV1.7 channels in Rab6A-positive vesicles, but the fate of internalized channels is not known. Membrane proteins that have undergone endocytosis can be directed into multiple pathways including those for degradation, recycling to the membrane, and transcytosis. Here, we demonstrate NaV1.7 endocytosis and dynein-dependent retrograde trafficking in Rab7-containing late endosomes together with other axonal membrane proteins using real-time imaging of live neurons. We show that some internalized NaV1.7 channels are delivered to lysosomes within the cell body, and that there is no evidence for NaV1.7 transcytosis. In addition, we show that NaV1.7 is recycled specifically to the axonal membrane as opposed to the soma membrane, suggesting a novel mechanism for the development of neuronal polarity.

Together, these results shed light on the mechanisms by which neurons maintain excitable membranes and may inform efforts to target ion channel trafficking for the treatment of disorders of excitability. Sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) rely on the function of several voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels to generate action potentials (1Waxman S.G. Zamponi G.W. Regulating excitability of peripheral afferents: emerging ion channel targets.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). NaV channel activity underpins the function of nearly all excitable tissues (including the brain, heart, and muscle), and individual NaV isoforms are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner (2Catterall W.A.

NaV1.7 plays a major role in the physiology of pain because it sets the activation threshold for nociceptors (pain-sensing neurons) (5Nassar M.A. Stirling L.C. Forlani G. Baker M.D. Matthews E.A.

Furthermore, genetic studies show that NaV1.7 is an obligate mediator of pain sensation in humans, causing both syndromes of extreme pain when mutations increase its activity and congenital insensitivity to pain when its function is impaired (10Bennett D.L.

Together, these factors have made selective blockade of NaV1.7 function a promising target for nonaddictive analgesia (12Alsaloum M. Higerd G.P. Effraim P.R. Waxman S.G.

Chem. 2019; 62: 8695-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neuronal excitability is shaped by the activity and number of ion channels in the cell membrane, which depends on the balancing of channel production, subcellular distribution, exocytosis, endocytosis, recycling, and degradation (14Estadella I. Pedrós-Gámez O. Colomer-Molera M. Bosch M. Sorkin A. Felipe A. Endocytosis: a turnover mechanism controlling ion channel function.Cells. 2020; 9: 1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since the function of ion channels is dependent on their presence at the cell membrane, dysfunction of channel trafficking is predicted to underlie excitability disorders. Thus, modulating their trafficking could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy to treat these disorders including pain. Our understanding of these processes for full-length NaV channels is currently limited because studying them was until recently not possible, especially at axonal ends far from the soma. We have now developed methods that have enabled real-time visualization of anterograde trafficking and surface distribution of single NaV channels in sensory axons (15Akin E.J. Higerd G.P. Mis M.A. Tanaka B.S. Adi T. Liu S. et al.Building sensory axons: delivery and distribution of NaV1.7 channels and effects of inflammatory mediators.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5eaax4755Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the fates of NaV channels after they undergo endocytosis remain unexplored and potentially include degradation, recycling back to the membrane, and the circuitous pathway of transcytosis, whereby proteins are first inserted in a somatodendritic compartment, internalized, and finally trafficked anterogradely to the axon (16Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Neuronal polarity and trafficking.Neuron. 2003; 40: 277-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endosomes originating in distal axons undergo a maturation process as they are trafficked retrogradely to the cell body, which includes conversion from a state of association with Rab5 to association with Rab7 (small GTPases linked with early and late endosomes, respectively) and eventual delivery to the lysosome (17Roney J.C. Cheng X.-T. Sheng Z.-H. Neuronal endolysosomal transport and lysosomal functionality in maintaining axonostasis.J. Cell Biol. 2022; 221e202111077Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The state of maturity of endosomes carrying NaV1.7 in axons is not known. Neurons are among the most morphologically complex cells, and their function depends on localization of specific membrane proteins in specialized domains such as neurotransmitter receptors in postsynaptic terminals and NaV channels in the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons (18Rasband M.N. The axon initial segment and the maintenance of neuronal polarity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Neurons utilize a variety of mechanisms to establish and maintain this polarization, including directly trafficking and trapping of specific NaV channel isoforms within the AIS in an ankyrin G–dependent manner, and possible selective endocytosis from the somatodendritic membrane in hippocampal neurons (19Akin E.J. Solé L. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. Tamkun M.M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, unmyelinated axons are not known to possess similar well-delineated axonal membrane specializations, and the regulation of the distribution of NaV channels in these neurons is less well understood. We report here the first observations of the fates of internalized full-length NaV1.7 channel in unmyelinated axons, including retrograde transport, domain-specific recycling, and degradation. Using cell-impermeable fluorescent ligands and compartmentalized neuronal cultures in microfluidic chambers (MFCs) together with super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate ongoing endocytosis and retrograde trafficking of NaV1.7 in distal axons, which is dynein dependent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that some internalized NaV1.7 channels are transported retrogradely in Rab7 late endosomes, together with multiple other axonal membrane proteins before delivery to lysosomes in cell bodies, whereas there was no evidence for NaV1.7 transcytosis. We have also observed specific recycling of internalized NaV1.7 channels in axonal membrane but not soma. These studies fill fundamental knowledge gaps regarding the fate of internalized NaV channels and uncover an additional mechanism for maintenance of polarized distribution of axonal proteins, which may inform efforts to target ion channel trafficking for the treatment of disorders of excitability. We previously engineered an NaV1.7 channel with an N-terminal Halo tag, a self-labeling enzyme that covalently reacts with specific photostable synthetic ligands, along with an additional transmembrane domain resulting in an extracellularly tagged channel with 25 transmembrane segments (Fig. 1A) (15Akin E.J. Higerd G.P. Mis M.A. Tanaka B.S. Adi T. Liu S. et al.Building sensory axons: delivery and distribution of NaV1.7 channels and effects of inflammatory mediators.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5eaax4755Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To study the trafficking of these channels in distal axons, we transfected the channel construct into DRG neurons. Also, we utilized MFCs to create compartmentalized cultures where DRG somata are isolated from their axons (Fig. 2A). We first visualized the endocytosis of NaV1.7 channels from the soma membrane by adding fluorescent and cell-impermeable Halo-tag ligands (21Jonker C.T.H. Deo C. Zager P.J. Tkachuk A.N. Weinstein A.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. et al.Accurate measurement of fast endocytic recycling kinetics in real time.J. Cell Sci. 2020; 133jcs231225PubMed Google Scholar) to the soma chamber to label only channels at the cell surface, which can then be observed as they are internalized and trafficked within the cell. Indeed, 1 h after labeling with Halo-tag JF635i (where “i” denotes cell impermeability), DRG cell bodies expressing Halo-NaV1.7 channels showed fluorescence limited to the cell membrane. However, over time, more fluorescence signal appeared within the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B), whereas signal disappeared from parts of the soma membrane. During all live-cell time-lapse imaging, cells were kept in a stage-top incubator at 37 °C.Figure 2NaV1.7 channels undergo endocytosis and dynein-dependent retrograde trafficking in distal axons. A, DRG neurons were transfected with Halo-NaV1.7 and cultured in microfluidic chambers (MFCs) for 5 days, allowing axons to grow into the distal axon chamber. Channels at the surface of distal axons were labeled with cell-impermeable Halo-tag ligand JF635i. B, NaV1.7 channels labeled at the surface of distal axons formed bright puncta, some of which were trafficked retrogradely, which we will refer to as endosomes. The top panel shows a maximum intensity projection of a 10 min movie of a distal axon, illustrating the axon’s outline. The middle panels are still images from the movie above, in which a fluorescent signal begins moving in the retrograde direction (white arrows). The bottom panel is a kymograph plot of the above axon, which displays distance along the axon as the x-axis and elapsed time on the y-axis. Stationary fluorescence puncta appear as vertical lines, whereas a retrogradely moving particle moves from the upper right to lower left (magenta arrow). C, a kymograph from a 1 h time-lapse movie of an untreated axon shows that endosomes containing surface-labeled NaV1.7 moved along axons almost exclusively in the retrograde direction. NaV1.7 in axons treated with ciliobrevin D (20 μM) form puncta, which remain arrested in the distal axon. D, the instantaneous velocity of NaV1.7-containing endosomes that had begun moving was distributed around a mean of 0.52 μm/s in the retrograde (negative) direction. E, the number of endosomes being trafficked retrogradely varied with time after the start of labeling, with fewer seen in the first 20 min of imaging (30–50 min after the start of labeling) and reached a plateau 50 min after the start of labeling (p < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s correction, N = 307 endosomes from 15 axons and 2 cultures. Error bars indicate mean ± SD). DRG, dorsal root ganglion; NaV, voltage-gated sodium channel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When Halo-tag ligand JF635i was applied to distal axons, fluorescence was initially distributed diffusely along the axon. However, within a matter of minutes, fluorescent puncta began to appear in the distal axon. These puncta were initially stationary, but some eventually began moving in the retrograde direction (Fig. 2B). Based on their retrograde movement and colocalization with endosomal markers (Fig. 3), we refer to these moving puncta as endosomes henceforth. When axons were observed over longer periods of up to an hour, many endosomes were seen moving retrogradely (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in axons treated with the dynein inhibitor ciliobrevin D, NaV1.7 puncta formed in distal axons but were not trafficked retrogradely. These stationary puncta likely reflect endosomes that are arrested in the distal axon. The instantaneous velocity (excluding long pauses) of moving NaV1.7 endosomes that had begun moving in untreated axons was distributed around a mean of 0.52 μm/s in the retrograde direction, with very few endosomes moving anterogradely (Fig. 2D). The velocity of these endosomes was comparable with previous measurements of dynein-dependent trafficking (22Ross J.L. Wallace K. Shuman H. Goldman Y.E. Holzbaur E.L.F.

The number of endosomes being transported retrogradely varied with time after labeling, with fewer being seen in the first 20 min of imaging (corresponding to the period 30–50 min after the start of labeling) after which the rate reached a plateau (Fig. 2E). This suggests that there is a minimum period required for NaV channels to undergo endocytosis and packaging for retrograde transport. Together, these results demonstrate that NaV channels continuously undergo endocytosis at distal axons followed by dynein-dependent retrograde transport. We next sought to confirm that the retrogradely transported NaV1.7 puncta observed in Figure 2 are indeed endosomes and specify their stage of maturity along the early endosome, late endosome, and lysosome axis. Thus, we cotransfected DRG neurons with Halo-NaV1.7 and either GFP-Rab7, EGFP-Rab5, or lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-mNeonGreen, which are markers of late endosomes/multivesicular bodies, early endosomes, and lysosomes, respectively (25Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosomes.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 26Ye M. Lehigh K.M. Ginty D.D. Multivesicular bodies mediate long-range retrograde NGF-TrkA signaling.eLife. 2018; 7e33012Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two-color movies of axons expressing both surface-labeled Halo-NaV1.7 channels that have been internalized and GFP-Rab7 demonstrate a high rate of cotransport (colocalization over time and space) of the two proteins (Fig. 3, A and D), whereas most of the NaV1.7 endosomes moved independently of Rab5 (Fig. 3, B and D) and LAMP1 (Fig. 3, C and D). When we analyzed the proportion of endosomes that were positive for both NaV1.7 and individual endosome markers, a large portion of the NaV1.7 endosomes that were positive for Rab7 moved in the retrograde direction, whereas most of the NaV1.7 endosomes that were positive for Rab5 were stationary or moving bidirectionally. There were few NaV1.7 endosomes that were positive for LAMP1, and most of those moved in the retrograde direction (Fig. 3E). While NaV1.7 endosomes could be seen stationary or moving retrogradely, anterogradely, or bidirectionally, we were particularly interested in retrogradely moving endosomes and performed an additional subanalysis focused on this population. The majority of retrogradely moving Halo-NaV1.7 endosomes were positive for Rab7 and negative for Rab5 and LAMP1 (Fig. 3F). Although we detected the localization of internalized NaV1.7 channels in lysosomes in the axons, these LAMP1-positive vesicles were rare (Fig. 3, D and F). Next, we wanted to find out whether the internalized NaV1.7 channels are eventually delivered to lysosomes once they arrive at the cell body. Given the thin focal plane of the spinning disk confocal microscope, retrogradely moving endosomes that arrived at the cell body tended to quickly leave the focal plane once they enter the relatively large volume of the cell body. Therefore, in order to visualize NaV-carrying endosomes within the cell body, the cells were fixed 6 h after axonal surface labeling and then imaged using super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF) microscopy (27Gustafsson N. Culley S. Ashdown G. Owen D.M. Pereira P.M. Henriques R. Fast live-cell conventional fluorophore nanoscopy with ImageJ through super-resolution radial fluctuations.Nat. Commun. 2016; 712471Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). NaV1.7 that were retrogradely transported to the soma could be seen closely colocalized with LAMP1 (Fig. 4A). Occasionally, NaV1.7 signal could be seen within individual lysosomal lumens (Fig. 4B). Together, these results demonstrate that endocytosed NaV1.7 can be observed in Rab5 early endosomes but that the endosomes mature to Rab7 late endosomes prior to initiating retrograde transport (25Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosomes.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NaV1.7-containing endosomes leaving distal axons have not fused with lysosomes, but at least some NaV1.7 channels are eventually delivered to lysosomes within the cell body. We next sought to determine whether the Rab7 endosomes that transport NaV1.7 away from distal axons carry only NaV1.7 or also contain other axonal membrane proteins. To test this, we engineered multiple axonal ion channels with extracellular Halo tags or SNAP tags: SNAP-NaV1.7, Halo-NaV1.8, Halo-KV7.2 (28Higerd-Rusli G.P. Alsaloum M. Tyagi S. Sarveswaran N. Estacion M. Dib-Hajj F. et al.Depolarizing NaV and hyperpolarizing KV channels are co-trafficked in sensory neurons.J Neurosci. 2022; 42: 4794-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) as well as an extracellularly tagged Halo-TrkA. SNAP tag is an enzymatic tag that functions similarly to Halo tag but has a different specific cognate ligand, enabling simultaneous use with Halo tag. We transfected DRG neurons with SNAP-NaV1.7 and either Halo-NaV1.8, Halo-KV7.2, or Halo-TrkA and then labeled surface proteins with SNAP-tag ligand JF549i and Halo-tag ligand JF635i. After waiting for endocytosis to occur (beginning approximately 40 min after the start of labeling), we observed that 75 to 80% of retrogradely moving NaV1.7-carrying endosomes also contained NaV1.8, KV7.2, or TrkA (Fig. 5, A–D). These results demonstrate that late endosomes in axons do not transport one type of protein specifically but rather several proteins together. To test whether NaV1.7 channels are distributed within sensory neurons via transcytosis, we utilized cell-permeable and cell-impermeable Halo-tag ligands in the MFC system. Transfected DRG cell bodies in the soma chamber were first exposed to Halo-tag ligand JF635i, labeling only channels at the cell surface, and then to Halo-tag ligand JF549, labeling channels in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). After labeling, distal axons expressing Halo-NaV1.7 were identified by the presence of anterogradely trafficking vesicles with JF549 signal. Although these axons continued to transport JF549-tagged Halo-NaV1.7 up to 4 h after labeling, JF635i fluorescence was not reliably observed moving in the anterograde direction in three independent cultures, each of which contained dozens of transfected axons (Fig. 6B). As a positive control to ensure that transcytosis occurs in our preparation and is detectable using our methodology, we carried out the same transfection, culture, and labeling protocol using cells transfected with Halo-TrkA, a protein previously shown to undergo transcytosis (29Ascano M. Richmond A. Borden P. Kuruvilla R. Axonal targeting of Trk receptors via transcytosis regulates sensitivity to Neurotrophin responses.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11674-11685Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Several hours after labeling, JF635i that had been applied to the soma compartment was seen being trafficked anterogradely toward axonal ends, confirming that the surface-labeled Halo-TrkA had undergone transcytosis (Fig. 6C). Next, we investigated whether NaV1.7 that had undergone endocytosis could be recycled back to the cell surface. To do this, we adapted a previously published cell surface protein recycling assay (30Zadeh A.D. Xu H. Loewen M.E. Noble G.P. Steele D.F. Fedida D. Internalized Kv1.5 traffics via Rab-dependent pathways.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 4793-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), schematized in Figure 7A. Importantly, in addition to its extracellular Halo tag, Halo-NaV1.7 also contains a myc tag on its extracellular face, which facilitates cell-surface antibody labeling. DRG neurons were transfected with Halo-NaV1.7, and channels at the surface of the neurons were labeled by adding an anti-Myc antibody to the live cells. NaV1.7 at the membrane and throughout the cytoplasm were also labeled with Halo-tag ligand JF549 to facilitate identification of transfected cells (step 1). Next, the cells were returned to the incubator to allow for primary-labeled channels to undergo endocytosis (step 2). Then, the cells were labeled with a saturating concentration of Fab secondary antibody fragment conjugated to a far-red fluorophore (Fab-AF647) to label all primary-labeled channels still at the cell surface (“surface” channels, step 3). Fab fragments were used to avoid protein aggregation by secondary antibody crosslinking, though dimer formation was possible because of the bivalent nature of the primary antibody. The cells were then either kept on ice to arrest trafficking or incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to allow channel recycling to occur (step 4). Next, a saturating concentration of Fab secondary antibody fragment conjugated to a green fluorophore (Fab-AF488) was used to label any channels that had been internalized after primary labeling and then reinserted into the membrane (“recycled” channels, step 5). Interestingly, we observed differences in behavior of channels at the surface of the soma compared with those along the proximal axons, which necessitated analyzing somas and axons separately. Generally, fewer channels were seen at the surface of somas when compared with their axons. In cells that were incubated for periods too short for recycling to occur, there were clear “surface” signals around the soma and along the axon but very weak “recycled” signals (Fig. 7B, 0 h). In contrast, cells that were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C demonstrated reduced “surface” signals at the perimeter of the cell and translocation of this signal to the cytoplasm (consistent with endocytosis) and increased “recycled” signals (Figure 2, Figure 7 h). While the reduction in “surface” signal and increase in “recycled” signal between 0 and 2 h was significant along axons, the somas showed a similar trend that did not reach significance (Fig. 7, C and D). It is possible that the appearance of the “recycled” signal in axons after 2 h of incubation could be due to secondary antibodies switching from one channel to another rather than channel trafficking. To exclude this possibility, we used two control treatments known to inhibit trafficking: incubating cells at 16 °C (31Deutsch E. Weigel A.V. Akin E.J. Fox P. Hansen G. Haberkorn C.J. et al.Kv2.1 cell surface clusters are insertion platforms for ion channel delivery to the plasma membrane.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and treating cells with the ionophore monensin (29Ascano M. Richmond A. Borden P. Kuruvilla R. Axonal targeting of Trk receptors via transcytosis regulates sensitivity to Neurotrophin responses.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11674-11685Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) for the duration of the recycling step (step 4). The axons incubated at 16 °C displayed both decreased endocytosis of “surface” channels and appearance of “recycled” channels, whereas the cells treated with monensin showed normal levels of endocytosis but decreased “recycled” channels (Fig. 7, B and C). This is consistent with 16 °C incubation inhibiting both endocytosis and recycling and monensin preferentially inhibiting recycling over endocytosis. Together, these results suggest that NaV1.7 undergoes endocytosis in both the axon and soma but is preferentially recycled to the membrane of the axon. Hyperexcitability of nociceptors drives pain and is dependent on ion channel currents, which are in part dependent on levels of these channels at the cell surface, which in turn depends on regulation of the different aspects of channel trafficking. Therefore, the insights into the mechanisms of channel trafficking provided by these studies are necessary for understanding how these mechanisms might be regulated in disease and may inform efforts to modulate channel trafficking for therapeutic benefit. Until recently, the study of NaV ch"
https://openalex.org/W4312060050,"Depression is a public health concern, nearing 1.5 million cases and accounting for 9.7% of years lost due to disability. Several factors, including altitude, contribute to its development. Altitude has become a topic for recent research, but its association with depressive symptoms has not been fully clarified. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between altitude and depressive symptoms in the Peruvian population.A retrospective, cross-sectional study of the 2019 Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES in Spanish) was conducted. The dependent variable, depressive symptoms, was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the independent variable, altitude, was categorized into: <1500 meters above sea level (masl), 1500-2499 masl and ≥2500 masl. To evaluate the association between altitude and depressive symptoms, we used Poisson regression model, constructing crude and multiple models.Of those living at 1500 to 2499 masl and ≥2500 masl, 7.23% and 7.12% had depressive symptoms, respectively. After adjusting for confounding variables, high altitude was found to be associated with depressive symptoms (prevalence ratio adjusted (aPR): 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.84; aPR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.20-1.66).A statistically significant association was found between high altitude and depressive symptoms. This may be attributable to hypobaric hypoxia that occurs at high altitudes and its effects on brain function. This study's findings should be considered to identify the population at risk and expand the coverage of preventive and therapeutic measures in high-altitude areas of Peru with poor access to health services."
https://openalex.org/W4312060052,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has a high measles incidence despite elimination efforts and has yet to introduce rubella vaccine. We evaluated the performance of a prototype rapid digital microfluidics powered (DMF) enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) assessing measles and rubella infection, by testing for immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunity from natural infection or vaccine, by testing immunoglobulin G (IgG), in outbreak settings. Field evaluations were conducted during September 2017, in Kinshasa province, DRC. Blood specimens were collected during an outbreak investigation of suspected measles cases and tested for measles and rubella IgM and IgG using the DMF-ELISA in the field. Simultaneously, a household serosurvey for measles and rubella IgG was conducted in a recently confirmed measles outbreak area. DMF-ELISA results were compared with reference ELISA results tested at DRC's National Public Health Laboratory and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of 157 suspected measles cases, rubella IgM was detected in 54% while measles IgM was detected in 13%. Measles IgG-positive cases were higher among vaccinated persons (87%) than unvaccinated persons (72%). In the recent measles outbreak area, measles IgG seroprevalence was 93% overall, while rubella seroprevalence was lower for children (77%) than women (98%). Compared with reference ELISA, DMF-ELISA sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 78% for measles IgG; 88% and 89% for measles IgM; 85% and 85% for rubella IgG; and 81% and 83% for rubella IgM, respectively. Rubella infection was detected in more than half of persons meeting the suspected measles case definition during a presumed measles outbreak, suggesting substantial unrecognized rubella incidence, and highlighting the need for rubella vaccine introduction into the national schedule. The performance of the DMF-ELISA suggested that this technology can be used to develop rapid diagnostic tests for measles and rubella."
https://openalex.org/W4312069058,"This paper aims to improve understanding of factors that contribute to persistent ethnic disparities in patient satisfaction in England. The specific objectives are to (i) examine ethnic differences in patient satisfaction with their primary care in England; and (ii) establish factors that contribute to ethnic differences in patient satisfaction.The study is based on secondary analysis of recent General Practitioner Patient Survey (GPPS) datasets of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Descriptive bivariate analysis was used to examine ethnic differences in patient satisfaction across the three years. This was followed with multilevel linear regression, with General Practice (GP) at level-1 and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) at level-2 to identify factors contributing to ethnic differences in patient satisfaction.The findings show consistent negative correlations between the proportion of patients reporting good (very or fairly good) overall experience and each of the ethnic minority groups. Further examination of the distribution of patient satisfaction by ethnicity, based on combined ethnic minority groups, depicted a clear negative association between ethnic minority group and patient satisfaction at both GP and CCG levels. Multilevel regression analysis identified several service-related factors (especially ease of using GP website and being treated with care and concern) that largely explained the ethnic differences in patient satisfaction. Of all factors relating to patient characteristics considered in the analysis, none was significant after controlling for GP service-related factors.Ethnic minority patients in England continue to consistently report lower satisfaction with their primary health care in recent years. This is largely attributable to supply (service related) rather than demand (patient characteristics) factors. These findings have important implications for health care system policy and practice at both GP and CCG levels in England."

In this analysis, we included all clients who received HIV counseling and testing services, tested HIV positive, and initiated ART in SIDHAS-supported local government areas (LGAs) from April 2017 to March 2021. We employed descriptive and inferential statistics to analyze our results. A total of 2,018,082 persons were tested for HIV. Out of those tested, 102,165 (5.1%) tested HIV-positive. Comparing the pre-surge and post-surge periods, we observed an increase in HIV testing from 490,450 to 2,018,082 (p≤0.031) and in HIV-positive individuals identified from 21,234 to 102,165 (p≤0.001) respectively. Of those newly identified positives during the surge, 98.26% (100,393/102,165) were linked to antiretroviral therapy compared to 99.24% (21,073/21,234) pre-surge. Retention improved from 83.3% to 92.3% (p<0.001), and viral suppression improved from 73.5% to 96.2% (p<0.001). A combination of community and facility-based interventions implemented during the surge was associated with the rapid increase in case finding, retention, and viral suppression; propelling the State towards HIV epidemic control.

https://openalex.org/W4312069094,"Aggression towards nurses in the workplace arises from various reasons, reportedly increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Where aggression can be maintained by spiritual well-being, as it is said that spirituality is a coping skill and psychological well-being maintainer-but there is little known, especially during the pandemic. Thus, this study explored the effect of spirituality on aggression among the nurses working in the COVID-19 wards.This cross-sectional data from 200 nurses involved in the COVID-19 patient treatment were collected using a random sampling method from four hospitals in East Mazandaran province, Iran. Responses were collected based on socio-demographics, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, and Paloutzian & Ellison Spiritual Well-being Scale. T-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression were applied for data analysis.The mean age of nurses was 31.49±6.88 (range: 21-48) years. Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards have a mean score of spiritual health of 67.21±12.84 (out of 120), whereas 51.77±10.96 (out of 116) was for aggression. The results showed a significant negative weak correlation between aggression and spiritual health (r = -.285, p<0.01). As per regression analysis, spiritual health [β = -.264], age [β = -.374], and working experience [β = 4.156] were the significant factors associated with aggression (p<0.05).It is evident that nurses who consider spirituality in their life actions are in a state of reduced negative emotions, such as aggression. Thus, policymakers and managers of the healthcare settings are suggested to promote spirituality among the nurses through spiritual care education, providing the ground for promoting spirituality and a positive attitude towards it."

An analog of E1P.ADP formed in the presence of oligomycin, ADP, and AlF4 was also found to occlude sodium (23Nyblom M. Poulsen H. Gourdon P. Reinhard L. Andersson M. Lindahl E. et al.Crystal structure of Na+, K(+)-ATPase in the Na(+)-bound state.Science. 2013; 342: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These results reaffirmed the original hypothesis that sodium is occluded concomitantly with the formation of E1P. As an exception, occluded sodium was also measured in dephosphorylated enzyme in the presence of oligomycin (24Esmann M. Skou J.C. Occlusion of Na+ by the Na,K-ATPase in the presence of oligomycin.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, none of the aforementioned conditions allow assessing the contribution of Na+-occluded states during the normal transport cycle. It is evident that sodium deocclusion needs to be effectively quenched for states with occluded Na+ to be captured and measured. In the case of cation occlusion, it is mandatory to preserve the structure of the pump, and denaturing agents cannot be used (25Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. World Scientific, Cambridge2017Crossref Google Scholar). Instead, other physicochemical procedures are required, such as a sudden drop in temperature (which is not sufficient for this specific purpose) or the use of a stabilizing agent at neutral pH. We took advantage of the finding that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg) stabilizes all the intermediates of the pump in the E1 conformation (26Ochiai H. Takeda K. Soeda S. Tahara Y. Takenaka H. Abe K. et al.Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is an inhibitor of Na+, K(+)-ATPase by favoring the E1 conformation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in a way similar to that of oligomycin (27Esmann M. Oligomycin interaction with Na,K-ATPase: oligomycin binding and dissociation are slow processes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Esmann M. Properties of oligomycin-induced occlusion of Na+ by detergent-solubilized Na,K-ATPase from pig kidney or shark rectal gland.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast to oligomycin, EGCg has three orders of magnitude higher water solubility, which allows millimolar concentrations of the agent in the solution. Such high concentrations, combined with its relatively high affinity for the Na+/K+-ATPase, ensure prompt binding of EGCg to the enzyme and its applicability in quench-flow experiments. Here, we report the direct measurement of Na+ occlusion in transport intermediates of the Na+/K+-ATPase. We determined that the Na+/K+-ATPase is capable of spontaneously occluding sodium in a cooperative manner. We also found that Na+-occluded intermediates represent a minor fraction of the total enzyme during ATP hydrolysis and that their level is restored upon ATP depletion. In the next few paragraphs, we characterize the ability of EGCg to stabilize the E1 conformations of the enzyme and, when added to the washing solution of a rapid filtration procedure, to be used as a quencher preventing the loss of Na from the occluded intermediates. It has been reported that EGCg inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase activity by stabilizing the E1 conformation of the pump. In agreement with Ochiai et al. (26Ochiai H. Takeda K. Soeda S. Tahara Y. Takenaka H. Abe K. et al.Epigallocatechin-3-gallate is an inhibitor of Na+, K(+)-ATPase by favoring the E1 conformation.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we found that ATPase activity decreases with [EGCg] with a K0.5 of 1.10 ± 0.03 μM (Fig. S1). Using eosin to assess the E2 → E1 conformational change in the Na+/K+-ATPase, we found that when EGCg was added to Rb+-bound enzyme, it shifted the equilibrium to the E1 conformation (Fig. S2) with an observed kinetic coefficient of about 0.132 ± 0.003 s−1, regardless of the concentration of EGCg in the tested range. To assess the effect of EGCg on the enzyme affinity for Na+, we measured eosin fluorescence under equilibrium conditions, at varying concentrations of EGCg and Rb+ (Fig. 2). In Figure 2, A–C, we show normalized results (F/F∞) of the original data (Fig. S3) as described in the Experimental procedures section. Normalized eosin fluorescence increases with [EGCg] in the absence of Na+ and further increases with [Na+] along sigmoid curves (29Skou J.C. Esmann M. The effects of Na+ and K+ on the conformational transitions of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 746: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) indicating a shift toward the E1 conformation that involves the binding of more than one Na+ ion. There is a shift to the left of the curves as [EGCg] increases, for all Rb+ concentrations tested, with a corresponding decrease in the values of K0.5 for Na+ (Fig. 2D). As shown by Esmann (30Esmann M. Influence of Na+ on conformational states in membrane-bound renal Na,K-ATPase.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8558-8565Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these values increase with [Rb+] (Fig. 2E). We can conclude that EGCg stabilizes states of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the E1 conformation and increases the affinity of the enzyme for Na+. We investigated if EGCg works as a stabilizing agent of Na+/K+-ATPase Na+-occluded species. Our procedure uses a rapid filtration technique in which EGCg is typically present only in the washing solution (see Experimental procedures section). The underlying hypothesis is that the binding of EGCg to the enzyme instantaneously stabilizes those intermediates containing occluded Na+ (Fig. 3). The washing solution also contains unlabeled Na+ and K+ in concentrations high enough to prevent the formation of new 22Na+-occluded species (Fig. S4). To test the optimal concentration of EGCg in the washing solution, the amount of 22Na+ retained on the filters was measured as a function of [EGCg] for reaction media with 6 mM or 12 mM NaCl (Fig. 4A). The values increased with the concentration of EGCg tending to a plateau. From these results, we decided to supplement washing solutions with 1 mM EGCg in order to quench reactions. To determine the volume of solution necessary to wash out free 22Na+, we performed an experiment where the filters were washed with different volumes of ice-cold buffer immediately after the reaction mixture was injected into the quenching-and-washing chamber (QWC). Results in Figure 4B show that using around 100 ml of washing solution (2.5 s at a flow rate of 40 ml s−1) is enough to wash out most of the free radioactivity on the filters; note that 2.3 × 106 cpm were injected into the QWC in each determination. These results led us to establish a volume of 250 ml to ensure proper washing. The control without EGCg in the washing solution produced much lower values, being the difference between the values obtained with and without EGCg in the washing solution constant with the washing volume (Fig. 4B). This difference must mainly be caused by the presence of Na+-occluded species, and its invariance denotes that these species are stable during the washing step. These results show that combining the cooling-and-washing procedure with the use of EGCg as a stabilizing agent allows the detection of Na+-occluded intermediates. It is noteworthy that the use of thermally inactivated enzyme produces lower 22Na+ retention values than intact enzyme when incubated with a very high concentration of unlabeled Na+ (Fig. S5)—accounting only for a fraction of the unspecific retention of radioactivity—and would lead to an overestimation of the amount of occluded Na+ if it were used as blanks. We also verified that retained Na+ is proportional to the amount of Na+/K+-ATPase and that at least part of it is unspecific, as evinced by an experiment carried at 10 mM K+ (Fig. S6). To determine the affinity for Na+ of the Na+/K+-ATPase to form Na+-occluded states (cf., Fig. 3A), we measured occluded Na+ as a function of [Na+] (Fig. 5). In addition, the enzyme was incubated in the presence of EGCg to investigate whether this inhibitor modifies the enzyme affinity for Na+. We observed that the Na+/K+-ATPase spontaneously occludes Na+ and that its affinity for the cation is not affected by EGCg. A control experiment omitting EGCg in the washing solution was also included, showing a linear increase of retained Na+, which suggests its unspecific nature, insufficient however to be used as a blank (Fig. S5). Data could be described by RetainedNa+=Occmax[Na+]K0.5+[Na+]+m[Na+](1) where Occmax is the maximal Na+ occlusion capacity of the enzyme and m is the slope of unspecific Na+ binding. For active and EGCg-inhibited enzymes, respectively, we found Occmax values of 6.0 ± 0.2 and 6.5 ± 0.2 mM and K0.5 for Na+ of 2.6 ± 0.3 and 2.6 ± 0.2 mM (Fig. 5B). These results show that, provided that EGCg is included in the washing step, similar values are obtained when the enzyme is incubated with or without EGCg. This fact indicates that our procedure allows quantitative detection of almost all Na+-occluded species and that EGCg does not change the affinity for Na+ or promote any further occlusion beyond that that spontaneously occurs. Considering the number of nucleotide sites in the preparations used in this work (see Experimental procedures section), the maximum occlusion values are consistent with a stoichiometry of three Na+ ions per enzyme unit. The hyperbolic shape of the specific component seems to contrast with the proposal of cooperativity between Na+-binding sites. However, an experiment performed at very low concentrations of Na+ revealed the existence of significant interactions between the Na+ sites (Fig. 6). The enzyme was incubated with carrier-free 22Na+ (about 48 nM) plus increasing concentrations of unlabeled NaCl. It is evident that, because of the decrease of the specific activity of 22Na+, the radioactivity on the filters decreases as the concentration of unlabeled Na+ increases indefinitely. However, the addition of up to 10 μM unlabeled Na+ leads to an increase in radioactivity on the filters (Fig. 6, inset), which showed to be significant (p < 0.01). Such an increase should not happen if the Na+-binding sites were identical and independent, and it reveals the existence of positive interactions between these sites that more than compensate for the drop in specific activity of 22Na+. Therefore, the hyperbolic shape of the curves in Figure 5B is only apparent, and sigmoidicity should be observed at a very low [Na+]. The results of eosin fluorescence (Fig. 2) and Na+ occlusion experiments (Fig. 5) are contradictory: EGCg increased the affinity for Na+ in the eosin experiments with K0.5 values in the submillimolar range, whereas, in occlusion experiments, the affinity for Na+ appeared to be an order of magnitude lower and not significantly affected by EGCg. This apparent discrepancy is easily resolved if we hypothesize that, while the formation of the occluded state increases with the number of sites occupied by Na+, the binding of a single Na+ is enough to promote the E1 conformation. The model in Figure 7, which does not intend a detailed quantitative description of the experimental observations, is based on this idea. The model assumes that the Na+/K+-ATPase exists in two main conformations, E1 and E2, and that the sequential binding of three Na+ to E1 leads to a state, E1(Na3), that is the only one capable of becoming occluded. This does not exclude the possibility of the existence of occluded species with less than three Na+, but these would represent only small fractions of the occluded Na+. The K+-congener Rb+ can also bind to the enzyme, in either of the two conformations. For the sake of simplicity of the model, only one Rb+ ion was considered ignoring the known stoichiometry of two Rb+ per enzyme unit. EGCg can bind to all states in the E1 conformation, regardless of whether its sites are empty or occupied by Na+ or Rb+. In general (Fig. 8), the model adequately explains (i) the effect of Na+, which increases the fluorescence of eosin through curves that are the more sigmoid, the higher the concentration of Rb+ (cf., Fig. 2, A–C); it also allows to explain the interaction between Na+ sites observed in Figure 6; (ii) the effect of Rb+, which decreases both the fluorescence of eosin and the affinity of the enzyme for Na+ (cf., Fig. 2); and (iii) the effect of EGCg, which increases the affinity for Na+ in eosin fluorescence experiments (for any [Rb+]) but keeps it unchanged in Na+ occlusion experiments (cf., Fig. 5); it also explains why EGCg promotes the E1 conformation even in the absence of Na+ (cf., Fig. 2, A–C). As a K+ congener, Rb+ can bind to the cation transport sites, which should lead to a decrease in the affinity of the Na+/K+-ATPase for Na+ (cf., Fig. 2E). A natural consequence of this competitive effect is that increasing Rb+ concentrations decrease the amount of occluded Na+ (Figs. 9A and S7A). The model in Figure 7 also predicts this effect (not shown). The sigmoid shape of the curve reflects the binding of more than one Rb+ per enzyme unit. Like Rb+, Mg2+ also interferes with Na+ binding (31Sachs J.R. Interaction of magnesium with the sodium pump of the human red cell.J. Physiol. 1988; 400: 575-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Pilotelle-Bunner A. Cornelius F. Sebban P. Kuchel P.W. Clarke R.J. Mechanism of Mg2+ binding in the Na+,K+-ATPase.Biophys.

Modulation of the Na,K-ATPase by magnesium ions.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and causes a decrease in occluded Na+ (Figs. 9B and S7B). Crystallographic studies show that Mg2+ can also bind to the cation transport sites (34Laursen M. Yatime L. Nissen P. Fedosova N.U. Crystal structure of the high-affinity Na+K+-ATPase-ouabain complex with Mg2+ bound in the cation binding site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 10958-10963Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), even though it is not transported by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Up to this point, we have shown that nonphosphorylated states of Na+/K+-ATPase can occlude Na+. It is a well-known fact that the enzyme can perform ATPase activity in the absence of K+, the Na+-ATPase activity cycle, at a rate that is only about 5% of its maximal activity in the presence of K+. To evaluate sodium occlusion as a transport step in the catalytic cycle, we measured its time course during the Na+-ATPase activity of the pump (cf., Fig. 3B). Results in Figure 10A show that, after the addition of ATP and Mg2+, occluded sodium transiently decreases and then increases as ATP is depleted. It is noteworthy that the addition of ATP, which activates the Na+-ATPase cycling mechanism, allowing the formation of E1P(Na3), does not produce an increase in Na+ occlusion. On the contrary, occluded sodium transiently decreases as long as ATP is present. The explanation for this transient decrease could be that during the Na+-ATPase reaction cycle (see the model in Fig. 11A), the enzyme redistributes between a larger number of conformations (mainly in the E2P state), which do not hold occluded sodium. Consequently, the addition of ATP should lead to a decrease in occluded sodium, a condition that lasts until the complete depletion of ATP and the establishment of a new equilibrium. In this experiment, we did not attempt to monitor the pre–steady-state phase (the phosphorylation reaction) given its high speed and the interval analyzed. As shown in Figure 10A, the higher the [ATP], the longer it takes for the same amount of enzyme to consume it and to reach the new equilibrium level of occluded Na+, which is significantly lower than the initial one because of the presence of Mg2+ (see Fig. 9B for the effect of Mg2+). We measured steady-state occluded Na+ 2 s after the addition of ATP to the enzyme suspension pre-equilibrated with different concentrations of 22Na+ (Fig. S9C). The results are compared (Fig. 10B) with those of equilibrium experiments performed in media free of ATP and Mg2+ or containing 0.5 mM free Mg2+. The value of K0.5 for Na+ in the presence of 0.5 mM Mg2+ decreased from 11.1 ± 1.9 mM under equilibrium conditions to 4.5 ± 3.2 mM in steady state. Because of the presence of Mg2+, both the steady-state and equilibrium experiments show lower affinities for Na+ than in the absence of Mg2+ (K0.5 for Na+ of 2.6 ± 0.3, closed circles in Figs. 5B and 10B). Note that the maximum value of occluded Na+ in the absence and presence of Mg2+ remains unchanged (6.0 ± 0.2 versus 6.0 ± 0.4 nmol mg−1). More interestingly, steady-state occluded sodium reaches a maximum value much lower than the equilibrium curves (1.0 ± 0.2 nmol mg−1) (Fig. 11). The scheme in Figure 11A is a simplified version of the Albers–Post model of the Na+-ATPase cycle, including the new findings reported in this article (see Fig. S8 for a more detailed description). States within boxes stand for the sum of every possible Na+-bound species, considered in rapid equilibrium with one another. Note that besides E1P(Na3), which exclusively exists as a state with occluded sodium, some species within the E1, E1ATP, and E1ADP boxes also contribute to sodium occlusion, whereas none of the species within the E2P box can occlude sodium. Simulations of the model in Figure 11A using parameter values in Table 1 adequately reproduce the experimental findings (a complete list of parameters, including equilibrium constants for Na+ binding, is shown in Table S2). In particular, time courses show a rapid decrease in sodium occlusion as the enzyme remains in a steady state (Fig. 11B), during which E2P states—which do not occlude sodium—are predominant (cf., Fig. 10A). Besides, the duration of such a state increases with the concentration of ATP initially added and remains until all ATP is consumed. When considering Na+ occlusion as a function of [Na+] (Fig. 11C), simulated results correctly predict Na+ occlusion in equilibrium (with Mg2+, cf., open circles in Fig. 9B) as well as under steady-state conditions (cf., gray circles in Fig. 9B). The model also explains the increase in the affinity for Na+ and the considerable reduction in the maximum value of Na+ occluded in steady state compared with that in equilibrium (cf., Fig. 10B). Moreover, the steady-state equations derived predict that the relationship (steady state/equilibrium) between occlusion values as [Na+] tends to infinity approximately represents the fraction of the phosphorylated enzyme that exists as E1P in steady state, that is (k21 + kdp3)/(k12 + k21 + kdp3)—see Supporting information section.Table 1Summary of parameter values used for simulations shown in Figures 10A and 11, B and C of the model presented in Figure 11AParameterValueReferencekATP15 μM−1 s−1Heyse et al.

https://openalex.org/W4311985934,"Energy homeostasis is a complex system involving multiple hormones, neuropeptides, and receptors. Prokineticins (PK1 and PK2) are agonists to two G protein-coupled receptors, prokineticin receptor 1 and 2 (PKR1 and PKR2), which decrease food intake when injected in rodents. The relative contribution of PKR1 and PKR2 to the anorexigenic effect of PK2 and their site of action in the brain have not yet been elucidated. While PKR1 and PKR2 are both expressed in the hypothalamus, a central region involved in the control of energy homeostasis, PKR2 is also present in the amygdala, which has recently been shown to regulate food intake in response to several anorexigenic signals. PKR trafficking and signaling are inhibited by the melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2), thus suggesting that MRAP2 has the potential to alter the anorexigenic activity of PK2 in vivo. In this study, we investigated the importance of PKR1 and PKR2 for PK2-mediated inhibition of food intake, the brain region involved in this function, and the effect of MRAP2 on PK2 action in vivo. Using targeted silencing of PKR2 and chemogenetic manipulation of PKR2 neurons, we show that the anorexigenic effect of PK2 is mediated by PKR2 in the amygdala and that altering MRAP2 expression in PKR2 neurons modulates the activity of PK2. Collectively, our results provide evidence that inhibition of food intake by PKs is not mediated through activation of hypothalamic neurons but rather amygdala PKR2 neurons and further establishes the importance of MRAP2 in the regulation of energy homeostasis."

Due to the high water content of cartilage, one of the main physical stimuli sensed by chondrocytes is hydrostatic pressure. We previously showed that high pressure above 20 MPa induced gene expression changes in chondrocyte precursor cells similar to what is observed in OA. Micro-RNAs are small non-coding RNAs essential to many physiological and pathological process including OA. As the micro-RNA miR-155 has been found increased in OA chondrocytes, we investigated the effects of high pressure on the expression of the miR-155 host gene Mir155hg. The chondrocyte progenitor cell line ATDC5 was pressurized under hydrostatic pressure up to 25 MPa and the expression of Mir155hg or the resulting micro-RNAs were measured; pharmacological inhibitors were used to identify the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of Mir155hg. We found that Mir155hg is strongly and rapidly up-regulated by high, but not moderate, pressure in chondrocyte progenitor cells. This up-regulation likely involves the membrane channel pannexin-1 and several intracellular signaling molecules including PKC and Src. MiR-155-5p and -3p were also up-regulated by pressure though somewhat later than Mir155hg, and a set of known miR-155-5p target genes, including Ikbke, Smarca4 and Ywhae, was affected by pressure, suggesting that Mir155hg may have important roles in cartilage physiology."

Considering the impacts of coexistent NAFLD and CKD on morbidity and mortality rates, screening strategies for groups at high-risk of CKD are needed in community-dwelling individuals with NAFLD. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and distribution of CKD in NAFLD, as well as the risk factors for CKD and the correlation with liver fibrosis in asymptomatic individuals with NAFLD at primary healthcare centers in Korea.This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from 13 health-promotion centers in 10 Korean cities. Liver steatosis and stiffness were assessed using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), respectively. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio or proteinuria. CKD was categorized into four stages: no CKD, mild, moderate, and severe. Comparisons according to the CKD stages in NAFLD were performed using Student's t-test or the chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for CKD and the correlation with liver fibrosis in NAFLD.The prevalence of CKD was 12.4% in NAFLD. Albuminuria (16.2%) and proteinuria (8.0%) were more prevalent in NAFLD. NAFLD (odd ratio = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.09-1.48, P = 0.003) was independently associated with CKD of at least mild stage. However, there was no significant association between CKD of at least moderate stage and NAFLD after adjusting for age and a metabolically unhealthy status. CKD was associated with significant liver fibrosis as measured by MRE in NAFLD.The presence of NAFLD and liver fibrosis were independent risk factors for CKD, but NAFLD was not an independent risk factor for the later stages of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4312036826,"The objective of this exploratory modelling study was to estimate the effects of second-trimester, ultrasound-based antenatal detection strategies for vasa praevia (VP) in a hypothetical cohort of pregnant women. For this, a decision-analytic tree model was developed covering four discrete detection pathways/strategies: no screening; screening targeted at women undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF); screening targeted at women with low-lying placentas (LLP); screening targeted at women with velamentous cord insertion (VCI) or a bilobed or succenturiate (BL/S) placenta. Main outcome measures were the number of referrals to transvaginal sonography (TVS), diagnosed and undiagnosed cases of VP, overdetected cases of VCI, and VP-associated perinatal mortality. The greatest number of referrals to TVS occurred in the LLP-based (2,083) and VCI-based screening (1,319) pathways. These two pathways also led to the highest proportions of pregnancies diagnosed with VP (VCI-based screening: 552 [78.9% of all pregnancies]; LLP-based: 371 [53.5%]) and the lowest proportions of VP leading to perinatal death (VCI-based screening: 100 [14.2%]; LLP-based: 196 [28.0%]). In contrast, the IVF-based pathway resulted in 66 TVS referrals, 50 VP diagnoses (7.1% of all VP pregnancies), and 368 (52.6%) VP-associated perinatal deaths which was comparable to the no screening pathway (380 [54.3%]). The VCI-based pathway resulted in the greatest detection of VCI (14,238 [99.1%]), followed by the IVF-based pathway (443 [3.1%]); no VCI detection occurred in the LLP-based or no screening pathways. In conclusion, the model results suggest that a targeted LLP-based approach could detect a substantial proportion of VP cases, while avoiding VCI overdetection and requiring minimal changes to current clinical practice. High-quality data is required to explore the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this and other detection strategies further. This is necessary to provide a robust basis for future discussion about routine screening for VP."

Experiment two— after the 5-h immersion, Bupi-1 . 5 and TMS-5 treated animals were comparable in heart rates. 43% of TMS-5 animals and 14% of the Bupi-1 . 5 animals had completely ceased heart rates at T5h. At 19 h all remaining animals exhibited rigor mortis and had ceased heart rate. We recommend 19-h of immersion using either TMS-5 or Bupi-1.5 for cessation of heart rate in African Clawed frogs. These data are strong support for the use of secondary physical methods for euthanasia in African Clawed frogs when euthanasia by immersion is performed."
https://openalex.org/W4312069049,"Functional effectiveness of erythrocytes depends on their high deformability that allows them to pass through narrow tissue capillaries. The erythrocytes can deform easily due to discoid shape provided by the stabilization of an optimal cell volume at a given cell surface area. We used mathematical simulation to study the role of transport Na/K-ATPase and transmembrane Na + and K + gradients in human erythrocyte volume stabilization at non-selective increase in cell membrane permeability to cations. The model included Na/K-ATPase activated by intracellular Na + , Na + and K + transmembrane gradients, and took into account contribution of glycolytic metabolites and adenine nucleotides to cytoplasm osmotic pressure. We found that this model provides the best stabilization of the erythrocyte volume at non-selective increase in the permeability of the cell membrane, which can be caused by an oxidation of the membrane components or mechanical stress during circulation. The volume of the erythrocyte deviates from the optimal value by no more than 10% with a change in the non-selective permeability of the cell membrane to cations from 50 to 200% of the normal value. If only one transmembrane ion gradient is present (Na + ), the cell loses the ability to stabilize volume and even small changes in membrane permeability cause dramatic changes in the cell volume. Our results reveal that the presence of two oppositely directed transmembrane ion gradients is fundamentally important for robust stabilization of cellular volume in human erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4312114391,"The musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) severity and frequency questionnaire (MSFQ) has been used with agriculturists. Although it frequently appears in the literature, it does not periodically reflect the levels of MSDs. This study aimed to develop a MSDs assessment tool for agriculturists via an online database. The four hospitals that were assigned to the development and tryout group received a random selection of participants from 33 health promoting hospitals. In the development phase, 55 agriculturists (from two hospitals) completed the structured interview questionnaire. The MSFQ document for the analysis of MSDs symptoms among agriculturists was concentrated on the frequency and severity of symptoms. The online MSFQ was checked by using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) in a one-way random-effects model. In the tryout phase, a group of 44 agriculturists (from another two hospitals) completed a similar online MSFQ. Cronbach's alpha was used to test the reliability of the online self-reported MSDs questionnaires. A Likert rating scale, used to measure the satisfaction of users, was divided into three categories: information, program design, and benefits. The development phase showed an ICC = 0.99 with a 95% CI = 0.98-0.99. More than 65 percent of agriculturists were female, aged from 41-50 years old. A large number of them were engaged in self-cultivation. Their main crops were rice and cassava. In total, 50% reported that they had experienced mild MSDs levels. The shoulder, knee-calf, and hip-thigh areas were the top three parts of the body where agriculturists had experienced MSDs from cultivation. Excellent reliability of online MSFQ was found after the tryout. The agriculturists were very satisfied overall (information, program design, and benefits). Developments to the MSFQ and online administration did not diminish its reliability for obtaining information about the level of MSDs of agriculturists' musculoskeletal symptoms. This self-reported MSDs questionnaire was appropriate to be used among agriculturists."
https://openalex.org/W4312115352,"To assess access to general and disability-related health care among people with disabilities in the Maldives.This study uses data from a case-control study (n = 711) nested within a population-based, nationally representative survey to compare health status and access to general healthcare amongst people with and without disabilities. Cases and controls were matched by gender, location and age. Unmet need for disability-related healthcare is also assessed. Multivariate regression was used for comparisons between people with and without disabilities.People with disabilities had poorer levels of health compared to people without disabilities, including poorer self-rated health, increased likelihood of having a chronic condition and of having had a serious health event in the previous 12 months. Although most people with and without disabilities sought care when needed, people with disabilities were much more likely to report difficulties when routinely accessing healthcare services compared to people without disabilities. Additionally, 24% of people with disabilities reported an unmet need for disability-related healthcare, which was highest amongst people with hearing, communication and cognitive difficulties, as well as amongst older adults and people living in the lowest income per capita quartile. Median healthcare spending in the past month was modest for people with and without disabilities. However, people with disabilities appear to have high episodic healthcare costs, such as for disability-related healthcare and when experiencing a serious health event.This study found evidence that people with disabilities experience unmet needs for both disability-related and general healthcare. There is therefore evidence that people with disabilities in the Maldives are falling behind in core components relevant to UHC: availability of all services needed, and quality and affordability of healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W4311987328,"CXXC5, a member of the CXXC family of zinc-finger proteins, is associated with numerous pathological processes. However, the pathophysiological function of CXXC5 has not been clearly established. Herein, we found that CXXC5 interacts with the CRL4B and NuRD complexes. Screening of transcriptional targets downstream of the CXXC5-CRL4B-NuRD complex by next-generation sequencing (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) revealed that the complex regulates the transcriptional repression process of a cohort of genes, including TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1), which play important roles in cell growth and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway regulation, and whose abnormal regulation results in the activation of programmed cell death-ligand protein 1 (PD-L1). Intriguingly, CXXC5 expression increased after stimulation with vitamin B2 but decreased after vitamin D treatment. We also found that the CXXC5-CRL4B-NuRD complex promotes the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and accelerates the growth of breast cancer in vivo. The expression of CXXC5, CUL4B, and MTA1 increased during the occurrence and development of breast cancer, and correspondingly, TSC1 expression decreased. Meanwhile, a high expression of CXXC5 was positively correlated with the histological grade of high malignancy and poor survival of patients. In conclusion, our study revealed that CXXC5-mediated TSC1 suppression activates the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, reduces autophagic cell death, induces PD-L1-mediated immune suppression, and results in tumor development, shedding light on the mechanism of the pathophysiological function of CXXC5."
https://openalex.org/W4312003232,"Providing care for the dependent older person is complex and there have been persistent concerns about care quality as well as a growing recognition of the need for systems approaches to improvement. The I-SCOPE (Improving Systems of Care for the Older person) project employed Resilient Healthcare (RHC) theory and the CARE (Concepts for Applying Resilience) Model to study how care organisations adapt to complexity in everyday work, with the aim of exploring how to support resilient performance. The project was an in-depth qualitative study across multiple sites over 24 months. There were: 68 hours of non-participant observation, shadowing care staff at work and starting broad before narrowing to observe care domains of interest; n = 33 recorded one-to-one interviews (32 care staff and one senior inspector); three focus groups (n = 19; two with inspectors and one multi-disciplinary group); and five round table discussions on emergent results at a final project workshop (n = 31). All interviews and discussion groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Resident and family interviews (n = 8) were facilitated through use of emotional touchpoints. Analysis using QSR NVivo 12.0 focused on a) capturing everyday work in terms of the interplay between demand and capacity, adaptations and intended and unintended outcomes and b) a higher-level thematic description (care planning and use of information; coordination of everyday care activity; providing person-centred care) which gives an overview of resilient performance and how it might be enhanced. This gives important new insight for improvement. Conclusions are that resilience can be supported through more efficient use of information, supporting flexible adaptation, coordination across care domains, design of the physical environment, and family involvement based on realistic conversations about quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4312003239,"Temporary changes in the menstrual cycle have recently been reported following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In the current study, we aimed to screen menstrual cycle changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection in Saudi Arabia. The type and duration of these changes have been screened in relation to the severity of coronavirus disease symptoms and vaccination status. In total, 956 individuals responded: sixty-nine did not get the COVID-19 vaccine, while the remaining were vaccinated with either a single dose of ChAdOx1 vaccine (n:45) or BNT162b2 vaccine (n: 142) or two doses of the vaccine (n:700) using BNT162b2 (n:477), ChAdOx1 (n:89) or ChAdOx1/ BNT162b2 (n:134). Approximately 26.1% (18/69) of the subjects who did not receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 15.3% (29/188) and 26.4% (185/700) of the subjects who received single and double doses of the vaccines, respectively, reported menstrual cycle changes. The persistence of menstrual cycle changes for more than six months was reported by 6.4% (61/956) of the participants. These changes were significantly correlated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. We concluded that menstrual cycle changes, associated with COVID-19 infection, increase due to the severity of COVID-19 infection. Thus, menstrual cycle changes are among the long-term effects associated with COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4312003271,"A deep understanding of the cattle gastrointestinal microbiome is crucial to selective breeding high-efficiency animals that produce more and generate less environmental damage. Here we performed the taxonomic identification of Bacterial and Archaeal communities using high throughput 16SrRNA gene sequencing from critical compartments of the gastrointestinal tract of Bradford cattle raised in a natural grassland in the Pampa biome, Brazil. We analyzed 110 samples, including saliva, ruminal fluid, and feces from 36 months old Bradford heifers (weighing on average 343 ± 30 kg by the sampling time). To reduce unexpected variation and confounders, we selected the animals from the same breed, submitted them to the same food source, and collected the samples for three consecutive years from different animals in the same season. Our main goal was to analyze the microbial shifts throughout the gastrointestinal tract to reference future works proposing management strategies and interventions to improve animal nutrition and increase production in the Pampa Biome. To accomplish our objective, we accessed the microbial community differences in groups with a high and low weight gain controlling for food ingestion and quality of grazed pasture. Few taxa were shared among the samples. About 40% of the phyla and 60% of the genera were unique from saliva samples, and 12.4% of the microbial genera were uniquely found in feces. All samples shared only 36.1% of phyla and 7.5% of genera. Differences in microbial diversity and taxa counts were observed. The ruminal fluid presented the lowest microbial richness, while saliva and feces presented the highest microbial richness. On the other hand, saliva and feces also presented more distinct communities between themselves when compared with ruminal samples. Our data showed that the saliva microbiome is not representative of the rumen microbiome and should not be used as an easy-to-collect sample for studies about the rumen microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W4312036667,"Glucocorticoids (GC) replacement are the mainstay treatment for 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), in its classical form. There are novel insights into the genetic basis of the GC action diversity that point to an important role for GC receptor (GR) gene polymorphisms, suggesting a possible modulation in occurrence of metabolic disorders, what may be relevant to clinical management of 21-OHD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the five GR gene polymorphisms Tth111 I, ER22 , 23EK , Bcl I, 9β (rs10052957, rs6189, rs6190, rs41423247, rs6198) and their combination into haplotypes are associated to different GC response in a cohort of classic 21-OHD subjects. GR genotype-phenotype associations were explored after a dexamethasone suppression test using very low-doses (VLD-DST), 20 and 40 μg/m². The final sample (n = 28) was selected based on the 102 individuals’ previous genotypes classification, according to literature data of GC sensitivity or resistance. Thus, only patients with GC increased resistance (n = 18) or increased sensitivity (n = 10) profiles were selected. Out of 28 subjects aged 12 (2–34) years enrolled in this study, 75% were females, 75% presented the salt-wasting form (SW) and 25% the simple virilizing form (SV). Subjects who carried Tth111 I and 9β , associated or not to the ER22/23EK variants, showed an impaired DST response. Results did not differ significantly according to gender or body mass index. SV subjects with GC hypersensitivity-genotypes showed decreased average cortisol levels compared to those with GC resistance-genotypes (p = 0.0023). The Tth111 I + 9β/ Wild or Tth111 I + ER22/23EK + 9β/ Wild genotypes were associated to GC resistance in this population. This finding may be relevant given the challenges posed by therapeutic management with GC in CAH."
https://openalex.org/W4312036698,"Purpose This study investigated the effects of acute, pre-exercise, hydrogen rich water (HRW) ingestion on running time to exhaustion at maximal aerobic speed in trained track and field runners. Methods Twenty-four, male runners aged 17.5 ± 1.8 years, with body mass index = 21.0 ± 1.3 kg⋅m -2 , and maximal oxygen uptake = 55.0 ± 4.6 ml⋅kg -1 ⋅min -1 (mean ± standard deviation) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. All runners ingested 1260 ml of HRW which was divided into four doses and taken at 120 min (420 ml), 60 min (420 ml), 30 min (210 ml), and 10 min (210 ml) prior to exercise. The running protocol consisted of three phases: warm-up performed at 10 km⋅h -1 for 3 min, followed by a transition phase performed at an individually determined speed (10 km⋅h -1 + maximal aerobic speed)/2 for 1 min, and finally the third phase performed at individual maximal aerobic speed until exhaustion. Time to exhaustion, cardiorespiratory variables, and post-exercise blood lactate concentration were measured. Results When running to exhaustion at maximal aerobic speed, compared with placebo, HRW had no significant effects on the following variables: time to exhaustion (217 ± 49 and 227 ± 53 s, p = 0.20), post-exercise blood lactate concentration (9.9 ± 2.2 and 10.1 ± 2.0 mmol⋅L -1 , p = 0.42), maximal heart rate (186 ± 9 and 186 ± 9 beats⋅min -1 , p = 0.80), and oxygen uptake (53.1 ± 4.5 and 52.2 ± 4.7 ml⋅kg -1 ⋅min -1 , p = 0.33). No variable assessed as a candidate moderator was significantly correlated with time to exhaustion (Spearman’s correlation coefficients ranged from −0.28 to 0.30, all p ≥ 0.16). Conclusions Pre-exercise administration of 1260 ml of HRW showed no ergogenic effect on running performance to exhaustion at maximal aerobic speed in trained track and field runners."
https://openalex.org/W4312036777,"Newborn screening tests (NST) are important public health procedures with potential to improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity/mortality by identifying metabolic, genetic, enzymatic, and endocrinological diseases/conditions. In the United States (U.S.), Hawaii conducts the fewest NST (28) and Connecticut conducts the most (75). The purpose of this research is to determine if difficulty receiving specialty care for children with genetic diseases is associated with NST determination of the genetic condition. The research hypothesis is that parents/guardians of children with determination of genetic disease from NST are more likely to report no/slight difficulty accessing specialty care versus parents/guardians of children with genetic diseases whose determination was other than NST. This study has a cross-sectional design with National Survey of Children's Health, 2020 data. Data were analyzed for frequency, Rao Scott Chi square, and logistic regression analyses. Of 833 children with genetic diseases, most parents/guardians reported no/slight difficulty in receiving needed specialty care; however, children whose determination of a genetic condition was other than NST were 4.82 times as likely (95%CI: 1.66, 14.02; p = 0.0040) to have difficulty. In analysis adjusted for sex, race, age, premature birth, and birthweight, the adjusted odds ratio was 6.71 (95% CI:1.91, 23.60 p = 0.0031). Parents/guardians of children screened with a positive NST reported less difficulty in receiving needed specialist care as compared with reports of parents/guardians of children with genetic conditions who were diagnosed later. The implication is there would be greater population level benefits realized in the U.S. if NST were expanded in states conducting minimal testing."
https://openalex.org/W4312060017,"Women who use drugs (WWUD) experience structural vulnerabilities (e.g., housing, food insecurities) and comorbidities that elevate their susceptibility to more severe COVID-19 symptoms or fatality compared to similarly-aged women who do not use illicit drugs. Testing is a cornerstone of effective COVID prevention, however, entrenched barriers to healthcare utilization means that WWUD may have diminished accessing to COVID testing. The CARE (COVID Action Research Engagement) study first examines predisposing and enabling factors that predict COVID testing uptake over six months (baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up) among a cohort of WWUD (N = 250) in Baltimore, Maryland, providing a nuanced and holistic understanding of how to meaningfully engage WWUD in COVID testing. Then, point-of-care COVID testing will be implemented on a mobile outreach van affiliated with a local community-based organization primarily serving WWUD; anonymous surveys of mobile outreach guests (N = 100) will assess feasibility and acceptability of this integrated testing. The study is grounded in the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations and the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. We hypothesize that point-of-care COVID testing integrated into a low-barrier harm reduction service, such as a mobile outreach program, will be an enabling environment for COVID testing uptake in part by reducing structural impediments to testing and will be highly feasible and acceptable to participants. Strengths, limitations, and plans for results dissemination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4312060022,"MHC genes play a fundamental role in immune recognition of pathogens and parasites. Therefore, females may increase offspring heterozygosity and genetic diversity by selecting males with genetically compatible or heterozygous MHC. In birds, several studies suggest that MHC genes play a role in mate choice, and recent evidence suggests that olfaction may play a role in the MHC-II discrimination. However, whether olfaction is involved in MHC-I discrimination in birds remains unknown. Previous studies indicate that house sparrow females with low allelic diversity prefer males with higher diversity in MHC-I alleles. Here, we directly explored whether female and male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) could estimate by scent MHC-I diversity and/or dissimilarity of potential partners. Our results show that neither females nor males exhibit a preference related to MHC-I diversity or dissimilarity of potential partners, suggesting that MHC-I is not detected through olfaction. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms responsible for mate discrimination based on MHC-I in birds."
https://openalex.org/W4312060026,"Patients with advanced fibrosis are at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) even after hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination. We previously reported that serum fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hp) levels increase as the disease progresses from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and then HCC. However, it remains unclear whether serum Fuc-Hp levels can stratify the risk of HCC occurrence after a sustained virological response (SVR) is achieved with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in patients with advanced liver fibrosis.Among 3,550 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with DAAs at Osaka University Hospital and related hospitals, the stored sera of 140 patients who were diagnosed with F3 or F4 by liver biopsy before DAA treatment, achieved SVR, and had no history of HCC were available at both baseline and the end of treatment (EOT). We measured the Fuc-Hp levels in these samples.The median serum levels of Fuc-Hp at EOT were significantly lower than those at baseline. During the 54.4-month follow-up period, 16 of 140 patients developed HCC. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high Fuc-Hp at EOT, high body mass index (BMI), and low albumin at EOT were independent risk factors for HCC occurrence. Patients with all three factors-high Fuc-Hp, high BMI, and low albumin-had a higher incidence of HCC than patients without these factors.High serum Fuc-Hp levels at EOT were an independent risk factor for HCC occurrence after SVR. Combined with BMI and albumin, Fuc-Hp can stratify the risk of HCC occurrence among those with advanced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4312060028,"The Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS) for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) was designed as a psychometrically robust clinical outcome assessment to assess physical abilities of patients with type 2 and 3 SMA. The reliability properties of the RHS have not yet been reported. A prospective RHS reliability study was undertaken in a UK cohort of experienced neuromuscular paediatric Physiotherapists. Reliability testing was conducted via a virtual survey platform two weeks apart. Through the virtual platform participants scored videos of two RHS assessments, one of a child with SMA 2 and one of a child with SMA 3. Inter and intra-rater reliability was analysed using a type 3 Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Intra-rater agreement was further analysed using Bland Altman (BA) Limits of Agreement (LOA) and plots. The acceptable inter and intra-rater variability was set as a change of ± 2 by the international team of expert physiotherapists who developed the RHS. Inter-rater agreement, n = 22 raters, type 3 ICC was 0.989 (95% CI 0.944 to 1.00), 97.7% of scores were within the acceptable limits of ± 2 points. Intra-rater agreement, n = 21 raters, type 3 ICC ranged from 0.922 to 1.0, with 97.6% of scores within the acceptable limits of ± 2 points. The mean SMA 2 intra-rater difference was -0.10 (-0.6 to 0.4), with lower LOA -2.24 and upper LOA +2.04. Intra-rater difference between tests for SMA 3 intra-rater difference was -0.05 (-0.6 to 0.5), with lower LOA -2.48 and upper LOA +2.38. Intra-rater scoring precision fell within BA agreement limits of ±2 points. The results demonstrate that the RHS is highly reliable when used by experienced UK physiotherapists, and variability of test scores regarding inter and intra-rater reliability was confirmed to lie within ±2 points."
https://openalex.org/W4312060063,"Previous studies have demonstrated that music has a positive effect on individuals during exercise and sports. We speculate that one of the mechanisms for this positive effect may be that music reduces the consumption of self-regulation strength. The primary objective of this study was to use a self-regulation strength model to explain the impact of music on individuals during aerobic exercises. Specifically, we examined the effects of synchronous music on college students' depletion of self-regulation during aerobic exercises. The participants underwent a pre-test in which they had to maintain 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) isometric grip and do exercise planning tasks. For subsequent power bicycle riding (aerobic exercise), the participants were divided into a music group and a control group. The music group performed aerobic exercises with synchronous music, while the control group performed aerobic exercises without music. After aerobic exercise, the participants underwent a post-test for isometric grip and exercise planning tasks. The results showed that the music group planned to reduce their efforts less for an upcoming exercise period (p < 0.01, d = 0.81), and their wrist flexor muscle group generated less electromyographic activation during an isometric grip task that maintained 50% MVC (p < 0.05, d = 0.80) than the control group. However, the two groups showed no difference in the duration of 50% MVC. This shows that: (a) for the same duration, participants in the music group required a lower degree of muscle activation than the control group, suggesting that music reduced the consumption of self-regulation strength in aerobic exercise; and (b) music decreased participants' planned exertion declined, also suggesting that music reduced the consumption of self-regulation strength in aerobic exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4312060078,"The Open Science (OS) movement is rapidly gaining traction among policy-makers, research funders, scientific journals and individual scientists. Despite these tendencies, the pace of implementing OS throughout the scientific process and across the scientific community remains slow. Thus, a better understanding of the conditions that affect OS engagement, and in particular, of how practitioners learn, use, conduct and share research openly can guide those seeking to implement OS more broadly. We surveyed participants at an OS workshop hosted by the Living Norway Ecological Data Network in 2020 to learn how they perceived OS and its importance in their research, supervision and teaching. Further, we wanted to know what OS practices they had encountered in their education and what they saw as hindering or helping their engagement with OS. The survey contained scaled-response and open-ended questions, allowing for a mixed-methods approach. We obtained survey responses from 60 out of 128 workshop participants (47%). Responses indicated that usage and sharing of open data and code, as well as open access publication, were the most frequent OS practices. Only a minority of respondents reported having encountered OS in their formal education. A majority also viewed OS as less important in their teaching than in their research and supervisory roles. The respondents' suggestions for what would facilitate greater OS engagement in the future included knowledge, guidelines, and resources, but also social and structural support. These are aspects that could be strengthened by promoting explicit implementation of OS practices in higher education and by nurturing a more inclusive and equitable OS culture. We argue that incorporating OS in teaching and learning of science can yield substantial benefits to the research community, student learning, and ultimately, to the wider societal objectives of science and higher education."
https://openalex.org/W4312061258,"Contemporary media is full of images that reflect traditional gender notions and stereotypes, some of which may perpetuate harmful gender representations. In an effort to highlight the occurrence of these adverse portrayals, researchers have proposed machine-learning methods to identify stereotypes in the language patterns found in character dialogues. However, not all of the harmful stereotypes are communicated just through dialogue. As a complementary approach, we present a large-scale machine-learning framework that automatically identifies character's actions from scene descriptions found in movie scripts. For this work, we collected 1.2+ million scene descriptions from 912 movie scripts, with more than 50 thousand actions and 20 thousand movie characters. Our framework allow us to study systematic gender differences in movie portrayals at a scale. We show this through a series of statistical analyses that highlight differences in gender portrayals. Our findings provide further evidence to claims from prior media studies including: (i) male characters display higher agency than female characters; (ii) female actors are more frequently the subject of gaze, and (iii) male characters are less likely to display affection. We hope that these data resources and findings help raise awareness on portrayals of character actions that reflect harmful gender stereotypes, and demonstrate novel possibilities for computational approaches in media analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4312061271,"In the United States (U.S.), pet turtles have been associated with outbreaks of salmonellosis, a serious and sometimes-fatal intestinal illness caused by Salmonella bacteria, with nearly 300,000 people being infected in some years. Children are particularly susceptible because of their propensity to put items, including small turtles, in their mouths. In 1975, a U.S. federal regulation prohibited the sale of turtles &lt;4 inches (101.6 mm) in size, except for the purposes of export, scientific, or educational purposes. This regulation was established to reduce the incidence of salmonellosis, particularly in small children. Previous research has not evaluated the availability of turtles &lt;4 inches in size on websites selling wildlife. We monitored 16 websites in 2021 and quantified listings of small turtles. We determined whether information on Salmonella , the 1975 federal regulation, or related state regulations were provided on the websites and determined legality of sales of small turtles by state regulations. We found that all 16 websites openly advertised and sold turtles &lt;4 inches in size, but only half of these websites provided information about Salmonella and/or the federal regulation. These websites required buyers to confirm that they were not purchasing a turtle as a pet, thereby putting the onus on the consumer to adhere to the regulation. We documented 515 listings of turtles &lt;4 inches in size, including 47 species and one hybrid. Our study has demonstrated that internet sales of small turtles currently represent part of the thriving online pet trade in the U.S. Enforcement of the federal regulation faces jurisdictional challenges in most states. Therefore, we recommend continued public education campaigns by public health agencies in the U.S. to help reduce the risk that pet turtle ownership presents."
https://openalex.org/W4312069050,"Weibel Palade bodies (WPBs) are vesicles found in endothelial cells which carry the multimeric protein von Willebrand factor (VWF). As cellular confluency has been shown to influence the number of WPBs in endothelial cells, we propose to test two methods of attaining endothelial cell confluence to inform on the relevancy of cellular culture methods when analyzing endothelial WPBs. We test these cellular culture methods in two endothelial cell types, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). One method maintains a constant incubation time of 96 hrs. while varying the seeding density. The second method maintains a constant seeding density of 30,000 cells/cm2 while varying incubation time. In comparing these two methods, we evaluate the nuclei count, total WPB count, and WPB/nuclei count for each. Our results show that there is a trend of increasing nuclei count, total WPB count, and WPB/nuclei count as incubation time and seeding density increases. However, there is no difference in WPB/nuclei quantification whether confluency is reached via a constant seeding density or a constant incubation time. In addition, we show that confluency plays a major role in WPB/nuclei generation as we demonstrate higher WPB/nuclei counts in confluent cultures compared to sub-confluent cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4312069079,"Evaluations of integrated care models for home-dwelling frail older adults have shown inconclusive results on health and service outcomes. However, limited research has focused on the implementation of integrated care models. Applying implementation science methods may facilitate uptake of integrated care models, thus generating positive outcomes e.g., reduced hospital admissions. This paper describes the protocol to assess the feasibility of an integrated care model (featuring a four-step comprehensive geriatric assessment: screening, a multi-dimensional assessment, a coordinated individualized care plan and follow-up) designed for a new community-based center for home-dwelling older adults in Switzerland. The study includes the following objectives: 1) to assess implementation by a) monitoring respondents to the outreach strategies and describing the Center's visitors; b) assessing implementation outcomes related to the care model (i.e., adoption, acceptability, feasibility, fidelity) and implementation processes related to collaboration; and 2) assessing implementation costs.For objective 1a, we will use a descriptive design to assess respondents to the outreach strategies and describe the Center's visitors. We will use a parallel convergent mixed methods design for objective 1b. Implementation outcomes data will be collected from meetings with the Center's staff, interviews with older adults and their informal caregivers, and reviewing older adults' health records at the Center. Implementation processes related to collaboration will be assessed through a questionnaire to external collaborators (e.g., GPs) towards the end of the study. For objective 2, implementation costs will be calculated using time-driven activity-based costing methods. Data collection is anticipated to occur over approximately six months.This study of a contextually adapted integrated care model will inform adaptations to the outreach strategies, care model and implementation strategies in one community center, prior to evaluating the care model effectiveness and potentially scaling out the intervention.Feasibility study registration ID with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT05302310; registration ID with BMC: ISRCTN12324618."
https://openalex.org/W4312069091,"Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is a major cereal crop worldwide and is traditionally or commercially cultivated almost all over the Americas. The North-Western Argentina (NWA) region constitutes one of the main diversity hotspots of the Southern Andes, with contrasting landscapes and a large number of landraces. Despite the extensive collections performed by the ""Banco Activo de Germoplasma INTA Pergamino, Argentina"" (BAP), most of them have not been characterized yet. Here we report the morphological and molecular evaluation of 30 accessions collected from NWA, along an altitudinal gradient between 1120 and 2950 meters above sea level (masl). Assessment of morphological variation in a common garden allowed the discrimination of two groups, which differed mainly in endosperm type and overall plant size. Although the groups retrieved by the molecular analyses were not consistent with morphological clusters, they showed a clear pattern of altitudinal structuring. Affinities among accessions were not in accordance with racial assignments. Overall, our results revealed that there are two maize gene pools co-existing in NWA, probably resulting from various waves of maize introduction in pre-Columbian times as well as from the adoption of modern varieties by local farmers. In conclusion, the NWA maize landraces preserved at the BAP possess high morphological and molecular variability. Our results highlight their potential as a source of diversity for increasing the genetic basis of breeding programs and provide useful information to guide future sampling and conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4312069109,"Stable isotopes are currently used to measure glucose fluxes responsible for observed glucose concentrations, providing information on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. The determination of glucose turnover, along with fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, is relevant for inferring insulin sensitivity levels. At equilibrium (e.g. during the fasting state) the rate of glucose entering the circulation equals its rate of disappearance from the circulation. If under these conditions tracer is infused at a constant rate and Specific Activity (SA) or Tracer to Tracee (TTR) ratio is computed, the Rate of Appearance (RA) equals the Rate of Disappearance (RD) and equals the ratio between infusion rate and TTR or SA. In the post-prandial situation or during perturbation studies, however, estimation of RA and RD becomes more complex because they are not necessarily equal and, furthermore, may vary over time due to gastric emptying, glucose absorption, appearance of ingested or infused glucose, variations of EGP and glucose disappearance. Up to now, the most commonly used approach to compute RA, RD and EGP has been the single-pool model by Steele. Several authors, however, report pitfalls in the use of this method, such as “paradoxical” increase in EGP immediately after meal ingestion and “negative” rates of EGP. Different attempts have been made to reduce the impact of these errors, but the same problems are still encountered. In the present work a completely different approach is proposed, where cold and labeled [6, 6-2H2] glucose observations are simultaneously fitted and where both RD and EGP are represented by simple but reasonable functions. As an example, this approach is applied to an intra-venous experiment, where cold glucose is infused at variable rates to reproduce a desired glycaemic time-course. The goal of the present work is to show that appropriate, if simple, modelling of the whole infusion procedure together with the underlying physiological system allows robust estimation of EGP with single-tracer administration, without the artefacts produced by the Steele method."
https://openalex.org/W4312069657,"Humans spontaneously attribute a wide range of traits to conspecifics based on their facial appearance. Unsurprisingly, previous findings indicate that this 'person evaluation' is affected by information provided about the target's past actions and behaviours. Strikingly, many news items shared on social media sites (e.g., Twitter) describe the actions of individuals who are often shown in accompanying images. This kind of material closely resembles that encountered by participants in previous studies of face-trait learning. We therefore sought to determine whether Twitter posts that pair facial images with favourable and unfavourable biographical information also modulate subsequent trait evaluation of the people depicted. We also assessed whether the effects of this information-valence manipulation were attenuated by the presence of the ""disputed tag"", introduced by Twitter as a means to combat the influence of fake-news. Across two preregistered experiments, we found that fictional tweets that paired facial images with details of the person's positive or negative actions affected the extent to which readers subsequently judged the faces depicted to be trustworthy. When the rating phase followed immediately after the study phase, the presence of the disputed tag attenuated the effect of the behavioural information (Experiment 1: N = 128; Mage = 34.06; 89 female, 36 male, 3 non-binary; 116 White British). However, when the rating phase was conducted after a 10-minute delay, the presence of the disputed tag had no significant effect (Experiment 2: N = 128; Mage = 29.12; 78 female, 44 male, 4 non-binary, 2 prefer not to say; 110 White British). Our findings suggest that disputed tags may have relatively little impact on the long-term face-trait learning that occurs via social media. As such, fake news stories may have considerable potential to shape users' person evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4312080000,"Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to unpredictable patterns of maternal sensory signals during infancy is associated with child neurodevelopment, including poorer effortful control. However, longitudinal effects on child development and possible sex differences are understudied. The aims of the present study were to explore whether exposure to unpredictable maternal sensory signals during infancy is related to child effortful control at 5 years of age and whether child sex moderates these associations. In addition, we examined how exposure to very high vs. low/moderate unpredictability using categorical cut-offs is related to child effortful control. Participants (133 mother–child pairs, all Caucasian) were drawn from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland. Maternal sensory signals (auditory, visual, tactile) were coded from the 10-min free-play episode on a moment-on-moment basis using Observer XT 11 (Noldus), and the unpredictability of maternal sensory signals was characterized as the entropy rate when the infant was 8 months of age. Child effortful control was assessed via mother reports using the Child Behavior Questionnaire very short form (CBQ-VSF) when the child was 5 years old. Correlational analyses showed that higher unpredictability of maternal sensory signals had a modest association with children’s poorer effortful control at 5 years of age. Notably, the linear regression model showed that child sex moderated these associations, as higher exposure to unpredictable maternal sensory signals was related to poorer effortful control among males, but not among females. Moreover, the general linear model showed that exposure to very high unpredictability was associated with poorer child effortful control at 5 years of age and remained significant when adjusted for possible confounding factors. These results are in line with previous findings and suggest that the unpredictability of maternal sensory signals is potentially an important aspect of early caregiving behavior associated with the development of child effortful control."
https://openalex.org/W4312114988,"The purpose of this study was to establish whether preferred music-listening level differed between musicians and non-musicians, and whether preferred music-listening level was related to music genre preference and lifetime noise exposure. Seventeen musicians (mean age = 29.06 years, SD = 4.74; female n = 9) and 17 non-musicians (mean age = 28.94 years, SD = 4.63; female n = 9) with clinically normal hearing were recruited to listen to six music samples from different genres and one sample of environmental sounds. Participants adjusted the listening level [dB(A)] until the music was loud and enjoyable. This was repeated three times and an average was taken. Lifetime noise exposure was estimated using the Noise Exposure Structured Interview. Preferred music-listening levels of musicians were significantly higher than non-musicians. The preferred music-listening level differed with genre preference, with the participants' favorite tracks being played at 11 dB higher level than the least favorite tracks. There was also a positive correlation between lifetime noise exposure and preferred music-listening level. Musicians prefer to listen to music at higher level than non-musicians and thus may be more susceptible to noise induced hearing loss than non-musicians. As such, musicians in particular would benefit from simple changes in lifestyle and listening habits, including increased awareness of the risks of higher listening levels, as well as the use of hearing protection."
https://openalex.org/W4312115079,"Automated mobile phone surveys (MPS) can be used to collect public health data of various types to inform health policy and programs globally. One challenge in administering MPS is identification of an appropriate and effective participant consent process. This study investigated the impact of different survey consent approaches on participant disposition (response characteristics and understanding of the purpose of the survey) within the context of an MPS that measured noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors across Colombia and Uganda.Participants were randomized to one of five consent approaches, with consent modules varying by the consent disclosure and mode of authorization. The control arm consisted of a standard consent disclosure and a combined opt-in/opt-out mode of authorization. The other four arms consist of a modified consent disclosure and one of four different forms of authorization (i.e., opt-in, opt-out, combined opt-in/opt-out, or implied). Data related to respondent disposition and respondent understanding of the survey purpose were analyzed.Among 1889 completed surveys in Colombia, differences in contact, response, refusal, and cooperation rates by study arms were found. About 68% of respondents correctly identified the survey purpose, with no significant difference by study arm. Participants reporting higher levels of education and urban residency were more likely to identify the purpose correctly. Participants were also more likely to accurately identify the survey purpose after completing several survey modules, compared to immediately following the consent disclosure (78.8% vs 54.2% correct, p<0.001). In Uganda, 1890 completed surveys were collected. Though there were differences in contact, refusal, and cooperation rates by study arm, response rates were similar across arms. About 37% of respondents identified the survey purpose correctly, with no difference by arm. Those with higher levels of education and who completed the survey in English were able to more accurately identify the survey purpose. Again, participants were more likely to accurately identify the purpose of the survey after completing several NCD modules, compared to immediately following the consent module (42.0% vs 32.2% correct, p = 0.013).This study contributes to the limited available evidence regarding consent procedures for automated MPS. Future studies should develop and trial additional interventions to enhance consent for automated public health surveys, and measure other dimensions of participant engagement and understanding."
