Little or no change was found in free-radical content for the three coals of lowest carbon content, whereas the two coals of highest carbon content were found to have a considerable increase in free-radical content. The infrared spectra and the apparent hardness of the irradiated coals of higher carbon content indicate that polymerization occurred. Radiation of these coals in chemical reagents may promote reactivity."

In the latter part of this period they were observed to shed a sheet of skin by a peculiar process and to devour it. This shed skin contained bacteria of the spirilla type, diatoms, and large amounts of unicellular algae, and possibly other organisms. Similar behavior in unstarved specimens of Cryptobranchus confined in an aquarium at the University of Alabama has been observed by E. L. Bishop."

https://openalex.org/W4231333994,"Those charged with safeguarding the United States have sought to minimize the danger of internal subversion through the screening of government employees and persons having access to classified information. This program is necessary, but it poses a serious dilemma: the more completely we succeed in reducing the danger that information now in our possession may leak to a potential enemy, the more risk we run of interfering with scientific progress and of reducing the technologic superiority and the moral and physical strength upon which victory in the ultimate test would depend. The inherent dangers of this dilemma can be lessoned and our strength enhanced by changing our basic concept of internal security from one that attempts almost exclusively to minimize our losses to one that places greatly increased emphasis on maximizinig our gains."
