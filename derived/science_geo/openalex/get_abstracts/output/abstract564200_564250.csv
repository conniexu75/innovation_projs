Within the mesenchymal lineage, factors such as RUNX2 and PPARγ are indispensable for osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We therefore investigated genomic binding of transcription factors and accompanying epigenetic modifications that occur during osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). As assessed by ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing analyses, we found that genes vital for osteogenic identity were linked to RUNX2, C/EBPβ, retinoid X receptor, and vitamin D receptor binding sites, whereas adipocyte differentiation favored PPARγ, retinoid X receptor, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ binding sites. Epigenetic marks were clear predictors of active differentiation loci as well as enhancer activities and selective gene expression. These marrow-derived MSCs displayed an epigenetic pattern that suggested a default preference for the osteogenic pathway; however, these patterns were rapidly altered near the Adipoq, Cidec, Fabp4, Lipe, Plin1, Pparg, and Cebpa genes during adipogenic differentiation. Surprisingly, we found that these cells also exhibited an epigenetic plasticity that enabled them to trans-differentiate from adipocytes to osteoblasts (and vice versa) after commitment, as assessed by staining, gene expression, and ChIP-quantitative PCR analysis. The osteogenic default pathway may be subverted during pathological conditions, leading to skeletal fragility and increased marrow adiposity during aging, estrogen deficiency, and skeletal unloading. Taken together, our data provide an increased mechanistic understanding of the epigenetic programs necessary for multipotent differentiation of MSCs that may prove beneficial in the development of therapeutic strategies.

Multilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cells.Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17937) Google Scholar). A common source of MSCs is derived from bone marrow. In addition to bone marrow, however, MSCs can also be isolated from adipogenic tissue sources (aMSC or ASC), umbilical cord tissue, pancreas, and most other vascularized tissues (1Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R.

Regardless of the source, these cells retain their ability to differentiate into a number of common lineages when appropriately stimulated, displaying cell markers such as CD29, CD44, CD70, CD73, CD90, CD105, and Stro-1, while lacking markers for early hematopoietic lineages (CD34 and others) (2Lin C.S.

Although the markers for identification of a “true” MSC remain somewhat controversial, multipotential differentiation morphology remains the hallmark of the MSC. These phenotypes are driven by distinct and essential sets of cell signaling pathways and their respective target transcription factors. Adipogenic differentiation relies on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), and agonists of the PPARγ pathway promote the formation of adipocytes at the expense of osteoblasts (4Tontonoz P.

Osteogenic differentiation, on the other hand, cannot proceed without expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) (6Komori T. Regulation of osteoblast differentiation by Runx2.Adv. Exp.

Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways favor the osteogenic versus the adipogenic lineage (8Visweswaran M. Pohl S. Arfuso F. Newsholme P. Dilley R. Pervaiz S. Dharmarajan A.

Likewise, bone morphogenic proteins and TGFβ direct MSCs toward both osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypes (10Hanada K. Dennis J.E. Caplan A.I. Stimulatory effects of basic fibroblast growth factor and bone morphogenetic protein-2 on osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.J. Bone Miner.

Sonomoto K. Lin L. Nakano K. Tanaka Y.

In addition to chemical signals, MSCs are able to respond to cues from physical interactions with intranuclear actin to up-regulate RUNX2 as well as to repress adipogenesis through down-regulation of C/EBPβ and PPARγ in response to mechanical loading that favors bone (12Sen B.

One of the major transcription factors active in preosteogenesis is the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-activated secondary activator of MSCs. VDR is able to regulate the expression of genes that are vital to osteoblastic identity in early osteoblastic cells as well as in MSCs through coordination with the actions of RUNX2 and C/EBPβ (15Meyer M.B.

The VDR has a pervasive genomic footprint in preosteoblastic cells that is reduced as these cells undergo further osteoblastic differentiation, but VDR is still an active regulator of transcription in both differentiation states (15Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Lee C.H. Pike J.W. Genomic determinants of gene regulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 during osteoblast-lineage cell differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 19539-19554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Likewise, recent efforts have been made to establish a role for the VDR in the adipocyte, where, as in the osteoblast, VDR has a somewhat conflicted role throughout differentiation. Global VDR knock-out in mice results in adipocyte atrophy, and mice with the VDR ablated specifically in adipose tissue show increased mammary epithelial density (17Matthews D.G. D'Angelo J. Drelich J. Welsh J. Adipose-specific Vdr deletion alters body fat and enhances mammary epithelial density.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, has been shown to prevent adipocyte differentiation in vitro and simultaneously up-regulate cytokine and leptin activity in fat tissue (19Sato M. Hiragun A. Demonstration of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor-like molecule in ST 13 and 3T3 L1 preadipocytes and its inhibitory effects on preadipocyte differentiation.J. Cell.

Despite the specifics of these activities, VDR is present in cells of all mesenchymally derived lineages and remains an important transcription factor in vivo for both osteoblasts and adipocytes. The regulatory activities of these transcription factors are accompanied (or preceded) by epigenetic modifications to either DNA or to histone protein tails to allow additional transcription factor access to genes vital for lineage determination. The epigenetic marks in osteoblastic cells (15Meyer M.B. Benkusky N.A. Lee C.H. Pike J.W.

Mandrup S. Genome-wide profiling of transcription factor binding and epigenetic marks in adipocytes by ChIP-seq.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 537: 261-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have revealed distinct patterns for gene expression in terminally differentiated cell types. Previous research has determined that the histone-modifying enzymes responsible for many of these patterns, including KDM5B, EZH2, and others, play a clear role in skeletal development and differentiation of the MSC through modulation of RUNX2 (23Dudakovic A.

A recent study found distinct open regions of DNase I-hypersensitive DNA in a human temperature-dependent model of osteoblast differentiation that favored genes known for the osteoblastic phenotype (25Thompson B. Varticovski L. Baek S. Hager G.L. Genome-wide chromatin landscape transitions identify novel pathways in early commitment to osteoblast differentiation.PLoS One. 2016; 11: e0148619Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Chromatin marks are dynamic in nature and can shift location based upon the stimulus received (26Calo E. Wysocka J. Modification of enhancer chromatin: what, how, and why?.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In fact, the plasticity of histone and chromatin modifications is believed to allow for memory context in the brain (27Bieszczad K.M. Bechay K. Rusche J.R. Jacques V. Kudugunti S. Miao W.

Res. 2014; 115: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Trans-differentiation of mesenchymal cells can be used to create neural stem cells (31Ortiz-Gonzalez X.R. Keene C.D.

Their accessibility and availability have made MSCs (stromal or adipose-derived) an attractive cell type for studies in personalized regenerative medicine. Given the diverse differentiation potential of marrow-derived MSCs as well as their dynamic nature, we sought to investigate the transcription factor cascades as well as histone modification patterns that characterize these differentiating cells. We differentiated MSCs in culture for 7 or 15 days using osteogenic medium and 7 days using adipogenic medium. At these time points, we performed RNA-seq analysis to establish changes in the transcriptome and ChIP-seq analysis to investigate the cistromes for a number of transcription factors (RUNX2, C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, PPARγ, VDR, and RXR) as well as several epigenetic marks (H3K9ac, H4K5ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3) that are associated with these transitions. We found that chromatin state profiles for the undifferentiated MSC closely resembled those of osteogenic cells differentiated for 7 or 15 days, indicating a potentially predetermined epigenetic pathway for these cells. These chromatin state profiles were dramatically altered, however, following adipogenic differentiation for 7 days, especially near genes vital for adipogenic function. These profiles accurately predicted the transition and gene output activity at the locus in which they resided. Finally, we found that despite numerous genomic, chromatin, and gene expression changes, MSCs were able to trans-differentiate from an adipogenic to an osteogenic lineage and vice versa. These two cell types displayed the appropriate cell morphology, transcriptomic, and genomic changes of the emerging trans-differentiated phenotype and demonstrated a plasticity in the histone modifications that allowed these transitions to occur in vitro. These observations provide a potential mechanism during pathological conditions that lead to skeletal fragility and increased marrow adiposity as in aging, estrogen deficiency, and in skeletal unloading. These expression patterns and profiles will be beneficial in understanding the mechanisms that underlie the cellular and genomic transitions that occur during differentiation and may lead to insights that will be required for the successful development of therapies or drug discovery models in the future. Marrow-derived MSCs present an interesting model of differentiation because they are capable of transitioning into a wide variety of cell types, most notably osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. In the marrow space, stromal cells differentiate into these cell types to maintain bone integrity and health. We chose to investigate the genetic (transcription factors) and epigenetic (histone modifications) pathways involved in the differentiation of the MSCs to osteoblasts and adipocytes. As outlined in Fig. 1 and detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” marrow-derived cells were isolated from C57bl/6 mice, and selected MSCs were cultured and validated as described previously (34Case N. Xie Z. Sen B. Styner M. Zou M. O'Conor C. Horowitz M. Rubin J. Mechanical activation of β-catenin regulates phenotype in adult murine marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.J. Orthop. Res. 2010; 28: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Peister A. Mellad J.A. Larson B.L. Hall B.M. Gibson L.F. Prockop D.J. Adult stem cells from bone marrow (MSCs) isolated from different strains of inbred mice vary in surface epitopes, rates of proliferation, and differentiation potential.Blood. 2004; 103: 1662-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). MSCs were then expanded for differentiation, staining, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq analyses. They were then induced for 7 days in adipogenic medium (MSC-F7) or for 7 (MSC-B7) and 15 (MSC-B15) days with osteogenic medium. At these time points, the cells were collected for staining, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq analysis. Oil Red O (ORO) staining was performed to examine lipid accumulation in adipocytes, and alizarin red (AR) staining was used to detect calcium deposition in mineralizing osteoblasts. The differentiation states displayed the appropriate cell morphology and staining as in Fig. 1. Having established the anticipated morphology, we then confirmed appropriate transcriptomic changes as well. As can be seen in Fig. 2, differentiated MSCs were easily distinguished as either osteoblasts (MSC-B7) or adipocytes (MSC-F7) from their gene expression profiles. These patterns identified in MSC, MSC-B7, MSC-B15, and MSC-F7 cells are displayed as heat maps from a hierarchical clustering analysis (using Euclidean distance) of the top 200 up-regulated (top) and down-regulated (bottom) genes contrasting MSC-B7 versus MSC (Fig. 2A) and MSC-F7 versus MSC (Fig. 2B). A large contingent of the genes up-regulated in MSC-B7 cells was also up-regulated in MSC-B15 cells, as can be observed by the gene clusters. This relationship is better visualized through the Venn diagrams documented in Fig. 2C. Here, genes that were up-regulated >2-fold within a 95% confidence interval (moderated t test) versus MSCs are shown on the left. A total of 373 genes were up-regulated in MSC-B7 cells (versus MSCs), 658 genes were up-regulated in MSC-B15 (versus MSC), and 1,312 genes were up-regulated in MSC-F7 cells (versus MSCs). Similarly, an analysis of the down-regulated genes revealed that there were many more genes suppressed in each condition: MSC-B7 with 9,152, MSC-B15 with 8,005, and MSC-F7 with 12,711 genes. As expected, both the up- and down-regulated genes of MSC-B7 and MSC-B15 cells displayed more closely related gene expression patterns than those with MSC-F7 cells; however, many genes were unique to both the MSC-B7 and MSC-B15 differentiation states. We then examined these gene networks through the GeneMANIA (Gene Multiple Association Network Integration Algorithm) pathway and literature analysis tool (36Warde-Farley D. Donaldson S.L. Comes O. Zuberi K. Badrawi R. Chao P. Franz M. Grouios C. Kazi F. Lopes C.T. Maitland A. Mostafavi S. Montojo J. Shao Q. Wright G. Bader G.D. Morris Q. The GeneMANIA prediction server: biological network integration for gene prioritization and predicting gene function.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W214-W220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, the top osteogenic genes shared in common with both the MSC-B7 and MSC-B15 cells are displayed. The genes within the black circles are those explored in GeneMANIA. These were computed to exhibit connections between each other as well as with genes predicted to be within a gene regulatory network (gray circles). We found that these highly regulated genes were tightly correlated with not only the algorithm prediction (orange lines) but also genes known to be co-expressed (purple) and/or co-localized (blue). Furthermore, this gene network can be interrogated by gene ontology (GO) analysis through the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) functional analysis tool (37da Huang W. Sherman B.T. Stephens R. Baseler M.W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. DAVID gene ID conversion tool.Bioinformation. 2008; 2: 428-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. DAVID: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene network associated with osteogenic differentiation was highly enriched for GO terms related to skeletal formation, ossification, and extracellular structure organization (Fig. 2E). In fact, osteocytic genes shared with MSC-B7 and MSC-B15 cells were further increased in the MSC-B15 cells, suggesting that by day 15, the MSCs were either progressing toward or had become osteocytes, as recently suggested (39Thompson W.R. Uzer G. Brobst K.E. Xie Z. Sen B. Yen S.S. Styner M. Rubin J. Osteocyte specific responses to soluble and mechanical stimuli in a stem cell-derived culture model.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 11049Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gremlin-1 (Grem1) expression was identified following osteoblast differentiation; Grem1-positive MSCs are hypothesized to be unable to differentiate into adipocytes (40Worthley D.L. Churchill M. Compton J.T. Tailor Y. Rao M. Si Y. Levin D. Schwartz M.G. Uygur A. Hayakawa Y. Gross S. Renz B.W. Setlik W. Martinez A.N. Chen X. et al.Gremlin 1 identifies a skeletal stem cell with bone, cartilage, and reticular stromal potential.Cell. 2015; 160: 269-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Similarly, genes up-regulated in MSC-F7 cells versus MSCs were also interrogated using the GeneMANIA pathway analysis (Fig. 2F) as well as DAVID functional analysis tools (Fig. 2G). The interactions within the adipogenic network of genes were tighter than those within MSC-B7 and MSC-B15 cells. These genes were highly enriched in GO categories involved in adipogenesis. Thus, the MSC-F7 transition was the more extreme differentiation process, although we suspect that associated transcriptomic changes in MSCs of fat origin could well be different. Taken together, the transcriptome analyses indicate that MSCs express the necessary gene profiles for osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes and that larger transcriptomic changes are observed during marrow-derived MSC differentiation into adipocytes than into bone cells. Transcriptomic changes (gene expression) are a direct consequence of genomic regulation. Transcription factors that respond to cellular stimuli are able to bind to the genome and activate the transcription of lineage- or stimuli-dependent genes. Here, we sought to investigate lineage-dependent transcription factors and to define a role for a secondary effector in hormone-dependent VDR activities.

However, no study has directly compared how different training volumes influence mitochondrial respiration and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. Ten healthy men performed high-intensity interval cycling during 3 consecutive training phases; 4 wk of normal-volume training (NVT; 3/wk), followed by 20 d of high-volume training (HVT; 2/d) and 2 wk of reduced-volume training (RVT; 5 sessions). Resting biopsy samples (vastus lateralis) were obtained at baseline and after each phase. No mitochondrial parameter changed after NVT. After HVT, mitochondrial respiration and citrate synthase activity (~40–50%), as well as the protein content of electron transport system (ETS) subunits (~10–40%), and that of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1a (PGC-1a), NRF1, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), PHF20, and p53 (~65–170%) all increased compared to baseline; mitochondrial specific respiration remained unchanged. After RVT, all the mitochondrial parameters measured except citrate synthase activity (~36% above initial) were not significantly different compared to baseline (all P >0.05). Our findings demonstrate that training volume is an important determinant of training-induced mitochondrial adaptations and highlight the rapid reversibility of human skeletal muscle to a reduction in training volume.—Granata, C., Oliveira, R.

https://openalex.org/W2472380918,"O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic post-translational modification consisting of the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine sugar to serine and threonine residues in proteins by the enzyme O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), whereas the enzyme O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes the modification. In cancer, tumor samples present with altered O-GlcNAcylation; however, changes in O-GlcNAcylation are not consistent between tumor types. Interestingly, the tumor suppressor p53 is modified by O-GlcNAc, and most solid tumors contain mutations in p53 leading to the loss of p53 function. Because ovarian cancer has a high frequency of p53 mutation rates, we decided to investigate the relationship between O-GlcNAcylation and p53 function in ovarian cancer. We measured a significant decrease in O-GlcNAcylation of tumor tissue in an ovarian tumor microarray. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation was increased, and OGA protein and mRNA levels were decreased in ovarian tumor cell lines not expressing the protein p53. Treatment with the OGA inhibitor Thiamet-G (TMG), silencing of OGA, or overexpression of OGA and OGT led to p53 stabilization, increased nuclear localization, and increased protein and mRNA levels of p53 target genes. These data suggest that changes in O-GlcNAc homeostasis activate the p53 pathway. Combination treatment of the chemotherapeutic cisplatin with TMG decreased tumor cell growth and enhanced cell cycle arrest without impairing cytotoxicity. The effects of TMG on tumor cell growth were partially dependent on wild type p53 activation. In conclusion, changes in O-GlcNAc homeostasis activate the wild type p53 pathway in ovarian cancer cells, and OGA inhibition has the potential as an adjuvant treatment for ovarian carcinoma."

Specifically, Wnt-5a acts as a secreted growth factor that regulates dendritic spine formation in rodent hippocampal neurons, resulting in postsynaptic development that promotes the clustering of the PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95). Here, we focused on the early events occurring after the interaction between Wnt-5a and its Frizzled receptor at the neuronal cell surface. Additionally, we studied the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in Wnt-5a-dependent synaptic development. We report that FZD9 (Frizzled9), a Wnt receptor related to Williams syndrome, is localized in the postsynaptic region, where it interacts with Wnt-5a. Functionally, FZD9 is required for the Wnt-5a-mediated increase in dendritic spine density. FZD9 forms a precoupled complex with Gαo under basal conditions that dissociates after Wnt-5a stimulation.

FZD proteins have been identified as Wnt receptors, and they can mediate the signaling triggered by several Wnt ligands. Wnt-5a activity has been linked to several FZDs receptors and other co-receptors in different model systems (15Sato A. Yamamoto H. Sakane H. Koyama H. Kikuchi A.

Several signaling cascades can be triggered upon Wnt binding to a FZD receptor, including canonical (i.e. β-catenin-dependent) and non-canonical pathways (19Gordon M.D. Nusse R. Wnt signaling: multiple pathways, multiple receptors, and multiple transcription factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22429-22433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Consistent with their GPCR identity, recent studies have revealed that FZD receptors can induce Wnt signaling-dependent activation of G proteins (20Kilander M.B. Halleskog C. Schulte G.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of a guanine nucleotide-binding α-subunit (Gα) and a βγ complex (Gβγ). In the resting state, Gα is bound to GDP and associated with Gβγ and a GPCR. This complex is dissociated when Gα binds to GTP, activating Gα and the Gβγ complex, which allows them to regulate their downstream effectors (22Milligan G. Kostenis E. Heterotrimeric G-proteins: a short history.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S46-S55Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The Gα subunits are separated into four families based on sequence homology (Gαi/o, Gαs, Gαq, and Gα12/13) (23Neer E.J. Heterotrimeric G proteins: organizers of transmembrane signals.Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), each activating different pathways. It has been shown that FZDs act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G proteins in vivo (Gαi/o), mediating both canonical and non-canonical signaling in Drosophila (24Katanaev V.L. Ponzielli R. Sémériva M. Tomlinson A. Trimeric G protein-dependent frizzled signaling in Drosophila.Cell. 2005; 120: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, the G proteins, particularly the PTX-sensitive Gα subunits, have been shown to be functional in several Wnt-dependent processes (25Dejmek J. Säfholm A. Kamp Nielsen C.

Neuroinflammation. 2012; 9: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the role of the G proteins in Wnt-5a signaling in hippocampal neurons has not been clarified. Here, we used hippocampal cultures, confocal fluorescent microscopy, and a combination of pharmacological and molecular approaches to characterize the cascade downstream of Wnt-5a that is relevant for dendritic spine development. Based on previous findings showing that FZD9 plays a key role in the formation of neuronal connectivity (28Li Y. Tian C. Yang Y. Yan Y. Ni Y. Wei Y. Pleasure S.J. Zhao C.

Avilés C. Abel R.A. Almli C.R. McQuillen P. Pleasure S.J. Hippocampal and visuospatial learning defects in mice with a deletion of frizzled 9, a gene in the Williams syndrome deletion interval.Development. 2005; 132: 2917-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we focused on the possible function of this receptor. We report that the activation of the non-canonical cascade by Wnt-5a required the FZD9 receptor. Also, we found that this receptor is located in the postsynaptic region, suggesting a role in Wnt-5a-induced postsynaptic remodeling. Additionally, the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations produced by Wnt-5a was dependent on FZD9. On the other hand, we found that FZD9 interacts with heterotrimeric G proteins, particularly the Gαo, and that this process is crucial for the formation of dendritic spines, postsynaptic remodeling, and activation of the signaling cascade. Our results increase the comprehension of the Wnt signaling cascade in hippocampal neurons and confirm the key role of heterotrimeric G proteins in the Wnt-5a pathway. To determine whether FZD9 mediates the Wnt-5a spinogenic effects in hippocampal neurons, we first studied the subcellular localization of this receptor. It has been reported that FZD9 expression increases during embryonic hippocampal development (31Varela-Nallar L. Ramirez V.T. Gonzalez-Billault C. Inestrosa N.C. Frizzled receptors in neurons: from growth cones to the synapse.Cytoskeleton. 2012; 69: 528-534Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), similar to Wnt-5a (13Varela-Nallar L. Alfaro I.E. Serrano F.G. Parodi J. Inestrosa N.C. Wingless-type family member 5A (Wnt-5a) stimulates synaptic differentiation and function of glutamatergic synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21164-21169Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, because Wnt-5a regulates synaptic development, we first analyzed the synaptic distribution of FZD9 in cultured hippocampal neurons at day in vitro (DIV) 14. Our immunolocalization studies showed that FZD9 was distributed in a punctate pattern in the neuronal processes, as previously reported (31Varela-Nallar L. Ramirez V.T. Gonzalez-Billault C. Inestrosa N.C. Frizzled receptors in neurons: from growth cones to the synapse.Cytoskeleton. 2012; 69: 528-534Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and co-localized with the postsynaptic density scaffolding protein PSD-95 (Fig. 1A). This observation was supported by the Manders overlap coefficient, which represents the number of co-localized pixels expressed as a fraction of the total number of pixels in each channel. The co-localization index between PSD-95 and FZD9 was significantly higher than the co-localization between FZD9 and Piccolo, a presynaptic marker (Fig. 1B). Additionally, PSD-95 displays a higher co-localization index with FZD9 than those with FZD2, FZD3, or FZD7 and PSD-95, suggesting that this co-distribution was specific for FZD9 (Fig. 1C). The postsynaptic distribution of FZD9 was also analyzed biochemically in adult rat brains. Synaptosomal preparations were separated in the synaptophysin (SYP)-enriched (Triton X-100-soluble) fraction and the PSD-95-enriched (Triton X-100-insoluble) fraction (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the distribution observed in the cultured neurons, Western blotting showed that FZD9 was highly enriched in the PSD-95-containing fraction, whereas it was almost undetectable in the SYP-enriched fraction. Together, these data strongly suggest that FZD9 is located in the postsynaptic region of hippocampal neurons. In different biological contexts, FZD9 has been shown to be a functional receptor for the ligands Wnt-2, Wnt-7a, and Wnt-8 (32Karasawa T. Yokokura H. Kitajewski J. Lombroso P.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 26943-26950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To assess whether FZD9 might also mediates the Wnt-5a cascade, we first performed a ligand-receptor binding assay between recombinant Wnt-5a and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FZD9, which is a Wnt-binding domain (35Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Insights into Wnt binding and signalling from the structures of two Frizzled cysteine-rich domains.Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). CRD-FZD9 (Leu24–Asp186) is fused to IgG. We also used the CRDs fused to IgG from FZD1, FZD2, and FZD5 to compare the interaction between Wnt-5a and these receptors. Immunoprecipitation of the CRDs-IgG chimera with A/G-agarose beads and Western blotting analysis revealed that Wnt-5a immunoprecipitated with the CRD-FZD9 as other CRD-FZDs (Fig. 2A). The level of immunoprecipitation of Wnt-5a was almost the same with all the CRD-FZD used, suggesting that FZD9 has a similar potential to interact biochemically with Wnt-5a. These ligand-receptor interactions are weak, because they do not interact covalently (Fig. 2A, right panel). Our biochemical assays indicates that FZD9 might be a functional receptor for Wnt-5a. Because Wnt-5a triggers an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in hippocampal neurons (13Varela-Nallar L. Alfaro I.E. Serrano F.G. Parodi J. Inestrosa N.C. Wingless-type family member 5A (Wnt-5a) stimulates synaptic differentiation and function of glutamatergic synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21164-21169Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we attempted to understand the potential role of FZD9 in this effect by measuring the intracellular Ca2+ changes using the molecular probe Fura-2 AM. As expected, Wnt-5a treatment induced a rapid increase in the intensity of the Fura-2 AM signal (340/380 ratio), indicating a positive signaling modulation in intracellular Ca2+. Treatment with CRD-FZD9 blocked the Wnt-5a-mediated increase in the Ca2+ concentrations, whereas CRD-FZD9 has no effect (Fig. 2B). The area under the curve (A.U.C.) decreased from 41.20 ± 2.64 in the Wnt-5a-treated neurons to 6.81 ± 0.72 in Wnt-5a+CRD-FZD9 cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). Previous observations have shown that Wnt-5a stimulates spinogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons (13Varela-Nallar L. Alfaro I.E. Serrano F.G. Parodi J. Inestrosa N.C. Wingless-type family member 5A (Wnt-5a) stimulates synaptic differentiation and function of glutamatergic synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21164-21169Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next evaluated the potential role of CRD-FZD9 to block this process. To analyze dendritic spines, hippocampal neurons were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at DIV 10 to reveal in detail neuronal morphology. At DIV 14 neurons were fixed and immunostained with anti-PSD-95 to label postsynaptic structures. We observed that almost all the EGFP protrusions were also labeled with anti-PSD-95, indicating that these protrusions effectively correspond to dendritic spine (Fig. 3A). Also, we performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of the dendrite to further analyze the dendritic spine density and the spine width head using Imaris software (Fig. 3A). In agreement with previous reports (13Varela-Nallar L. Alfaro I.E. Serrano F.G. Parodi J. Inestrosa N.C. Wingless-type family member 5A (Wnt-5a) stimulates synaptic differentiation and function of glutamatergic synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21164-21169Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we observed that Wnt-5a increased the dendritic spine density (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the exogenous addition of CRD-FZD9 inhibited the Wnt-5a-mediated increase in the density of dendritic protrusions after 2 h of Wnt-5a treatment. To evaluate the potential role of the endogenous FZD9, we selectively decreased FZD9 expression using a short hairpin construct directed against FZD9 (shFZD9-EGFP) or its control vector (Fux-EGFP). Both constructs contained the EGFP gene to label the transfected cells and have been used previously (36Avilés E.C. Pinto C. Hanna P. Ojeda J. Pérez V. De Ferrari G.V. Zamorano P. Albistur M. Sandoval D. Henríquez J.P. Frizzled-9 impairs acetylcholine receptor clustering in skeletal muscle cells.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 110PubMed Google Scholar). FZD9 knockdown was evaluated by Western blotting in the HT22 cell line, in which a marked decrease of FZD9 expression was observed in shFZD9-EGFP-transfected cells compared with control, but it failed to decrease the FZD5 and the FZD7 expression (Fig. 4A). Additionally, we observed in hippocampal neurons the efficiency of the FZD9 knockdown, where the number of FZD9 clusters was reduced in shFZD9-EGFP-transfected neurons (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Thereafter, we analyzed the effect of shFZD9-EGFP or control Fux-EGFP on Wnt-5a-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase in 10 DIV hippocampal neurons. In Fux-EGFP-transfected neurons, the Fura-2 AM signal increased after Wnt-5a treatment; notably, this effect was not observed in neurons transfected with shFZD9-EGFP (Fig. 4, C and D), as evidenced by the quantitative analysis. A significant reduction in A.U.C. from 1.53 ± 1.06 in the Fux-EGFP-transfected neurons to 0.44 ± 0.27 in the shFZD9-EGFP-transfected neurons (p < 0.05) was observed. As a control for Ca2+ entry, treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin induced an intracellular Ca2+ increase in both neuronal populations without significant differences, suggesting that both neuronal populations can respond and produce a Ca2+ increase with a different stimulus than Wnt-5a (Fig. 4C). These experiments reveal that down-regulation of endogenous FZD9 selectively impairs the Wnt-5a-induced rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, dendritic spine density was measured in shFZD9-EGFP-transfected neurons after Wnt-5a treatment. As shown in Fig. 4E, Wnt-5a treatment induced an increase in the number of dendritic protrusions in Fux-EGFP-transfected neurons, with a maximal effect at 2 h; however, this effect was reduced to basal levels in shFZD9-transfected neurons. To confirm these data, we used a different shRNA against FZD9 (shFZD9c-EGFP, Code number KH02416G) that is commercially available that also express the EGFP protein to select the transfected neurons, which reduce the expression of FZD9 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). In the scramble-EGFP-transfected neurons, there was a significant increase in the density of dendritic spines after the treatment with Wnt-5a (5.69 ± 1.90 spine protrusions/10-μm dendrite length) compared with control conditions (3.4 ± 1.51). This increase was not observed in shFZD9c-EGFP-transfected neurons treated with Wnt-5a (4.16 ± 1.07), as compared with the shFZD9c untreated neurons (4.30 ± 1.31) (Fig. 4F). Taken together, our results suggest that FZD9 mediates Wnt-5a signaling, inducing a rapid increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations and enhancing dendritic spine formation in hippocampal neurons. To determine whether Wnt-5a activates G proteins, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using specific antibodies that recognize the GTP-bound Gαo or the Gαi subunits, the active forms of the Gα proteins (Gαo-GTP or Gαi-GTP), in cultures of hippocampal neurons that were previously treated with Wnt-5a for different times periods. As a positive control, the untreated lysates were incubated with the non-hydrolyzable GTP form GTPγS, which increases the activation state of G proteins. Our results show that Wnt-5a induced a sustained activation of the Gαo subunit after 5 min of exposure and remained active for at least 60 min. In contrast, Wnt-5a was unable to alter the level of the active Gαi subunit (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Wnt-5a specifically induces the activation of Gαo. The IgG bands show that an equal amount of the antibody was used for each immunoprecipitation. Considering that FZD9 mediates the Wnt-5a responses, we next aimed to determine whether FZD9 acts as a GPCR. We treated DIV 14 hippocampal neurons with Wnt-5a and then performed co-immunoprecipitation against total Gαo. Then the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting sequentially against Gαo, FZD9, and Gβ1–5 (using an antibody that labels the five Gβ isoforms) in the same membrane. We found that FZD9 receptor was markedly co-immunoprecipitated with Gαo in unstimulated neurons (Fig. 5B), suggesting that FZD9 and Gαo interact under basal conditions in neurons. Notably, when the neurons were treated with Wnt-5a for 30 min, the co-immunoprecipitation of FZD9 was significantly reduced. Additionally, we found that the interaction between Gαo and Gβ1–5 decreases after Wnt-5a treatment, suggesting that the Gβγ complex is activated and released after the interaction between Wnt-5a and FZD9 receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that Wnt-5a decouples the interaction between and FZD9 and Gαo and Gβγ complex. Previously, it has been demonstrated that Wnt-5a activates the Wnt/Ca2+ and the Wnt/JNK pathways (37Kohn A.D. Moon R.T. Wnt and calcium signaling: β-catenin-independent pathways.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In addition, Wnt-5a induces the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) and JNK in a time-dependent manner in hippocampal neurons (11Farías G.G. Alfaro I.E. Cerpa W. Grabowski C.P. Godoy J.A. Bonansco C. Inestrosa N.C. Wnt-5a/JNK signaling promotes the clustering of PSD-95 in hippocampal neurons.J. Biol.

To evaluate whether the effect of Wnt-5a in both cascades is due to the activation of G proteins, we analyzed the effect of PTX, an exotoxin that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of the Gαi/o subunits, precluding its interaction with the GPCR. First, the PTX requires an endosomal uptake, and then it is transported to the Golgi and to the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally it is released in the cytosol where it ADP-ribosylates the Gαi/o subunits (39Stein P.E. Boodhoo A. Armstrong G.D. Cockle S.A. Klein M.H. Read R.J.

Retrograde transport of pertussis toxin in the mammalian cell.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1130-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For this reason, the hippocampal neurons were preincubated with PTX for 6 h, and then Wnt-5a was added for different lengths of time. The hippocampal neurons showed a significant increase in the active form of CaMKIIα (p-CaMKIIα Tyr286) after 30 min of Wnt-5a treatment compared with the control conditions. This effect was attenuated by preincubation with PTX at all time points (Fig. 6A). In addition, Wnt-5a treatment increased JNK phosphorylation (p-JNK Thr183/Tyr185) after 15 min, with a peak at 30 min, and this effect was also significantly reduced by PTX co-treatment (Fig. 6A). Additionally, we observed that exposing hippocampal neurons to Wnt-5a for 5 min induced an increase in the phosphorylation of protein kinase CβII (PKCβII) at serine 660, a key post-translational modification required for its translocation from the cytoplasm to the membrane and subsequent activation. Interestingly, this effect was partially blocked by PTX pretreatment (Fig. 6A). Finally, our findings reveal that neither Wnt-5a nor PTX affected the stabilization of β-catenin in hippocampal neurons, even after 2 h of treatment (Fig. 6A). These experiments confirm that Gαo is required for the activation of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, including CaMKII, JNK, and PKC activation. Because Wnt-5a promotes the clustering of PSD-95 in the postsynaptic region (11Farías G.G. Alfaro I.E. Cerpa W. Grabowski C.P. Godoy J.A. Bonansco C. Inestrosa N.C.

The structure of a mammalian bGP has not been yet determined even though glycogen and bGP are increasingly recognized to play key roles in brain function. Knowledge of the structure of bGP would allow a better understanding of the molecular basis of brain glycogen metabolism, its regulation, and its role in physiological and pathological brain processes. In addition, the structure of bGP could be helpful to design isozyme-specific drugs. glycogen phosphorylase muscle GP liver GP brain GP Protein Data Bank. Here, we report the first structures of human bGP in complex with PEG 400 and in complex with AMP, its allosteric activator. These structures demonstrate that bGP has a closer structural relationship with mGP, which is also activated by AMP, contrary to liver GP, which is not. More importantly, the bGP structures suggest the molecular bases responsible for the distinct responses of mGP and bGP to allosteric activation by AMP. More broadly, our study further supports that the distinct structural and regulatory properties of GP isozymes contribute to the different functions of muscle, liver, and brain glycogen. Human bGP was overexpressed in Escherichia coli expressing the chaperonin complex GroEL-GroES. The co-expression of the GroEL-GroES complex and human bGP substantially increased the production and purification yield of the functional recombinant enzyme by improving the correct folding of human bGP. The enzyme was expressed as an N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The polyhistidine tag was removed by thrombin digestion to ensure structural integrity and full biological activity of the protein. We assessed the protein for purity, enzymatic activity, and full-length sequence (Fig. 1, a–c, and supplemental Fig. S1). GPs are allosteric enzymes activated by both phosphorylation of Ser14 by phosphorylase kinase and binding of allosteric effectors, such as AMP. We carried out biochemical and enzymatic characterization of the recombinant bGP to ensure that the purified enzyme was functional. The glycogen saturation curve (Fig. 1d) and the activation of the enzyme by AMP, as well as following phosphorylation by phosphorylase kinase (Fig. 1e), confirmed the functionality of the protein. We assessed the phosphorylation state of the enzyme by Western blotting, using an antibody raised against phosphorylated serine (Fig. 1f) and native mass spectrometry analysis and confirmed the presence of two phosphate groups per dimer (supplemental Fig. S1). Phosphorylation of bGP promoted the activation of the enzyme to 60% of that of the control with AMP. The addition of AMP to phosphorylated bGP resulted in a similar level of enzyme activation as that by AMP alone (Fig. 1e). We incubated the recombinant enzyme with increasing concentrations of AMP and fitted the initial velocities to the Hill equation to determine whether the binding of AMP to bGP is cooperative. The resulting nHill coefficient of 0.994 indicated that AMP binding to bGP was not cooperative (Fig. 1g). All these characteristics are in accordance with previously published data (23Crerar M.M. Karlsson O. Fletterick R.J. Hwang P.K. Chimeric muscle and brain glycogen phosphorylases define protein domains governing isozyme-specific responses to allosteric activation.J. Biol.

We thus used this functional enzyme for further crystallographic studies. We performed several trials to obtain the human bGP structure in its active and inactive conformations. We first attempted to crystallize the enzyme alone and complexed with allosteric effectors such as AMP, ATP, caffeine, glucose, or ammonium sulfate. We obtained bGP crystals in 0.2 m calcium chloride dihydrate, 0.1 m NaHepes, pH 7.5, using 28% (v/v) PEG 400 as precipitant. We did not obtain bGP co-crystals with ligands, despite the high number of crystallization conditions tested. We thus performed soaking experiments of the bGP crystals with several allosteric effectors. Finally, we collected diffraction data sets from bGP crystals, at 2.5 Å resolution and from bGP in complex with AMP at 3.4 Å resolution. The three-dimensional structures were determined by molecular replacement, using a homology model based on human muscle glycogen phosphorylase (PDB code 1Z8D) as a search model (Table 1). bGP shares a high percentage of amino acid sequence identity with the muscle (83%) and liver (80%) isozymes. Accordingly, bGP displays a global structure similar to the other isoforms with monomer and dimer RMSD in alpha carbon positions of <1 Å (Table 2). In both crystals, we have one molecule by asymmetric unit, but a bGP tetramer is formed by crystallographic symmetry (Figs. 2a and 3a). The tetrameric arrangement of GPs has only been observed for the activated (or R state) of mGP (in the presence of AMP and/or when phosphorylated). In the absence of AMP or phosphorylation, mGP crystallizes as a dimer in the asymmetric unit (PDB code 2GPB). It was thus surprising to observe that in absence of AMP, bGP also formed a tetramer. We attribute this quaternary arrangement to the presence of a PEG 400 molecule, used as precipitant, in the AMP binding site (supplemental Fig. S2) (see “Results” and “Discussion”). Each tetramer is composed by the association of two functional dimers that interact through the catalytic face located at the tetramer interface (29Rath V.L. Ammirati M. LeMotte P.K. Fennell K.F.

The monomer is composed of two domains: the N-terminal domain from residues 22 to 484 and the C-terminal domain from residues 485 to 822 (Fig. 2, b and c). The catalytic site, found at the interface between the two domains, is marked by the presence of the electron density of the co-factor pyridoxal phosphate attached to the protein through a Schiff base linkage to Lys680, as observed in the mGP and lGP structures (27Barford D.

Surprisingly, both the AMP-bound and PEG-bound bGP structures display classical features attributed to the active state of GPs including the open gate loop, the tetrameric association mentioned above, the overall relationship between the dimers, and the conformation of the tower helices (27Barford D. Johnson L.N. The allosteric transition of glycogen phosphorylase.Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 28Sprang S.R. Withers S.G. Goldsmith E.J. Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Structural basis for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase b by adenosine monophosphate.Science. 1991; 254: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These are distinguishing features for the active form of mGP and are consistent with bGP regulation being similar to that of mGP. A PEG 400 molecule is found in the AMP-binding site of PEG-bound bGP structure (Fig. 4a and Fig. 3) and interacts with residues involved in the binding of AMP (Fig. 4b). The PEG 400 molecule may mimic the binding of AMP and stabilizes the protein in active-like structural conformation. However, we found PEG 400 to be a very poor activator of bGP (data not shown). The structure of the bGP complexed with AMP was obtained by long time soaking of protein crystals with AMP (supplemental Fig. S2). We suppose that the protein conformation observed in PEG-bound bGP crystals is sufficiently close to the active state to allow all the structural changes induced by the addition of AMP without altering the crystal integrity. Indeed, soaking experiments with allosteric inhibitors, such as ATP or caffeine, altered the crystal integrity within seconds (visible cracks and poor diffraction). By contrast, several diffraction data sets were collected from crystals of AMP-complexed bGP obtained by soaking, and the solved structures were similar (monomer RMSD of 0.34 Å and dimer RMSD of 0.35 Å). Changes induced by the addition of AMP were conserved in all the AMP-bound bGP structures. Additionally, the correct and reproducible coordination of AMP in the AMP-binding site and the slight structural changes accompanying PEG 400 replacement by AMP (Fig. 4c) suggest that the AMP-bound bGP structure corresponds to the active conformation of the enzyme. GPs are generally found in two major oligomeric states: dimer and tetramer. In the absence of AMP or phosphorylation, the dimer remains in an inactive conformation. The subunit interfaces of the dimer are remodeled upon activation, allowing the transition from the inactive (T state) to the active (R state) conformations. The remodeling of the mGP interfaces allows this isozyme to form tetramers in which the catalytic sites are occluded (27Barford D. Johnson L.N. The allosteric transition of glycogen phosphorylase.Nature. 1989; 340: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 33Barford D. Johnson L.N. The molecular mechanism for the tetrameric association of glycogen phosphorylase promoted by protein phosphorylation.Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The active form of lGP remains as a dimer because of its more rigid structure (29Rath V.L. Ammirati M. LeMotte P.K. Fennell K.F. Mansour M.N. Danley D.E. Hynes T.R. Schulte G.K. Wasilko D.J.

We observed that bGP is found as an equilibrium between a monomeric and dimeric form, which is shift toward the dimeric state upon activation (supplemental Table S1). In crystals, bGP forms a tetramer displaying three distinct interfaces, similar to the muscle isoform. Each monomer displays a series of contacts allowing it to interact with the three other monomers of the tetramer. We designate the three interfaces as: 1) the functional dimer, which corresponds to the acti"

We have investigated the μs-ms time-scale dynamics of the intra-strand hydrophobic core and interfaces of the fibrils composed of Aβ1–40 protein. Using solid-state 2H NMR line shape experiments performed on selectively deuterated methyl groups, we probed the 3-fold symmetric and 2-fold symmetric polymorphs of native Aβ as well as the protofibrils of D23N Iowa mutant, associated with an early onset of Alzheimer disease. The dynamics of the hydrophobic regions probed at Leu-17, Leu-34, Val-36, and Met-35 side chains were found to be very pronounced at all sites and in all polymorphs of Aβ, with methyl axis motions persisting down to 230–200 K for most of the sites. The dominant mode of motions is the rotameric side chain jumps, with the Met-35 displaying the most complex multi-modal behavior. There are distinct differences in the dynamics among the three protein variants, with the Val-36 site displaying the most variability. Solvation of the fibrils does not affect methyl group motions within the hydrophobic core of individual cross-β subunits but has a clear effect on the motions at the hydrophobic interface between the cross-β subunits, which is defined by Met-35 contacts. In particular, hydration activates transitions between additional rotameric states that are not sampled in the dry protein. Thus, these results support the existence of water-accessible cavity recently predicted by molecular dynamics simulations and suggested by cryo-EM studies.

We conducted a prospective, randomized double-blind study in 40 Parkinson disease patients at Hoehn & Yahr stages 1.5 to 3 who were either assigned to monthly bee venom injections or equivalent volumes of saline (treatment/placebo group: n = 20/20). The primary objective of this study was to assess a potential symptomatic effect of s.c. bee venom injections (100 μg) compared to placebo 11 months after initiation of therapy on United Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores in the « off » condition pre-and post-injection at a 60 minute interval. Secondary objectives included the evolution of UPDRS III scores over the study period and [123I]-FP-CIT scans to evaluate disease progression. Finally, safety was assessed by monitoring specific IgE against bee venom and skin tests when necessary. After an 11 month period of monthly administration, bee venom did not significantly decrease UPDRS III scores in the « off » condition. Also, UPDRS III scores over the study course, and nuclear imaging, did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Four patients were excluded during the trial due to positive skin tests but no systemic allergic reaction was recorded. After an initial increase, specific IgE against bee venom decreased in all patients completing the trial. This study did not evidence any clear symptomatic or disease-modifying effects of monthly bee venom injections over an 11 month period compared to placebo using a standard bee venom allergy desensitization protocol in Parkinson disease patients. However, bee venom administration appeared safe in non-allergic subjects. Thus, we suggest that higher administration frequency and possibly higher individual doses of bee venom may reveal its potency in treating Parkinson disease.

https://openalex.org/W2469042150,"Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli use tripartite efflux pumps such as AcrAB-TolC to expel antibiotics and noxious compounds. A key feature of the inner membrane transporter component, AcrB, is a short stretch of residues known as the gate/switch loop that divides the proximal and distal substrate binding pockets. Amino acid substitutions of the gate loop are known to decrease antibiotic resistance conferred by AcrB. Here we present two new AcrB gate loop variants, the first stripped of its bulky side chains, and a second in which the gate loop is removed entirely. By determining the crystal structures of the variant AcrB proteins in the presence and absence of erythromycin and assessing their ability to confer erythromycin tolerance, we demonstrate that the gate loop is important for AcrB export activity but is not required for erythromycin binding."
https://openalex.org/W2463305391,"Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Liberia. At the same time, insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership and use remain low. Access is a key determinant of ITN use but it is not the only one; prior studies have identified factors that affect the use of ITNs in households with at least one ITN. These factors operate at the individual, household, and community levels. However, studies have generally not assessed the psychosocial or ideational determinants of ITN use. Using 2014 household survey data, this manuscript examines the socio-demographic, ideational, household, and community factors associated with household member use of ITNs in Liberia. Multilevel modeling was used to assess fixed effects at the individual, household, and community levels, and random effects at the household and cluster levels. The data showed significant residual clustering at the household level, indicating that there were unmeasured factors operating at this level that are associated with ITN use. The association of age with ITN use was moderated by sex such that men, older children, and teenagers were less likely to sleep under an ITN compared to women and children under five years old. Female caregivers' perceived severity of malaria, perceived self-efficacy to detect a complicated case of malaria, and exposure to the ""Take Cover"" communication campaign were positively associated with ITN use by members of her household. The association with household size was negative, while the relationship with the number of ITNs was positive. Programs should seek to achieve universal coverage (that is, one ITN for every two household members) and promote the notion that everyone needs to sleep under an ITN every night. Programs should also seek to strengthen perceived severity of malaria and educate intended audience groups on the signs of malaria complications. Given the significance of residual clustering at the household level, interventions that engage men as heads of household and key decision-makers are relevant."

To address the impact of maternal and neonatal Fe status and hepcidin on the regulation of these proteins, mRNA expression and protein abundance of nonheme and heme Fe transport proteins were evaluated in placental tissue from 154 adolescents. Regression analyses found maternal Fe status was significantly associated with multiple placental nonheme and heme transporters, whereas neonatal Fe status was related to only 3 heme transporters. Across statistical analyses, maternal Fe status was consistently associated with the placental nonheme Fe importer transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Protein abundance of TfR1 was related to midgestation maternal serum ferritin (SF) (β = -0.32; P = 0.005) and serum TfR (β = 0.25; P = 0.024). Protein abundance of the heme importer, proton-coupled folate transporter, was related to neonatal SF (β = 0.30; P = 0.016) and serum TfR (β = -0.46; P < 0.0001). Neonatal SF was also related to mRNA expression of the heme exporter feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 (β = -0.30; P = 0.004). In summary, maternal Fe insufficiency during pregnancy predicts increased expression of the placental nonheme Fe transporter TfR1.

https://openalex.org/W2462411645,"β-Carotene is an important source of vitamin A for the mammalian embryo, which depends on its adequate supply to achieve proper organogenesis. In mammalian tissues, β-carotene 15,15′-oxygenase (BCO1) converts β-carotene to retinaldehyde, which is then oxidized to retinoic acid, the biologically active form of vitamin A that acts as a transcription factor ligand to regulate gene expression. β-Carotene can also be cleaved by β-carotene 9′,10′-oxygenase (BCO2) to form β-apo-10′-carotenal, a precursor of retinoic acid and a transcriptional regulator per se. The mammalian embryo obtains β-carotene from the maternal circulation. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable its transfer across the maternal-fetal barrier are not understood. Given that β-carotene is transported in the adult bloodstream by lipoproteins and that the placenta acquires, assembles, and secretes lipoproteins, we hypothesized that the aforementioned process requires placental lipoprotein biosynthesis. Here we show that β-carotene availability regulates transcription and activity of placental microsomal triglyceride transfer protein as well as expression of placental apolipoprotein B, two key players in lipoprotein biosynthesis. We also show that β-apo-10′-carotenal mediates the transcriptional regulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein via hepatic nuclear factor 4α and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor I/II. Our data provide the first in vivo evidence of the transcriptional regulatory activity of β-apocarotenoids and identify microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and its transcription factors as the targets of their action. This study demonstrates that β-carotene induces a feed-forward mechanism in the placenta to enhance the assimilation of β-carotene for proper embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2470166042,"We previously examined the effect of brain microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) transplantation on rat white matter infarction, and found that MVEC transplantation promoted remyelination of demyelinated axons in the infarct region and reduced apoptotic death of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). We also found that the conditioned medium (CM) from cultured MVECs inhibited apoptosis of cultured OPCs. In this study, we examined contribution of extracellular vesicles (EVs) contained in the CM to its inhibitory effect on OPC apoptosis. Removal of EVs from the CM by ultracentrifugation reduced its inhibitory effect on OPC apoptosis. To confirm whether EVs derived from MVECs are taken up by cultured OPCs, we labeled EVs with PKH67, a fluorescent dye, and added them to OPC cultures. Many vesicular structures labeled with PKH67 were found within OPCs immediately after their addition. Next we examined the effect of MVEC-derived EVs on OPC behaviors. After 2 days in culture with EVs, there was significantly less pyknotic and more BrdU-positive OPCs when compared to control. We also examined the effect of EVs on motility of OPCs. OPCs migrated longer in the presence of EVs when compared to control. To examine whether these effects on cultured OPCs are shared by EVs from endothelial cells, we prepared EVs from conditioned media of several types of endothelial cells, and tested their effects on cultured OPCs. EVs from all types of endothelial cells we examined reduced apoptosis of OPCs and promoted their motility. Identification of the molecules contained in EVs from endothelial cells may prove helpful for establishment of effective therapies for demyelinating diseases."

Despite a wealth of studies conducted on the relevance of Tom70·Hsp90 complex formation, there is a dearth of information regarding the exact molecular mode of interaction. To help fill this void, we have employed a combined experimental strategy consisting of cross-linking/mass spectrometry to investigate binding of the C-terminal Hsp90 domain to the cytosolic domain of Tom70. This approach has identified a novel region of contact between C-Hsp90 and Tom70, a finding that is confirmed by probing the corresponding peptides derived from cross-linking experiments via isothermal titration calorimetry and mitochondrial import assays. The data generated in this study are combined to input constraints for a molecular model of the Hsp90/Tom70 interaction, which has been validated by small angle x-ray scattering, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and mass spectrometry. The resultant model suggests that only one of the MEEVD motifs within dimeric Hsp90 contacts Tom70. Collectively, our findings provide significant insight on the mechanisms by which preproteins interact with Hsp90 and are translocated via Tom70 to the mitochondria. To accomplish its crucial role, mitochondria require proteins that are produced in the cytosol, delivered by cytosolic Hsp90, and translocated to its interior by the translocase outer membrane (TOM) complex. Hsp90 is a dimeric molecular chaperone and its function is modulated by its interaction with a large variety of co-chaperones expressed within the cell.

Four lines of evidence argue that the motor primarily resides in a two-heads-bound (2HB) state. First, upon microtubule binding, dimeric Eg5 releases both bound ADPs. Second, microtubule dissociation in saturating ADP is 20-fold slower for the dimer than for the monomer. Third, ATP-triggered mant-ADP release is 5-fold faster than the stepping rate. Fourth, ATP binding is relatively fast when the motor is locked in a 2HB state. Shortening the neck-linker does not facilitate rear-head detachment, suggesting a minimal role for rear-head-gating. This 2HB state may enable Eg5 to stabilize incoming tubulin at the growing microtubule plus-end. The finding that slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs trigger slower nucleotide release than ATP suggests that ATP hydrolysis in the bound head precedes stepping by the tethered head, leading to a mechanochemical cycle in which processivity is determined by the race between unbinding of the bound head and attachment of the tethered head.

We aimed to assess the impact of asymptomatic NC (AsNC) on the management and prognosis of IE.From the database of cases collected for a population-based study on IE, we selected 283 patients with definite left-sided IE who had undergone at least one neuroimaging procedure (cerebral CT scan and/or MRI) performed as part of initial evaluation.Among those 283 patients, 100 had symptomatic neurological complications (SNC) prior to the investigation, 35 had an asymptomatic neurological complications (AsNC), and 148 had a normal cerebral imaging (NoNC). The rate of valve surgery was 43% in the 100 patients with SNC, 77% in the 35 with AsNC, and 54% in the 148 with NoNC (p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was 42% in patients with SNC, 8.6% in patients with AsNC, and 16.9% in patients with NoNC (p<0.001). Among the 135 patients with NC, 95 had an indication for valve surgery (71%), which was performed in 70 of them (mortality 20%) and not performed in 25 (mortality 68%). In a multivariate adjusted analysis of the 135 patients with NC, age, renal failure, septic shock, and IE caused by S. aureus were independently associated with in-hospital and 1-year mortality. In addition SNC was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality.The presence of NC was associated with a poorer prognosis when symptomatic. Patients with AsNC had the highest rate of valve surgery and the lowest mortality rate, which suggests a protective role of surgery guided by systematic neuroimaging results."

Many pharmaceutical agents, including anticancer drugs, cause undesired toxicities to normal tissues, which prevent dose escalation to therapeutically active regimens. Paul Ehrlich's dream of a magic bullet (“Zauberkugel”), a molecule that would display toxic activity only upon binding to a target cell of interest, has to some extent been realized by the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface antigens, as these therapeutic products may preferentially redirect the cytotoxic activity of certain leukocytes (e.g. natural killer cells) to antibody-coated cells. Although certain therapeutic antibodies specific to leukemia and lymphoma antigens have demonstrated a potential to induce cancer cures in mice and humans (1Coiffier B. Lepage E. Briere J.

To improve the therapeutic activity of anticancer monoclonal antibodies, various types of antibody derivatives have been developed, including antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (7Hess C. Venetz D. Neri D. Emerging classes of armed antibody therapeutics against cancer.Medchemcomm. 2014; 5: 408-431Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

In principle, an ideal biopharmaceutical agent would display no toxicity when injected into the bloodstream, but should regain potent therapeutic activity upon binding to its antigen expressed on target cells. The targeted reassembly of a bioactive cytokine payload from two split cytokine constituents represents a new immunotherapeutic strategy, which could potentially accomplish this goal. The reconstitution of protein activity from two fragments has been demonstrated in vitro for a variety of proteins. For example, the enzyme ribonuclease H or green fluorescent proteins have been engineered into split proteins (11Hostomsky Z. Hostomska Z. Hudson G.O. Moomaw E.W. Nodes B.R. Reconstitution in vitro of RNase H activity by using purified N-terminal and C-terminal domains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Protein tagging and detection with engineered self-assembling fragments of green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and experimental techniques that rely on protein fragment complementation have become useful tools for the study of protein interactions (13Remy I. Michnick S.W. Application of protein-fragment complementation assays in cell biology.BioTechniques. 2007; 42: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Morell M. Ventura S. Avilés F.X. Protein complementation assays: approaches for the in vivo analysis of protein interactions.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The concept of reconstituting therapeutic activity at the site of disease (“activity on demand”) has been pursued with various experimental implementations, ranging from the antigen-restricted complementation of a tri-specific antibody to the tetrazine-triggered release of drug payloads from antibody-drug conjugates (15Banaszek, A., (2013) Dual Antigen-restricted Complementation of a Two-part Trispecific Antibody for Targeted Immunotherapy of Blood Cancer.

The practical implementation of these strategies may be hindered by the fact that the reconstitution of activity at the site of disease requires relatively high local concentrations of the interaction (or reaction) partners. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are potent activators of the immune system that have been considered for cancer therapy. Indeed, recombinant versions of interleukin-2 (IL2), interferon-α (IFNα), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have received marketing authorization for the treatment of certain types of malignancies (17Walsh G. Biopharmaceutical benchmarks 2014.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). However, already at low doses, these biopharmaceuticals can cause systemic activation of immune cells or the endothelium, leading to cytokine release and vascular leakage. These off-target effects are clinically manifested by flu-like symptoms and hypotension, which often prevent the escalation to therapeutically active doses (18Motzer R.J. Hutson T.E. Tomczak P. Michaelson M.D. Bukowski R.M. Rixe O. Oudard S. Negrier S. Szczylik C. Kim S.T. Chen I. Bycott P.W. Baum C.M. Figlin R.A. Sunitinib versus interferon alfa in metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). Recombinant IL2 can be administered at doses up to 800 million IU for only 1–2 weeks and only to young cancer patients, who are in a relatively good state of health. The treatment still leads to substantial systemic side effects but also to long-term remissions in ∼10% of patients with renal cell carcinoma or with metastatic melanoma (19Donohue J.H. Rosenberg S.A. The fate of interleukin-2 after in vivo administration.J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2203-2208PubMed Google Scholar, 20Boyman O. Sprent J.

IL-2: the first effective immunotherapy for human cancer.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 5451-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Similarly, the recommended doses for systemic administration of IFNα and TNF are typically lower than 1 mg due to dose-limiting toxicities (18Motzer R.J. Hutson T.E. Tomczak P. Michaelson M.D. Bukowski R.M. Rixe O. Oudard S. Negrier S. Szczylik C. Kim S.T. Chen I. Bycott P.W. Baum C.M. Figlin R.A. Sunitinib versus interferon alfa in metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.N. Engl.

Med. 1987; 317: 1545-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Interleukin-12 (IL12), one of the most active cytokine products described so far, could be administered to cancer patients only at a dose of 500 ng/kg twice weekly (23Gollob J.A. Mier J.W. Veenstra K. McDermott D.F. Clancy D. Clancy M. Atkins M.B. Phase I trial of twice-weekly intravenous interleukin 12 in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or malignant melanoma: ability to maintain IFN-γ induction is associated with clinical response.Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1678-1692PubMed Google Scholar). At this dose, IL12 exhibits only modest antitumor activity and may cause strong side effects primarily related to systemic IFNγ release, which have even led to fatal toxicities in a Phase II clinical trial (24Leonard J.P. Sherman M.L. Fisher G.L. Buchanan L.J. Larsen G. Atkins M.B. Sosman J.A. Dutcher J.P. Vogelzang N.J. Ryan J.L. Effects of single-dose interleukin-12 exposure on interleukin-12-associated toxicity and interferon-γ production.Blood. 1997; 90: 2541-2548PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, clinical investigations of IL12-based biopharmaceuticals have been largely abandoned until now despite promising preclinical data. To improve the therapeutic index of cytokines for cancer therapy, tumor-homing antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (also termed “immunocytokines”) have been investigated. Studies on syngeneic mouse models of different types of solid tumors and hematological malignancies could demonstrate that immunocytokines can indeed substantially increase the therapeutic index of the corresponding cytokine payloads (25Pasche N. Neri D. Immunocytokines: a novel class of potent armed antibodies.Drug Discov. Today. 2012; 17: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For the most promising products, the gain in therapeutic activity could be attributed to a preferential localization at the site of disease (26Halin C. Rondini S. Nilsson F. Berndt A. Kosmehl H. Zardi L. Neri D. Enhancement of the antitumor activity of interleukin-12 by targeted delivery to neovasculature.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Carnemolla B. Borsi L. Balza E. Castellani P. Meazza R. Berndt A. Ferrini S. Kosmehl H. Neri D. Zardi L.

Selective targeted delivery of TNFα to tumor blood vessels.Blood. 2003; 102: 4384-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, immunocytokines normally retain full cytokine activity in vitro, and cytokine-induced toxicity is mainly associated with peak concentrations of the corresponding cytokine-based pharmaceutical, which are reached shortly upon intravenous injection (8Eigentler T.K. Weide B. de Braud F. Spitaleri G. Romanini A. Pflugfelder A. González-Iglesias R. Tasciotti A. Giovannoni L. Schwager K. Lovato V. Kaspar M. Trachsel E. Menssen H.D. Neri D. Garbe C.

Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 7732-7742Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Immunocytokines therefore often display similar side effect profiles as the parental cytokines. An ideal immunocytokine product would display potent activity only at the site of disease, but not when the protein circulates in blood. In this study, we propose a new strategy for the development of antibody-cytokine fusions with activity on demand, based on the stepwise reassembly of cytokine subunits at the site of disease. Interleukin-12 lends itself for this purpose because of its heterodimeric architecture (29Yoon C. Johnston S.C. Tang J. Stahl M. Tobin J.F. Somers W.S. Charged residues dominate a unique interlocking topography in the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-12.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3530-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Human IL12 exhibits structural similarity to a class I cytokine-receptor complex. The p35 subunit is homologous to IL6, whereas p40 exhibits homology to the IL6 receptor α (29Yoon C. Johnston S.C. Tang J. Stahl M. Tobin J.F. Somers W.S. Charged residues dominate a unique interlocking topography in the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-12.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3530-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the functional contribution of the individual subunits to IL12 activity has so far been elusive because p35 is only secreted when co-expressed with p40 (30Jalah R. Rosati M. Ganneru B.

Cancer. 2008; 122: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The selective antibody uptake in different tissues or blood can be expressed as the percentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at various time points. Earlier studies on mouse IL12-based antibody fusion proteins had revealed a preferential accumulation at the tumor site (32Gafner V. Trachsel E. Neri D.

Within these studies, we have shown that fusion proteins, consisting of antibodies fused to mutants of the p40 and p35 subunits of mouse IL12, could selectively reassemble after product binding to the target antigen in vitro. Furthermore, these split cytokine fusion proteins were able to preferentially localize to the tumor site. Unexpectedly, we observed that antibody fusions of p35S partially retained the ability to activate CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells. The hypothetical graph in Fig. 1 depicts the general pharmaceutical strategy for the antibody-based stepwise reassembly of a split cytokine at the site of disease, exemplified with heterodimeric IL12. In a first step, a bivalent p35S-based antibody fusion protein (F8-p35S-F8) is injected and allowed to selectively bind to its antigen in vivo. Once a suitable selectivity has been achieved, a second injection of a fusion protein based on the complementary p40S subunit could lead to the reconstitution of cytokine activity at the site of disease. The order and timing of the injections could be chosen on the basis of the pharmacokinetic profiles of the individual split protein fusions, to minimize reassembly in the bloodstream. The p40 subunit of IL12 is known to be secreted independently of p35 in mice (35Heinzel F.P. Hujer A.M. Ahmed F.N. Rerko R.M. In vivo production and function of IL-12 p40 homodimers.J.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Homodimeric p40 is covalently linked via a disulfide bond and has the ability to antagonize IL12 by competing for IL12 receptor binding. We sought to produce monomeric p40 by mutating the cysteine at position 197 by a C197S substitution (p40S). Likewise, a C92S substitution was performed for p35 (p35S). Previous mutational studies have revealed that the intermolecular disulfide bond is not needed to form active IL12 heterodimers (29Yoon C. Johnston S.C. Tang J. Stahl M. Tobin J.F. Somers W.S. Charged residues dominate a unique interlocking topography in the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-12.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3530-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We found that the same is also applicable to mutated murine IL12 subunits, which have an amino acid sequence homology of 60% in the case of p35 and 70% in the case of p40 when compared with their human homologs (39Schoenhaut D.S. Chua A.O. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Cloning and expression of murine IL-12.J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3433-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this initial test could be performed with His-tagged IL12 mutant subunits, low expression yields prevented further analysis. The genetic fusion to single-chain variable fragments (scFv) greatly enhanced the expression of soluble homogenous monomeric p40S preparations in CHO-S cells (Fig. 2). The mass differences observed by electrospray ionization/liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (ESI/LC-MS) indicate the presence of different glycoforms. Earlier studies on recombinant IL12 stated that an N-terminal antibody fusion to the p40 subunit may interfere with the biological activity of the IL12 payload (32Gafner V. Trachsel E. Neri D.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To further investigate this aspect, fusion proteins with p40S at the N- or C-terminal extremity of scFv antibody fragments (KSF-p40S and p40S-KSF) were produced and purified to homogeneity (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast to p40S, the expression and isolation of the mutated p35S subunit from eukaryotic cells presented a major challenge that has not been reported in the literature before. The biosynthesis and secretion of p35 are known to rely on the intracellular interaction with p40 and are most efficient in the presence of an excess of p40 (30Jalah R. Rosati M. Ganneru B. Pilkington G.R. Valentin A. Kulkarni V. Bergamaschi C. Chowdhury B. Zhang G.M. Beach R.K. Alicea C. Broderick K.E. Sardesai N.Y. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K.

Chem. 2013; 288: 6763-6776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether it would be possible to express mutated p35S by transient gene expression in a stable CHO cell line previously transfected with p40. The p40 variant used for this expression strategy did not feature a purification tag and only served as a “chaperone” for the expression of p35S. Although His-tagged p35S or fusion proteins of wild-type p35 could only be isolated as aggregates, the fusion of the p35S mutant to antibody fragments greatly improved solubility and production yields. The sequential arrangement of two scFv(F8) moieties to both termini of p35S resulted in a highly stable F8-p35S-F8 fusion protein, with a suitable biochemical quality (Fig. 2) for protein reassembly experiments and in vivo studies. To evaluate the targeting performance of purified IL12 subunit derivatives, quantitative biodistribution experiments were performed. A bivalent scFv(F8)-based fusion protein format was chosen for both IL12-derived subunit fusion proteins. The ability of F8-p35S-F8 and F8-p40S-F8 to bind with high affinity to the cognate EDA domain of fibronectin was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 3A), while tumor targeting properties were evaluated by quantitative biodistribution analysis in mice bearing murine F9 teratocarcinomas (Fig. 3B). A preferential tumor uptake for F8-p35S-F8 as well as for F8-p40S-F8 was observed 24 h after intravenous administration, with average tumor-to-blood ratios of 6.7 and 8.4, respectively. Different scFv antibody fragments, namely F8 (specific to EDA) and KSF (irrelevant specificity), were chosen as fusion partners for p35S and p40S, respectively, to test the in vitro reconstitution of heterodimeric IL12 in an SPR-based ligand capture experiment (Fig. 4A). In a first step, F8-p35S-F8 was immobilized by binding to the cognate antigen (an EDA-containing recombinant fragment of fibronectin) on an SPR sensor chip (Fig. 4B). A subsequent injection of the p40S-KSF or KSF-p40S fusion proteins led to the association with p35S and thus the formation of non-covalent heterodimeric IL12 moieties. The dissociation constants (KD) for the resulting heterodimers, calculated by fitting the sensorgrams of Fig. 4C, were 21.9 nm for p40S-KSF and 27.3 nm for KSF-p40S, respectively. Importantly, a trimeric scFv(KSF) fusion protein of TNF, which served as a negative control, did not exhibit detectable SPR binding, confirming that the assembly process relied on the interaction between the p35S and p40S subunits (Fig. 4B). Next, we assessed the biological activity of the reconstituted IL12 complexes in vitro. Using freshly isolated mouse splenocytes, equimolar mixtures of F8-p35S-F8 and KSF-p40S or p40S-KSF were able to induce IFNγ production in these cells, as shown in Fig. 5A. All fusion proteins had endotoxin levels below 0.5 endotoxin units/ml. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) for the reconstituted IL12 moieties were 10–100 times lower when compared with wild-type IL12. Unexpectedly, we observed that fusion proteins containing only the p35S subunit retained the ability to induce IFNγ production, when tested as a single agent. By contrast, neither KSF-p40S nor p40S-KSF alone induced measurable IFNγ levels. To gain additional evidence for the single agent activity of F8-p35S-F8, phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4 or pSTAT4) was assessed. Again, we compared in vitro reconstituted IL12 split cytokine mixtures with the individual mutant subunit fusion proteins. Maximal pSTAT4 levels were reached 20–25 min after stimulation with functional IL12 derivatives. Phosphorylation of STAT4 was measured in natural killer cells, as well as in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5B). The single-agent activity of F8-p35S-F8 observed in the IFNγ release assay was confirmed in all analyzed cell populations. The data indicate that F8-p35S-F8 alone is able to bind to the murine IL12 receptor β2 (IL12Rβ2), which is required for IL12-induced STAT4 phosphorylation (41Wu C. Wang X. Gadina M. O'Shea J.J.

Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins represent a promising class of biopharmaceutical agents (42Neri D. Sondel P.M. Immunocytokines for cancer treatment: past, present and future.Curr. Opin.

Strategies aimed at the reconstitution of cytokine activity at the site of disease may facilitate the development of better tolerated immunomodulatory products. In this study, we have shown that the reconstitution of a heterodimeric non-covalent IL12 complex can be achieved in vitro, using mutant subunit fusion proteins. Mutation of critical cysteine residues, in the p40-p35 interface, allowed the production of split cytokine fusion proteins, which could be purified to homogeneity, eluted as a single peak in gel filtration chromatography, and"

Expression of apolipoprotein A-I mRNA and protein synthesis were markedly up-regulated in choroids of chick eyes during the recovery from induced myopia, and apolipoprotein A-I mRNA was significantly increased in choroids following retinoic acid treatment.

Together, these data suggest that apolipoprotein A-I may participate in a regulatory feedback mechanism with retinoic acid to control the action of retinoic acid on ocular targets during postnatal ocular growth. In humans and diurnal vertebrates, postnatal eye growth is tightly regulated by a vision-dependent “emmetropization” mechanism that minimizes refractive error through modulation of the axial length of the growing eye to match the refractive target (1Siegwart Jr., J.T. Norton T.T. Perspective: how might emmetropization and genetic factors produce myopia in normal eyes?.Optom. Vis. Sci. 2011; 88: E365-E372Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Failure of the emmetropization process can lead to abnormally long or short eyes, resulting in myopia or hyperopia, respectively. In humans, the incidence of myopia is reaching epidemic proportions (2Dolgin E. The myopia boom.Nature. 2015; 519: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), theorized to be largely due to reduced time spent outdoors (3Jones L.A. Sinnott L.T. Mutti D.O. Mitchell G.L.

It has been suggested that sustained near-work activities indoors such as reading, studying, or working on computers and smartphones may not provide the visual cues necessary for emmetropization to occur (5Norton T.T. Siegwart Jr., J.T. Light levels, refractive development, and myopia—a speculative review.Exp. Eye Res. 2013; 114: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It is well established that visually guided eye growth is controlled via a cascade of locally generated chemical events that are initiated in the retina and ultimately cause changes in scleral extracellular matrix remodeling to effect changes in eye size and refraction (6Rada J.A.

Based on estimated endogenous concentrations of atRA in the choroid (∼4 × 10−9 to ∼3 × 10−8 m) and the calculated half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of atRA on inhibition of scleral proteoglycan synthesis (8 × 10−9 m), we speculate that choroidally derived atRA is transported to the sclera where it inhibits proteoglycan synthesis, resulting in a slowing of ocular growth (13Rada J.A.

However, direct evidence that choroidally generated atRA acts on the sclera to alter extracellular matrix remodeling has yet to be demonstrated.

We hypothesize that atRA-binding proteins are synthesized in the chick choroid to regulate the transport and activity of atRA. Mertz and Wallman (9Mertz J.R. Wallman J.

ARVO E): 2162PubMed Google Scholar) have identified a secreted atRA-binding protein from choroid- and sclera-conditioned media with an apparent Mr of 27,000. This Mr 27,000 protein does not correspond in size to any of the previously identified atRA-binding proteins (14Noy N. Retinoid-binding proteins: mediators of retinoid action.Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and has yet to be identified. An atRA-binding protein with an apparent Mr of 28,000, previously described in bovine retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell lysates (16Bernstein P.S. Choi S.Y. Ho Y.C. Rando R.R. Photoaffinity labeling of retinoic acid-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), may be similar to the chick Mr 27,000 protein; however, this Mr 28,000 protein has also not been identified. Consequently, the goal of the present study was to identify the Mr 27,000 atRA-binding protein in choroid- and sclera-conditioned media. Using a combination of ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, mass spectrometry, and immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence that the Mr 27,000 binding protein is apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I has saturable binding for [3H]atRA, demonstrates binding selectivity for all-trans-retinoic acid, and requires the presence of apoA-I-associated lipids for retinoid binding. Furthermore, we found that apoA-I synthesis is coordinately up-regulated with atRA synthesis and that choroidal apoA-I is transcriptionally up-regulated by atRA. Considering that apoA-I can function as an atRA-binding protein, our results also suggest that transcriptional control of apoA-I gene expression in the choroid by endogenous atRA may provide an additional level of regulation of retinoic acid transport and activity in the eye. Retinoic acid-binding proteins secreted by chick tissues were identified by direct photoaffinity labeling of proteins in conditioned medium with [3H]atRA (16Bernstein P.S. Choi S.Y. Ho Y.C. Rando R.R. Photoaffinity labeling of retinoic acid-binding proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which covalently links [3H]atRA to atRA-binding sites on proteins. Following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, three major bands with apparent Mr values of 60,000, 27,000 and <10,000 were apparent in choroid- and retina/RPE-conditioned media (Fig. 1A). In contrast, liver-conditioned medium contained numerous atRA-binding proteins between the 65- and 20-kDa markers with the Mr 27,000 protein band relatively less abundant as compared with the Mr 27,000 protein band in choroid and retina/RPE samples. The Mr 66,000 band present in N2 medium and in all samples is most likely due to the presence of serum albumin (Mr 66,500) in the N2 supplement in addition to that secreted from chick tissues into the medium as several studies have demonstrated that serum albumin specifically binds atRA (17Karnaukhova E. Interactions of human serum albumin with retinoic acid, retinal and retinyl acetate.Biochem.

The Mr 66,000 and 27,000 atRA-binding proteins were also detected in sclera-conditioned medium (Fig. 1B). Sclera-conditioned medium was used for subsequent column purification of the Mr 27,000 [3H]atRA-binding protein (“p27*”) (Fig. 2). During anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q, p27* eluted as a single peak following the bulk of other proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE autoradiography (Fig. 2A). The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. p27* eluted monodispersely at a position corresponding to an Mr of ≈27,000 together with the majority of total protein (Fig. 2B). Unlabeled conditioned medium was separated on Mono Q and Superdex 200 based on conditions established previously for p27*, and a co-eluting band at the Mr 27,000 position, referred to as p27, was observed in the corresponding Superdex fractions (fractions 25–31) by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Purification of unlabeled p27 for mass spectrometry. Unlabeled conditioned medium was separated on Mono Q and Superdex 200 as for the p27* sample (Fig. 2) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Regions of the gel that contained p27, which co-eluted and co-electrophoresed with p27*, based on conductivity and A280 profile, were labeled A, B, C, D, and E, excised from the gel of fraction 28, and processed for mass spectrometry. Gel slices at position D as well as a gel slice from the Mr 66,000 protein in fraction 27 (“66”) were similarly analyzed from fractions 26, 27, 29, and 30.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the protein content of this band, gel slices labeled “A”, “B” “C”, “D”, and “E” were excised from the Coomassie-stained gel for Superdex fraction 28 and processed for mass spectrometry. Slices A, B, and C were taken from areas above p27; slice D was taken at the position of p27; and slice E was taken immediately below p27. Additionally, gel slices corresponding to the position of p27 (slice D) were excised from the gel containing fractions 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. A similar gel slice was also excised at the position of Mr 66,000 from gel slice 27.The protein content of the gel bands was estimated after trypsinization and analysis of the recovered peptides by LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. Following analyses of mass spectra with Proteome Discoverer, proteins with at least three identified peptides were plotted in Fig. 4 as total chromatographic peak area of the three most abundant peptides for each protein (see supplemental Table 1 for additional details on mass spectrometry and database search results). Chicken apoA-I (UniProt reference number P08250) was the most abundant protein in slices A–E of fraction 28 with highest concentration in gel slice D relative to the flanking positions (Fig. 4A). All other identified proteins were ≥100-fold lower in relative concentration. ApoA-I also co-eluted faithfully with the p27 band across Superdex fractions 26–30 (Fig. 4B). Additionally, albumin and triose-phosphate isomerase were identified in Superdex fractions 26–30; however, their relative apparent abundance was much lower than that of apoA-I, and their elution patterns did not correspond to that of p27. Thus, apoA-I became the top candidate for the identity of p27. The predicted Mr of mature chicken apoA-I (following cleavage of the 18-amino acid signal peptide and 6-amino acid propeptide), 27,964, is consistent with the assignment. Mass spectrometry analyses of the Mr 66,000 protein from gel slice 27 identified chicken serum albumin (UniProt reference number P19121) as the most abundant protein present. A relatively small amount of apoA-I (≈7%) and trace amounts of heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (HSPA8; UniProt reference number F1NWP3) were also identified at the Mr 66,000 position. A few of the predicted proteins at the Mr ≈27,000 position were identified by mass spectrometry as proteins larger than Mr ≈27,000 (e.g. serum albumin (Mr 69,900) and lamin-A (Mr 73,100)). Although both of these proteins are relatively abundant in the choroid, they were present in trace amounts at the Mr 27,000 position (0.1–0.01% of the apoA-I peak area) and are most likely degradation products of the mature proteins that occurred as a consequence of organ culture for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence of protease inhibitors. To test whether p27* from choroid- and sclera-conditioned media is apoA-I, its susceptibility to immunocapture by antibodies specific for chicken apolipoprotein A-I (20Nimpf J. George R. Schneider W.J. Apolipoprotein specificity of the chicken oocyte receptor for low and very low density lipoproteins: lack of recognition of apolipoprotein VLDL-II.J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 657-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (generously supplied by Dr. Marcela Hermann, Medical University of Vienna) was examined. As shown in Fig. 5A, anti-apoA-I coupled to magnetic beads was able to capture the majority of both p27 and p27* from choroid-conditioned medium. Capture was specific for anti-apoA-I as no p27 or p27* was seen using nonspecific IgG beads. Anti-apoA-I also captured an unidentified protein with an apparent Mr of ≈55,000, which was not photolabeled, and the Mr 8000 band, which may be a degradation product of apoA-I. The unlabeled and photolabeled Mr 66,000 proteins did not bind to anti-apoA-I-coupled beads and was present in flow-through and wash fractions. Similar results were observed for sclera-conditioned medium (Fig. 5B). These results strongly support the interpretation that p27 and p27* are the same protein and correspond to chicken apoA-I. The interaction of [3H]atRA with native and recombinant apoA-I was investigated in Fig. 6. Recombinant chicken apoA-I was generated from Escherichia coli, and native apoA-I (delipidated or lipid-associated) was purified from chicken serum. Following preincubation of [3H]atRA with 1 μg of lipid-associated native apoA-I (L-apoA-I) (Fig. 6A, lane 2), delipidated apoA-I (Fig. 6A, lane 3), recombinant apoA-I (Fig. 6A, lane 4), or total chicken serum (containing ∼1 μg of L-apoA-I; Fig. 6A, lane 1), UV irradiation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography, radioactive bands at Mr 66,000 and 27,000 were clearly detectable in serum, and a single strong radioactive band at Mr 27,000 was detected in the L-apoA-I sample (Fig. 6A, Autorad, lanes 1 and 2). Little to no radioactive adduct was detected in delipidated and recombinant apoA-I samples (Fig. 6A, Autorad, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the atRA/apoA-I interaction requires apoA-I-associated lipids. This result also suggests that the apoA-I fractions purified from serum are either not already saturated with atRA or that binding is readily reversible. To determine whether delipidated apoA-I and recombinant apoA-I maintained correct folding in our [3H]atRA binding experiments, the structural properties of lipid-associated apoA-I, delipidated apoA-I, and recombinant apoA-I were evaluated spectroscopically (Fig. 6B). Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) analysis of apoA-I indicated that L-apoA-I and delipidated apoA-I demonstrated the characteristic high content of α-helical secondary structure. Addition of 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE), an agent known to induce and stabilize the α-helical structure in proteins (21Kemmink J. Creighton T.E. Effects of trifluoroethanol on the conformations of peptides representing the entire sequence of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12630-12635Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), to delipidated apoA-I resulted in a further induction of α-helix. This pattern is very similar to that described for plasma-derived chicken apoA-I (22Kiss R.S. Ryan R.O. Hicks L.D. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Physical properties of apolipoprotein A-I from the chicken.Gallus domesticus. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7872-7878Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), indicating that delipidated apoA-I adopts a folded conformation in solution similar to its natural counterpart. Furthermore, analyses of the spectra indicated that delipidated native apoA-I protein contained 61 ± 5% α-helix and 5 ± 2% β-sheet. In contrast, recombinant apoA-I had minimal α-helical secondary structure as compared with lipid-associated or delipidated apoA-I either in the absence or presence of 50% TFE, indicating a lack of proper protein folding. To determine whether apoA-I in choroid-conditioned medium was lipid-associated, choroid-conditioned medium, previously photoaffinity-labeled with [3H]atRA, was subjected to ultracentrifugation in the presence of 0.2 g/ml NaBr (Fig. 7). Following ultracentrifugation, upper (lane 2), middle (lane 3), and bottom (lane 4) regions of the gradient were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Comparison of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (prior to autoradiography) with the autoradiogram indicates that the 3H-labeled apoA-I secreted from choroids is located in the upper 110 of the NaBr gradient (lane 2), whereas the photolabeled Mr 66,000 protein albumin, which also binds [3H]atRA, segregates to the bottom of the NaBr gradient. These observations suggest that choroidally derived apoA-I is secreted from the choroids as part of lipoprotein particles or becomes associated with lipid shortly after its secretion, and it is this lipid-associated apoA-I that binds [3H]atRA. The UV/visible light absorption spectrum of L-apoA-I purified from chicken serum had one peak with a maximum at 280 nm (Fig. 8B). Following incubation of L-apoA-I with a 10-fold molar excess of atRA and removal of the excess atRA by centrifugal ultrafiltration, holo-apoA-I was generated (indicated by absorbance maxima at 280 and 346 nm). The additional peak with a λmax of 346 nm was nearly identical to the spectra for atRA in ethanol (Fig. 8A), indicating the presence of atRA in association with apoA-I. Negative control samples prepared in the absence of apoA-I had undetectable levels of atRA. Thus, native apoA-I from serum was not substantially and stably loaded with atRA, and based on the extinction coefficients apoA-I appeared to bind 0.43 ± 0.01 mol of atRA/mol of apoA-I in a manner that was stable for at least 6 h at 4 °C. To determine whether atRA could be recovered from holo-apoA-I and whether atRA was altered by its association with apoA-I, we extracted atRA from holo-apoA-I and determined its solvent partition characteristics by monitoring absorption spectra between 250 and 450 nm (Fig. 8C). Following extraction with hexane under alkaline conditions, no retinoid-like absorbance peaks were detected in either of the neutral lipid extractions (“neutral lipid 1” and “neutral lipid 2”), indicating that none of the bound atRA had been reduced (e.g. to retinol or retinal). After acidification of the aqueous ethanol phase by addition of HCl and re-extraction with hexane, all atRA was recovered in the hexane phase (“acidic lipid”). The slight red shift of the absorbance maxima to 355 nm for atRA observed in the acidic lipid fraction is characteristic of atRA in acidified ethanol (23Ross A.C. Adachi N. Goodman D.S. The binding protein for retinoic acid from rat testis cytosol: isolation and partial characterization.J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 100-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, atRA bound to apoA-I behaved as an acidic lipid as expected for atRA. Retinoic acid lacks intrinsic fluorescence but can quench inherent protein fluorescence due to energy transfer from tryptophan residues (24Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Binding affinities of retinol and related compounds to retinol binding proteins.Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9A). We exploited this effect to measure the binding affinities of atRA and other retinoic acid derivatives toward lipid-associated native apoA-I using a fluorescence assay that monitored quenching of protein fluorescence (Fig. 9B). Titration of 1.24 μm apoA-I with atRA yielded a Kdof 0.64 μm (R2 = 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.54, 0.79). All-trans-retinaldehyde displayed a lower affinity for apoA-I with an apparent Kd of 2.34 μm (R2 = 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.31, 10.83). Binding of 9-cis-retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid, and retinol to apoA-I (indicated by dashed lines) was too weak to calculate Kd values. We speculate that, in vivo, atRA and apoA-I are rapidly secreted from the choroid during visually guided ocular growth. To test whether apoA-I associates with atRA in vivo, we purified apoA-I from the conditioned medium of choroid organ cultures and evaluated the presence of bound atRA in holo-apoA-I by monitoring atRA fluorescence emission spectra following excitation at 350 nm (Fig. 10). To maximize the amount of atRA generated in organ culture, choroids were obtained from treated eyes of chicks following 5 days of recovery from induced myopia, a condition associated with increased choroidal atRA synthesis (9Mertz J.R.

Moreover, retinol (8 μm) and ketoconazole (10 μm) were added to the culture medium to promote atRA synthesis and inhibit atRA degradation in the conditioned medium (9Mertz J.R. Wallman J.

Following supplementation with NaBr, ultracentrifugation, and SDS-PAGE, an Mr 27,000 band could be detected in choroid-conditioned medium (CCM) from the upper 110 of the gradient but not in the middle 110 or lower 110, indicating the presence of lipid-associated apoA-I (Fig. 10A). No Mr 27,000 band could be detected from the gradient of recovering choroid tissue homogenate (Fig. 10A, Tissue), indicating that the majority of apoA-I was secreted into the medium during the organ culture. The uncorrected fluorescence spectra of the upper layer from CCM (containing apoA-I as the predominant protein) was obtained following desalting and buffer exchange to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (Fig. 10B). When excited at 340 nm, a peak of emission was recorded with a maximum at ∼474 nm with a less intense peak detected at 528 nm (CCM). A qualitatively similar spectrum was obtained for apoA-I previously incubated with 10 μm atRA. In contrast, lipid-associated native apoA-I in the absence of atRA displayed a maximum emission at 422 nm that gradually declined to background levels by 525 nm. atRA in the absence of protein lacked fluorescence. TaqMan real time quantitative PCR analyses indicated that choroidal gene expression of apoA-I was significantly increased in treated eyes following 4–15 days of recovery as compared with paired contralateral controls (*, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001, paired t test). ApoA-I gene expression was also elevated in 20-day recovering choroids compared with contralateral controls but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.069, paired t test). No significant differences were detected between control and treated eyes in choroids following 10 days of form deprivation (0 days of recovery) or following 1 day of recovery (Fig. 11B). Additionally, analyses of all control groups in Fig. 11B indicated a significant difference in choroidal apoA-I gene expression in the 4- and 20-day control groups (p <"

As Camtas can function as co-activators with NK2 proteins in other tissues, we explored the role of Camta1, Camta2, and Nkx2-2 in the regulation of the miR-212/miR-132 cluster and insulin secretion. We demonstrate that exposure of control Wistar or GK rat islets to 16.7 mm glucose increases miR-212/miR-132 expression but significantly less so in the GK rat.

https://openalex.org/W2468731349,"Many metabolic studies employ tissue-specific gene knockout mice, which requires breeding of floxed gene mice, available mostly on C57BL/6N (NN) genetic background, with cre or Flp recombinase-expressing mice, available on C57BL/6J (JJ) background, resulting in the generation of mixed C57BL/6NJ (NJ) genetic background mice. Recent awareness of many genetic differences between NN and JJ strains including the deletion of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (nnt), necessitates examination of the consequence of mixed NJ background on glucose tolerance, beta cell function and other metabolic parameters. Male mice with NN and NJ genetic background were fed with normal or high fat diets (HFD) for 12 weeks and glucose and insulin homeostasis were studied. Genotype had no effect on body weight and food intake in mice fed normal or high fat diets. Insulinemia in the fed and fasted states and after a glucose challenge was lower in HFD-fed NJ mice, even though their glycemia and insulin sensitivity were similar to NN mice. NJ mice showed mild glucose intolerance. Moreover, glucose- but not KCl-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets was decreased in HFD-fed NJ vs NN mice without changes in insulin content and beta cell mass. Under normal diet, besides reduced fed insulinemia, NN and NJ mice presented similar metabolic parameters. However, HFD-fed NJ mice displayed lower fed and fasted insulinemia and glucose-induced insulin secretion in vivo and ex vivo, as compared to NN mice. These results strongly caution against using unmatched mixed genetic background C57BL/6 mice for comparisons, particularly under HFD conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2466700753,"Protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR4) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for thrombin and is proteolytically activated, similar to the prototypical PAR1. Due to the irreversible activation of PAR1, receptor trafficking is intimately linked to signal regulation. However, unlike PAR1, the mechanisms that control PAR4 trafficking are not known. Here, we sought to define the mechanisms that control PAR4 trafficking and signaling. In HeLa cells depleted of clathrin by siRNA, activated PAR4 failed to internalize. Consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, expression of a dynamin dominant-negative K44A mutant also blocked activated PAR4 internalization. However, unlike most GPCRs, PAR4 internalization occurred independently of β-arrestins and the receptor's C-tail domain. Rather, we discovered a highly conserved tyrosine-based motif in the third intracellular loop of PAR4 and found that the clathrin adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) is important for internalization. Depletion of AP-2 inhibited PAR4 internalization induced by agonist. In addition, mutation of the critical residues of the tyrosine-based motif disrupted agonist-induced PAR4 internalization. Using Dami megakaryocytic cells, we confirmed that AP-2 is required for agonist-induced internalization of endogenous PAR4. Moreover, inhibition of activated PAR4 internalization enhanced ERK1/2 signaling, whereas Akt signaling was markedly diminished. These findings indicate that activated PAR4 internalization requires AP-2 and a tyrosine-based motif and occurs independent of β-arrestins, unlike most classical GPCRs. Moreover, these findings are the first to show that internalization of activated PAR4 is linked to proper ERK1/2 and Akt activation."
https://openalex.org/W2471030523,"Translocation can reduce extinction risk by increasing population size and geographic range, and is increasingly being used in the management of rare and threatened plant species. A critical determinant of successful plant establishment is light environment. Wollemia nobilis (Wollemi pine) is a critically endangered conifer, with a wild population of 83 mature trees and a highly restricted distribution of less than 10 km2. We used under-planting to establish a population of W. nobilis in a new rainforest site. Because its optimal establishment conditions were unknown, we conducted an experimental translocation, planting in a range of different light conditions from deeply shaded to high light gaps. Two years after the experimental translocation, 85% of plants had survived. There were two distinct responses: very high survival (94%) but very low growth, and lower survival (69%) and higher growth, associated with initial plant condition. Overall survival of translocated W. nobilis was strongly increased in planting sites with higher light, in contrast to previous studies demonstrating long-term survival of wild W. nobilis juveniles in deep shade. Translocation by under-planting may be useful in establishing new populations of shade-tolerant plant species, not least by utilizing the range of light conditions that occur in forest understories."

A novel function of the human CLS1 in phosphatidylglycerol synthesis and remodeling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but there is no report of it in yeast. Thus, the enzymes responsible for PG remodeling in yeast remain to be identified. Several studies have shown that CL is very important for mitochondrial function and growth on different carbon sources (17Beranek A. Rechberger G. Knauer H. Wolinski H. Kohlwein S.D. Leber R.

Chem. 2014; 289: 3114-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The growth defect is more pronounced at higher temperatures because CL is required to maintain the mitochondrial DNA and other important cellular functions (13Jiang F. Ryan M.T. Schlame M. Zhao M. Gu Z. Klingenberg M. Pfanner N. Greenberg M.L. Absence of cardiolipin in the crd1 null mutant results in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced mitochondrial function.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22387-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Defects in PE and CL metabolism cause mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we report that Yor022c, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial protein (20Reinders J. Zahedi R.P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Sickmann A. Toward the complete yeast mitochondrial proteome: multidimensional separation techniques for mitochondrial proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1543-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) of the iPLA1 family, is a novel mitochondrial phospholipase that hydrolyzes important mitochondrial phospholipids. Yor022c is a DDHD domain-containing serine hydrolase named Ddl1 (DDHD domain-containing lipase 1) that plays roles in CL, PE, and PG remodeling. We also suggest that Ddl1 has roles in CL degradation. In addition, we show that the DDL1 gene is antagonistically regulated by Aft1 and Aft2 transcription factors. Ddl1 is a DDHD domain-containing protein that belongs to the iPLA1 family of proteins. A list of homologs of the iPLA1 family is available on the UniProtKB database. A sequence comparison was performed between selected members of the family that contained two conserved regions: the lipase motif (GXSXG) and the DDHD domain. An analysis of the sequences in the PROSITE database showed that the lipase motif is present inside the PROSITE domain PS00120 consensus sequence LIV-KG-LIVFY-LIVMST-G-HYWV-S-YAG-G-GSTAC, where the underlined amino acids are not accepted at a given position. In some family members, the lipase consensus sequence (GXSXG) was replaced by the SXSXG sequence. In Ddl1, the lipase motif spanned amino acids 499 to 503, whereas the DDHD domain spanned amino acids 519 to 700 (Fig. 1A). As reported previously (1Lev S. The role of the Nir/rdgB protein family in membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton remodeling.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), DDHD domain-containing proteins play an important role in phospholipid metabolism. Therefore, we analyzed the phospholipid profiles of the ddl1Δ strain. The cells were grown in their respective media with 0.2 μCi of [14C]acetate/ml. The lipids were extracted from stationary-phase cells and resolved on a silica-thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate followed by phosphorimaging. The ddl1Δ strain did not show a significant change in the PA content compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B). The deletion of the DDL1 gene resulted in an increase (∼21%) in the CL content in the cells, whereas the ddl1Δ strain did not show a substantial change in the content of other phospholipids (Fig. 1C). We also analyzed the phospholipid content of the important deletion strains in the CL metabolism (Fig. 1C). The CLD1 gene encodes the known cardiolipin-specific phospholipase, whereas the CRD1gene encodes cardiolipin synthase. Gep4 is a phosphatase required for PG synthesis, and Taz1 is a transacylase required for CL remodeling. The CL-deficient and PG-rich crd1Δ strain was used as a negative control for CL and as a positive control for PG. The gep4Δ strain was used as a negative control for both CL and PG. The crd1Δ cells grown on glucose showed an accumulation of PG (1.79 ± 0.07% of the total phospholipids), which was confirmed using three different TLC solvent systems (solvent systems 1, 2, and 3). The cellular PA content did not change significantly upon overexpression of the DDL1 gene (data not shown). Overexpression of the DDL1 gene caused a significant decrease (∼22%) in the cellular CL content on the ddl1Δ and (∼33%) wild-type backgrounds compared with the vector control (Fig. 1D), whereas the PE content was elevated by ∼16% on the ddl1Δ background and ∼23% on the wild-type background (Fig. 1E). We also checked the effect of DDL1 overexpression on the cellular content of the PG, an important intermediate of the CL biosynthesis. The cellular PG content did not change significantly upon overexpression of the DDL1 gene on the crd1Δ background (data not shown). The TLC analyses of the deletion and overexpression studies suggested that the DDL1 gene may have a potential role in the phospholipid metabolism. To validate the role of the DDL1 gene in phospholipid metabolism, we conducted a phospholipase activity assay using recombinant Ddl1 protein. Prior to the assays, the recombinant Ddl1 protein was purified from the yeast using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) column chromatography and confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). All of the assays were conducted in the presence of the purified recombinant Ddl1 protein. The phospholipase assays with different fluorescently tagged phospholipids and native phospholipids showed that Ddl1 hydrolyzes CL, PE, and PG as substrates. Phospholipase activity was measured under different assay conditions. The protein-dependent (Fig. 2B) and time-dependent (Fig. 2C) lipase activity of Ddl1 was measured using fluorescently tagged CL, PE, and PG. The assays showed a protein- and time-dependent increase in the phospholipase activity. Similarly, pH-dependent and temperature-dependent assays were also conducted. Greater activity was observed at pH 8.5 and at 25 °C (data not shown). The phospholipase activity of Ddl1 was measured using the native phospholipids (CL, PE, and PG) as substrates. The phospholipase activity of Ddl1 was higher for CL compared with PE and PG (Fig. 3A). PLA1 activity toward the C18:1-, C18:0-, and C16:0-containing substrates (PE and PG) was not significantly different (Fig. 3B). Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted to evaluate the role of the GXSXG motif in lipase activity. The predicted amino acid residues Gly-499, Ser-501, and Gly-503 were replaced with alanine. The recombinant mutant Ddl1 proteins were purified from the yeast, similar to the wild-type Ddl1 protein. Mutations in the GXSXG motif (Gly to Ala) caused a significant reduction in the lipase activity of the protein, whereas the Ser to Ala mutation completely abolished the activity (Fig. 3C). Inoue et al. (4Inoue H. Baba T. Sato S. Ohtsuki R. Takemori A. Watanabe T. Tagaya M. Tani K. Roles of SAM and DDHD domains in mammalian intracellular phospholipase A1 KIAA0725p.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have suggested that the DDHD domain is crucial for the PLA1 activity. Therefore, to check the effect of the DDHD domain on the phospholipase activity of the Ddl1, we created a DDHD domain deletion protein (truncated Ddl1). Like wild-type Ddl1, the truncated Ddl1 protein was purified, and the phospholipase activity assays were performed. The data indicated that the DDHD domain deletion significantly reduced the phospholipase activity of the Ddl1 (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these experiments suggested that Ddl1 is a novel phospholipase that uses key mitochondrial membrane lipids as substrates. Phospholipase assays revealed that Ddl1 hydrolyzes CL, PE, and PG. Therefore we checked the effect of the Ddl1 on molecular species of its substrates using the MS/MSALL technique. An analysis of the molecular species of CL revealed that the C64 to C68 clusters harbored the majority of the CL species, as reported previously (21Gu Z. Valianpour F. Chen S. Vaz F.M. Hakkaart G.A. Wanders R.J. Greenberg M.L. Aberrant cardiolipin metabolism in the yeast taz1 mutant: a model for Barth syndrome.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The major CL molecular species clusters (CL C64 to C68) were grouped into two groups, the more unsaturated group (MUG) and the less unsaturated group (LUG). The deletion of the DDL1 gene significantly altered the profile of the CL species (Fig. 4A). In the ddl1Δ strain, the CL species with saturated fatty acids (LUG) were increased at the expense of the CL species with unsaturated fatty acids (MUG). We also analyzed the CL species of cld1Δ and taz1Δ strains because the CLD1 and TAZ1 genes play an important role in CL remodeling (Fig. 4A). DDL1 overexpression did not significantly affect the molecular species of CL in the cld1Δ strain, but it caused an increase in the CL species with unsaturated fatty acids (MUG) at the expense of the CL species with saturated fatty acids (LUG) on the ddl1Δ background (Fig. 4B). In contrast, DDL1 overexpression on the wild-type background increased the CL species with saturated fatty acids (LUG) at the expense of the CL species with unsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 4B). A comparison of the ddl1Δ, and wild-type strains showed that there was a relative increase in the C32:0 and a decrease in the C32:1 species of PE (Fig. 4C). An analysis of DDL1 overexpression on the ddl1Δ background showed that there was an increase in the C34:2 species of PE (Fig. 4D). DDL1 overexpression on the crd1Δ background caused a significant increase in the C34:2 and C34:1 species of PG at the expense of the C32:1 and C32:0 species (Fig. 4E). We also analyzed the effect of the DDL1 gene on the molecular species of other phospholipids. The analysis showed that like with PE and PG, the C32 and C34 clusters harbored the majority of the PA, PC, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS), species, as reported previously (22Schneiter R. Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Zellnig G. Leber A. Lampl M. Athenstaedt K. Hrastnik C. Eder S. Daum G. Paltauf F. Wieland F.T. Kohlwein S.D. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis of the lipid molecular species composition of yeast subcellular membranes reveals acyl chain-based sorting/remodeling of distinct molecular species en route to the plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The comparative analysis showed that the DDL1 deletion and overexpression altered the molecular species profile of PA and PS (Fig. 5, A–D). In the ddl1Δ strain, the molecular species of PC and PI were altered, but DDL1 overexpression did not change the molecular species of these phospholipids (Fig. 5, E–H). These changes could be due to the indirect effect of the DDL1 gene, as Ddl1 did not show lipase activity toward these phospholipids. Together, the phospholipase assays and the phospholipids analyses of the deletion and overexpression studies suggested that the DDL1 gene may have a potential role in the CL metabolism. To identify the transcription factor that putatively binds the upstream promoter region of the DDL1 gene, we searched the Yeastract promoter database of S. cerevisiae, which provided us with 23 different transcription factors. However, none of them are directly involved in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Recently, Berthelet et al. (23Berthelet S. Usher J. Shulist K. Hamza A. Maltez N. Johnston A. Fong Y. Harris L.J. Baetz K. Functional genomics analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae iron-responsive transcription factor Aft1 reveals iron-independent functions.Genetics. 2010; 185: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that the AFT1 gene has iron-independent functions and affects mitochondrial function. Therefore, we selected Aft1 and its paralog, Aft2, both of which bind at the same sequence (Fig. 6A). First, we examined the expression of the DDL1 gene on the aft1Δ and aft2Δ backgrounds. The AFT1 deletion caused an increase in the expression of the DDL1 transcripts, whereas the AFT2 deletion caused a decrease in the level of the DDL1 transcripts. AFT2 was up-regulated (8.87-fold) in the aft1Δ strain, and AFT1 was up-regulated 7.46-fold in the aft2Δ strain (Fig. 6B). Compared with the vector control, AFT1 overexpression caused a slight down-regulation of the DDL1 transcripts, whereas AFT2 overexpression up-regulated (∼12-fold) the expression of the DDL1 gene (Fig. 6C). To assess the transcriptional regulation of the DDL1 gene by Aft1/2 in vivo, the β-galactosidase activity of DDL1-lacZ was measured in the WT, aft1Δ, and aft2Δ strains. The β-galactosidase activity of the aft1Δ strain was significantly higher (∼37%), and that of the aft2Δ strain was lower (∼52%) than the wild-type strain (Fig. 6D). These results suggested that Aft1 negatively regulates DDL1 expression, whereas Aft2 positively regulates its expression. It has been shown that Aft1 and Aft2 bind a conserved iron-responsive element (Fe-RE) site present in the promoters of their gene targets. Fe-RE binding sites consist of a CACCC core sequence (24Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Winge D.R. Aft1p and Aft2p mediate iron-responsive gene expression in yeast through related promoter elements.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27636-27643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to assess the in vivo binding of Aft1/2 to the DDL1 promoter. The ChIP assays revealed that both Aft1 and Aft2 occupy the DDL1 promoter (Fig. 6E). To confirm the binding of Aft1/2 to the DDL1 promoter, gel shift assays were performed using the bacterially expressed and purified recombinant Aft1/2 proteins. The proteins were purified by Ni2+-NTA column chromatography. We were able to purify Aft2 protein, but the Aft1 protein was only partially purified (Fig. 7A). As the amount of protein increased, a decrease in the free DNA and an increase in the formation of the DNA-protein complex were observed (Fig. 7, B and C). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) conducted in the presence of an anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Ab) showed stronger DNA-protein complex formation. Fe2+ prevented Aft1/2 binding (Fig. 7D). Together, the data from the expression analysis, β-galactosidase activity assays, ChIP assays, and gel shift assays suggested that Aft1 and Aft2 antagonistically regulate DDL1 gene. It was reported previously that the Ddl1 protein is localized in the mitochondria (20Reinders J. Zahedi R.P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Sickmann A. Toward the complete yeast mitochondrial proteome: multidimensional separation techniques for mitochondrial proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1543-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and we showed that it acts as a phospholipase that hydrolyzes the major mitochondrial phospholipids species. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the DDL1 gene on the mitochondria in the cells. Cells grown in stationary phase in synthetic minimal (SM) medium were collected and stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos followed by confocal microscopy. Microscopic imaging showed that alterations in CL metabolism produce mitochondrial dysfunction. The ddl1Δ strain showed a significant increase (69.46%) in fragmented mitochondria compared with the wild-type cells (24.87%). A similarly significant pattern was also observed in the other deletion strains in CL metabolism (Fig. 8A). Ye et al. (18Ye C. Lou W. Li Y. Chatzispyrou I.A. Hüttemann M. Lee I. Houtkooper R.H. Vaz F.M. Chen S. Greenberg M.L. Deletion of the cardiolipin-specific phospholipase Cld1 rescues growth and life span defects in the tafazzin mutant: implications for Barth syndrome.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 3114-3125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have shown that the deletion of CLD1 (the only known CL-specific phospholipase A2 in S. cerevisiae) on the taz1Δ background rescues the respiration defect of the mutant. Therefore, we also investigated the effect of the DDL1 and CLD1 deletions on the mitochondria in the taz1Δ strain. CLD1 deletion in the taz1Δ strain showed a significant reduction in the mitochondrial fragmentation pattern (53.93%) in comparison with the taz1Δ strain (79.65%), whereas the DDL1 deletion in the taz1Δ strain caused an increase (93.36%) in the fragmentation pattern (Fig. 8A). To understand the effects of CL-hydrolyzing phospholipases on mitochondrial function, we generated a triple deletion strain (RRY25, cld1Δddl1Δtaz1Δ) on the taz1Δ background. Interestingly, compared with the taz1Δ strain (79.65%), the triple mutant showed reduced (40.44%) mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 8A). DDL1 overexpression caused an increase (∼14% on the ddl1Δ background and ∼30% on the wild-type background) in the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 8B). The effect of DDL1 overexpression on the mitochondrial inner membrane potential was investigated with potentiometric JC-1 dye (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide). DDL1 overexpression caused a reduction (∼21% on the ddl1Δ background and ∼23% on the wild-type background) in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential of the cells (Fig. 8C). DDL1 overexpression caused a substantial reduction in the rate of oxygen consumption in the cells (Fig. 8D). We also examined the CL content in the double and triple mutants. Compared with the taz1Δ strain, the TLC analysis showed a substantial increase (∼51%) in the CL content of the triple mutant, whereas the CL contents of the ddl1Δtaz1Δ and cld1Δtaz1Δ strains were not significantly different (Fig. 9A). We also checked the molecular species profile of CL in the cld1Δddl1Δtaz1Δ strain, which showed no significant difference (Fig. 9B). The TLC data showed that compared with the taz1Δ strain, the cld1Δddl1Δtaz1Δ strain exhibited reduced monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) content (Fig. 9C). The ddl1Δ and cld1Δddl1Δ strains also showed a faintly detectable amount of MLCL, but MLCL was absent in the cld1Δ strain (data not shown). We also performed an expression analysis of the DDL1 and CLD1 genes on the taz1Δ background, which showed that the expression of these genes w"

Previous studies have shown that the encapsulation-dehydration cryopreservation methodology imposes no significant extra mutational load since embryos carrying high levels of genetic variability are selected against during protracted culture. Also, the use of secondary rather than primary somatic embryos has been shown to further reduce the incidence of genetic somaclonal variation. Here, the effect of in vitro conservation, cryopreservation and post-cryopreservation generation of somatic embryos on the appearance of epigenetic somaclonal variation were comparatively assessed. To achieve this we compared the epigenetic profiles, generated using Methylation Sensitive Amplified Polymorphisms, of leaves collected from the ortet tree and from cocoa somatic embryos derived from three in vitro conditions: somatic embryos, somatic embryos cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and somatic embryos generated from cryoproserved somatic embryos. Somatic embryos accumulated epigenetic changes but these were less extensive than in those regenerated after storage in LN. Furthermore, the passage of cryopreserved embryos through another embryogenic stage led to further increase in variation. Interestingly, this detected variability appears to be in some measure reversible. The outcome of this study indicates that the cryopreservation induced phenotypic variability could be, at least partially, due to DNA methylation changes. Key message: Phenotypic variability observed in cryostored cocoa somatic-embryos is epigenetic in nature. This variability is partially reversible, not stochastic in nature but a directed response to the in-vitro culture and cryopreservation."
https://openalex.org/W2470418555,"Gamma delta T-cells have been shown to be important to the early immunoinflammatory response to injury, independent of infection. This unique T-cell population acts to regulate cell trafficking and the release of cytokines and growth factors. We propose this sterile inflammatory response is in part associated with damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated by major injury, such as burn, and mediated via toll-like receptors (TLRs). It is unknown whether DAMPs can activate resident γδ T-cells that reside in skin.Gamma delta T-cells were isolated from the skin of male C57BL/6 mice by enzymatic digestion. Mitochondrial DAMPs (MTDs) were generated from mitochondria isolated from mouse livers by sonication and centrifugation. Dermal γδ T-cells were incubated with MTDs (0-500 μg/ml) for 24 hr and cells and supernatants were collected for analysis.MTDs activated dermal γδ T-cells, as evidenced by increased TLR2 and TLR4 expression following in vitro exposure. MTDs also induced the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6), and growth factors (PDGF and VEGF) by γδ T-cells.These findings herein support the concept that MTDs released after tissue/cellular injury are capable of activating dermal γδ T-cells. We propose that the activation of this unique T-cell population is central in the initiation of sterile inflammation and also contributes to the subsequent healing processes."
https://openalex.org/W2470957898,"The human omentum has been long regarded as a healing patch, used by surgeons for its ability to immunomodulate, repair and vascularise injured tissues. A major component of the omentum are mesothelial cells, which display some of the characteristics of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. For instance, lineage tracing studies have shown that mesothelial cells give rise to adipocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and human and rat mesothelial cells have been shown to differentiate into osteoblast- and adipocyte-like cells in vitro, indicating that they have considerable plasticity. However, so far, long-term cultures of mesothelial cells have not been successfully established due to early senescence. Here, we demonstrate that mesothelial cells isolated from the mouse omentum could be cultured for more than 30 passages. While epithelial markers were downregulated over passages in the mesothelial cells, their mesenchymal profile remained unchanged. Early passage mesothelial cells displayed clonogenicitiy, expressed several stem cell markers, and up to passage 5 and 13, respectively, could differentiate along the adipogenic and osteogenic lineages, demonstrating stem/progenitor characteristics and differentiation potential."

https://openalex.org/W2470878692,"NOS is the key component of the NO system, which plays an indispensable role in many physiologic and immunologic processes; however, the process that underlies the activation of ancient NOSs and their functions remains unclear. Expression of Crassostrea gigas NOS (CgNOS) mRNA in hemocytes was examined after stimulating oysters with LPS and TNF-α. Expression level of CgNOS mRNA was increased significantly, by 2.61-fold (P < 0.05), at 24 h poststimulation. A positive CgNOS signal was detected via immunoprecipitation, and only one protein was detected in oyster hemocytes. Shifting and supershifting bands were observed in EMSAs between the CgNOS promoter and the transcription factors CgNF-κB1 and Cg-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). CgNF-κB1 was detected in the nucleus only at 12 h, whereas CgSTAT was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus at 12 and 24 h. Expression levels of tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie-1, phosphatidylinositide phosphatase SAC2, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type-1α, diacylglycerol kinase θ, LPS-induced TNF-α factor-like protein, cAMP-dependent transcription factor-2, NF-κB1, and STAT6 were significantly elevated in a transcriptome analysis after 12 h of LPS and TNF-α stimulation. An immunoreactive CgNOS signal was observed in both the cell membrane and cytoplasm at 12 h, whereas it was mainly localized to the cytoplasm at 24 h post-LPS and -TNF-α stimulation. These findings revealed that CgNOS could be transcriptionally activated by CgNF-κB1 and CgSTAT via the PI3K-Akt pathway, similar to what occurs for iNOS, but CgNOS translocated to the cytoplasm, similar to neuronal NOS, to modulate downstream signals during an immune defense. These results collectively provide crucial knowledge about the evolution of NOS structure and function.-Jiang, Q., Liu, Z., Zhou, Z., Wang, L., Wang, L., Yue, F., Wang, J., Wang, H., Song, L.

https://openalex.org/W2463436753,"The true function of neuroglobin (Ngb) and, particularly, human Ngb (NGB) has been under debate since its discovery 15 years ago. It has been expected to play a role in oxygen binding/supply, but a variety of other functions have been put forward, including NO dioxygenase activity. However, in vitro studies that could unravel these potential roles have been hampered by the lack of an Ngb-specific reductase. In this work, we used electrochemical measurements to investigate the role of an intermittent internal disulfide bridge in determining NO oxidation kinetics at physiological NO concentrations. The use of a polarized electrode to efficiently interconvert the ferric (Fe3+) and ferrous (Fe2+) forms of an immobilized NGB showed that the disulfide bridge both defines the kinetics of NO dioxygenase activity and regulates appearance of the free ferrous deoxy-NGB, which is the redox active form of the protein in contrast to oxy-NGB. Our studies further identified a role for the distal histidine, interacting with the hexacoordinated iron atom of the heme, in oxidation kinetics. These findings may be relevant in vivo, for example, in blocking apoptosis by reduction of ferric cytochrome c, and gentle tuning of NO concentration in the tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2471311306,"Selective autophagy contributes to cellular homeostasis by delivering harmful material into the lysosomal system for degradation via vesicular intermediates referred to as autophagosomes. The cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway is a variant of selective autophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during which hydrolases such as prApe1 are transported into the vacuole. In general, selectivity is achieved by autophagic cargo receptors that link the cargo to autophagosomal membranes because of their ability to simultaneously interact with the cargo and Atg8 proteins that coat the membrane. The Atg19 receptor contains multiple Atg8 interaction sites in its C terminus in addition to a canonical Atg8-interacting LC3-interacting region (LIR, with LC3 being a homolog of Atg8) motif, but their mode of interaction with Atg8 is unclear. Here we show, using a combination of NMR, microscopy-based interaction assays, and prApe1 processing experiments, that two additional sites interact with Atg8 in a LIR-like and thus mutually exclusive manner. We term these motifs accessory LIR motifs because their affinities are lower than that of the canonical LIR motif. Thus, one Atg19 molecule has the ability to interact with multiple Atg8 proteins simultaneously, resulting in a high-avidity interaction that may confer specific binding to the Atg8-coated autophagosomal membrane on which Atg8 is concentrated.

Thus, one Atg19 molecule has the ability to interact with multiple Atg8 proteins simultaneously, resulting in a high-avidity interaction that may confer specific binding to the Atg8-coated autophagosomal membrane on which Atg8 is concentrated."
https://openalex.org/W2509049369,"The LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a large endocytic receptor that binds and mediates the endocytosis of numerous structurally diverse ligands. Currently, the basis for ligand recognition by LRP1 is not well understood. LRP1 requires a molecular chaperone, termed the receptor-associated protein (RAP), to escort the newly synthesized receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. RAP is a three-domain protein that contains the following two high affinity binding sites for LRP1: one is located within domains 1 and 2, and one is located in its third domain. Studies on the interaction of the RAP third domain with LRP1 reveal critical contributions by lysine 256 and lysine 270 for this interaction. From these studies, a model for ligand recognition by this class of receptors has been proposed. Here, we employed surface plasmon resonance to investigate the binding of RAP D1D2 to LRP1. Our results reveal that the high affinity of D1D2 for LRP1 results from avidity effects mediated by the simultaneous interactions of lysine 60 in D1 and lysine 191 in D2 with sites on LRP1 to form a bivalent D1D2-LRP1 complex. When lysine 60 and 191 are both mutated to alanine, the binding of D1D2 to LRP1 is ablated. Our data also reveal that D1D2 is able to bind to a second distinct site on LRP1 to form a monovalent complex. The studies confirm the canonical model for ligand recognition by this class of receptors, which is initiated by pairs of lysine residues that dock into acidic pockets on the receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2462783112,"Caspase-1 is a key player during the initiation of pro-inflammatory innate immune responses, activating pro-IL-1β in so-called inflammasomes. A subset of patients with recurrent febrile episodes and systemic inflammation of unknown origin harbor mutations in CASP1 encoding caspase-1. CASP1 variants result in reduced enzymatic activity of caspase-1 and impaired IL-1β secretion. The apparent paradox of reduced IL-1β secretion but systemic inflammation led to the hypothesis that CASP1 mutations may result in variable protein interaction clusters, thus activating alternative signaling pathways. To test this hypothesis, we established and characterized an in vitro system of transduced immortalized murine macrophages expressing either WT or enzymatically inactive (p.C284A) procaspase-1 fusion reporter proteins. Macrophages with variant p.C284A caspase-1 did not secrete IL-1β and exhibited reduced inflammatory cell death, referred to as pyroptosis. Caspase-1 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) formed cytosolic macromolecular complexes (so-called pyroptosomes) that were significantly increased in number and size in cells carrying the p.C284A caspase-1 variant compared with WT caspase-1. Furthermore, enzymatically inactive caspase-1 interacted with ASC longer and with increased intensity compared with WT caspase-1. Applying live cell imaging, we documented for the first time that pyroptosomes containing enzymatically inactive variant p.C284A caspase-1 spread during cell division. In conclusion, variant p.C284A caspase-1 stabilizes pyroptosome formation, potentially enhancing inflammation by two IL-1β-independent mechanisms: pyroptosomes convey an enhanced inflammatory stimulus through the recruitment of additional proteins (such as RIP2, receptor interacting protein kinase 2), which is further amplified through pyroptosome and cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2467860101,"Previous studies have demonstrated that cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen (HKa) induces endothelial apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis and have suggested that this occurs through inhibition of Src family kinases. This study assessed the role of tyrosine–protein kinase Lck (p56/Lck) in this pathway. We analyzed early events leading to apoptosis of human endothelial cells exposed to HKa. The role of p56/Lck was investigated using short interfering (si) RNA knockdown and lentivirus expression in assays of endothelial tube formation, sprouting of neovessels from murine aorta, and angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs. HKa stimulated expression and phosphorylation of p56/Lck. siRNA knockdown of p56/Lck promoted endothelial proliferation and blocked HKa-induced apoptosis and activation of p53, Bax, and Bak. Lentivirus expression of p56/Lck in endothelial cells induced apoptosis and blocked tube formation. Expression of p56/Lck in murine aortic rings blocked sprouting angiogenesis. Lentivirus expressing p56/Lck blocked angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs, while p56/Lck short hairpin RNA inhibited the antiangiogenic effect of HKa. Scrambled siRNAs and empty lentiviral vectors were used in all experiments. Apoptosis of proliferating endothelial cells and inhibition of angiogenesis by HKa requires p56/Lck. This suggests a novel role for p56/Lck in regulation of endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis.—Betapudi, V., Shukla, M., Alluri, R., Merkulov, S., McCrae, K. R.

The relative amounts of pzX produced can be manipulated by specific nutrients in the medium, but rich medium appears to suppress pzX formation. pzX has the following unique characteristics: a surfactant property that lowers surface tension, a cell/spore antiaggregant, and an adherence property that increases spores binding to surfaces. pzX in Bacillus could represent a trait shared by many spore-producing microorganisms.

Angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) is a secreted factor that induces tissue inflammation by attracting and activating macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines in chronic inflammation-associated diseases such as obesity-associated metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we asked whether and how ANGPTL2 activates macrophages in the innate immune response. ANGPTL2 was predominantly expressed in proinflammatory mouse bone marrow-derived differentiated macrophages (GM-BMMs) following GM-CSF treatment relative to anti-inflammatory cells (M-BMMs) established by M-CSF treatment. Expression of the proinflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-12p35, and IL-12p40 significantly decreased in GM-BMMs from Angptl2-deficient compared with wild-type (WT) mice, suggestive of attenuated proinflammatory activity. We also report that ANGPTL2 inflammatory signaling is transduced through integrin α5β1 rather than through paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B. Interestingly, Angptl2-deficient mice were more susceptible to infection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium than were WT mice. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO) production by Angptl2-deficient GM-BMMs was significantly lower than in WT GM-BMMs. Collectively, our findings suggest that macrophage-derived ANGPTL2 promotes an innate immune response in those cells by enhancing proinflammatory activity and NO production required to fight infection.

https://openalex.org/W2462507877,"We present a model that generalizes the apparent volume of distribution and half-life as functions of time following intravenous bolus injection. This generalized model defines a time varying apparent volume of drug distribution. The half-lives of drug remaining in the body vary in time and become longer as time elapses, eventually converging to the terminal half-life. Two example fit models were substituted into the general model: biexponential models from the least relative concentration error, and gamma variate models using adaptive regularization for least relative error of clearance. Using adult population parameters from 41 studies of the renal glomerular filtration marker 169Yb-DTPA, simulations of extracellular fluid volumes of 5, 10, 15 and 20 litres and plasma clearances of 40 and 100 ml/min were obtained. Of these models, the adaptively obtained gamma variate models had longer times to 95% of terminal volume and longer half-lives."
https://openalex.org/W2463237149,"Vocalizing behavior of frogs and toads, once quantified, is useful for systematics, rapid species identification, behavioral experimentation and conservation monitoring. But yet, for many lineages vocalizations remain unknown or poorly quantified, especially in diversity rich tropical regions. Here we provide a quantitative acoustical analysis for all four Sri Lankan congeners of the genus Microhyla. Three of these species are endemic to the island, but Microhyla ornata is regionally widespread. Two of these endemics, M. karunaratnei (Critically Endangered) and M. zeylanica (Endangered), are highly threatened montane isolates; the other, M. mihintalei, is relatively common across the dry lowlands. We recorded and analyzed 100 advertisement calls from five calling males for each species, except for M. zeylanica, which only had 53 calls from three males suitable for analyses. All four species call in choruses and their vocal repertoires are simple compared to most frogs. Their calls contain multiple pulses and no frequency modulation. We quantified eight call characters. Call duration and number of pulses were higher for the two montane isolates (inhabiting cooler habitats at higher altitudes) compared to their lowland congeners. Microhyla zeylanica has the longest call duration (of 1.8 ± 0.12 s) and the highest number of pulses (of 61–92 pulses). The smallest of the species, Microhyla karunaratnei (16.2–18.3 mm), has the highest mean dominant frequency (3.3 ± 0.14 kHz) and pulse rate (77 ± 5.8 pulses per second). The calls separate well in the Principal Component space: PC1 axis is mostly explained by the number of pulses per call and call duration; PC2 is mostly explained by the pulse rate. A canonical means plot of a Discriminant Function analysis shows non-overlapping 95% confidence ellipses. This suggests that some call parameters can be used to distinguish these species effectively. We provide detailed descriptions for eight call properties and compare these with congeners for which data is available. This work provides a foundation for comparative bioacoustic analyses and species monitoring while facilitating the systematics of Microhyla across its range."

Since breast cancer comprises heterogeneous intrinsic subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes we investigated the pivotal role of NDRG2 in basal-type breast cancers. Based on subtype classified tumor (n = 45) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 17) we examined NDRG2 mRNA expression and CpG-hypermethylation, whose significance was further validated by independent data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition, NDRG2 protein expression was evaluated immunohistochemically using a tissue micro array (TMA, n = 211). In vitro, we investigated phenotypic effects caused by NDRG2 silencing in the basal A-like HCC1806 as well as NDRG2 over-expression in basal A-like BT20 compared to luminal-type MCF7 breast cancer cells. Our tissue collections demonstrated an overall low NDRG2 mRNA expression in breast cancer subtypes compared to normal breast tissue in line with an increased CpG-hypermethylation in breast cancer tissue. Independent TCGA data sets verified a significant (P<0.001) expression loss of NDRG2 in breast tumors. Of interest, basal-like tumors more frequently retained abundant NDRG2 expression concordant with a lower CpG-hypermethylation. Unexpectedly, basal-like breast cancer revealed an association of NDRG2 expression with unfavorable patients' outcome. In line with this observation, in vitro experiments demonstrated reduced proliferation and migration rates (~20%) in HCC1806 cells following NDRG2 silencing. In contrast, NDRG2 over-expressing luminal-type MCF7 cells demonstrated a 26% decreased proliferation rate. Until now, this is the first study investigating the putative role of NDRG2 in depth in basal-type breast cancer. Our data indicate that the described putative tumor suppressive function of NDRG2 may be confined to luminal- and basal B-type breast cancers."

Surface plasmon resonance binding data showed that FBLN1 binds tightly to FGF8 and prevents its enzymatic degradation by ADAM17. Moreover, overexpression of FBLN1 up-regulates FGF8 gene expression, and down-regulation of FBLN1 by siRNA inhibits FGF8 expression. The generation of a double mutant Fbln1 and Fgf8 mice (Fbln1−/− and Fgf8−/−) showed that haplo-insufficiency (Fbln1+/− and Fgf8+/−) resulted in increased embryonic mortality compared with single heterozygote crosses. The mortality of the FGF8/Fbln1 double heterozygote embryos occurred between 14.5 and 16.5 days post-coitus.

https://openalex.org/W2461836879,"Reproductive tract tumours, specifically leiomyoma, are commonly found in female rhinoceroses. Similar to humans, tumour growth in rhinoceroses is thought to be sex hormone dependent. Tumours can form and expand from the onset of ovarian activity at puberty until the cessation of sex-steroid influences at senescence. Extensive tumour growth results in infertility. The aim of this study was to down regulate reproductive function of tumour-diseased and infertile females to stop further tumour growth using a Gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF) vaccine. Four infertile southern white (Ceratotherium simum simum) and three Greater one-horned rhinoceroses (rhinoceros unicornis) with active ovaries and 2.7 ± 0.9 and 14.0 ± 1.5 reproductive tract tumours respectively were vaccinated against GnRF (Improvac®, Zoetis, Germany) at 0, 4 and 16 weeks and re-boostered every 6-8 months thereafter. After GnRF vaccination ovarian and luteal activity was suppressed in all treated females. Three months after vaccination the size of the ovaries, the number of follicles and the size of the largest follicle were significantly reduced (P<0.03). Reproductive tract tumours decreased significantly in diameter (Greater-one horned rhino: P<0.0001; white rhino: P<0.01), presumably as a result of reduced sex-steroid influence. The calculated tumour volumes were reduced by 50.8 ± 10.9% in Greater one-horned and 48.6 ± 12.9% in white rhinoceroses. In conclusion, GnRF vaccine effectively down regulated reproductive function and decreased the size of reproductive tract tumours in female rhinoceros. Our work is the first to use down regulation of reproductive function as a symptomatic treatment against benign reproductive tumour disease in a wildlife species. Nonetheless, full reversibility and rhinoceros fertility following GnRF vaccination warrants further evaluation."

We examine this issue by way of the model protein Gloeobacter violaceous ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) using computational molecular dynamics, with a coarse-grained model to enhance sampling. We find that in flooding simulations, both propofol and a generic particle localize to the crystallographic transmembrane anesthetic binding region, and that propofol also localizes to an extracellular region shared with the crystallographic ketamine binding site. Subsequent simulations to probe these binding modes in greater detail demonstrate that ligand binding induces structural asymmetry in GLIC. Consequently, we employ residue interaction correlation analysis to describe the internal allosteric network underlying the coupling of ligand and distant effector sites necessary for conformational change. Overall, the results suggest that the same allosteric network may underlie the actions of various anesthetics, regardless of binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2472506606,"Background HIV Elite Controllers may reveal insights into virus persistence given they harbour small reservoir sizes, akin to HIV non-controllers treated early with combination antiretroviral therapy. Both groups of patients represent the most promising candidates for interventions aimed at sustained remission or ‘cure’. Analytic treatment interruption (ATI) in the latter group leads to stochastic rebound of virus, though it is unclear whether loss of elite control is also associated with similar rebound characteristics. Methods We studied three discrete periods of virus rebound during myeloma related immune disruption over 2.5 years in an elite controller who previously underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in the absence of any antiretroviral therapy. Single genome sequencing of the V1-V4 region of env in PBMC and plasma was performed and phylogenies reconstructed. Average pairwise distance (APD) was calculated and non-parametric methods used to assess compartmentalisation. Coreceptor usage was predicted based on genotypic algorithms. Results 122 single genome sequences were obtained (median 26 sequences per rebound). The initial rebounding plasma env sequences following ASCT represented two distinct lineages, and clustered with proviral DNA sequences isolated prior to ASCT. One of the lineages was monophyletic, possibly indicating reactivation from clonally expanded cells. The second rebound occurred 470 days after spontaneous control of the first rebound and was phylogenetically distinct from the first, confirmed by compartmentalisation analysis, with a different cellular origin rather than ongoing replication. By contrast, third rebound viruses clustered with second rebound viruses, with evidence for ongoing evolution that was associated with lymphopenia and myeloma progression. Following ASCT a shift in tropism from CXCR4-tropic viruses to a CCR5-tropic population was observed to persist through to the third rebound. Conclusions Our data highlight similarities in the viral reservoir between elite and non-controllers undergoing ATI following allogeneic transplantation. The lack of propagation of CXCR4 using viruses following transplantation warrants further study."

In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the landscape of Italian Postgraduate Schools in Medical Oncology, the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) undertook an online survey, inviting all the residents to describe their daily activities and to express their overall satisfaction about their programs. Methods A team composed of five residents and three consultants in medical oncology prepared a 38 items questionnaire that was published online in a reserved section, accessible through a link sent by e-mail. Residents were invited to anonymously fill in the questionnaire that included the following sub-sections: quality of teaching, clinical and research activity, overall satisfaction. Results Three-hundred and eleven (57%) out of 547 invited residents filled in the questionnaire. Two-hundred and twenty-three (72%) participants declared that attending lessons was frequently difficult and 153 (49%) declared they did not gain substantial improvement in their knowledge from them. Fifty-five percent stated that they did not receive lessons on palliative care. Their overall judgment about didactic activity was low in 63% of the interviewed. The satisfaction for clinical activity was in 86% of cases good: 84% recognized that, during the training period, they acquired a progressive independence on patients' management. About research activity, the majority (79%) of participants in the survey was actively engaged in managing patients included in clinical trials but the satisfaction level for the involvement in research activities was quite low (54%). Overall, 246 residents (79%) gave a positive global judgment of their Medical Oncology Schools. Conclusions The landscape of Italian Postgraduate Schools in Medical Oncology is quite heterogeneous across the country. Some improvements in the organization of teaching and in the access to research opportunity are needed; the perception about clinical activity and the overall judgment of the programs are quite satisfactory."
