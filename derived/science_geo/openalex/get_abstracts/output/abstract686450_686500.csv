https://openalex.org/W4205652915,"Although liquid-solid interfaces are foundational in broad areas of science, characterizing this delicate interface remains inherently difficult because of shortcomings in existing tools to access liquid and solid phases simultaneously at the nanoscale. This leads to substantial gaps in our understanding of the structure and chemistry of key interfaces in battery systems. We adopt and modify a thin film vitrification method to preserve the sensitive yet critical interfaces in batteries at native liquid electrolyte environments to enable cryo–electron microscopy and spectroscopy. We report substantial swelling of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anode in various electrolytes. The swelling behavior is dependent on electrolyte chemistry and is highly correlated to battery performance. Higher degrees of SEI swelling tend to exhibit poor electrochemical cycling."
https://openalex.org/W4220829301,"Understanding broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus antibody responses is key to developing countermeasures against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and future zoonotic sarbecoviruses. We describe the isolation and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody, designated S2K146, that broadly neutralizes viruses belonging to SARS-CoV– and SARS-CoV-2–related sarbecovirus clades, which use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor. Structural and functional studies show that most of the virus residues that directly bind S2K146 are also involved in binding to ACE2. This allows the antibody to potently inhibit receptor attachment. S2K146 protects against SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant challenge in hamsters, and viral passaging experiments reveal a high barrier for emergence of escape mutants, making it a good candidate for clinical development. The conserved ACE2-binding residues present a site of vulnerability that might be leveraged for developing vaccines eliciting broad sarbecovirus immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4205590923,"Abstract Maternal morbidity and mortality continue to rise, and pre-eclampsia is a major driver of this burden 1 . Yet the ability to assess underlying pathophysiology before clinical presentation to enable identification of pregnancies at risk remains elusive. Here we demonstrate the ability of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) to reveal patterns of normal pregnancy progression and determine the risk of developing pre-eclampsia months before clinical presentation. Our results centre on comprehensive transcriptome data from eight independent prospectively collected cohorts comprising 1,840 racially diverse pregnancies and retrospective analysis of 2,539 banked plasma samples. The pre-eclampsia data include 524 samples (72 cases and 452 non-cases) from two diverse independent cohorts collected 14.5 weeks (s.d., 4.5 weeks) before delivery. We show that cfRNA signatures from a single blood draw can track pregnancy progression at the placental, maternal and fetal levels and can robustly predict pre-eclampsia, with a sensitivity of 75% and a positive predictive value of 32.3% (s.d., 3%), which is superior to the state-of-the-art method 2 . cfRNA signatures of normal pregnancy progression and pre-eclampsia are independent of clinical factors, such as maternal age, body mass index and race, which cumulatively account for less than 1% of model variance. Further, the cfRNA signature for pre-eclampsia contains gene features linked to biological processes implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W4205345182,"The Drosophila brain is a frequently used model in neuroscience. Single-cell transcriptome analysis1–6, three-dimensional morphological classification7 and electron microscopy mapping of the connectome8,9 have revealed an immense diversity of neuronal and glial cell types that underlie an array of functional and behavioural traits in the fly. The identities of these cell types are controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs), involving combinations of transcription factors that bind to genomic enhancers to regulate their target genes. Here, to characterize GRNs at the cell-type level in the fly brain, we profiled the chromatin accessibility of 240,919 single cells spanning 9 developmental timepoints and integrated these data with single-cell transcriptomes. We identify more than 95,000 regulatory regions that are used in different neuronal cell types, of which 70,000 are linked to developmental trajectories involving neurogenesis, reprogramming and maturation. For 40 cell types, uniquely accessible regions were associated with their expressed transcription factors and downstream target genes through a combination of motif discovery, network inference and deep learning, creating enhancer GRNs. The enhancer architectures revealed by DeepFlyBrain lead to a better understanding of neuronal regulatory diversity and can be used to design genetic driver lines for cell types at specific timepoints, facilitating their characterization and manipulation. A chromatin accessibility atlas of 240,919 cells in the adult and developing Drosophila brain reveals 95,000 enhancers, which are integrated in cell-type specific enhancer gene regulatory networks and decoded into combinations of functional transcription factor binding sites using deep learning."
https://openalex.org/W4206174975,"India’s national COVID death totals remain undetermined. Using an independent nationally representative survey of 0.14 million (M) adults, we compared COVID mortality during the 2020 and 2021 viral waves to expected all-cause mortality. COVID constituted 29% (95%CI 28-31%) of deaths from June 2020-July 2021, corresponding to 3.2M (3.1-3.4) deaths, of which 2.7M (2.6-2.9) occurred in April-July 2021 (when COVID doubled all-cause mortality). A sub-survey of 57,000 adults showed similar temporal increases in mortality with COVID and non-COVID deaths peaking similarly. Two government data sources found that, when compared to pre-pandemic periods, all-cause mortality was 27% (23-32%) higher in 0.2M health facilities and 26% (21-31%) higher in civil registration deaths in ten states; both increases occurred mostly in 2021. The analyses find that India’s cumulative COVID deaths by September 2021 were 6-7 times higher than reported officially."
https://openalex.org/W4205900198,"Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for an increasing number of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant infections1,2. The bacterial natural product colistin is considered the last line of defence against a number of Gram-negative pathogens. The recent global spread of the plasmid-borne mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 (phosphoethanolamine transferase) threatens the usefulness of colistin3. Bacteria-derived antibiotics often appear in nature as collections of similar structures that are encoded by evolutionarily related biosynthetic gene clusters. This structural diversity is, at least in part, expected to be a response to the development of natural resistance, which often mechanistically mimics clinical resistance. Here we propose that a solution to mcr-1-mediated resistance might have evolved among naturally occurring colistin congeners. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced bacterial genomes identified a biosynthetic gene cluster that was predicted to encode a structurally divergent colistin congener. Chemical synthesis of this structure produced macolacin, which is active against Gram-negative pathogens expressing mcr-1 and intrinsically resistant pathogens with chromosomally encoded phosphoethanolamine transferase genes. These Gram-negative bacteria include extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and intrinsically colistin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which, owing to a lack of effective treatment options, are considered among the highest level threat pathogens4. In a mouse neutropenic infection model, a biphenyl analogue of macolacin proved to be effective against extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii with colistin-resistance, thus providing a naturally inspired and easily produced therapeutic lead for overcoming colistin-resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4220836693,"Strong electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can have a profound influence on the electronic properties of materials. We examine their combined influence on a 2-dimensional electronic system at the atomic interface between magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and a tungsten diselenide crystal. Strong electron correlation within the moiré flatband stabilizes correlated insulating states at both quarter and half filling, and SOC transforms these Mott-like insulators into ferromagnets, evidenced by robust anomalous Hall effect with hysteretic switching behavior. The coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom is demonstrated through the control of the magnetic order with an in-plane magnetic field, or a perpendicular electric field. Our findings establish an experimental knob to engineer topological properties of moiré bands in twisted bilayer graphene and related systems."
https://openalex.org/W4205280085,"Transcriptional and proteomic profiling of individual cells have revolutionized interpretation of biological phenomena by providing cellular landscapes of healthy and diseased tissues1,2. These approaches, however, do not describe dynamic scenarios in which cells continuously change their biochemical properties and downstream 'behavioural' outputs3-5. Here we used 4D live imaging to record tens to hundreds of morpho-kinetic parameters describing the dynamics of individual leukocytes at sites of active inflammation. By analysing more than 100,000 reconstructions of cell shapes and tracks over time, we obtained behavioural descriptors of individual cells and used these high-dimensional datasets to build behavioural landscapes. These landscapes recognized leukocyte identities in the inflamed skin and trachea, and uncovered a continuum of neutrophil states inside blood vessels, including a large, sessile state that was embraced by the underlying endothelium and associated with pathogenic inflammation. Behavioural screening in 24 mouse mutants identified the kinase Fgr as a driver of this pathogenic state, and interference with Fgr protected mice from inflammatory injury. Thus, behavioural landscapes report distinct properties of dynamic environments at high cellular resolution."
https://openalex.org/W4206645554,"During conversation, people take turns speaking by rapidly responding to their partners while simultaneously avoiding interruption1,2. Such interactions display a remarkable degree of coordination, as gaps between turns are typically about 200 milliseconds3-approximately the duration of an eyeblink4. These latencies are considerably shorter than those observed in simple word-production tasks, which indicates that speakers often plan their responses while listening to their partners2. Although a distributed network of brain regions has been implicated in speech planning5-9, the neural dynamics underlying the specific preparatory processes that enable rapid turn-taking are poorly understood. Here we use intracranial electrocorticography to precisely measure neural activity as participants perform interactive tasks, and we observe a functionally and anatomically distinct class of planning-related cortical dynamics. We localize these responses to a frontotemporal circuit centred on the language-critical caudal inferior frontal cortex10 (Broca's region) and the caudal middle frontal gyrus-a region not normally implicated in speech planning11-13. Using a series of motor tasks, we then show that this planning network is more active when preparing speech as opposed to non-linguistic actions. Finally, we delineate planning-related circuitry during natural conversation that is nearly identical to the network mapped with our interactive tasks, and we find this circuit to be most active before participant speech during unconstrained turn-taking. Therefore, we have identified a speech planning network that is central to natural language generation during social interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4206476713,"Abstract The DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) has a central role in non-homologous end joining, one of the two main pathways that detect and repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in humans 1,2 . DNA-PKcs is of great importance in repairing pathological DSBs, making DNA-PKcs inhibitors attractive therapeutic agents for cancer in combination with DSB-inducing radiotherapy and chemotherapy 3 . Many of the selective inhibitors of DNA-PKcs that have been developed exhibit potential as treatment for various cancers 4 . Here we report cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human DNA-PKcs natively purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, in complex with adenosine-5′-(γ-thio)-triphosphate (ATPγS) and four inhibitors (wortmannin, NU7441, AZD7648 and M3814), including drug candidates undergoing clinical trials. The structures reveal molecular details of ATP binding at the active site before catalysis and provide insights into the modes of action and specificities of the competitive inhibitors. Of note, binding of the ligands causes movement of the PIKK regulatory domain (PRD), revealing a connection between the p-loop and PRD conformations. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and cryo-EM studies on the DNA-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme further show that ligand binding does not have a negative allosteric or inhibitory effect on assembly of the holoenzyme complex and that inhibitors function through direct competition with ATP. Overall, the structures described in this study should greatly assist future efforts in rational drug design targeting DNA-PKcs, demonstrating the potential of cryo-EM in structure-guided drug development for large and challenging targets."

Here we performed time-resolved measurements using attosecond soft x-ray pulses produced by a free-electron laser, to track the evolution of a coherent core-hole excitation in nitric oxide. Using an additional circularly polarized infrared laser pulse, we created a clock to time-resolve the electron dynamics and demonstrated control of the coherent electron motion by tuning the photon energy of the x-ray pulse. Core-excited states offer a fundamental test bed for studying coherent electron dynamics in highly excited and strongly correlated matter."
https://openalex.org/W4206900329,"Stellar ejecta gradually enrich the gas out of which subsequent stars form, making the least chemically enriched stellar systems direct fossils of structures formed in the early Universe1. Although a few hundred stars with metal content below 1,000th of the solar iron content are known in the Galaxy2–4, none of them inhabit globular clusters, some of the oldest known stellar structures. These show metal content of at least approximately 0.2% of the solar metallicity $$([{\rm{Fe}}/{\rm{H}}]\gtrsim -2.7)$$ . This metallicity floor appears universal5,6, and it has been proposed that protogalaxies that merged into the galaxies we observe today were simply not massive enough to form clusters that survived to the present day7. Here we report observations of a stellar stream, C-19, whose metallicity is less than 0.05% of the solar metallicity $$([{\rm{F}}{\rm{e}}/{\rm{H}}]=-3.38\pm 0.06\,({\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{c}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{l}})\pm 0.20\,({\rm{s}}{\rm{y}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{m}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{t}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{c}}))$$ . The low metallicity dispersion and the chemical abundances of the C-19 stars show that this stream is the tidal remnant of the most metal-poor globular cluster ever discovered, and is significantly below the purported metallicity floor: clusters with significantly lower metallicities than observed today existed in the past and contributed their stars to the Milky Way halo. Observations of a stellar stream below the metallicity floor for a disrupted globular cluster are described."
https://openalex.org/W4205195570,"Magnetic fields have an important role in the evolution of interstellar medium and star formation1,2. As the only direct probe of interstellar field strength, credible Zeeman measurements remain sparse owing to the lack of suitable Zeeman probes, particularly for cold, molecular gas3. Here we report the detection of a magnetic field of +3.8 ± 0.3 microgauss through the H I narrow self-absorption (HINSA)4,5 towards L15446,7-a well-studied prototypical prestellar core in an early transition between starless and protostellar phases8-10 characterized by a high central number density11 and a low central temperature12. A combined analysis of the Zeeman measurements of quasar H I absorption, H I emission, OH emission and HINSA reveals a coherent magnetic field from the atomic cold neutral medium (CNM) to the molecular envelope. The molecular envelope traced by the HINSA is found to be magnetically supercritical, with a field strength comparable to that of the surrounding diffuse, magnetically subcritical CNM despite a large increase in density. The reduction of the magnetic flux relative to the mass, which is necessary for star formation, thus seems to have already happened during the transition from the diffuse CNM to the molecular gas traced by the HINSA. This is earlier than envisioned in the classical picture where magnetically supercritical cores capable of collapsing into stars form out of magnetically subcritical envelopes13,14."

Brewing Huangjiu with millet can increase the value of millet. Microbial community plays crucial roles in millet Huangjiu fermentation. Flavor compounds reflect the quality and health function of Huangjiu. The flavor compounds of Huangjiu are complex and their formation is closely associated with microorganisms, but the relationship between them during fermentation has been unknown. In this research, this relationship during millet Huangjiu fermentation were deeply investigated. Totally 86 volatile compounds were detected. Bacillus , Weissella , Paenibacillus , Klebsiella , Prevotella was investigated as the dominant microbes through high-throughput sequencing. 537 correlations between major flavor compounds and microbes were established to reflect the dynamic change during millet Huangjiu fermentation. The top five dominant genus of flavor producing microbes were Chryseobacterium , Sporolactobacillus , Psychrobacter , Sphingobium and Anoxybacillus . The content of malic acid and citric acid was gradually improved all through the millet Huangjiu fermentation. Malic acid and citric acid generated from millet Huangjiu fermentation shows healthy properties as liver protection and eliminating fatigue. Our research provides essential information on microbial community succession and the flavor formation during millet Huangjiu fermentation, and beneficial for development of Huangjiu products."
https://openalex.org/W4205815178,"The dominance of interactions over kinetic energy lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum matter, from fractional quantum Hall liquids, to atoms in optical lattices and twisted bilayer graphene. Crystalline phases often compete with correlated quantum liquids, and transitions between them occur when the energy cost of forming a density wave approaches zero. A prime example occurs for electrons in high magnetic fields, where the instability of quantum Hall liquids towards a Wigner crystal is heralded by a roton-like softening of density modulations at the magnetic length. Remarkably, interacting bosons in a gauge field are also expected to form analogous liquid and crystalline states. However, combining interactions with strong synthetic magnetic fields has been a challenge for experiments on bosonic quantum gases. Here, we study the purely interaction-driven dynamics of a Landau gauge Bose-Einstein condensate in and near the lowest Landau level (LLL). We observe a spontaneous crystallization driven by condensation of magneto-rotons, excitations visible as density modulations at the magnetic length. Increasing the cloud density smoothly connects this behaviour to a quantum version of the Kelvin-Helmholtz hydrodynamic instability, driven by the sheared internal flow profile of the rapidly rotating condensate. At long times the condensate self-organizes into a persistent array of droplets, separated by vortex streets, which are stabilized by a balance of interactions and effective magnetic forces."
https://openalex.org/W4205184318,"Whether glutamate or itch-selective neurotransmitters are used to confer itch specificity is still under debate. We focused on an itch-selective population of primary afferents expressing MRGPRA3, which highly expresses Vglut2 and the neuropeptide neuromedin B (Nmb), to investigate this question. Optogenetic stimulation of MRGPRA3+ afferents triggers scratching and other itch-related avoidance behaviors. Using a combination of optogenetics, spinal cord slice recordings, Vglut2 conditional knockout mice, and behavior assays, we showed that glutamate is essential for MRGPRA3+ afferents to transmit itch. We further demonstrated that MRGPRA3+ afferents form monosynaptic connections with both NMBR+ and NMBR- neurons and that NMB and glutamate together can enhance the activity of NMBR+ spinal DH neurons. Moreover, Nmb in MRGPRA3+ afferents and NMBR+ DH neurons are required for chloroquine-induced scratching. Together, our results establish a new model in which glutamate is an essential neurotransmitter in primary afferents for itch transmission, whereas NMB signaling enhances its activities."

https://openalex.org/W4206577779,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to counteract it have highlighted the role of individual differences in evaluating and reacting to emergencies, and the challenges inherent in promoting precautionary behaviours. We aimed to explore the psychological and cognitive factors modulating behaviour and intentions during the national lockdown in Italy. We administered an online questionnaire (N = 244) that included tests for assessing personality traits (Temperament and Character Inventory; Locus of Control of Behaviour) and moral judgment (Moral Foundations Questionnaire), alongside behavioural economics tasks addressing different facets of risk attitude (loss aversion, risk aversion and delay discounting). We then assessed the extent to which individual variations in these dimensions modulated participants' compliance with the lockdown norms. When assessing their joint contribution via multiple regressions, lockdown adherence was mostly predicted by internal locus of control, psycho-economic dimensions suggestive of long-sighted and loss-averse attitudes, as well as personality traits related to cautionary behaviour, such as harm avoidance, and the authority moral concern. These findings show that a multi-domain assessment of the factors underlying personal intentions, and thus driving compliance with government measures, can help predict individuals' actions during health emergencies. This evidence points to factors that should be considered when developing interventions and communication strategies to promote precautionary behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W4205972236,"The 660-kilometre seismic discontinuity is the boundary between the Earth's lower mantle and transition zone and is commonly interpreted as being due to the dissociation of ringwoodite to bridgmanite plus ferropericlase (post-spinel transition)1-3. A distinct feature of the 660-kilometre discontinuity is its depression to 750 kilometres beneath subduction zones4-10. However, in situ X-ray diffraction studies using multi-anvil techniques have demonstrated negative but gentle Clapeyron slopes (that is, the ratio between pressure and temperature changes) of the post-spinel transition that do not allow a significant depression11-13. On the other hand, conventional high-pressure experiments face difficulties in accurate phase identification due to inevitable pressure changes during heating and the persistent presence of metastable phases1,3. Here we determine the post-spinel and akimotoite-bridgmanite transition boundaries by multi-anvil experiments using in situ X-ray diffraction, with the boundaries strictly based on the definition of phase equilibrium. The post-spinel boundary has almost no temperature dependence, whereas the akimotoite-bridgmanite transition has a very steep negative boundary slope at temperatures lower than ambient mantle geotherms. The large depressions of the 660-kilometre discontinuity in cold subduction zones are thus interpreted as the akimotoite-bridgmanite transition. The steep negative boundary of the akimotoite-bridgmanite transition will cause slab stagnation (a stalling of the slab's descent) due to significant upward buoyancy14,15."
https://openalex.org/W4205987875,"Neonatal brain injury may impact brain development and lead to lifelong functional impairments. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and congenital heart disease (CHD) are two common causes of neonatal brain injury differing in timing and mechanism. Maturation of whole-brain neural networks can be quantified during development using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in combination with graph theory metrics. DMRI of 35 subjects with CHD and 62 subjects with HIE were compared to understand differences in the effects of HIE and CHD on the development of network topological parameters and functional outcomes. CHD newborns had worse 12-18 month language (P<0.01) and 30 month cognitive (P<0.01), language (P = 0.05), motor outcomes (P = 0.01). Global efficiency, a metric of brain integration, was lower in CHD (P = 0.03) than in HIE, but transitivity, modularity and small-worldness were similar. After controlling for clinical factors known to affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, we observed that global efficiency was highly associated with 30 month motor outcomes (P = 0.02) in both groups. To explore neural correlates of adverse language outcomes in CHD, we used hypothesis-based and data-driven approaches to identify pathways with altered structural connectivity. We found that connectivity strength in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) tract 2 was inversely associated with expressive language. After false discovery rate correction, a whole connectome edge analysis identified 18 pathways that were hypoconnected in the CHD cohort as compared to HIE. In sum, our study shows that neonatal structural connectivity predicts early motor development after HIE or in subjects with CHD, and regional SLF connectivity is associated with language outcomes. Further research is needed to determine if and how brain networks change over time and whether those changes represent recovery or ongoing dysfunction. This knowledge will directly inform strategies to optimize neurologic functional outcomes after neonatal brain injury."
https://openalex.org/W4226126936,"Renal fibrosis is a progressive, fatal renal disease characterized by the aberrant accumulation of myofibroblasts that produce excess extracellular matrix (ECM) in the renal interstitium and glomeruli. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been regarded as a crucial modulator in myofibroblast transformation, but its upstream regulator remains a mystery. In the present study investigating the participation of m6A methylation during renal fibrosis through bioinformatics analysis, we identified YTHDF1, a modulator of m6A methylation, as a key contributor for renal fibrosis because it was highly expressed in human fibrotic kidneys and had a significant correction with YAP. Their co-localization in human fibrotic kidneys was additionally shown by immunofluorescence. We then found that YTHDF1 was also up-regulated in fibrotic mouse kidneys induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), high-dose folic acid administration, or the unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury, further supporting a causal role of YTHDF1 during renal fibrosis. Consistent with this notion, YTHDF1 knockdown alleviated the progression of renal fibrosis both in cultured cells induced by transforming growth factor-beta administration and in the UUO mouse model. Meanwhile, YAP was accordingly down-regulated when YTHDF1 was inhibited. Furthermore, the specific binding of YTHDF1 to YAP mRNA was detected using RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation, and the up-regulation of fibrotic related molecules in cultured cells induced by YTHDF1 over-expression plasmid was attenuated by YAP siRNA. Taken together, our data highlight the potential utility of YTHDF1 as an indicator for renal fibrosis and suggest that YTHDF1 inhibition might be a promising therapeutic strategy to alleviate renal fibrosis via downregulating YAP."
https://openalex.org/W4205204403,"Ponesimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor (S1PR) modulator that was recently approved for treating relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Three other FDA-approved S1PR modulators for MS-fingolimod, siponimod, and ozanimod-share peripheral immunological effects via common S1P1 interactions, yet ponesimod may access distinct central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms through its selectivity for the S1P1 receptor. Here, ponesimod was examined for S1PR internalization and binding, human astrocyte signaling and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression, and in vivo using murine cuprizone-mediated demyelination. Studies confirmed ponesimod's selectivity for S1P1 without comparable engagement to the other S1PR subtypes (S1P2,3,4,5 ). Ponesimod showed pharmacological properties of acute agonism followed by chronic functional antagonism of S1P1 . A major locus of S1P1 expression in the CNS is on astrocytes, and scRNA-seq of primary human astrocytes exposed to ponesimod identified a gene ontology relationship of reduced neuroinflammation and reduction in known astrocyte disease-related genes including those of immediate early astrocytes that have been strongly associated with disease progression in MS animal models. Remarkably, ponesimod prevented cuprizone-induced demyelination selectively in the cingulum, but not in the corpus callosum. These data support the CNS activities of ponesimod through S1P1 , including protective, and likely selective, effects against demyelination in a major connection pathway of the brain, the limbic fibers of the cingulum, lesions of which have been associated with several neurologic impairments including MS fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W4225718284,"Assistive exoskeletons can reduce the metabolic cost of walking, and recent advances in exoskeleton device design and control have resulted in large metabolic savings. Most exoskeleton devices provide assistance at either the ankle or hip. Exoskeletons that assist multiple joints have the potential to provide greater metabolic savings, but can require many actuators and complicated controllers, making it difficult to design effective assistance. Coupled assistance, when two or more joints are assisted using one actuator or control signal, could reduce control dimensionality while retaining metabolic benefits. However, it is unknown which combinations of assisted joints are most promising and if there are negative consequences associated with coupled assistance. Since designing assistance with human experiments is expensive and time-consuming, we used musculoskeletal simulation to evaluate metabolic savings from multi-joint assistance and identify promising joint combinations. We generated 2D muscle-driven simulations of walking while simultaneously optimizing control strategies for simulated lower-limb exoskeleton assistive devices to minimize metabolic cost. Each device provided assistance either at a single joint or at multiple joints using massless, ideal actuators. To assess if control could be simplified for multi-joint exoskeletons, we simulated different control strategies in which the torque provided at each joint was either controlled independently or coupled between joints. We compared the predicted optimal torque profiles and changes in muscle and total metabolic power consumption across the single joint and multi-joint assistance strategies. We found multi-joint devices-whether independent or coupled-provided 50% greater metabolic savings than single joint devices. The coupled multi-joint devices were able to achieve most of the metabolic savings produced by independently-controlled multi-joint devices. Our results indicate that device designers could simplify multi-joint exoskeleton designs by reducing the number of torque control parameters through coupling, while still maintaining large reductions in metabolic cost."

It is often considered as a synonym with ‘wellbeing’ and defined as a state characterized by a high level of life satisfaction, a high level of positive emotions, and less negative emotions. This research aims to validate the Happiness at Work scale in the Indonesian context. In this study, the researchers conducted cross-cultural adaptation for the Happiness at Work scale following systematic procedures to produce the Scale of Happiness at Work in the Indonesian language. Afterward, the researchers evaluated the content validity with the help of professional judgment and measured the Content Validity Index at the item level and the scale level. Further, to examine the psychometric properties of the Happiness at Work scale, the researchers administer the questionnaire to a sample of 105 (35 male and 70 female) lecturers to conduct exploratory factor analysis to formulate the new dimensionality of the Happiness at Work scale. The results of Exploratory Factor Analysis indicated that Happiness at Work in the Indonesian context could be measured using four dimensions. To confirm that the extracted dimensions measure a single construct, the researchers administered the produced version to a sample of 370 (147 male and 223 female). Afterward, researchers conducted confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the validity and reliability of the measurement model. This research found out that the Indonesian version of Happiness at Work measurement is reliable and valid. Thus, this study may contribute to the happiness at work literature of non-western context. In conclusion, the Indonesian-Happiness at Work scale shows robust psychometric properties that can be used for further research."

https://openalex.org/W4206497547,"Background The subjective experience of fatigue impairs an individual’s ability to sustain physical endurance performance. However, precise understanding of the specific role perceived fatigue plays in the central regulation of performance remains unclear. Here, we examined whether the subjective intensity of a perceived state of fatigue, pre-induced through prior upper body activity, differentially impacted performance and altered perceived effort and affect experienced during a sustained, isometric contraction in lower body. We also explored whether (cardiac) interoception predicted the intensity of experienced perceptual and affective responses and moderated the relationships between constructs during physical activity. Methods Using a repeated-measures study design, thirty male participants completed three experimental conditions, with the intensity of a pre-induced state of fatigue manipulated to evoke moderate (MOD), severe (SEV) and minimal (control; CON) intensity of perceptions prior to performance of the sustained contraction. Results Performance of the sustained contraction was significantly impaired under a perceived state of fatigue, with reductions of 10% and 14% observed in the MOD and SEV conditions, respectively. Performance impairment was accompanied by greater perceived effort and more negative affective valence reported during the contraction. However, effects were limited to comparisons to CON, with no difference evident between the two experimental trials (i.e. MOD vs . SEV). Individuals’ awareness of their accuracy in judging resting heartbeats was shown to predict the subjective intensity of fatigue experienced during the endurance task. However, interoception did not moderate the relationships evident between fatigue and both perceived effort and affective valence. Conclusions A perceived state of fatigue limits endurance performance, influencing both how effortful activity is perceived to be and the affective experience of activity. Though awareness of interoceptive representations of bodily states may be important to the subjective experience of fatigue, interoception does not modulate the relationships between perceived fatigue and other perceptual (i.e. effort) and affective constructs."

The aim of this study was to assess patient satisfaction with pharmaceutical services and associated factors in public hospitals located in Northwestern Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based quantitative cross-sectional study was used. The study was carried out in an outpatient pharmacy from January 1–June 30, 2021. Participants were selected by a systematic sampling technique. The IBM SPSS statistical package (version 23) was used to enter and analyze the collected data. The findings were presented using descriptive statistical methods. To find factors linked to satisfaction, binary logistic regression was used. Results The final analysis included a total of 401 samples. More than half of the participants (229, or 55.1%) were female. The overall mean score of satisfaction was 30.6 out of a maximum of 100 scores. By taking this mean score as a cut-off point, 204 (50.9%) of the study participants had satisfaction with the outpatient pharmacists’ service. Participants’ responses scored on the uncomfortable and inconvenient waiting areas [AOR = 0.31; 95%CI, (0.13, 0.49)] were found to be negatively associated with the level of patients’ satisfaction. Also, the unavailability of medications [AOR = 0.12; 95%CI, (0.02, 0.37)] was negatively associated with the respondent satisfaction. Uncomfortable and inconvenient private counseling areas [AOR = 1.37; 95%CI, (0.79, 4.42)] showed a negative association with their satisfaction. Conclusion Patients’ satisfaction levels with pharmacy service were found to be greater than 50%. The socio-demographic characteristics of patients have no association with their level of satisfaction, but their perception of uncomfortable private counseling areas and waiting areas was negatively associated with their satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4206657683,"""Contracting Out"" is a popular strategy to expand coverage and utilization of health services. Bangladesh began contracting out primary healthcare services to NGOs in urban areas through the Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) in 1998. Over the three phases of this project, retention of trained and skilled human resources, especially doctors, proved to be an intractable challenge. This paper highlights the issues influencing doctor's retention both in managerial as well as service provision level in the contracted-out setting.In this qualitative study, 42 Key Informant Interviews were undertaken with individuals involved with UPHCP in various levels including relevant ministries, project personnel representing the City Corporations and municipalities, NGO managers and doctors. Verbatim transcripts were coded in ATLAS.ti and analyzed using the thematic analysis. Document review was done for data triangulation.The most cited problem was a low salary structure in contrast to public sector pay scale followed by a dearth of other financial incentives such as performance-based incentives, provident funds and gratuities. Lack of career ladder, for those in both managerial and service delivery roles, was also identified as a factor hindering staff retention. Other disincentives included inadequate opportunities for training to improve clinical skills, ineffective staffing arrangements, security issues during night shifts, abuse from community members in the context of critical patient management, and lack of job security after project completion.An adequate, efficient and dedicated health workforce is a pre-requisite for quality service provision and patient utilization of these services. Improved career development opportunities, the provision of salaries and incentives, and a safer working environment are necessary actions to retain and motivate those serving in managerial and service delivery positions in contracting out arrangements."
https://openalex.org/W4205189628,"The micro- and macro-complications in diabetes mellitus (DM) mainly arise from the damage induced by Amadori and advanced glycation end products, as well as the released free radicals. The primary goal of DM treatment is to reduce the risk of micro- and macro-complications. In this study, we looked at the efficacy of aminoguanidine (AG) to prevent the production of early glycation products in alloxan-diabetic rabbits. Type1 DM was induced in rabbits by a single intravenous injection of alloxan (90 mg/kg body weight). Another group of rabbits was pre-treated with AG (100 mg/kg body weight) prior to alloxan injection; this was followed by weekly treatment with 100 mg/kg of AG for eight weeks. Glucose, insulin, and early glycation products (HbA1C and fructosamine) were measured in control, diabetic and AG treated diabetic rabbits. The effects of hyperglycemia on superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), reduced glutathione (rGSH), nitric oxide, lipid peroxides, and protein carbonyl were investigated. Alloxan-diabetic rabbits had lower levels of SOD, CAT, Gpx, and rGSH than control rabbits. Nitric oxide levels were considerably greater. AG administration restored the activities of SOD, CAT, Gpx enzymes up to 70-80% and ameliorated the nitric oxide production. HbA1c and fructosamine levels were considerably lower in AG-treated diabetic rabbits. The observed control of hyperglycemia and amadori adducts in alloxan-diabetic rabbits by AG may be attributed to decrease of stress and restoration of antioxidant defenses."

However, limited information is available that shows the magnitude of the problem and its risk factors that help for intervention in Ethiopia. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of tungiasis in children aged 5 to 14 in Mettu woreda in 2020. A community based cross sectional study was conducted among randomly selected kebeles of Mettu woreda, in Southwest Ethiopia. To select study participants, multistage sampling was used. The data were collected through physical examination of the children, interview of parents/guardians of the children, and observation of the home environment using checklists and questionnaires. The descriptive analysis was done for socio-demographic characteristics, prevalence of tungiasis, and housing conditions. A logistic regression analysis was performed, and variables in multivariable regression reported odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals once the variables were identified using a p-value of 0.05 as a risk factor of statistical significance. The prevalence of tungiasis among children 5-14 years of age in Mettu rural woreda was 52 percent (n = 821). As a risk factor, large family size (AOR: 2.9, 95% CI: 2.13, 4.40); school attendance (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.18), floor inside the house (AOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.76, 8.43); having sleeping bed (AOR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.82); access to protected water sources (AOR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.39); access to improved toilet facilities(AOR: 0.63: 95% CI: 0.44, 0.89); access to electric services (AOR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.62); and lack of own farmland (AOR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.50) were found. Therefore, planning and implementation of interventions focus on those risk factors that are particularly important. Water, sanitation and hygiene interventions, and livelihood improvement interventions are required to solve the problem in the setting."
https://openalex.org/W4205654552,"The purpose of this study was to compare heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability in young endurance athletes during nocturnal sleep and in the morning; and to assess whether changes in these values are associated with changes in submaximal running (SRT) and counter-movement jump (CMJ) performance.During a three-week period of similar training, eleven athletes (16 ± 1 years) determined daily HR and heart rate variability (RMSSD) during sleep utilizing a ballistocardiographic device (Emfit QS), as well as in the morning with a HR monitor (Polar V800). Aerobic fitness and power production were assessed employing SRT and CMJ test.Comparison of the average values for week 1 and week 3 revealed no significant differences with respect to nocturnal RMSSD (6.8%, P = 0.344), morning RMSSD (13.4%, P = 0.151), morning HR (-3.9 bpm, P = 0.063), SRT HR (-0.7 bpm, P = 0.447), SRT blood lactate (4.9%, P = 0.781), CMJ (-4.2%, P = 0.122) or training volume (16%, P = 0.499). There was a strong correlation between morning and nocturnal HRs during week 1 (r = 0.800, P = 0.003) and week 3 (r = 0.815, P = 0.002), as well as between morning and nocturnal RMSSD values (for week 1, r = 0.895, P<0.001 and week 3, r = 0.878, P = 0.001).This study concluded that HR and RMSSD obtained during nocturnal sleep and in the morning did not differ significantly. In addition, weekly changes in training and performance were small indicating that fitness was similar throughout the 3-week period of observation. Consequently, daily measurement of HR indices during nocturnal sleep provide a potential tool for long-term monitoring of young endurance athletes."
https://openalex.org/W4206125209,"DNA methylation (DNAme; 5-methylcytosine, 5mC) plays an essential role in mammalian development, and the 5mC profile is regulated by a balance of opposing enzymatic activities: DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TETs). In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), de novo DNAme by DNMT3 family enzymes, demethylation by the TET-mediated conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), and maintenance of the remaining DNAme by DNMT1 are actively repeated throughout cell cycles, dynamically forming a constant 5mC profile. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism and physiological significance of this active cyclic DNA modification in mouse ESCs remain unclear. Here by visualizing the localization of DNA modifications on metaphase chromosomes and comparing whole-genome methylation profiles before and after the mid-S phase in ESCs lacking Dnmt1 (1KO ESCs), we demonstrated that in 1KO ESCs, DNMT3-mediated remethylation was interrupted during and after DNA replication. This results in a marked asymmetry in the distribution of 5hmC between sister chromatids at mitosis, with one chromatid being almost no 5hmC. When introduced in 1KO ESCs, the catalytically inactive form of DNMT1 (DNMT1 CI ) induced an increase in DNAme in pericentric heterochromatin and the DNAme-independent repression of IAPEz, a retrotransposon family, in 1KO ESCs. However, DNMT1 CI could not restore the ability of DNMT3 to methylate unmodified dsDNA de novo in S phase in 1KO ESCs. Furthermore, during in vitro differentiation into epiblasts, 1KO ESCs expressing DNMT1 CI showed an even stronger tendency to differentiate into the primitive endoderm than 1KO ESCs and were readily reprogrammed into the primitive streak via an epiblast-like cell state, reconfirming the importance of DNMT1 enzymatic activity at the onset of epiblast differentiation. These results indicate a novel function of DNMT1, in which DNMT1 actively regulates the timing and genomic targets of de novo methylation by DNMT3 in an enzymatic activity-dependent and independent manner, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4225649022,"Sleep deficiency is a hidden cost of our 24-7 society, with 70% of adults in the US admitting that they routinely obtain insufficient sleep. Further, it is estimated that 50-70 million adults in the US have a sleep disorder. Undiagnosed and untreated sleep disorders are associated with diminished health for the individual and increased costs for the employer. Research has shown that adverse impacts on employees and employers can be mitigated through sleep health education and sleep disorder screening and treatment programs. Smartphone applications (app) are increasingly commonplace and represent promising, scalable modalities for such programs. The dayzz app is a personalized sleep training program that incorporates assessment of sleep disorders and offers a personalized comprehensive sleep improvement solution. Using a sample of day workers affiliated with a large institution of higher education, we will conduct a single-site, parallel-group, randomized, waitlist control trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either use the dayzz app throughout the study or receive the dayzz app at the end of the study. We will collect data on feasibility and acceptability of the dayzz app; employee sleep, including sleep behavioral changes, sleep duration, regularity, and quality; employee presenteeism, absenteeism, and performance; employee mood; adverse and safety outcomes; and healthcare utilization on a monthly basis throughout the study, as well as collect more granular daily data from the employee during pre-specified intervals.

https://openalex.org/W4205670584,"Purpose Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a systemic inflammatory arthritis mediated mainly by interleukin (IL)-17. The vitronectin-derived bioactive peptide, VnP-16, exerts an anti-osteoporotic effect via β1 and αvβ3 integrin signaling. SpA is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis, and we investigated the effect of VnP-16 in mice with SpA. Methods SpA was induced by curdlan in SKG ZAP-70 W163C mice, which were treated with vehicle, celecoxib, VnP-16, or VnP-16+celecoxib. The clinical score, arthritis score, spondylitis score, and proinflammatory cytokine expression of the spine were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Type 17 helper T cell (Th17) and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation in the spleen was evaluated by flow cytometry and in the spine by confocal staining. Splenocyte expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and p STAT3 was evaluated by in vitro Western blotting. Results The clinical score was significantly reduced in the VnP16+celecoxib group. The arthritis and spondylitis scores were significantly lower in the VnP-16 and VnP16+celecoxib groups than the vehicle group. In the spine, the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-17 expression were reduced and Th17/Treg imbalance was regulated in the VnP-16 alone and VnP-16+celecoxib groups. Flow cytometry of splenocytes showed increased polarization of Tregs in the VnP-16+celecoxib group. In vitro , VnP-16 suppressed p STAT3. Conclusions VnP-16 plus celecoxib prevented SpA progression in a mouse model by regulating the Th17/Treg imbalance and suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines."

Whether the impact is positive or negative, its significance on the overall shaping of adolescents’ lives cannot be overlooked. The aim of the present study was to explore impacts of the pandemic on the adolescents’ everyday lives in Pakistan. Methods Following ethical approval, this cross-sectional study was conducted through September to December, 2020 via an online survey on 842 adolescents with the mean age of 17.14 ± SD 1.48. Socio-demographic data and Epidemic Pandemic Impact Inventory-Adolescent Adaptation (EPII-A) was used to assess the multi-dimensional effects of the pandemic. Results Among the 842 participants, 84% were girls. Education emerged as the most negatively affected Pandemic domain (41.6–64.3%). Most of the adolescents (62.0–65.8%) had reported changes in responsibilities at home including increased time spent in helping family members. Besides, increase in workload of participants and their parents was prominent (41.8% &amp; 47.6%). Social activities were mostly halted for approximately half (41–51%) of the participants. Increased screen time, decreased physical activity and sedentary lifestyle were reported by 52.7%, 46.3% and 40.7% respectively. 22.2–62.4% of the adolescents had a direct experience with quarantine, while 15.7% experienced death of a close friend or relative. Positive changes in their lives were endorsed by 30.5–62.4% respondents. Being male and older adolescents had significant association with negative impact across most domains (p&lt;0 . 05) .

https://openalex.org/W4206543785,"A variety of antibiotics are ubiquitous in all freshwater ecosystems that receive wastewater. A wide variety of antibiotics have been developed to kill problematic bacteria and fungi through targeted application, and their use has contributed significantly to public health and livestock management. Unfortunately, a substantial fraction of the antibiotics applied to humans, pets and livestock end up in wastewater, and ultimately many of these chemicals enter freshwater ecosystems. The effect of adding chemicals that are intentionally designed to kill microbes, on freshwater microbial communities remains poorly understood. There are reasons to be concerned, as microbes play an essential role in nutrient uptake, carbon fixation and denitrification in freshwater ecosystems. Chemicals that reduce or alter freshwater microbial communities might reduce their capacity to degrade the excess nutrients and organic matter that characterize wastewater. We performed a laboratory experiment in which we exposed microbial community from unexposed stream sediments to three commonly detected antibiotics found in urban wastewater and urban streams (sulfamethoxazole, danofloxacin, and erythromycin). We assessed how the form and concentration of inorganic nitrogen, microbial carbon, and nitrogen cycling processes changed in response to environmentally relevant doses (10 μg/L) of each of these antibiotics individually and in combination. We expected to find that all antibiotics suppressed rates of microbial mineralization and nitrogen transformations and we anticipated that this suppression of microbial activity would be greatest in the combined treatment. Contrary to our expectations we measured few significant changes in microbially mediated functions in response to our experimental antibiotic dosing. We found no difference in functional gene abundance of key nitrogen cycling genes nosZ, mcrA, nirK, and amoA genes, and we measured no treatment effects on NO3- uptake or N2O, N2, CH4, CO2 production over the course of our seven-day experiment. In the mixture treatment, we measured significant increases in NH4+ concentrations over the first 24 hours of the experiment, which were indistinguishable from controls within six hours. Our results suggest remarkable community resistance to pressure antibiotic exposure poses on naïve stream sediments."

The intervention group received a dietary intervention of minimal and unprocessed foods for three to six months, consisting of five times per week green vegetables, three times per week beef, daily 200-300 mL whole cow's milk (3.4% fat) and whole dairy butter (80% fat) on each slice of bread. The control group continued their usual dietary habits. Raw data of the three intervention studies where combined into one single dataset for data analysis, using mixed effects analysis of covariance to test the effects of the dietary advice on the main study outcomes, which are measurements of the lipid profile.In total, 267 children aged 1 to 16 years were followed. 135 children were included in the intervention group and 139 children in the control group. Characteristics (age, gender and follow-up period) were equally distributed between the groups at baseline. In the intervention group HDL-cholesterol increased significantly from 1.22 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.32 to 1.42 mmol/L 95% CI 1.30-1.65 (p = 0.007). The increase over time in HDL cholesterol in the intervention group was significantly different compared to the increase in the control group (from 1.26 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.19-1.35, to 1.30 mmol/L, 95% CI 1.26-1.37) (p = 0.04). Due to the increased HDL concentration in the intervention group, the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased significantly from 3.70 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.38-3.87, to 3.25 mmol/L, 95% CI 2.96-3.31 (p = 0.05).Consumption of minimal and unprocessed foods (high in natural saturated fats) has favourable effects on HDL cholesterol in children. Therefore, this dietary advice can safely be recommended to children."
https://openalex.org/W4205453279,"Contact lens usage has contributed to increased incidence rates of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a serious corneal infection that can lead to blindness. Since symptoms associated with AK closely resemble those incurred by bacterial or fungal keratitis, developing a diagnostic method enabling rapid detection with a high degree of Acanthamoeba-specificity would be beneficial. Here, we produced a polyclonal antibody targeting the carboxylesterase (CE) superfamily protein secreted by the pathogenic Acanthamoeba and evaluated its diagnostic potential. Western blot analysis revealed that the CE antibody specifically interacts with the cell lysates and conditioned media of pathogenic Acanthamoeba, which were not observed from the cell lysates and conditioned media of human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, Fusarium solani, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. High titers of A. castellanii-specific antibody production were confirmed sera of immunized mice via ELISA, and these antibodies were capable of detecting A. castellanii from the cell lysates and their conditioned media. The specificity of the CE antibody was further confirmed on A. castellanii trophozoites and cysts co-cultured with HCE cells, F. solani, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa using immunocytochemistry. Additionally, the CE antibody produced in this study successfully interacted with 7 different Acanthamoeba species. Our findings demonstrate that the polyclonal CE antibody specifically detects multiple species belong to the genus Acanthamoeba, thus highlighting its potential as AK diagnostic tool."

The median (interquartile range) age of the children included in this analysis was 6 (3,12) months. Fifty-nine percent of the children had received at least one dose of PCV-13 and 35% were fully vaccinated with PCV-13. While colonization by vaccine serotypes steadily declined following PCV-13 introduction, 25% of strains isolated more than 3 years after vaccine introduction were PCV-13 serotypes. We also observed an increase in colonization by non-vaccine serotypes 21 and 23B, which have been associated with invasive pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance in other settings."

While models for assessing the cost-effectiveness of screening were proposed in the past, they often presented only a limited view. This study aimed to develop a simulation-based German Albuminuria Screening Model (S-GASM) and present some initial applications.The model consists of an individual-based simulation of disease progression, considering age, gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, albuminuria, glomerular filtration rate, and quality of life, furthermore, costs of testing, therapy, and renal replacement therapy with parameters based on published evidence. Selected screening scenarios were compared in a cost-effectiveness analysis.Compared to no testing, a simulation of 10 million individuals with a current age distribution of the adult German population and a follow-up until death or the age of 90 shows that a testing of all individuals with diabetes every two years leads to a reduction of the lifetime prevalence of renal replacement therapy from 2.5% to 2.3%. The undiscounted costs of this intervention would be 1164.10 € / QALY (quality-adjusted life year). Considering saved costs for renal replacement therapy, the overall undiscounted costs would be-12581.95 € / QALY. Testing all individuals with diabetes or hypertension and screening the general population reduced the lifetime prevalence even further (to 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively). Both scenarios were cost-saving (undiscounted, - 7127.10 €/QALY and-5439.23 €/QALY).The S-GASM can be used for the comparison of various albuminuria testing strategies. The exemplary analysis demonstrates cost savings through albuminuria testing for individuals with diabetes, diabetes or hypertension, and for population-wide screening."
https://openalex.org/W4205430961,"Introduction In cholera endemic areas, the periodicity of cholera outbreaks remains unpredictable, making it difficult to organize preventive efforts. Lack of data on duration of protection conferred by oral cholera vaccines further makes it difficult to determine when to deploy preemptive vaccination. We report on the immunogenicity and waning of immunity to Shanchol ™ in Lukanga Swamps. Methods We enrolled a cohort of 223 participants aged between 18 and 65 years old from whom serum samples were collected at baseline, day 28 before administration of the second dose, and consecutively at 6, 12, 24, 30, 36, and 48 months. Vibriocidal antibody titres were measured and expressed as geometric mean titres. Box plots and 95% CI were computed at each visit for both Inaba and Ogawa. Seroconversion was defined as a four fold or greater increase in antibody titres compared to baseline titres. Results Overall, seroconversion against V . cholerae Inaba and Ogawa after 1st dose was 35/134 (26%) and 34/134 (25%) respectively. We observed a statistical difference in seroconversion between the two subgroups of baseline titres (low &lt;80 and high ≥80) for both Inaba (p = 0.02) and Ogawa (p&lt;0.0001). From a baseline of 13.58, anti-Ogawa GMT increased to 21.95 after the first dose, but rapidly waned to 14.52, 13.13, and 12.78 at months 6, 12 and 24 respectively, and then increased to 13.21, 18.67 and 23.65 at months 30, 36 and 48 respectively. A similar trend was observed for anti-Inaba GMT across the same time points. Conclusion We found that Shanchol ™ was immunogenic in our study population and that vibriocidal antibodies may not be a good marker for long-term immunity. The observed rise in titres after 36 months suggests natural exposure, and this may be a critical time window opening for natural transmission in an endemic areas. We recommend re-vaccination at this time point in high risk areas."
https://openalex.org/W4205646003,"Numerous CCT genes are known to regulate various biological processes, such as circadian rhythm regulation, flowering, light signaling, plant development, and stress resistance. The CCT gene family has been characterized in many plants but remains unknown in the major cereal wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Extended exposure to low temperature (vernalization) is necessary for winter wheat to flower successfully. VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2), a specific CCT-containing gene, has been proved to be strongly associated with vernalization in winter wheat. Mutation of all VRN2 copies in three subgenomes results in the eliminated demands of low temperature in flowering. However, no other CCT genes have been reported to be associated with vernalization to date. The present study screened CCT genes in the whole wheat genome, and preliminarily identified the vernalization related CCT genes through expression analysis. 127 CCT genes were identified in three subgenomes of common wheat through a hidden Markov model-based method. Based on multiple alignment, these genes were grouped into 40 gene clusters, including the duplicated gene clusters TaCMF6 and TaCMF8, each tandemly arranged near the telomere. The phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into eight groups. The transcriptome analysis using leaf tissues collected before, during, and after vernalization revealed 49 upregulated and 31 downregulated CCT genes during vernalization, further validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Among the differentially expressed and well-investigated CCT gene clusters analyzed in this study, TaCMF11, TaCO18, TaPRR95, TaCMF6, and TaCO16 were induced during vernalization but decreased immediately after vernalization, while TaCO1, TaCO15, TaCO2, TaCMF8, and TaPPD1 were stably suppressed during and after vernalization. These data imply that some vernalization related CCT genes other than VRN2 may exist in wheat. This study improves our understanding of CCT genes and provides a foundation for further research on CCT genes related to vernalization in wheat."

This finding suggests that hypothetical market research methods may deliver lower quality data. Moreover, it contributes to the discussion examining the mechanism underlying the anchoring effect, suggesting it could partly be caused by insufficient conscious effort to drift away from the anchor."

Findings indicate the need to improve the level of information available on websites, with disclosure of voluntary information on CG practices being more prevalent than the disclosure of mandatory information. Likewise, banks that operate in Paraguay have made scant “progress” regarding online access to their governance information over the years analyzed. Moreover, the factors “Bank size” and “listed status” positively influence the information transparency regarding CG practices of Paraguayan banks. In contrast, “leverage,” “liquidity,” “size of the audit firm,” and “credit risk rating” are factors that have a negative relation with the extent of CG disclosure."

This study hypothesized that biomechanical improvements related to ESWT are a result of improved bone microstructure and muscle tendon properties.In this controlled laboratory study unilateral supraspinatus (SSP) tendon detachment was performed in 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats. After a degeneration period of three weeks, SSP tendon was reconstructed transosseously. Rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 16 per group): control (noSW); intraoperative shockwave treatment (IntraSW); intra- and postoperative shockwave treatment (IntraPostSW). Eight weeks after SSP repair, all rats were sacrificed and underwent bone microstructure analysis as well as histological and immunohistochemical analyses.With exception of cortical porosity at the tendon area, bone microstructure analyses revealed no significant differences between the three study groups regarding cortical and trabecular bone parameters. Cortical Porosity at the Tendon Area was lowest in the IntraPostSW (p≤0.05) group. Histological analyses showed well-regenerated muscle and tendon structures in all groups. Immunohistochemistry detected augmented angiogenesis at the musculo-tendinous transition zone in both shockwave groups indicated by CD31 positive stained blood vessels.In conclusion, bone microarchitecture changes are not responsible for previously described improved biomechanical results after shockwave treatment in rotator cuff repair in rodents. Immunohistochemical analysis showed neovascularization at the musculo-tendinous transition zone within ESWT-treated animals. Further studies focusing on neovascularization at the musculo-tendinous transition zone are necessary to explain the enhanced biomechanical and functional properties observed previously.In patients treated with a double-row SSP tendon repair, an improvement in healing through ESWT, especially in this area, could prevent a failure of the medial row, which is considered a constantly observed tear pattern."
https://openalex.org/W4225724190,"Cervical carcinoma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. Histological subtype, lymphovascular space invasion and tumor grade could have a prognostic and predictive value for patients' outcome and the knowledge of these histologic characteristics may influence clinical decision making. However, studies evaluating the diagnostic value of various biopsy techniques regarding these parameters of cervical cancer are scarce. We reviewed 318 cases of cervical carcinoma with available pathology reports from preoperative core needle biopsy (CNB) assessment and from final postoperative evaluation of the hysterectomy specimen. Setting the postoperative comprehensive pathological evaluation as reference, we analysed CNB assessment of histological tumor characteristics. In addition, we performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors influencing the accuracy in identifying LVSI and tumor grade. CNB was highly accurate in discriminating histological subtype. Sensitivity and specificity were 98.8% and 89% for squamous cell carcinoma, 92.9% and 96.6% for adenocarcinoma, 33.3% and 100% in adenosquamous carcinoma respectively. Neuroendocrine carcinoma was always recognized correctly. The accuracy of the prediction of LVSI was 61.9% and was positively influenced by tumor size in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and negatively influenced by strong peritumoral inflammation. High tumor grade (G3) was diagnosed accurately in 73.9% of cases and was influenced by histological tumor type. In conclusion, CNB is an accurate sampling technique for histological classification of cervical cancer and represents a reasonable alternative to other biopsy techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4226249664,"Body segment parameters are inputs for a range of applications. Participant-specific estimates of body segment parameters are desirable as this requires fewer prior assumptions and can reduce outcome measurement errors. Commonly used methods for estimating participant-specific body segment parameters are either expensive and out of reach (medical imaging), have many underlying assumptions (geometrical modelling) or are based on a specific subset of a population (regression models). Our objective was to develop a participant-specific 3D scanning and body segmentation method that estimates body segment parameters without any assumptions about the geometry of the body, ethnic background, and gender, is low-cost, fast, and can be readily available. Using a Microsoft Kinect Version 2 camera, we developed a 3D surface scanning protocol that enabled the estimation of participant-specific body segment parameters. To evaluate our system, we performed repeated 3D scans of 21 healthy participants (10 male, 11 female). We used open source tools to segment each body scan into 16 segments (head, torso, abdomen, pelvis, left and right hand, forearm, upper arm, foot, shank and thigh) and wrote custom software to estimate each segment's mass, mass moment of inertia in the three principal orthogonal axes relevant to the center of the segment, longitudinal length, and center of mass. We compared our body segment parameter estimates to those obtained using two comparison methods and found that our system was consistent in estimating total body volume between repeated scans (male p = 0.1194, female p = 0.2240), estimated total body mass without significant differences when compared to our comparison method and a medical scale (male p = 0.8529, female p = 0.6339), and generated consistent and comparable estimates across a range of the body segment parameters of interest. Our work here outlines and provides the code for an inexpensive 3D surface scanning method for estimating a range of participant-specific body segment parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4205733250,"Background In the nation-wide double-blind cluster-randomised Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease trial (FinIP, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00861380, NCT00839254), we assessed the indirect impact of the 10-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) against five pneumococcal disease syndromes. Methods Children 6 weeks to 18 months received PHiD-CV10 in 48 clusters or hepatitis B/A-vaccine as control in 24 clusters according to infant 3+1/2+1 or catch-up schedules in years 2009―2011. Outcome data were collected from national health registers and included laboratory-confirmed and clinically suspected invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), hospital-diagnosed pneumonia, tympanostomy tube placements (TTP) and outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions. Incidence rates in the unvaccinated population in years 2010―2015 were compared between PHiD-CV10 and control clusters in age groups &lt;5 and ≥5 years (5―7 years for TTP and outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions), and in infants &lt;3 months. PHiD-CV10 was introduced into the Finnish National Vaccination Programme (PCV-NVP) for 3-month-old infants without catch-up in 9/2010. Results From 2/2009 to 10/2010, 45398 children were enrolled. Vaccination coverage varied from 29 to 61% in PHiD-CV10 clusters. We detected no clear differences in the incidence rates between the unvaccinated cohorts of the treatment arms, except in single years. For example, the rates of vaccine-type IPD, non-laboratory-confirmed IPD and empyema were lower in PHiD-CV10 clusters compared to control clusters in 2012, 2015 and 2011, respectively, in the age-group ≥5 years. Conclusions This is the first report from a clinical trial evaluating the indirect impact of a PCV against clinical outcomes in an unvaccinated population. We did not observe consistent indirect effects in the PHiD-CV10 clusters compared to the control clusters. We consider that the sub-optimal trial vaccination coverage did not allow the development of detectable indirect effects and that the supervening PCV-NVP significantly diminished the differences in PHiD-CV10 vaccination coverage between the treatment arms."
https://openalex.org/W4206335273,"High-level amplification of MDM2 and other genes in the 12q13–15 locus is a hallmark genetic feature of well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WDLPS and DDLPS, respectively). Detection of this genomic aberration in plasma cell-free DNA may be a clinically useful assay for non-invasive distinction between these liposarcomas and other retroperitoneal tumors in differential diagnosis, and might be useful for the early detection of disease recurrence. In this study, we performed shallow whole genome sequencing of cell-free DNA extracted from 10 plasma samples from 3 patients with DDLPS and 1 patient with WDLPS. In addition, we studied 31 plasma samples from 11 patients with other types of soft tissue tumors. We detected MDM2 amplification in cell-free DNA of 2 of 3 patients with DDLPS. By applying a genome-wide approach to the analysis of cell-free DNA, we also detected amplification of other genes that are known to be recurrently affected in DDLPS. Based on the analysis of one patient with DDLPS with longitudinal plasma samples available, we show that tracking MDM2 amplification in cell-free DNA may be potentially useful for evaluation of response to treatment. The patient with WDLPS and patients with other soft tissue tumors in differential diagnosis were negative for the MDM2 amplification in cell-free DNA. In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting amplification of MDM2 and other DDLPS-associated genes in plasma cell-free DNA using technology that is already routinely applied for other clinical indications. Our results may have clinical implications for improved diagnosis and surveillance of patients with retroperitoneal tumors."
