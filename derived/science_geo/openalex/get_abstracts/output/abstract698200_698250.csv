https://openalex.org/W4289793679,"Pathogenic variants in genes that cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) convey high risks for the development of heart failure through unknown mechanisms. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the transcriptome of 880,000 nuclei from 18 control and 61 failing, nonischemic human hearts with pathogenic variants in DCM and ACM genes or idiopathic disease. We performed genotype-stratified analyses of the ventricular cell lineages and transcriptional states. The resultant DCM and ACM ventricular cell atlas demonstrated distinct right and left ventricular responses, highlighting genotype-associated pathways, intercellular interactions, and differential gene expression at single-cell resolution. Together, these data illuminate both shared and distinct cellular and molecular architectures of human heart failure and suggest candidate therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W4289688512,"The centromere represents a single region in most eukaryotic chromosomes. However, several plant and animal lineages assemble holocentromeres along the entire chromosome length. Here, we compare genome organization and evolution as a function of centromere type by assembling chromosome-scale holocentric genomes with repeat-based holocentromeres from three beak-sedge (Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis) and their closest monocentric relative, Juncus effusus. We demonstrate that transition to holocentricity affected 3D genome architecture by redefining genomic compartments, while distributing centromere function to thousands of repeat-based centromere units genome-wide. We uncover a complex genome organization in R. pubera that hides its unexpected octoploidy and describe a marked reduction in chromosome number for R. tenuis, which has only two chromosomes. We show that chromosome fusions, facilitated by repeat-based holocentromeres, promoted karyotype evolution and diploidization. Our study thus sheds light on several important aspects of genome architecture and evolution influenced by centromere organization."
https://openalex.org/W4289782005,"Kynurenic acid (KynA) is tissue protective in cardiac, cerebral, renal, and retinal ischemia models, but the mechanism is unknown. KynA can bind to multiple receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAChR), multiple ionotropic glutamate receptors, and the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. Here, we show that GPR35 activation was necessary and sufficient for ischemic protection by KynA. When bound by KynA, GPR35 activated Gi- and G12/13-coupled signaling and trafficked to the outer mitochondria membrane, where it bound, apparantly indirectly, to ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (ATPIF1). Activated GPR35, in an ATPIF1-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner, induced ATP synthase dimerization, which prevented ATP loss upon ischemia. These findings provide a rationale for the development of specific GPR35 agonists for the treatment of ischemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4289782019,"The microbiome contributes to the development and maturation of the immune system. In response to commensal bacteria, intestinal CD4 + T lymphocytes differentiate into functional subtypes with regulatory or effector functions. The development of small intestine intraepithelial lymphocytes that coexpress CD4 and CD8αα homodimers (CD4IELs) depends on the microbiota. However, the identity of the microbial antigens recognized by CD4 + T cells that can differentiate into CD4IELs remains unknown. We identified β-hexosaminidase, a conserved enzyme across commensals of the Bacteroidetes phylum, as a driver of CD4IEL differentiation. In a mouse model of colitis, β-hexosaminidase–specific lymphocytes protected against intestinal inflammation. Thus, T cells of a single specificity can recognize a variety of abundant commensals and elicit a regulatory immune response at the intestinal mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W4289782042,"Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful, long-standing model for metazoan development and gene regulation. We profiled chromatin accessibility in almost 1 million and gene expression in half a million nuclei from overlapping windows spanning the entirety of embryogenesis. Leveraging developmental asynchronicity within embryo collections, we applied deep neural networks to infer the age of each nucleus, resulting in continuous, multimodal views of molecular and cellular transitions in absolute time. We identify cell lineages; infer their developmental relationships; and link dynamic changes in enhancer usage, transcription factor (TF) expression, and the accessibility of TFs’ cognate motifs. With these data, the dynamics of enhancer usage and gene expression can be explored within and across lineages at the scale of minutes, including for precise transitions like zygotic genome activation."
https://openalex.org/W4289782035,"Skeletal or concave polyhedral crystals appear in a variety of synthetic processes and natural environments. However, their morphology, size, and orientation are difficult to control because of their highly kinetic growth character. We report a methodology to achieve synchronous, uniaxial, and stepwise growth of micrometer-scale skeletal single crystals from planar-chiral double-decker molecules. Upon drop-casting of a heated ethanol solution onto a quartz substrate, the molecules spontaneously assemble into standing vessel-shaped single crystals uniaxially and synchronously over the wide area of the substrate, with small size polydispersity. The crystal edge is active even after consumption of the molecules and resumes stereoselective growth with successive feeding. The resultant morphology can be packed into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon–like microarchitectures and behaves as a microscopic container."

https://openalex.org/W4289782040,"Carbenes are highly enabling reactive intermediates that facilitate a diverse range of otherwise inaccessible chemistry, including small-ring formation and insertion into strong σ bonds. To access such valuable reactivity, reagents with high entropic or enthalpic driving forces are often used, including explosive (diazo) or unstable ( gem -dihalo) compounds. Here, we report that common aldehydes are readily converted (via stable α-acyloxy halide intermediates) to electronically diverse (donor or neutral) carbenes to facilitate &gt;10 reaction classes. This strategy enables safe reactivity of nonstabilized carbenes from alkyl, aryl, and formyl aldehydes via zinc carbenoids. Earth-abundant metal salts [iron(II) chloride (FeCl 2 ), cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl 2 ), copper(I) chloride (CuCl)] are effective catalysts for these chemoselective carbene additions to σ and π bonds."
https://openalex.org/W4289793654,"Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) reside in a specialized niche that ensures their regenerative capacity. Although we know that innate immune cells infiltrate the niche in response to injury, it remains unclear how MuSCs adapt to this altered environment for initiating repair. Here, we demonstrate that inflammatory cytokine signaling from the regenerative niche impairs the ability of quiescent MuSCs to reenter the cell cycle. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3, but not UTX, allowed MuSCs to overcome inhibitory inflammation signaling by removing trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) marks at the Has2 locus to initiate production of hyaluronic acid, which in turn established an extracellular matrix competent for integrating signals that direct MuSCs to exit quiescence. Thus, JMJD3-driven hyaluronic acid synthesis plays a proregenerative role that allows MuSC adaptation to inflammation and the initiation of muscle repair."
https://openalex.org/W4289793668,"Genetic admixture is central to primate evolution. We combined 50 years of field observations of immigration and group demography with genomic data from ~9 generations of hybrid baboons to investigate the consequences of admixture in the wild. Despite no obvious fitness costs to hybrids, we found signatures of selection against admixture similar to those described for archaic hominins. These patterns were concentrated near genes where ancestry is strongly associated with gene expression. Our analyses also show that introgression is partially predictable across the genome. This study demonstrates the value of integrating genomic and field data for revealing how ""genomic signatures of selection"" (e.g., reduced introgression in low-recombination regions) manifest in nature; moreover, it underscores the importance of other primates as living models for human evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4289793704,"The hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) unit can produce various hormones to regulate immune responses, and some of its downstream hormones or effectors are elevated in cancer patients. We show that the HP unit can promote myelopoiesis and immunosuppression to accelerate tumor growth. Subcutaneous implantation of tumors induced hypothalamus activation and pituitary α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) production in mice. α-MSH acted on bone marrow progenitors to promote myelopoiesis, myeloid cell accumulation, immunosuppression, and tumor growth through its melanocortin receptor MC5R. MC5R peptide antagonist boosted antitumor immunity and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) immunotherapy. Serum α-MSH concentration was elevated and correlated with circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancer patients. Our results reveal a neuroendocrine pathway that suppresses tumor immunity and suggest MC5R as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4289782032,"Meiosis, at the transition between diploid and haploid life cycle phases, is accompanied by reprograming of cell division machinery and followed by a transition back to mitosis. We show that, in Arabidopsis , this transition is driven by inhibition of translation, achieved by a mechanism that involves processing bodies (P-bodies). During the second meiotic division, the meiosis-specific protein THREE-DIVISION MUTANT 1 (TDM1) is incorporated into P-bodies through interaction with SUPPRESSOR WITH MORPHOGENETIC EFFECTS ON GENITALIA 7 (SMG7). TDM1 attracts eIF4F, the main translation initiation complex, temporarily sequestering it in P-bodies and inhibiting translation. The failure of tdm1 mutants to terminate meiosis can be overcome by chemical inhibition of translation. We propose that TDM1-containing P-bodies down-regulate expression of meiotic transcripts to facilitate transition of cell fates to postmeiotic gametophyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4289852750,"Background Current evidence suggests that up to 70% of COVID-19 survivors develop post-COVID symptoms during the following months after infection. Fatigue and dyspnea seem to be the most prevalent post-COVID symptoms. Objective To analyze whether a tele-rehabilitation exercise program is able to improve self-perceived physical exertion in patients with post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea. Methods Sixty-eight COVID-19 survivors exhibiting post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea derived to four Primary Health Care centers located in Madrid were enrolled in this quasi-experimental study. A tele-rehabilitation program based on patient education, physical activity, airway clearing, and breathing exercise interventions was structured on eighteen sessions (3 sessions/week). Self-perceived physical exertion during daily living activities, dyspnea severity, health-related quality of life and distance walked and changes in oxygen saturation and heart rate during the 6-Minute walking test were assessed at baseline, after the program and at 1- and 3-months follow-up periods. Results Daily living activities, dyspnea severity and quality of life improved significantly at all follow-ups (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, a significant increase in oxygen saturation before and after the 6-Minute Walking test was found when compared with baseline (P&lt;0.001). Heart rate adaptations at rest were found during the follow-up periods (P = 0.012). Lower perceived exertion before and after the 6-Minute Walking test were also observed, even if larger distance were walked (P&lt;0.001). Conclusion Tele-rehabilitation programs could be an effective strategy to reduce post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 survivors. In addition, it could also reduce the economic burden of acute COVID-19, reaching a greater number of patients and releasing Intensive Unit Care beds for prioritized patients with a severe disease.

https://openalex.org/W4289526625,"Oakleaf butterflies in the genus Kallima have a polymorphic wing phenotype, enabling these insects to masquerade as dead leaves. This iconic example of protective resemblance provides an interesting evolutionary paradigm that can be employed to study biodiversity. We integrated multi-omic data analyses and functional validation to infer the evolutionary history of Kallima species and investigate the genetic basis of their variable leaf wing patterns. We find that Kallima butterflies diversified in the eastern Himalayas and dispersed to East and Southeast Asia. Moreover, we find that leaf wing polymorphism is controlled by the wing patterning gene cortex, which has been maintained in Kallima by long-term balancing selection. Our results provide macroevolutionary and microevolutionary insights into a model species originating from a mountain ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W4289849075,"Nigella sativa is one of the medicinal plant species that gained popularity for a wide range of medicinal applications due to its seeds which are rich in phytoconstituents. Continuous scientific investigations on N. sativa seeds are needed to better understand its many medicinal potentials. This will also form a composition-based foundation that support several old and/or new case beneficial histories of its seeds. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of N. sativa seeds was phytochemically characterized and evaluated. Different extracts of N. sativa seeds were obtained by maceration and soxhlet extraction methods using different extraction solvents. The obtained extracts were tested using UV-Vis, FTIR, TLC, and GC-MS techniques. Antimicrobial analysis against pathogenic bacterial strains (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis) was carried out by disc diffusion method using different preparations of N. sativa seeds. The screening analysis revealed the presence of all the tested phytochemicals. FT-IR analysis of N. sativa seeds oil extracted with absolute ethanol revealed functional groups that are associated with active ingredients of medicinal value. The GC-MS chromatograms revealed different chemical constituents whose known bioactivities and/or applications are essential in the management of life-threatening infections. Different extracts of N. sativa seeds showed antimicrobial activity with different efficacy against the tested pathogenic bacterial strains. Therefore, this study shows that extracts of N. sativa seeds contain a variety of chemical components and functional groups linked to their antimicrobial properties, and they might be natural precursors of nutraceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W4289849143,"Purpose The Onodera’s prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the haemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte and platelet (HALP) score are immune-nutritional indices that correlate with survival outcomes in several adult solid malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PNI and HALP are associated with survival outcomes in endometrial cancer. Patients and methods Women undergoing management for endometrial cancer were recruited to a single centre prospective cohort study. Pre-treatment PNI and HALP scores were computed for study participants and analysed as continuous variables and by selecting cut-off values based on previous publications. Both parameters were analysed in relation to overall, endometrial cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival using Kaplan-Meier estimation and multivariable Cox proportional regression. Results A total of 439 women, with a median age of 67 years (interquartile range (IQR), 58, 74) and BMI of 31kg/m 2 (IQR 26, 37) were included in the analysis. Most had low-grade (63.3%), early-stage (84.4% stage I/II) endometrial cancer of endometrioid histological subtype (72.7%). Primary treatment was surgery in 98.2% of cases. Adjusted overall mortality hazard ratios for PNI and HALP as continuous variables were 0.97(95%CI 0.94–1.00, p = 0.136) and 0.99(95%CI 0.98–1.01, p = 0.368), respectively. Women with pre-treatment PNI ≥45 had a 45% decrease in both overall (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.33–0.92, p = 0.022) and cancer-specific mortality risk (adjusted HR = 0.55, 95%CI 0.30–0.99, p = 0.048) compared to those with PNI &lt;45. There was no evidence for an effect of PNI on recurrence free survival. HALP scores were associated with adverse clinico-pathologic factors, but not overall, cancer-specific or recurrence-free survival in the multivariable analysis. Conclusion PNI is an independent prognostic factor in endometrial cancer and has the potential to refine pre-operative risk assessment."

We present a high-resolution reconstruction of relative changes in oxygen concentration in the deep North Atlantic for the past 1.5 million years using the carbon isotope gradient between epifaunal and infaunal benthic foraminifera species as a proxy for paleo-oxygen. We report a significant (&gt;40 micromole per kilogram) reduction in glacial Atlantic deep-water oxygenation at ~960 thousand to 900 thousand years ago that coincided with increased continental ice volume and a major change in ocean thermohaline circulation. Paleo-oxygen results support a scenario of decreasing deep-water oxygen concentrations, increased respired carbon storage, and a reduction in glacial p CO 2 across the Middle Pleistocene Transition."
https://openalex.org/W4289334951,"The zinc finger ubiquitin ligase RNF6 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target in several cancers, but understanding its molecular mechanism of degradation has been elusive. In the present study, we find that RNF6 is degraded via auto-ubiquitination in a manner dependent on its Really Interesting New Gene (RING) domain. We determine that when the RING domain is deleted (ΔRING) or the core cysteine residues in the zinc finger are mutated (C632S/C635S), the WT protein, but not the ΔRING or mutant RNF6 protein, undergoes polyubiquitination. We also identify USP7 as a deubiquitinase of RNF6 by tandem mass spectrometry. We show that USP7 interacts with RNF6 and abolishes its K48-linked polyubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation. In contrast, we found a USP7-specific inhibitor promotes RNF6 polyubiquitination, degradation, and cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrate the anti-leukemic drug Nilotinib and anti-myeloma drug Panobinostat (LBH589) induce RNF6 K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation in both multiple myeloma (MM) and leukemia cells. In agreement with our hypothesis on the mode of RNF6 degradation, we show these drugs promote RNF6 auto-ubiquitination in an in vitro ubiquitination system without other E3 ligases. Consistently, reexpression of RNF6 ablates drug-induced MM and leukemia cell apoptosis. Therefore, our results reveal that RNF6 is a RING E3 ligase that undergoes auto-ubiquitination, which could be abolished by USP7 and induced by anti-cancer drugs. We propose that chemical induction of RNF6 auto-ubiquitination and degradation could be a novel strategy for the treatment of hematological malignancies including MM and leukemia."

https://openalex.org/W4289855282,"Objective We aimed to provide an analysis of A . baumannii complex (ABC) isolated from blood cultures in South Africa. Materials and methods ABC surveillance was conducted from 1 April 2017 to 30 September 2019 at 19 hospital sites from blood cultures of any age and sex. Organism identification was performed using the MALDI-TOF MS and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), MicroScan Walkaway System. We confirmed colistin resistance with Sensititre, FRCOL panel, and selected for whole-genome sequencing. Results During the study period, we identified 4822 cases of ABC, of which 2152 cases were from 19 enhanced surveillance sites were reported during the enhanced surveillance period (1 August 2018 to 30 September 2019). Males accounted for 54% (2611/4822). Of the cases with known age, 41% (1968/4822) were infants (&lt; 1-year-old). Seventy-eight percent (1688/2152) of cases had a known hospital outcome, of which 36% (602/1688) died. HIV status was known for 69% (1168/1688) of cases, and 14% (238/1688) were positive. Eighty-two percent (1389/1688) received antimicrobial treatment in admission. Three percent (35/1389) of cases received single colistin. Four percent (75/2033) were resistant to colistin. At least 75% of the isolates (1530/2033) can be classified as extensively drug-resistant (XDR), with resistance to most antibiotics except for colistin. The majority, 83% (20/24), of the colistin-resistant isolates were of the sequence type (ST) 1. Resistance genes, both plasmid- and chromosomal- mediated were not observed. Although all isolates had, nine efflux pump genes related to antimicrobial resistance. Conclusion Our surveillance data contributed to a better understanding of the natural course of A . baumannii disease, the patient characteristics among infants, and the level of resistance. At least two-thirds of the isolates were extensively drug-resistant, and four percent of isolates were resistant to colistin."
https://openalex.org/W4289833875,"Background Pre-eclampsia can be described as new-onset hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg) together with proteinuria (24-hr urinary protein ≥ 0.3 g) or any indication of end-organ damage after 20 weeks of gestation. Liver and kidney dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary edema, and neurologic dysfunction are common manifestations of end-organ damage due to pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is the most common cause of liver and kidney dysfunction due to hypoxia and endothelial dysfunction. Hyperuricemia indicates kidney dysfunction and is considered a predictor of the severity of preeclampsia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the utility of the levels of serum uric acid and liver function tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] as biomarkers of preeclampsia-related organ damage. Methods and materials An institutional-based comparative cross-sectional study design was conducted, and a total of 102 subjects (51 patients with preeclampsia and 51 normotensive pregnant women) were recruited. The parameters measured were levels of serum uric acid and liver function tests. Results and discussion There were statistically significant differences in the mean serum uric acid, ALT, and AST levels between preeclamptic pregnant women and normotensive pregnant women (p&lt;0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the mean total and direct bilirubin levels. There was also a significant difference in mean serum uric acid, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase levels across different gestational age categories. Conclusion Our study revealed that serum uric acid, ALT, and AST levels were higher in pre-eclamptic pregnant women compared to those of normotensive pregnant women, and the differences were statistically significant. As such, serum uric acid and liver function tests may be considered biomarkers of pre-eclampsia-related end-organ damage."
https://openalex.org/W4289833891,"Background Burnout is associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. Few studies have examined burnout prevalence related to healthcare workers during the pandemic. This study investigated the burnout prevalence and contributing factors among HCWs, including medical staff and support staff, during the COVID-19 pandemic in an urban community in Thailand. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was distributed among HCWs in Bangkok, Thailand, from July–August 2021. The independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the contributing factors and burnout items. Variable factors associated with burnout among HCWs were used in multiple linear regression models. Results A total of 517 HCWs’ survey responses were received. Most participants were medical staff (55.3%), female (83.4%), and over the age of 35 (59.4%); most participants (65.6%) did not have any diseases but had family members that did (63.6%). The prevalence of overall burnout presented among medical staff (25.9%). The results of the multiple linear regression models found that female (vs. male, β 0.088; 95% CI 0.033, 6.614) was higher associated with overall burnout score. In addition, hours of sleep as &gt; 6 hr./day (vs. ≤ 6 hr./day, β -0.120; 95% CI -6.012, -0.969) was lower associated with overall burnout score. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of addressing burnout among HCWs, in which female medical staff who slept less than six hours per day were associated with burnout. Our study further suggested that both intervention and identification are needed of frontline HCWs to prevent and reduce the risk of burnout, as the proportion of females compared to males is high. Thus, the government should provide support in these areas to prevent a humanitarian crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4289855725,"Both post-traumatic growth (PTG) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with spirituality and different kinds of repetitive thinking, such as deliberate rumination (DR) and intrusive rumination (IR), respectively. This study aimed to examine if spirituality modifies the relationship between types of rumination and trauma outcomes. Ninety-six students completed an online survey of four questionnaires in a cross-sectional online survey: The Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Event Related Rumination Inventory, the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short form and the Expressions of Spirituality Inventory- Revised. Findings revealed that spirituality was related to DR and PTG, but not to IR or PTSD symptoms. Moderation analysis showed that spirituality significantly moderated the relationship between PTG and DR, but not the relationship between PTSD and IR. These findings indicate that while spirituality has no relationship with negative outcomes of trauma, it may help individuals to ruminate in a constructive manner in order to develop positive outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4289336060,"G protein-coupled olfactory receptors (ORs) enable us to detect innumerous odorants. They are also ectopically expressed in nonolfactory tissues and emerging as attractive drug targets. ORs can be promiscuous or highly specific, which is part of a larger mechanism for odor discrimination. Here, we demonstrate that the OR extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) plays critical roles in OR promiscuity and specificity. Using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling, we constructed 3D OR models in which ECL2 forms a lid over the orthosteric pocket. We demonstrate using molecular dynamics simulations that ECL2 controls the shape and volume of the odorant-binding pocket, maintains the pocket hydrophobicity, and acts as a gatekeeper of odorant binding. Therefore, we propose the interplay between the specific orthosteric pocket and the variable, less specific ECL2 controls OR specificity and promiscuity. Furthermore, the 3D models created here enabled virtual screening of new OR agonists and antagonists, which exhibited a 70% hit rate in cell assays. Our approach can potentially be generalized to structure-based ligand screening for other G protein-coupled receptors that lack high-resolution 3D structures."
https://openalex.org/W4289340013,"The Na+,K+-ATPase generates electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane via a functional cycle that includes various phosphoenzyme intermediates. However, the structure and function of these intermediates and how metal fluorides mimick them require further investigation. Here, we describe a 4.0 Å resolution crystal structure and functional properties of the pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase stabilized by the inhibitor beryllium fluoride (denoted E2-BeFx). E2-BeFx is expected to mimic properties of the E2P phosphoenzyme, yet with unknown characteristics of ion and ligand binding. The structure resembles the E2P form obtained by phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate (Pi) and stabilized by cardiotonic steroids, including a low-affinity Mg2+ site near ion binding site II. Our anomalous Fourier analysis of the crystals soaked in Rb+ (a K+ congener) followed by a low-resolution rigid-body refinement (6.9-7.5 Å) revealed preocclusion transitions leading to activation of the dephosphorylation reaction. We show that the Mg2+ location indicates a site of initial K+ recognition and acceptance upon binding to the outward-open E2P state after Na+ release. Furthermore, using binding and activity studies, we find that the BeFx-inhibited enzyme is also able to bind ADP/ATP and Na+. These results relate the E2-BeFx complex to a transient K+- and ADP-sensitive E∗P intermediate of the functional cycle of the Na+,K+-ATPase, prior to E2P."
https://openalex.org/W4289525359,"Disordered expression and distribution of plasma membrane proteins at the cell surface leads to diverse malignant phenotypes in tumors, including cell invasion. The ubiquitin-specific protease TRE17/USP6, an oncogene identified in Ewing sarcoma, is highly expressed in several cancers and locally aggressive tumor-like lesions. We have previously demonstrated that TRE17 regulates the trafficking of plasma membrane proteins that enter cells via clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE); TRE17 prevents CIE cargo proteins from being targeted to lysosomes for degradation by deubiquitylating them. However, functional insights into the effects of TRE17-mediated CIE cargo trafficking on cell invasion remain unknown. Here, we show that increased expression of TRE17 enhances invasiveness of the human sarcoma cell line HT-1080 by elevating the cell surface levels of the membrane glycoprotein CD147, which plays a central role in tumor progression. We demonstrate overexpression of TRE17 decreases ubiquitylated CD147, which is accompanied by suppression of CD147 transport to lysosomes, resulting in the stabilization and increase of cell surface-localized CD147. On the other hand, we show knockdown of TRE17 decreases cell surface CD147, which is coupled with reduced production of matrix metalloproteinases, the enzymes responsible for extracellular matrix degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of CD147 by a specific inhibitor alleviated the TRE17-promoted tumor cell invasion. We therefore propose a model for the pathogenesis of TRE17-driven tumors in which TRE17 increases CD147 at the cell surface by preventing its lysosomal degradation, which in turn enhances matrix metalloproteinase synthesis and matrix degradation, thereby promoting tumor cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W4289782651,"The aim of the present study was to reveal the associations between skeletal and soft tissue features of the nasomaxillary complex and development and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adolescents. A total of 100 adolescents (mean age, 14.9 ± 1.4 years; age range, 13–17 years) were enrolled. All participants underwent full-night polysomnography and had an assessment of size and position of the tongue, tonsillar size, body mass index (BMI), and circumference of the waist, neck, and hip. The skeletal features of the nasomaxillary complex, including the zygomatic arch width, nasal cavity width, nasal base width, intercanine width, intermolar width, maxillary dental arch length, palatal vault angle, palatal depth, and SNA were measured on the three-dimensional images constructed with computed tomography data. Participants with an apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) of lower than 5 (AHI ≤ 5) were classified as control and participants while those with an AHI of greater than 5 were classified as OSA group. Each variable with a significant outcome in the independent T-test and age and sex factors were integrated into the multivariate linear regression and the dependent variable was AHI. There were significant differences in the BMI and hip circumference between two groups. The width of nasal base, palatal vault angle and SNA also showed significant differences between groups. The results from multivariate linear regression demonstrated that the BMI, width of the nasal base, and SNA showed significant contributions to the severity of OSA in adolescents. The features of the nasomaxillary complex seemed to have significant influences on development and severity of OSA."
https://openalex.org/W4289782690,"Captive environments trigger the propagation and multiplication of parasites among different reptile species, thus weakening their immune response and causing infections and diseases. Technological advances of convolutional neural networks have opened a new field for detecting and classifying diseases which have shown great potential to overcome the shortcomings of manual detection performed by experts. Therefore, we propose an approach to identify six captive reptiles parasitic agents (Ophionyssus natricis, Blastocystis sp, Oxiurdo egg, Rhytidoides similis, Strongyloides, Taenia) or the absence of such parasites from a microscope stool images dataset. Towards this end, we first use an image segmentation stage to detect the parasite within the image, which combines the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) technique, the OTSU binarization method, and morphological operations. Then, we carry out a classification stage through MobileNet CNN under a transfer learning scheme. This method was validated on a stool image dataset containing 3616 images data samples and 26 videos from the six parasites mentioned above. The results obtained indicate that our transfer learning-based approach can learn a helpful representation from the dataset. We obtained an average accuracy of 94.26% across the seven classes (i.e., six parasitic agents and the absence of parasites), which statistically outperformed, at a 95% confidence level, a custom CNN trained from scratch."

https://openalex.org/W4289850483,"Manuscript symbols can be stored, recognized and retrieved from an entropic digital memory that is associative and distributed but yet declarative; memory retrieval is a constructive operation, memory cues to objects not contained in the memory are rejected directly without search, and memory operations can be performed through parallel computations. Manuscript symbols, both letters and numerals, are represented in Associative Memory Registers that have an associated entropy. The memory recognition operation obeys an entropy trade-off between precision and recall, and the entropy level impacts on the quality of the objects recovered through the memory retrieval operation. The present proposal is contrasted in several dimensions with neural networks models of associative memory. We discuss the operational characteristics of the entropic associative memory for retrieving objects with both complete and incomplete information, such as severe occlusions. The experiments reported in this paper add evidence on the potential of this framework for developing practical applications and computational models of natural memory."
https://openalex.org/W4289854357,"Objectives Karoli Lwanga Hospital and Global Emergency Care, a 501(c)(3) nongovernmental organization, operate an Emergency Department (ED) in Uganda’s rural Rukungiri District. Despite available emergency care (EC), preventable death and disability persist due to delayed patient presentations. This study seeks to understand the emergency care seeking behavior of community members utilizing the established ED. Methods We purposefully sampled and interviewed patients and caregivers presenting to the ED more than 12 hours after onset of chief complaint in January-March 2017 to include various ages, genders, and complaints. Semistructured interviews addressing actions taken before seeking EC and delays to presentation once the need for EC was recognized were conducted until a diverse sample and theoretical saturation were obtained. An interdisciplinary and multicultural research team conducted thematic analysis based on descriptive phenomenology. Results The 50 ED patients for whom care was sought (mean age 33) had approximately even distribution of gender, as well as occupation (none, subsistence farmers and small business owner). Interviews were conducted with 13 ED patients and 37 caregivers, on the behalf of patients when unavailable. The median duration of patients’ chief complaint on ED presentation was 5.5 days. On average, participants identified severe symptoms necessitating EC 1 day before presentation. Four themes of treatment delay before and after severity were recognized were identified: 1) Cultural factors and limited knowledge of emergency signs and initial actions to take; 2) Use of local health facilities despite perception of inadequate services; 3) Lack of resources to cover the anticipated cost of obtaining EC; 4) Inadequate transportation options. Conclusions Interventions are warranted to address each of the four major reasons for treatment delay. The next stage of formative research will generate intervention strategies and assess the opportunities and challenges to implementation with community and health system stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W4289782023,"Biomonitoring data of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) in children is scarce and limited to controlled exposure and surveillance studies. We conducted a 24-hour observational exposure and human biomonitoring study designed to estimate use of and exposure to DEET-based insect repellents by Canadian children in an overnight summer camp setting. Here, we present our study design and methodology. In 2019, children between the ages of 7 and 13 took part in the study (n = 126). Children controlled their use of DEET-based insect repellents, and provided an account of their activities at camp that could impact insect repellent absorption. Children provided a total of 389 urine samples throughout the study day, and reported the time that they applied insect repellent, which allowed us to contextualize urinary DEET and metabolite concentrations with respect to the timing of insect repellent application. DEET (2.3% <Limits of detection (LOD)) and two metabolites, N,N-diethyl-m-(hydroxymethyl)benzamide (DHMB) (0% <LOD) and 3-diethylcarbamoyl benzoic acid (DCBA) (0% <LOD), were measured in urine samples. Three time difference scenarios were established for the data and analysed to account for these complex time-dependent data, which demonstrated the need for DEET biomonitoring to be done in context with the timing of a known DEET exposure or over the course of at least 14 to 24 hours to better capture the excretion curve. To our knowledge, this is the first field-based study of real-world exposure to DEET in children. Our experience and results suggest that this type of real-world observational exposure study with a human biomonitoring component can generate data reflective of actual exposure, but is not without significant logistic, practical, and analytical challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4289782740,"The traffic environment of an extra-long expressway tunnel is more complex than that of a long tunnel, which increases the driving risk. The visual load of drivers can be used to evaluate driving safety and comfort. To reveal drivers’ visual load characteristics at the entrance and exit of extra-long tunnels on mountainous expressways, this study conducted vehicle tests with 12 drivers at Gonghe extra-long tunnel on the Yu-Xiang expressway in the Wulong District. An eye tracker, non-contact multifunctional velocimetry, illuminometer, and other test equipment were used to record drivers’ pupil areas, velocity, and illuminance when entering and leaving the tunnel. The change characteristics of drivers’ pupil areas were studied. The maximum transient velocity value (MTPA) of the pupil area was selected as an index to evaluate the visual load degree. Based on velocity and illuminance coupling, a visual load model was constructed using the optimized support vector machine (GA-SVM). The influence of velocity and illuminance on the MTPA in the tunnel’s approach, entrance, exit, and departure section was analyzed. The results show that drivers’ psychological tension order at the entrance and exit is entrance section ≈ exit section &gt; departure section &gt; approach section. In the approach section, the visual load is mainly affected by environmental illumination. In the entrance and exit sections, the visual load is positively correlated with velocity and negatively correlated with illuminance, and velocity has a greater impact on visual load. In the tunnel departure section, the two variables synergistically influence the driving visual load. The research results provide theoretical support for the safety design and management of extra-long tunnel entrances and exits."

Although most FL patients respond well to treatment, few with specific traits have a poor prognosis; the latter are difficult to define.We retrospectively analyzed data from 143 FL patients treated at the University of Debrecen since 2009 and investigated prognostic factors that may influence the survival of FL patients.A maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) cut-off of 9.85 at the staging positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) (p = 0.0001, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.2535, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1118-0.4878) and a lymphocyte/monocyte (Ly/Mo) ratio of 3.41 (p = 0.0027, HR: 2.997, 95% CI: 1.463-6.142), drawn at diagnosis, significantly predicted FL patients' progression-free survival (PFS). A staging SUVmax >9.85 with Ly/Mo <3.41 could delineate a high-risk group of FL patients (p<0.0001, HR: 0.0957, 95% CI: 0.03416-0.2685). Similarly, a significant difference was shown with an SUVmax cut-off of 3.15 at the interim PET/CT (p<0.0001, HR: 0.1614, 95% CI: 0.06684-0.3897). A staging SUVmax >9.85 in conjunction with interim SUVmax >3.15 predicted poor prognosis (p<0.0001, HR: 0.1037, 95% CI: 0.03811-0.2824). The PFS difference was translated into overall survival (OS) advantage (p = 0.0506, HR: 0.1187, 95% CI: 0.01401-1.005).Biological prognostic factors, such as the Ly/Mo ratio, may improve the prognostic assessment of staging PET/CT. The survival advantage observed in PFS is translated into OS when determined using a combination of staging and interim SUVmax. We recommend investigating additional biological prognostic factors while highlighting the role of PET/CT in FL."

Patients eligible for inclusion were consecutive adults, 30-75 years, receiving care at the outpatient department of a general hospital in eastern Uganda. We determined the sensitivity, specificity and optimum cut-off points for HBA1C and FPG tests using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as a clinical reference standard.A total of 1659 participants underwent FPG testing of whom 310 were also HBA1C and OGTT tested. A total of 113 tested positive for diabetes and 168 for AGR on the OGTT. At recommended cut-off points for diabetes, the HBA1C and FPG tests had comparable sensitivity [69.8% (95% CI 46.3-86.1) versus 62.6% (95% CI 41.5-79.8), respectively] and specificity [98.6% (95% CI 95.4-99.6) versus 99.4% (95% CI 98.9-99.7), respectively]. Similarly, the sensitivity of HBA1C and the FPG tests for Abnormal Glucose Regulation (AGR) at ADA cut-offs were comparable [58.9% (95% CI 46.7-70.2) vs 47.7% (95% CI 37.3-58.4), respectively]; however, the HBA1C test had lower specificity [70.7% (95% CI 65.1-75.8)] than the FPG test [93.5% (95% CI 88.6-96.4)]. At the optimum cut-offs points for diabetes [45.0 mmol/mol (6.3%) for HBA1C and 6.4 mmol/L (115.2 mg/dl) for FPG], HBA1C and FPG sensitivity [71.2% (95% CI 46.9-87.8) versus 72.7% (95% CI 49.5-87.8), respectively] and specificity [95.1% (95% CI91.8 97.2) versus 98.7% (95% CI 98.0 99.2), respectively] were comparable. Similarly, at the optimum cut-off points for AGR [42.0 mmol/mol (6.0%) for the HBA1C and 5.5 mmol/l (99.0 mg/dl) for the FPG test], HBA1C and FPG sensitivity [42.3% (95% CI 31.8-53.6) and 53.2 (95% CI 43.1-63.1), respectively] and specificity [89.1% (95% CI 84.1 92.7) and 92.7% (95% CI 91.0 94.1), respectively] were comparable.HBA1C is a viable alternative diabetes screening and confirmatory test to the FPG test; however, the utility of both tests in screening for prediabetes in this outpatient population is limited."
https://openalex.org/W4289849006,"Agricultural practice in adjusting planting density and harvest date are important factors for plant development and crop improvement, reaching maximum yields and enhancing the production of secondary metabolites. However, it is unclear as to the optimal planting densities during mass production that encourage consistent, high yield secondary metabolite content. For this, controlled environment, crop production facilities such as plant factories with artificial lighting (PFAL) offer opportunity to enhance quality and stabilize production of herbal plants. This study assessed the effect of plant density and harvest date on physiological responses, yield and andrographolide (AP1) content in Andrographis paniculata (Andrographis) using hydroponic conditions in a PFAL system. Andrographis, harvested at vegetative stage (30 days after transplanting; 30 DAT) and initial stage of flowering (60 DAT) exhibited no significant differences in growth parameters or andrographolide accumulation according to planting densities. Harvest time at flowering stage (90 DAT) showed the highest photosynthetic rates at a planting density of 15 plants m-2. Highest yield, number of leaves, and Andrographolide (AP1) content (mg per gram of DW in m2) were achieved at a more moderate planting density (30 plants m-2). Finally, five out of seventeen indices of leaf reflectance reveal high correlation (r = 0.8 to 1.0 and r = -0.8 to -1.0, P<0.01) with AP1 content. These results suggest that a planting density of 30 plants m-2 and harvest time of 90 DAT provide optimal growing condition under the hydroponic PFAL system."

This study evaluated knowledge, and attitudes regarding unused and expired medicines and explored medicine storage and disposal practices among selected households in the Kathmandu valley, Nepal.A cross-sectional study with a two-stage cluster survey design was done using a semi-structured questionnaire from April to October 2021. The sample size (total number of households) after adjusting for design effect and non-response rate was 210 and the study population was the household heads. Simple random sampling was done to select clusters during the first stage and systematic random sampling to select households during the second stage. Descriptive statistics and t-test/one-way ANOVA were used to compare the respondents' average knowledge scores. Practice variables were presented using frequency distribution.Around half the respondents were from the Kathmandu district, nearly 20% were from Bhaktapur and 30% were from Lalitpur. Nearly two-thirds were male and about 25% had a bachelor's degree. Nearly 90% of respondents agreed that storage of excess medicines at home may promote self-medication. Similarly, 97.6% of respondents agreed there is a lack of adequate information on the safe disposal of unused medicines. The majority [125 (59.5%)] of participants always checked the expiry date of medicines. The safe methods of medicine disposal were not known by 137 (65.2%) participants. Throwing in a dustbin was the preferred method of expired medicine disposal.The level of knowledge and practice of disposing of unused and expired medicines requires improvement. Educational interventions may help improve awareness further. Creating a chart summarizing disposal procedures of common medicines is important. Similar studies in other regions are required."
https://openalex.org/W4289853583,"The mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is necessary for the morbidity of tuberculosis (TB), but it is insufficient. Many risk factors increase the risk of disease among infected people. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of modifiable risk factors of TB and their related population attributable fraction (PAF) in the marginal population of Markazi province in Iran.In this cross-sectional study, the prevalence of the modifiable risk factors of TB was estimated. We designed and validated a questionnaire to determine the risk factors. The measures of association for the modifiable risk factors of TB were obtained via the review of published literature. We calculated the PAF for each modifiable risk factor.Out of the 1275 calculated sample size, 1146 people participated in this study, and the participation rate was 89.9%. The mean age was 39.26. Out of 1146 participants, 76% did not know anything regarding TB. The highest prevalence was related to the lack of physical activity (58.73%), lack of fish consumption (50.79%), lack of red meat consumption (21.20%), and secondhand smoke (19.02%). The highest PAF was related to secondhand smoke; this value based on the crude relative risk (RR) and crude odds ratio (OR) was 24.54% and 23.44%, respectively. Based on crude hazard ratio (HR) and crude OR, the PAF for smoking was 14.81% and 11.19%, respectively. PAF for lack of BCG vaccination based on the crude OR was 14.79%.Based on this study's results, poor nutrition, secondhand smoke, smoking, lack of BCG vaccination, and diabetes are the main prevalent modifiable risk factors for TB. The highest PAF for TB was related to secondhand smoke, smoking, lack of BCG vaccination, and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4289782048,"Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells (PCs), has diverse genetic underpinnings and in rare cases these include amplification of the lymphotoxin b receptor ( Ltbr ) locus. LTβR has well defined roles in supporting lymphoid tissue development and function through actions in stromal and myeloid cells, but whether it is functional in PCs is unknown. Here we showed that Ltbr mRNA was upregulated in mouse PCs compared to follicular B cells, but deficiency in the receptor did not cause a reduction in PC responses to a T-dependent or T-independent immunogen. However, LTβR overexpression (OE) enhanced PC formation in vitro after LPS or anti-CD40 stimulation. In vivo, LTβR OE led to increased antigen-specific splenic and bone marrow (BM) plasma cells responses. LTβR OE PCs had increased expression of Nfkb2 and of the NF-kB target genes Bcl2 and Mcl1 , factors involved in the formation of long-lived BM PCs. Our findings suggest a pathway by which Ltbr gene amplifications may contribute to MM development through increased NF-kB activity and induction of an anti-apoptotic transcriptional program."
https://openalex.org/W4289782706,"Aims This study aimed to examine the association between mental health problems and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) among in-school adolescents 13–19 years in the Harari region, eastern Ethiopia. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 3227 in-school adolescents aged 13 to 19 using multistage sampling. The KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire assessed health-related quality of life (HrQoL), while a self-administered version of the strength and difficulty questionnaire (SDQ) examined mental health issues. Data were double entered, validated, and cleaned using EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using STATA 14.1. An ordinal logistic regression model investigated the link between the outcome variable and the predictors. The results were reported using an odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A quarter of the adolescents (23%) reported poor health-related quality of life; adolescents with internalizing and externalizing mental health problems had the lowest health-related quality of life. After controlling for potential confounders, adolescents with abnormal (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.59) and borderline (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.78) levels of internalizing problems had a 52% and 41% lower probability of having high HrQoL than those with normal levels. Furthermore, individuals with abnormal (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.77) and borderline (AOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45, 0.92) levels of externalizing difficulties had a 41% and 36% lower chance of having a high health-related quality of life. Conclusions Nearly a quarter of in-school adolescents had poor health-related quality of life. High scores for internalizing and externalizing mental health problems significantly impacted the adolescents’ health-related quality of life. This emphasizes the need to address mental health issues in the school setting to improve adolescents’ overall quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4289782739,"In this study, a comprehensive treatment process based on the rotary injection of Ar+CO2 Mg-Al alloy melt is proposed. The effect of carbon on the grain refinement of Mg-Al alloy is studied according to the proposed integrated treatment process. The regularity of carbon refinement in the Mg-Al alloy is examined by microstructural observation and theoretical calculation. The results show that carbon has no effect on the grain refinement of Mg-Al alloy when the Al content is less than 1wt.%. However, when the Al content reaches 2 wt.%, the refining effect is obvious, and the grain refinement efficiency is 62%. The refining effect increases with the increase in the Al content, and the refinement efficiency becomes 79% when the Al content reaches 9 wt.%. The size of Al-C-O in the matrix is approximately 5μm, which confirms the existence of Al4C3 phase exists as a heterogeneous nucleating agent. The theoretical calculations suggest that the Al4C3 heterogeneous nucleating agent cannot be formed when the Al content in the Mg alloy is less than 1.34%, so there is no thinning effect under such Al content. The crystallographic calculations reveal that the mismatch between the Al4C3 phase and Mg alloy matrix is only 4.05%, and Al4C3 can exist as a heterogeneous nucleating agent for α-Mg phase. Combining the measured solidification curves with the classical nucleation theory, the wetting angle of Mg-Al alloy on Al4C3 is calculated to be 24.3°."
https://openalex.org/W4289782742,"In foot and ankle infections, cases with apparent soft-tissue necrosis or purulent fluid collections definitely require surgical treatments. However, clinicians often have difficulty in determining whether to perform surgery in ambiguous cases without these findings. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the delta neutrophil index as a predictor of surgical treatment in patients with foot and ankle infections.In total, 66 patients diagnosed with foot and ankle infections who underwent the delta neutrophil index test were retrospectively investigated. Medical records, including data on diabetes mellitus status, delta neutrophil index values, white blood cell count, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level, were retrospectively investigated. Logistic regression models were analyzed for the correlation between biomarkers, such as the delta neutrophil index and surgical treatment. The area under the curve was investigated to evaluate the cut-off value of the logistic model in predicting surgery.The relationship between the delta neutrophil index and surgical treatment was analyzed. The delta neutrophil index, adjusted for diabetes mellitus, was the best predictor of future surgical intervention. Based on the Youden index, the cutoff point (the equation's adjusted by diabetes mellitus) for the prediction of surgical treatment was defined as a probability of 0.3, with sensitivity and specificity of 82.4% and 77.6%, respectively.Based on the present study, the delta neutrophil index can help clinicians decide the appropriate surgical treatment for foot and ankle infections at the right time."

Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the risk of subsequent PAOD in patients with lower leg fracture who received fixation and non-fixation treatments.We included 6538 patients with lower leg fracture who received non-fixation treatment and a matched cohort comprising 26152 patients who received fixation treatment from the National Health Insurance Database. Patients were frequency matched according to age, sex, and index year. The incidence and risk of PAOD in patients with lower leg fracture who received fixation and non-fixation treatments were evaluated via the stratification of different characteristics and comorbidities.Non-fixation treatment, male sex, older age (≥ 50 years old), diabetes mellitus, and gout were associated with a significantly higher risk of lower extremity PAOD compare to each comparison group, respectively. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between fixation treatment and a lower risk of lower extremity PAOD in women (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.90), women aged > 50 years (aHR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38-0.96), and patients with coronary artery disease (aHR = 0.43, 95% CI = (0.23-0.81). Further, patients with fixation treatment had a significantly lower risk of lower extremity PAOD within 2 years after trauma (aHR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34-0.97). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidence of PAOD was significantly higher in the non-fixation treatment group than in the fixation treatment group at the end of the 10-year follow-up period (log-rank test: P = 0.022).Patients with lower leg fracture who received non-fixation treatment had a significantly higher risk of PAOD than those who received fixation treatment. Moreover, the risk of PAOD was higher in women aged > 50 years, as well as in coronary artery disease patients who received non-fixation treatment than in those who received fixation treatment. Therefore, regular assessment of vessel patency are recommended for these patients. Nevertheless, further studies must be conducted to validate the results of our study."

The purpose was to compare the achievement of treatment targets and outcome in relation to vasoactive strategy in AMICS patients stratified according to the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) shock classification.Retrospective analysis of patients with AMICS admitted to cardiac intensive care unit at two tertiary cardiac centers during 2010-2017 with retrieval of real-time hemodynamic data and dosages of vasoactive drugs from intensive care unit databases.Out of 1,249 AMICS patients classified into SCAI class C, D, and E, mortality increased for each shock stage from 34% to 60%, and 82% (p<0.001). Treatment targets of mean arterial blood pressure > 65mmHg and venous oxygen saturation > 55% were reached in the majority of patients; however, more patients in SCAI class D and E had values below treatment targets within 24 hours (p<0.001) despite higher vasoactive load and increased use of epinephrine for each severity stage (p<0.001). In univariate analysis no significant difference in mortality within SCAI class D and E regarding vasoactive strategy was observed, however in SCAI class C, epinephrine was associated with higher mortality and a significantly higher vasoactive load to reach treatment targets. In multivariate analysis there was no statistically association between individually vasoactive choice within each SCAI class and 30-day mortality.Hemodynamic treatment targets were achieved in most patients at the expense of increased vasoactive load and more frequent use of epinephrine for each shock severity stage. Mortality was high regardless of vasoactive strategy; only in SCAI class C, epinephrine was associated with a significantly higher mortality, but the signal was not significant in adjusted analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4289854356,"Background Preeclampsia is one of the top maternal morbidity and mortality that disproportionately affects pregnant women in low and middle-income countries where access and quality of health services are limited. People in different areas perceive preeclampsia differently which directly or indirectly affects the timing and place of heath seeking. Positive perception about perceived causes, perceived complications, and prevention of preeclampsia is central for the prediction and early diagnosis of the disease. However, little is known about the perception of pregnant women towards preeclampsia in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the perception towards preeclampsia and perceived barriers to early health-seeking among pregnant women in selected Hospitals of South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A qualitative study using phenomenological approach was implemented among 20 purposively selected pregnant women who visited health facilities for antenatal care service in four selected Hospitals of the South Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region. Data were collected through an in-depth interview (IDI) using a semi-structured interview guide from January to February 2020. Thematic analysis was executed using Open Code Software version 4.03. Results The majority of the participants believed preeclampsia as a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disease and mainly associated it with overweight and nutritional problems. With regards to the perceived severity, the study participants agreed that preeclampsia can lead women to death. Personal delay, lack of awareness about the disease, transport problem, and low socioeconomic condition were perceived as the major reasons for the delay to early health-seeking (the 1 st and the 2 nd delay). While poor service provision and long waiting times were the barriers to receive services at the health facility level (the 3 rd delay). Conclusion The majority of the participants believed preeclampsia as a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disease and mainly associated it with overweight and nutritional problems. The finding of this study implied that awareness creation about the danger of hypertension during pregnancy and its risk reduction mechanisms shall be emphasized. The care provision at health facilities shall be improved by decreasing long waiting time which discourages service utilizations aside from improving early seeking behavior of pregnant women through different interventions."
