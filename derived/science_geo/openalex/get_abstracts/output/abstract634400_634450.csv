We describe challenges to, and strategies that support, patients' priorities-aligned decision-making.Participant observation qualitative study.Primary care and cardiology practices in Connecticut.Ten primary care clinicians, five cardiologists, and the Patient Priorities implementation team (four geriatricians, physician expert in clinician training, behavioral medicine expert). The patients discussed were ≥ 66 years with >3 chronic conditions and ≥10 medications or saw ≥ two specialists.Following initial training and experience in providing Patient Priorities Care, the clinicians and Patient Priorities implementation team participated in 21 case-based, group discussions (10 face-to-face;11 telephonic). Using emergent learning (i.e. learning which arises from interactions among the participants), participants discussed challenges, posed solutions, and worked together to determine how to align care options with the health priorities of 35 patients participating in the Patient Priorities Care pilot.Challenges to, and strategies for, aligning decision-making with patient's health priorities.Categories of challenges discussed among participants included uncertainty, complexity, and multiplicity of problems and treatments; difficulty switching to patients' priorities as the focus of decision-making; and differing perspectives between patients and clinicians, and among clinicians. Strategies identified to support patient priorities-aligned decision-making included starting with one thing that matters most to each patient; conducting serial trials of starting, stopping, or continuing interventions; focusing on function (i.e. achieving patient's desired activities) rather than eliminating symptoms; basing communications, decision-making, and effectiveness on patients' priorities not solely on diseases; and negotiating shared decisions when there are differences in perspectives.The discrete set of challenges encountered and the implementable strategies identified suggest that patient priorities-aligned decision-making in the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions is feasible, albeit complicated. Findings require replication in additional settings and determination of their effect on patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2950121766,"Rapid and non-destructive estimation of plant water status is essential for adjusting field practices and irrigation schemes of winter wheat. The objective of this study was to find new combination spectral indices based on canopy reflectance for the estimation of plant water status. Two experiments with different irrigation regimes were conducted in 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. The canopy spectra were collected at different growth stages of winter wheat. The raw and derivative reflectance of canopy spectra showed obvious responses to the change of plant water status. Except for equivalent water thickness (EWT), other water metrics had good relationships with new combination spectral indices (R2>0.7). An acceptable model of canopy water content (CWC) was established with the best spectral index (RVI (1605, 1712)). Models of leaf water content (LWC) and plant water content (PWC) had better performances. Optimal spectral index of LWC was FDRVI (687, 531), having R2, RMSE and RPD of 0.77, 2.181 and 2.09; R2, RMSE and RPD of 0.87, 2.652 and 2.34 for calibration and validation, respectively. And PWC could be well estimated with FDDVI (688, 532) (R2, RMSE and RPD of 0.79, 3.136 and 2.21; R2, RMSE and RPD of 0.83, 3.702 and 2.18 for calibration and validation, respectively). Comparing the performances of estimation models, the new combination spectral indices FDRVI (687, 531) based on canopy reflectance improved the accuracy of estimation of plant water status. Besides, based on FDRVI (687, 531), LWC was the optimal water metrics for plant water status estimation."
https://openalex.org/W2953332122,"Background The majority of studies that link antibiotic usage and resistance focus on simple associations between the resistance against a specific antibiotic and the use of that specific antibiotic. However, the relationship between antibiotic use and resistance is more complex. Here we evaluate selection and co-selection by assessing which antibiotics, including those mainly prescribed for respiratory tract infections, are associated with increased resistance to various antibiotics among Escherichia coli isolated from urinary samples. Methods Monthly primary care prescribing data were obtained from National Health Service (NHS) Digital. Positive E. coli records from urine samples in English primary care (n = 888,207) between April 2014 and January 2016 were obtained from the Second Generation Surveillance System. Elastic net regularization was used to evaluate associations between prescribing of different antibiotic groups and resistance against amoxicillin, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and nitrofurantoin at the clinical commissioning group (CCG) level. England is divided into 209 CCGs, with each NHS practice prolonging to one CCG. Results Amoxicillin prescribing (measured in DDD/ 1000 inhabitants / day) was positively associated with amoxicillin (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.04) and ciprofloxacin (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.17) resistance. In contrast, nitrofurantoin prescribing was associated with lower levels of resistance to amoxicillin (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84–0.97). CCGs with higher levels of trimethoprim prescribing also had higher levels of ciprofloxacin resistance (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10–1.59). Conclusion Amoxicillin, which is mainly (and often unnecessarily) prescribed for respiratory tract infections is associated with increased resistance against various antibiotics among E. coli causing urinary tract infections. Our findings suggest that when predicting the potential impact of interventions on antibiotic resistances it is important to account for use of other antibiotics, including those typically used for other indications."
https://openalex.org/W2949350481,"Introduction In 2014, 159 million under 5 year-old children were stunted (suffered chronic undernutrition) worldwide. Identifying risk factors for stunting among 6 to 24 month-age children in Mekelle City is important for evidence-based interventions. Method Case-Control study design was undertaken in 330 children, from January to February 2016. World Health Organization (WHO) anthropometric software and statistical package for social sciences version 20 were used for analysis. Logistic regression analysis was applied. Result The following were identified as risk factors for stunting: mother’s lack of formal education (adjusted odds ratio (AOR = 6.4)), mother height less than 150cm (AOR = 4.2), mother with a body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m2 (AOR = 3.8), childbirth weight less than 2.5kg (AOR = 5.3), household with two and above under-five children (AOR = 2.9), a WHO diet diversity score < 4 (AOR = 3.2) and repeated diarrheal episodes (AOR = 5.3). Conclusion The factors associated with stunting among children aged 6 to 24 months are no formal education in mother, mother height less than 150cm, low BMI of the mother, low birth weight, low WHO DDS, number of under 5 children in the household and repeated diarrheal episodes. Nutritional interventions should give emphasis to maternal education, maternal nutrition, childbirth weight, family size, diet diversity, and diarrheal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2951604497,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health burden worldwide with 240 million chronically infected individuals. Nucleos(t)ide analogs and interferons are the current standards of care due to their suppression of HBV replication, but the treatments rarely eradicate HBV from individuals. Similar to current treatments for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, improved HBV therapies will require the combination of multiple drugs which target distinct steps of the HBV life cycle. In this study, we tested the potential of a cyclophilin inhibitor, CRV431, to affect HBV replication in transgenic mice. We found that oral treatment with CRV431 (50 mg/kg/day) for a period of 16 days significantly reduced liver HBV DNA levels and moderately decreased serum HBsAg levels. We observed an additive inhibitory effect on liver HBV DNA levels in mice treated with a combination of low doses of CRV431 (10 mg/kg/day) and the nucleotide prodrug, tenofovir exalidex (TXL), (5 mg/kg/day). No toxicity was observed in CRV431-treated mice. Although it is well known that CRV431 neutralizes the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilins, its anti-HBV mechanism(s) of action remains unknown. Nevertheless, this study provides the first demonstration of a beneficial effect of a cyclophilin inhibitor in vivo in an HBV transgenic mouse model. Altogether our data reveal the potential of CRV431 to be part of improved new therapies for HBV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2951959040,"Due to its tropical origin and adaptation, rice is significantly impacted by cold stress, and consequently sustains large losses in growth and productivity. Currently, rice is the second most consumed cereal in the world and production losses caused by extreme temperature events in the context of ""major climatic changes"" can have major impacts on the world economy. We report here an analysis of rice genotypes in response to low-temperature stress, studied through physiological gas-exchange parameters, biochemical changes in photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants, and at the level of gene and protein expression, towards an understanding and identification of multiple low-temperature tolerance mechanisms. The first effects of cold stress were observed on photosynthesis among all genotypes. However, the tropical japonica genotypes Secano do Brazil and Cypress had a greater reduction in gas exchange parameters like photosynthesis and water use efficiency in comparison to the temperate japonica Nipponbare and M202 genotypes. The analysis of biochemical profiles showed that despite the impacts of low temperature on tolerant plants, they quickly adjusted to maintain their cellular homeostasis by an accumulation of antioxidants and osmolytes like phenolic compounds and proline. The cold tolerant and sensitive genotypes showed a clear difference in gene expression at the transcript level for OsGH3-2, OsSRO1a, OsZFP245, and OsTPP1, as well as for expression at the protein level for LRR-RLKs, bHLH, GLYI, and LTP1 proteins. This study exemplifies the cold tolerant features of the temperate japonica Nipponbare and M202 genotypes, as observed through the analysis of physiological and biochemical responses and the associated changes in gene and protein expression patterns. The genes and proteins showing differential expression response are notable candidates towards understanding the biological pathways affected in rice and for engineering cold tolerance, to generate cultivars capable of maintaining growth, development, and reproduction under cold stress. We also propose that the mechanisms of action of the genes analyzed are associated with the tolerance response."
https://openalex.org/W2950585911,"This study aimed to analyze the number of task, social and external athlete leaders within sports teams, and to examine the effectiveness of different leadership structures in male and female teams. The participants were 317 male and 214 female soccer players belonging to 18 teams playing in the third highest male division and to 13 teams playing in the highest female division in Spain, respectively. First, we identified the leadership structure in each team (i.e., having zero, one, two or three leaders); second, we grouped the teams according to these leadership structures; and third, MANOVA was used to compare different leadership groups in terms of their effectiveness. The results demonstrated that: (a) the most common structure within the teams was to have one task leader, one social leader, and two external leaders; (b) shared leadership across and within leadership roles was seen as the most effective leadership structure for male and female teams; and (c) male teams showed more benefits when having more task and external leaders, while female teams experienced more benefits when having more task and social leaders on the team. Based on these findings, coaches can optimize their team's functioning by implementing a structure of shared leadership within their teams, both across and within the different leadership roles."
https://openalex.org/W2949221143,"Background Grasping the human cost of war requires comprehensive evaluation of multiple dimensions of conflict. While the number of civilian casualties is a frequently used indicator to evaluate intensity of violence in conflict, the inclusion of other indicators may provide a more complete understanding of how war impacts people and their communities. The Syrian conflict has been specifically marked by attacks against healthcare facilities, and the advancement of technology has provided an avenue for remote data analysis of conflict trends. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using publicly available, online data of attacks on healthcare facilities to better describe population-level violence in the Syrian Civil War. Methods This study utilized publicly available datasets from the Violations Documentation Center (VDC) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) to compare trends in attacks on healthcare facilities and civilian casualties from March 2011 to November 2017 in the Syrian Civil War. We used descriptive statistics, bivariate tests and a multivariable hypothesis testing model to measure the association between the two indicators while adjusting for confounding variables. Results We examined for associations between attacks on healthcare facilities and overall civilian casualties. In the adjusted regression model, each attack on a healthcare facility in the Syrian conflict corresponded to an estimated 260 reported civilian casualties in the same month (95% CI: 227 to 294). This model adjusted for population displacement (using number of registered refugees as a proxy). The May 2014 interaction term, used a transition point of early/late war based on political events during that time, illustrated that each healthcare facility attack after May 2014 corresponded to a statistically significant decrease of 228 civilian deaths. This suggests that although attacks on healthcare facilities continued to contribute to overall civilian deaths, the scale that this was happening was lower after May 2014. Conclusion In the Syrian Civil War, our findings suggest that the inclusion of other humanitarian indicators, such as attacks on hospitals, may add granularity to traditional indicators of violence (e.g. such as civilian casualties) to develop a more nuanced understanding of the warring tactics used and violence against civilians in the Syrian conflict. This exploratory case study represents a novel approach to utilizing open-source data along with statistical analysis to interpret violence against civilians. Future research could benefit from analyzing attacks on healthcare facilities and other civilian infrastructure concurrently with civilian casualty data for further data-driven utilization of open-source data."
https://openalex.org/W2948747002,"In-play gambling is a recent innovation allowing gambling to occur during the course of a sporting event, rather than merely before play commences. For years, in-play gambling has been marketed in the UK via adverts displaying current betting odds during breaks in televised soccer, e.g., ""England to score in the first 20 minutes, 4-to-1."" Previous research shows that this so-called ""live-odds"" advertising is skewed toward complex events with high profit margins which consumers do not evaluate rationally. Recent UK regulatory guidance on ""impulsiveness and urgency,"" aiming to enhance consumer protection around gambling advertising, states that gambling advertising should not ""unduly pressure the audience to gamble."" We explored the frequency and content of live-odds advertising over the 2018 soccer World Cup, as a case study of the first major televised sporting event after the publication of this UK regulatory guidance. In total, 69 live-odds adverts were shown over 32 matches (M = 2.16 per-match), by five bookmakers. We identified two key features that made advertised bets appear more urgent than necessary. First, 39.1% of bets could be determined before the match ended. Second, 24.6% of bets showed a recent improvement in odds, including a 15.9% subset of ""flash odds,"" which were limited in both time and quantity. Advertised odds were again skewed toward complex events, with a qualitative trend toward greater complexity than at the previous World Cup. We believe that consumers should be protected against the targeted content of gambling advertising."
https://openalex.org/W2949723059,"Despite the efforts of community health workers to increase access to healthcare among ethnic minority groups in low- and -middle income countries, members of ethnic minorities are less likely than women from other ethnic groups to use maternal and child healthcare services. However, much less is known about the factors that limit access of ethnic minorities to healthcare services, including the services of community health workers in Nepal, who are known as Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs). To address this issue, we conducted a qualitative study to explore perceived barriers to accessing maternal and child healthcare services among ethnic minority groups in two different geographical locations (the hill and Terai regions- flatland bordering south India) with varying degrees of access to local healthcare centres. Between April 2014 and September 2014, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty FCHVs, 26 women service users and 11 paid local health workers. In addition, 15 FCHVs participated in four focus group discussions. A thematic analysis of the data identified five major themes underlying barriers to accessing available maternal and child healthcare services by ethnic minority groups such as Dalits, Madhesi, Muslim, Chepang and Tamang. These themes include: a) lack of knowledge among service users; b) lack of trust in volunteers; c) traditional beliefs and healthcare practices; d) low decision-making power of women; and e) perceived indignities experienced when using health centres. We conclude that community health programmes should focus on increasing awareness of healthcare services among ethnic minority groups, and the programmes should involve family members (husband and mothers-in-law) and traditional health practitioners. Both the FCHVs and local healthcare providers should be trained to communicate effectively in order to deliver respectful care among ethnic minorities if we want to achieve universal healthcare coverage for maternal and child health in low- and -middle income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2951594270,"Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem which accounts for serious medical and economic consequences. Depression is an important associated condition that upsets the management and complications of diabetes. This study aimed to measure the prevalence of depression among people living with Type 2 Diabetes and to examine the factors linked with it.This community based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 278 people living with type 2 diabetes in Duhabi-Bhaluwa municipality, Nepal. A face to face interview was conducted using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire to gain information on socio-demographic characteristics and clinical profile of the participants. Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scale. Variables were categorical and were thus, compared with Pearson's chi-square tests and binary logistic regression models.The prevalence of depression in this study was 22.7%. Most people indicative of having depression were of older age, females, below secondary level education, with a smaller family size, with low family income, using insulin, without a family history of diabetes and/or having an additional illness. However, multivariate analysis showed that the only significant factors for depression were older age, education below secondary level, homemaker, smaller family size, using insulin and having an additional illness.The prevalence of depression in this study is consistent with that reported by other communities. Factors like older age, lower education level, being a homemaker, living in a small size family, insulin use and additional illness could increase the likelihood of developing Major Depressive disorder among people with type 2 diabetes, hence, psychosocial assessment is necessary along with diabetes management plan in a primary health care setting."
https://openalex.org/W2951917539,"Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) belongs to the TGF-β superfamily of proteins and is closely related to myostatin. Recent findings show that GDF11 has rejuvenating properties with pronounced effects on the cardiovascular system, brain, skeletal muscle, and skeleton in mice. Several human studies were also conducted, some implicating decreasing levels of circulating GDF11 with age. To date, however, there have not been any reports on its role in human skin. This study examined the impact of GDF11 on human skin, specifically related to skin aging. The effect of recombinant GDF11 on the function of various skin cells was examined in human epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, melanocytes, dermal microvascular endothelial cells and 3D skin equivalents, as well as in ex vivo human skin explants. GDF11 had significant effects on the production of dermal matrix components in multiple skin models in vitro and ex vivo. In addition, it had a pronounced effect on expression of multiple skin related genes in full thickness 3D skin equivalents. This work, for the first time, demonstrates an important role for GDF11 in skin biology and a potential impact on skin health and aging."

C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP develop a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) at adulthood, but similarly-exposed FVB/N mice are not affected. Here we aim to understand the reasons behind this drastic difference that should depend on the genome of the strain. In both backgrounds, pregnant female mice received per os either DEHP or corn oil vehicle and the male filiations were examined. Computer-assisted sperm analysis showed a DEHP-induced decreased sperm count and velocities in C57BL/6J. Sperm RNA sequencing experiments resulted in the identification of the 62 most differentially expressed RNAs. These RNAs, mainly regulated by hormones, produced strain-specific transcriptional responses to prenatal exposure to DEHP; a pool of RNAs was increased in FVB, another pool of RNAs was decreased in C57BL/6J. In FVB/N, analysis of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) impacting SHP identified rs387782768 and rs29315913 respectively associated with absence of the Forkhead Box A3 (Foxa3) RNA and increased expression of estrogen receptor 1 variant 4 (NM_001302533) RNA. Analysis of the role of SNPs modifying SHP binding sites in function of strain-specific responses to DEHP revealed a DEHP-resistance allele in FVB/N containing an additional FOXA1-3 binding site at rs30973633 and four DEHP-induced beta-defensins (Defb42, Defb30, Defb47 and Defb48). A DEHP-susceptibility allele in C57BL/6J contained five SNPs (rs28279710, rs32977910, rs46648903, rs46677594 and rs48287999) affecting SHP and six genes (Svs2, Svs3b, Svs4, Svs3a, Svs6 and Svs5) epigenetically silenced by DEHP. Finally, targeted experiments confirmed increased methylation in the Svs3ab promoter with decreased SEMG2 persisting across generations, providing a molecular explanation for the transgenerational sperm velocity decrease found in C57BL/6J after DEHP exposure. We conclude that the existence of SNP-dependent mechanisms in FVB/N inbred mice may confer resistance to transgenerational endocrine disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2952761766,"Conflicts between biodiversity conservation and resource production can be mitigated by multi-objective management planning. Optimizing management for multiple objectives over larger land areas likely entails trading off the practicability of the process against the goodness of the solution. It is therefore worthwhile to resolve how large areas are required as management planning regions to reconcile conflicting objectives as effectively as possible. We aimed to reveal how the extent of forestry planning regions impacts the potential to mitigate a forestry-conservation conflict in Finland, represented as a trade-off between harvest income and deadwood availability. We used forecasted data from a forest simulator, a hierarchy of forestry planning regions, and an optimization model to explore the production possibility frontier between harvest income and deadwood. We compared the overall outcomes when management was optimized within the different-sized planning regions in terms of the two objectives, the spatial variation of deadwood, and the optimal combinations of management regimes. Increasing the size of the planning regions did produce higher simultaneous levels of the two objectives, but the differences were most often of the magnitude of only a few percentages. The differences among the scales were minor also in terms of the spatial variation in deadwood availability and in the optimal management combinations. The conflict between timber harvesting and deadwood availability is only marginally easier to mitigate at large spatial scales than at small forest ownership scales. However, regardless of the spatial scale of planning, the achievable solutions may not be good enough to safeguard deadwood-dependent biodiversity without active deadwood creation."
https://openalex.org/W2950540137,"Seafloor mapping can offer important insights for marine management, spatial planning, and research in marine geology, ecology, and oceanography. Here, we present a method for generating regional bathymetry and geomorphometry maps from crowd-sourced depth soundings (Olex AS) for a small fraction of the cost of multibeam data collection over the same area. Empirical Bayesian Kriging was used to generate a continuous bathymetric surface from incomplete and, in some areas, sparse Olex coverage on the Newfoundland and Labrador shelves of eastern Canada. The result is a 75m bathymetric grid that provides over 100x finer spatial resolution than previously available for the majority of the 672,900 km2 study area. The interpolated bathymetry was tested for accuracy against independent depth data provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Spearman correlation = 0.99, p<0.001). Quantitative terrain attributes were generated to better understand seascape characteristics at multiple spatial scales, including slope, rugosity, aspect, and bathymetric position index. Landform classification was carried out using the geomorphons algorithm and a novel method for the identification of previously unmapped tributary canyons at the continental shelf edge are also presented to illustrate some of many potential benefits of crowd-sourced regional seafloor mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2951221544,"Introduction Ensuring quality service provision is fundamental to ZAZIC’s voluntary medical male circumcision (MC) program in Zimbabwe. From October, 2014 to September, 2017, ZAZIC conducted 205,847 MCs. Passive surveillance recorded a combined moderate and severe adverse event (AE) rate of 0.3%; reported adherence to follow-up was 95%, suggesting program safety. Despite encouraging passive surveillance data, verification of data quality and accuracy would increase confidence in AE identification. Methods From May to August, 2017, ZAZIC implemented a focused quality assurance (QA) study on AE ascertainment and documentation at 6 purposively-selected, high-volume MC sites. ZAZIC Gold-Standard (GS) clinicians prospectively observed 100 post-MC follow-ups per site in tandem with facility-based MC providers to confirm and characterize AEs, providing mentoring in AE management when needed. GS clinicians also retrospectively reviewed site-based, routine MC data, comparing recorded to reported AEs, and held brief qualitative interviews with site leadership on AE-related issues. Results Observed AE rates varied from 1–8%, potentially translating to thousands of unidentified AEs if observed AE rates were applied to previous MC performance. Most observed AEs were infections among younger clients. Retrospective review found discrepancies in AE documentation and reporting. Interviews suggest human resource and transport issues challenge MC follow-up visit attendance. Post-operative self-care appears to produce generally good results for adults; however, younger clients and guardians need additional attention to ensure quality care. There was no evidence of missed severe AEs resulting in permanent impairment or morbidity. Conclusions Although results cannot be generalized, active surveillance suggests that AEs may be higher and follow-up lower than reported. In response, ZAZIC’s Quality Assurance Task Force will replicate this QA study in other sites; increase training in AE identification, management, and documentation for clinical and data teams; and improve post-operative counseling for younger clients. Additional nurses and vehicles, especially in rural health clinics, could be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2952255198,"In cancer tumors, lactate accumulation was initially attributed to high glucose consumption associated with the Warburg Effect. Now it is evident that lactate can also serve as an energy source in cancer cell metabolism. Additionally, lactate has been shown to promote metastasis, generate gene expression patterns in cancer cells consistent with “cancer stem cell” phenotypes, and result in treatment resistant tumors. Therefore, the goal of this work was to quantify the impact of lactate on metabolism in three breast cell lines (one normal and two breast cancer cell lines—MCF 10A, MCF7, and MDA-MB-231), in order to better understand the role lactate may have in different disease cell types. Parallel labeling metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA) was used to quantify the intracellular fluxes under normal and high extracellular lactate culture conditions. Additionally, high extracellular lactate cultures were labelled in parallel with [U-13C] lactate, which provided qualitative information regarding the lactate uptake and metabolism. The 13C-MFA model, which incorporated the measured extracellular fluxes and the parallel labeling mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) for five glycolysis, four tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and three intracellular amino acid metabolites, predicted lower glycolysis fluxes in the high lactate cultures. All three cell lines experienced reductive carboxylation of glutamine to citrate in the TCA cycle as a result of high extracellular lactate. Reductive carboxylation previously has been observed under hypoxia and other mitochondrial stresses, whereas these cultures were grown aerobically. In addition, this is the first study to investigate the intracellular metabolic responses of different stages of breast cancer progression to high lactate exposure. These results provide insight into the role lactate accumulation has on metabolic reaction distributions in the different disease cell types while the cells are still proliferating in lactate concentrations that do not significantly decrease exponential growth rates."
https://openalex.org/W2949617484,"Companies need to ensure that customers perceive their brands as intended, with strong and unique associations, when facing a competitive market. Traditionally, brand associations are measured using conventional techniques such as surveys and questionnaires albeit both conscious and unconscious factors can influence the collected data and the outcome of a campaign. Neuromarketing can shed light on how the customer's brain processes marketing stimuli. We report here on an EEG study aimed at gauging mental associations with brands. We focus on the N400 event-related potential, an EEG component most strongly elicited in response to a concept unrelated to a preceding concept. We considered two video on demand brands, Netflix and Rex&Rio, and selected a set of words grouped in 4 categories that were either related (Television, Relaxation, and Price), in varying degrees, or unrelated (Unrelated) to the said brands. The experiment started with both brands' TV commercials, as a common reference for our participants. We then applied a semantic priming paradigm in which a brand logo (""prime"") was followed by a word (""target""), and the strength of the N400 response to the word used as an inverted measure of the association strength with the brand logo. We clustered N400 responses to identify, for each brand, natural groups of associated words. As a result, for Netflix the cluster with the smallest N400 responses (i.e., strongest associations) consisted of words related to Television but for Rex&Rio it consisted of words related to Relaxation. We also evaluated the relationship between the two brands and determined which associations they share or which ones not. It turned out that associations related to Relaxation and Television distinguish the two brands. Interestingly, survey data did not show any difference between the two brands as they were equally associated with Television and Relaxation. These findings show that our N400 technique can reveal brand associations, and natural categories thereof, that would otherwise go unnoticed when using conventional surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2949639665,"Background A substantial number of survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia suffer from treatment-related late adverse effects including neurocognitive impairment. While multiple studies have described neurocognitive outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors, relatively few have investigated their association with individual genetic constitution. Methods To further address this issue, genetic variants located in 99 genes relevant to the effects of anticancer drugs and in 360 genes implicated in nervous system function and predicted to affect protein function, were pooled from whole exome sequencing data of childhood ALL survivors (PETALE cohort) and analyzed for an association with neurocognitive complications, as well as with anxiety and depression. Variants that sustained correction for multiple testing were genotyped in entire cohort (n = 236) and analyzed with same outcomes. Results Common variants in MTR, PPARA, ABCC3, CALML5, CACNB2 and PCDHB10 genes were associated with deficits in neurocognitive tests performance, whereas a variant in SLCO1B1 and EPHA5 genes was associated with anxiety and depression. Majority of associations were modulated by intensity of treatment. Associated variants were further analyzed in an independent SJLIFE cohort of 545 ALL survivors. Two variants, rs1805087 in methionine synthase, MTR and rs58225473 in voltage-dependent calcium channel protein encoding gene, CACNB2 are of particular interest, since associations of borderline significance were found in replication cohort and remain significant in combined discovery and replication groups (OR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1–2.3; p = 0.04 and; OR = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.25–11; p = 0.01, respectively). Variant rs4149056 in SLCO1B1 gene also deserves further attention since previously shown to affect methotrexate clearance and short-term toxicity in ALL patients. Conclusions Current findings can help understanding of the influence of genetic component on long-term neurocognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to confirm whether identified variants may be useful in identifying survivors at increased risk of these complications."
https://openalex.org/W2950519731,"The paracellular gap formed by endothelial cell (EC) contraction is fundamental for endothelium permeability, but the mechanism underlying EC contraction has yet to be determined. Here, we identified the zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) as the kinase for EC contraction and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Inhibition of ZIPK activity by pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNAs led to a significant decrease in the mono- and diphosphorylation of MLCs along with a contractile response to thrombin, suggesting an essential role of ZIPK in EC paracellular permeability. To assess the role of ZIPK in vivo, we established mouse lines with conditional deletion of Zipk gene. The endothelium-specific deletion of Zipk led to embryonic lethality, whereas the UBC-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Zipk by tamoxifen induction at adulthood caused no apparent phenotype. The induced deletion of Zipk significantly inhibited ischemia-reperfusion-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction and neuronal injuries from middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, as evidenced by reduced infarct and edema volume, attenuated Evans blue dye leakage, and improved neuronal behavior. We thus concluded that ZIPK and its phosphorylation of MLC were required for EC contraction and ischemic neuronal injuries. ZIPK may be a prospective therapeutic target for stroke.-Zhang, Y., Zhang, C., Zhang, H., Zeng, W., Li, S., Chen, C., Song, X., Sun, J., Sun, Z., Cui, C., Cao, X., Zheng, L., Wang, P., Zhao, W., Zhang, Z., Xu, Y., Zhu, M., Chen, H. ZIPK mediates endothelial cell contraction through myosin light chain phosphorylation and is required for ischemic-reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W2951347972,"Coxiella burnetii, the agent causing Q fever, has been associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). To better clarify this link, we analysed the genetic transcriptomic profile of peripheral blood leukocytes from patients with C. burnetii infection to identify possible links to lymphoma. Microarray analyses revealed that 1189 genes were expressed differently (p <.001 and fold change ≥4) in whole blood of patients with C. burnetii infection compared to controls. In addition, 95 genes expressed in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and in patients with C. burnetii persistent infection have allowed us to establish the 'C. burnetii-associated NHL signature'. Among these, 33 genes previously found modulated in C. burnetii-associated -NHL by the microarray analysis were selected and their mRNA expression levels were measured in distinct C. burnetii-induced pathologies, namely, acute Q fever, focalized persistent infection, lymphadenitis and C.burnetii-associated NHL. Specific genes involved in anti-apoptotic process were found highly expressed in leukocytes from patients with C. burnetii associated-NHL: MIR17HG, REL and SP100. This signature differed from that found for NHL-control group. Patients with C. burnetii lymphadenitis presented significant elevated levels of BCL2 and ETS1 mRNAs. Altogether, we identified a specific transcriptionnal signature for NHL during C. burnetii infection reflecting the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic processes and the fact that lymphadenitis might constitute a critical step towards lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2951449211,"Background The Lower Extremity Functional Scale evaluates the functional status of patients that have lower extremity conditions of musculoskeletal origin. Regional Arabic dialects often create barriers to clear communication and comparative research. We aimed to cross-culturally adapt the Lower Extremity Functional Scale in modern standard Arabic that is widely used and understood in the Middle East and North Africa region, and assess its psychometric properties. Methods Cross-cultural adaptation followed a combination of recommended guidelines. For psychometric evaluation 150 patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury and 65 asymptomatic individuals were recruited. All measurement properties as indicated by the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments recommendations were evaluated, including content-relevance analysis, structural validity, longitudinal reproducibility, anchor- and distribution-based methods of responsiveness, as well as the longitudinal pattern of change of Lower Extremity Functional Scale in anterior cruciate ligament injured patients’ functional status. Results The questionnaire presented excellent internal consistency (α = 0.96), reliability (0.80–0.98), and good convergent validity (ρ = 0.85). For reproducibility testing: minimal detectable change was 9.26 points; for responsiveness assessment: minimal clinically important difference was 9 points and presented moderate effect sizes (Glass’Δ = 0.71, Cohen’s d = 0.81). Its unidimensionality was not confirmed and an exploratory factor analysis indicated a 2-factor solution explaining 78.1% of the variance. Conclusion The Arabic Lower Extremity Functional Scale presented acceptable psychometric properties comparable to the original version. The Arabic version of Lower Extremity Functional Scale can be used in research and clinical practice to assess the functional status of Arabic-patients suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury."

All patients underwent CEUS by an experienced examiner using a convex multifrequency probe (1-6 MHz) within 24 hours following TACE to detect residual tumor tissue. Retrospective evaluation using a perfusion quantification software regarding pE, TTP, mTT, Ri and WiAUC in the center of the lesion, the margin and surrounding liver.In all lesions, a post-interventional visual reduction of the tumor microvascularization was observed. Significant differences between center of the lesion vs. margin and surrounding liver were found regarding peak enhancement (867.8 ± 2416 center vs 2028 ± 3954 margin p<0.005) and center 867.8 ± 2416 vs 2824 ± 4290 surrounding liver, p<0.0001)). However, no significant differences were found concerning Ri, WiAuC, mTT and TTP.CEUS with color- coded perfusion imaging is a valuable supporting tool for post-interventional success control following TACE of liver lesions. Peak enhancement seems to be the most valuable parameter."
https://openalex.org/W2949638452,"Diaphorin is a polyketide produced by Candidatus Profftella armatura (Betaproteobacteria), an organelle-like defensive symbiont harbored by a plant sap-sucking insect, Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae). Diaphorin belongs to the pederin family, a group of compounds that share much of their core structure with that of pederin, which is characterized by two dihydropyran rings bridged by an N-acyl aminal. Most members of this family have potent antitumor activity, making them promising anticancer drug candidates. The present study assessed the therapeutic potential of diaphorin for its antitumor activity against 39 human cancer cell lines including those from breast, brain, colon, lung, skin, ovary, kidney, stomach, and prostate. The results showed that diaphorin had inhibitory activity against all 39 cancer cell lines tested. The GI50, TGI, and LC50 values ranged from 0.28 μM- 2.4 μM, 1.6 μM -11 μM, and 7.5 μM-> 100 μM, respectively. These values are among the highest in the pederin family, indicating that the anticancer activity of diaphorin is milder than those of other pederin congeners. The inhibitory effects of diaphorin significantly differed among the distinct cancer types. The maximum difference was about 10-fold, which was similar to those of most other pederin congeners."
https://openalex.org/W2950996393,"Staphylococcus aureus infections represent a major public health threat, but previous attempts at developing a universal vaccine have been unsuccessful. We attempted to identify a vaccine that would be protective against both skin/soft tissue and bloodstream infections. We first tested a panel of staphylococcal antigens that are conserved across strains, combined with aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, for their ability to induce protective immunity in both skin and bacteremia infection models. Antigens were identified that reduced dermonecrosis during skin infection, and other non-overlapping antigens were identified that showed trends to protection in the bacteremia model. However, individual antigens were not identified that mediated substantial protection in both the skin and bacteremia infection models. We therefore tested a variety of combinations of proteins to seek a single combination that could mediate protection in both models. After iterative testing, a vaccine consisting of 3 antigens, ABC transporter protein (SACOL2451), ABC2 transporter protein (SACOL0695), and α-hemolysin (SACOL1173), was identified as the most effective combination. This combination vaccine provided protection in a skin infection model. However, these antigens were only partially protective in the bacteremia infection model. Even by testing multiple different adjuvants, optimized efficacy in the skin infection model did not translate into efficacy in the bacteremia model. Thus protective vaccines against skin/soft tissue infections may not enable effective protection against bloodstream infections."
https://openalex.org/W2952975593,"Infections can spread among livestock notably because infected animals can be brought to uncontaminated holdings, therefore exposing a new group of susceptible animals to the disease. As a consequence, the structure and dynamics of animal trade networks is a major focus of interest to control zoonosis. We investigate the impact of the chronology of animal trades on the dynamics of the process. Precisely, in the context of a basic SI model spreading, we measure on the French database of bovine transfers to what extent a snapshot-based analysis of the cattle trade networks overestimates the epidemic risks. We bring into light that an analysis taking into account the chronology of interactions would give a much more accurate assessment of both the size and speed of the process. For this purpose, we model data as a temporal network that we analyze using the link stream formalism in order to mix structural and temporal aspects. We also show that in this dataset, a basic SI spreading comes down in most cases to a simple two-phases scenario: a waiting period, with few contacts and low activity, followed by a linear growth of the number of infected holdings. Using this portrait of the spreading process, we identify efficient strategies to control a potential outbreak, based on the identification of specific elements of the link stream which have a higher probability to be involved in a spreading process."

Heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction have higher AXL in serum than controls. No information about Axl expression with HF progression is available.Thoracic transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was successfully performed on male Wistar rats (n = 25) with different constriction levels. Controls underwent sham surgery (n = 12). Echocardiography measurements were performed 4-8 weeks after surgery. Collagen deposition was measured with picrosirius red staining. Axl mRNA levels in left ventricle (LV), left kidney (LK) and ascending aorta (aAo) and the LV expression of cardiac remodeling and fibrogenic factors were quantified with real-time PCR. AXL LV protein levels were quantified with western blot and localization was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Soluble AXL levels in plasma were assayed with ELISA.Successful TAC rats were classified into LV hypertrophy (LVH) or heart failure (HF), modeling the progressive cardiac changes after pressure overload. Collagen deposition was increased only in the HF group. LV Axl mRNA levels were higher in LVH and HF than in Sham rats, and correlated with LVHi, and hypertrophic and fibrogenic mediators. However, no association was found with LV systolic function. AXL was expressed in LV myocytes and other cell types. Concentration of circulating sAXL in plasma was increased in the LVH group compared to Sham and HF rats. Axl mRNA levels were similar in all groups in the LK and aAo.Axl expression pattern suggests a role in the early progression of LV remodeling in HF but not in the later systolic dysfunction. The higher levels of circulating AXL found in HF patients most probably shed from the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2950493055,"Gastrointestinal parasites are neglected infections, yet they cause significant burden to animal and human health globally. To date, most studies of gastrointestinal parasites focus on host-parasite systems that involve either a single parasite or a host species. However, when hosts share habitat and resources, they may also cross-transmit generalist gastrointestinal parasites. Here we explore multi-host-parasite interactions in a single ecosystem to understand the infection patterns, especially those linked to livestock-wildlife interfaces and zoonotic risk.We used both coprological methods (flotation and sedimentation; N = 1,138 fecal samples) and molecular identification techniques (rDNA and mtDNA; N = 18 larvae) to identify gastrointestinal parasites in nine sympatric host species (cattle, sheep, goats, wildebeest, Grant's gazelles, Thomson's gazelles, impala, vervet monkeys and baboons) in the Amboseli ecosystem, Kenya.We found that the host community harbored a diverse community of gastrointestinal helminths, including 22 species and/or morphotypes that were heterogeneously distributed across the hosts. Six zoonotic gastrointestinal helminths were identified: Trichuris spp., Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Enterobius spp. Oesophagostomum bifurcum, Strongyloides stercoralis and Strongyloides fuelleborni. The dominant parasite was Trichuris spp, whose ova occurred in two morphological types. Baboons were co-infected with Strongyloides fuelleborni and S. stercoralis.We found that the interface zone shared by wild ungulates, livestock and non-human primates is rich in diversity of gastrointestinal helminths, of which some are extensively shared across the host species. Closely related host species were most likely to be infected by the same parasite species. Several parasites showed genetic sub-structuring according to either geography or host species. Of significance and contrary to expectation, we found that livestock had a higher parasite richness than wild bovids, which is a health risk for both conservation and livestock production. The zoonotic parasites are of public health risk, especially to pastoralist communities living in areas contiguous to wildlife areas. These results expand information on the epidemiology of these parasites and highlights potential zoonotic risk in East African savanna habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2953279282,"Introduction Radiation-induced dermatitis (RID) is routinely graded by visual inspection. Inter-observer variability makes this approach inadequate for an objective assessment of the efficacy of different topical treatments. In this study we report on the first clinical application of a new image-analysis tool developed to measure the relevant effects quantitatively and to compare the effects of two different topical preparations used to treat RID. Materials and methods After completion of radiotherapy, RID was retrospectively assessed in 100 white female breast cancer patients who had received adjuvant breast irradiation. Of these patients, 34 were treated with R1&R2, a Lactokine-fluid derived from milk proteins, and 66 were treated with Bepanthen. In addition RID was graded independently by two experienced radiation oncologists in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). For quantitative evaluation, the irradiated breast and the non-irradiated contralateral breast were photographed in a standardized manner including a color reference card. For analysis, all images were converted into the color space L*a*b* and mean values were calculated for each of the color parameters. Results The CTCAE-based grading revealed statistically significant inter-observer variability in the scoring of RID Grades 1, 2 and 3 (p<0.001). A difference between the two topical products could not be observed with visual inspection. By using augmented image analysis methods a statistically significant increase in a*-values (mean 4.15; 95%CI: 5.97–2.33, p<0.001) in patients treated with R1&R2 indicated more intense reddening. Digital subtraction was used to eliminate differences in individual baseline skin tone to generate a new, low-scatter parameter (ΔSEV). Conclusions Visual CTCAE-based evaluation of RID was not suitable for assessing the efficacy of the skin treatment products. In contrast, the novel image analysis enabled a quantitative evaluation independent of skin type and baseline skin tone in our cohort suggesting that augmented image analysis may be a suitable tool for this type of investigation. Prospective studies are needed to validate our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2952342138,"The objective of this study was to examine whether exposure to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is associated with premature termination of Exclusive Breastfeeding (EB). Per WHO recommendations, this was defined as ceasing breastfeeding or supplementing with other foods or liquids before the child was 6 months old.It is a prospective cohort study set in Moshi, Tanzania consisting of 1128 pregnant women with live singleton births. Women were enrolled during pregnancy and followed up with interviews during pregnancy, after birth and 2-3 years postpartum, using structured questionnaires. Emotional, physical and sexual IPV exerted by the current partner was assessed at 34 weeks gestational age with WHO questionnaires. Months of EB was assessed 2-3 years postpartum. Premature termination of EB was defined as less than 6 months of EB. Analyses were made using a logistic regression model adjusted for maternal age, education, HIV-status, alcohol use during pregnancy and parity. Confounding variables were determined using a theoretical framework approach, i.e. a Directed Acyclic Graph model to minimize bias.Women who were exposed to IPV had more than 50% higher odds of terminating EB before the child was 6 months old compared to women who were not exposed (aOR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.27-2.06). Women exposed to all three types of IPV had twice the odds of early termination of EB (aOR = 1.95, 1.12; 3.37). Furthermore, the odds were tripled if exposure happened specifically during the index pregnancy (aOR = 2.93 95%CI: 1.3; 6.6). Stratified analyses showed the most severely affected groups were the mothers older than 30 and those who gave birth to girls.The results indicated that exposure to IPV is associated with increased risk of premature termination of EB. The odds increase with multiple types of the IPV, especially when exposed during the index pregnancy."

Method We studied patients’ preferences considering sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, history of psychological treatments, number of sessions, and satisfaction with past interventions. Results Most participants (85.4%) preferred psychological treatment in an individual format, 14.2% in group, and 0.4% online. When comparing the people who chose individual and group treatment, no demographic or clinical differences were found. The arguments against group format were the lack of privacy and expression difficulties. Regarding online format, these included being considered impersonal and ineffective. Conclusion The rejection of group and online psychotherapy formats allows us to define the actions we should carry out in public mental health settings to improve the acceptance of more cost-effective therapy formats."
https://openalex.org/W2950360941,"Cebpa encodes a transcription factor (TF) that plays an instructive role in the development of multiple myeloid lineages. The expression of Cebpa itself is finely modulated, as Cebpa is expressed at high and intermediate levels in neutrophils and macrophages respectively and downregulated in non-myeloid lineages. The cis-regulatory logic underlying the lineage-specific modulation of Cebpa’s expression level is yet to be fully characterized. Previously, we had identified 6 new cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a 78kb region surrounding Cebpa. We had also inferred the TFs that regulate each CRM by fitting a sequence-based thermodynamic model to a comprehensive reporter activity dataset. Here, we report the cis-regulatory logic of Cebpa CRMs at the resolution of individual binding sites. We tested the binding sites and functional roles of inferred TFs by designing and constructing mutated CRMs and comparing theoretical predictions of their activity against empirical measurements in a myeloid cell line. The enhancers were confirmed to be activated by combinations of PU.1, C/EBP family TFs, Egr1, and Gfi1 as predicted by the model. We show that silencers repress the activity of the proximal promoter in a dominant manner in G1ME cells, which are derived from the red-blood cell lineage. Dominant repression in G1ME cells can be traced to binding sites for GATA and Myb, a motif shared by all of the silencers. Finally, we demonstrate that GATA and Myb act redundantly to silence the proximal promoter. These results indicate that dominant repression is a novel mechanism for resolving hematopoietic lineages. Furthermore, Cebpa has a fail-safe cis-regulatory architecture, featuring several functionally similar CRMs, each of which contains redundant binding sites for multiple TFs. Lastly, by experimentally demonstrating the predictive ability of our sequence-based thermodynamic model, this work highlights the utility of this computational approach for understanding mammalian gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2951308008,"Introduction Dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) have decreased serum tryptophan concentrations, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) expression is associated with low serum tryptophan concentrations and is increased in the gastrointestinal tract of humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine if the mRNA expression of IDO-1 is increased in the duodenal mucosa of dogs with PLE as compared to dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE) and healthy dogs, and whether this expression is correlated with changes in serum tryptophan concentration. Methods Our study was a retrospective study using archived paraffin-embedded duodenal biopsy specimens from 8 healthy Beagle dogs from the Iowa State University Canine Service Colony and 18 and 6 client-owned dogs diagnosed with CE and PLE, respectively at the Bristol Veterinary School. A novel RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) technology, RNAscope, was used to identify IDO-1 mRNA mucosal expression in duodenal tissues. An IDO-1 specific probe was hybridized onto 10 duodenal biopsy sections from each dog whereby RNAscope signal (mRNA expression) was quantified by a single operator using light microscopy. Results Dogs with PLE had significantly higher mRNA expression of IDO-1 in the duodenal mucosa compared to healthy dogs (mucosal percentage IDO-1 positive: P = 0.0093, (mean ± S.D) control: 19.36 ± 7.08, PLE: 34.12 ± 5.98, average fold difference: 1.76 and mucosal IDO-1 H-score: P = 0.0356, (mean ± S.D) control: 45.26 ± 19.33, PLE: 84.37 ± 19.86, average fold difference: 1.86). The duodenal mucosal mRNA expression of IDO-1 was negatively correlated with serum tryptophan concentrations in dogs with PLE (mucosal IDO-1 H-score: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = -0.94, P = 0.0048). Conclusions In conclusion, our study suggests that decreased serum tryptophan concentrations in dogs with PLE is associated with increased intestinal IDO-1 expression. Further studies are needed to determine potential inflammatory pathways responsible for increased expression of IDO-1 in the intestinal tract of dogs with PLE."
https://openalex.org/W2951376687,"Macrophages play a pivotal role in the formation and development of atherosclerosis as a predominant inflammatory cell type present within atherosclerotic plaque. Promoting anti-atherosclerotic drug delivery into macrophages may provide a therapeutic potential on atherosclerotic plaque. In this study, we investigated whether membrane-permeabilized sonodynamic therapy (MP-SDT) enhances drug delivery into THP-1 macrophages. Images of confocal microscopy confirmed that the optimal plasma distribution of the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) was at 1 hour incubation. The non-lethal parameter of MP-SDT was determined by cell viability as measured by a CCK-8 assay. Bright field microscopy demonstrated plasma membrane deformation in response to MP-SDT. Using SYTOX Green, a model drug for cellular uptake, we found that MP-SDT significantly induced membrane permeabilization dependent on ultrasound intensity and exposure time. Using Fluo-3 AM, intracellular calcium elevation during MP-SDT was confirmed as a result of membrane permeabilization. Membrane perforation of MP-SDT-treated cells was observed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, MP-SDT-induced membrane permeabilization and perforation were remarkably prevented by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) during MP-SDT. Furthermore, we assessed the therapeutic effect of MP-SDT in combination with anti-atherosclerotic drug atorvastatin. Our results showed that MP-SDT increased the therapeutic effect of atorvastatin on lipid-laden THP-1-derived foam cells, including decreasing lipid droplets, increasing the cholesterol efflux and the expression of PPARγ and ABCG1. In conclusion, MP-SDT might become a promising approach to facilitating the delivery of anti-atherosclerotic drugs into macrophages via membrane permeabilization."

PD may improve access to renal replacement therapy in low- and middle-income countries; however, these countries have a higher prevalence of protein-energy wasting in patients and poorer socioeconomic conditions. We evaluated the effects of HIV infection on serum albumin levels in ESRD patients starting continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) and mortality outcomes. Methods We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study of consecutive incident CAPD patients recruited from two hospitals in Durban, South Africa, from September 2012 to February 2015. Seventy HIV-negative and 70 HIV-positive ESRD patients were followed monthly for serum albumin levels and mortality events during the first 18 months of CAPD therapy. Results The HIV-positive cohort recorded 28 deaths (40%) among patients with a functional CAPD catheter at 18 months and 13 deaths (18.6%) in the HIV-negative cohort (p = 0.005). The mean serum albumin levels were lower in the HIV-positive cohort than in the HIV-negative cohort during the 18-month follow-up. The mean difference in serum albumin levels between the two cohorts was 4.24 g/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.02–6.46, p<0.001) at baseline and 3.99 g/L (95% CI 1.19–6.79, p = 0.006) at 18 months. HIV-positive status (adjusted regression coefficient -2.84, CI -5.00–-0.67, p = 0.011), diabetes (adjusted coefficient -2.85; CI, -5.58–-0.12; p = 0.041), and serum C-reactive protein and blood hemoglobin levels were independent predictors of serum albumin levels on multivariable linear regression. Baseline serum albumin <25 g/L (subdistribution-hazard ratio [SHR] 13.06, 95% CI 3.09–55.14, p<0.001) and CD4+ cell count <200 cells/μL (SHR 3.2, CI 1.38–7.45, p = 0.007) were independent predictors of mortality in our competing risk model. Conclusions HIV infection can adversely affect serum albumin levels in ESRD patients managed with CAPD, while low baseline serum albumin levels and impaired immunity reliably predict mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2950466825,"Iron is essential for the normal development of cellular processes. This metal has a high redox potential that can damage cells and its overload or deficiency is related to several diseases, therefore it is crucial for its absorption to be highly regulated. A fast-response regulatory mechanism has been reported known as mucosal block, which allows to regulate iron absorption after an initial iron challenge. In this mechanism, the internalization of the DMT1 transporters in enterocytes would be a key factor. Two phenomenological models are proposed for the iron absorption process: DMT1’s binary switching mechanism model and DMT1’s swinging-mechanism model, which represent the absorption mechanism for iron uptake in intestinal cells. The first model considers mutually excluding processes for endocytosis and exocytosis of DMT1. The second model considers a Ball’s oscillator to represent the oscillatory behavior of DMT1’s internalization. Both models are capable of capturing the kinetics of iron absorption and represent empirical observations, but the DMT1’s swinging-mechanism model exhibits a better correlation with experimental data and is able to capture the regulatory phenomenon of mucosal block. The DMT1 swinging-mechanism model is the first phenomenological model reported to effectively represent the complexity of the iron absorption process, as it can predict the behavior of iron absorption fluxes after challenging cells with an initial dose of iron, and the reduction in iron uptake observed as a result of mucosal block after a second iron dose."

We analyze the characteristics of 6,402 physicians who engaged in political advocacy by signing the Clinician Action Network's 2016 petition objecting to the American Medical Association's endorsement of the nomination of Tom Price as Secretary of Health and Human Services. These physicians were matched to the NPI (all physicians) and PECOS (largely Medicare payment recipients) directories. Physicians in the directories were matched to publicly disclosed campaign contributions. Contributions are used to measure political preferences expressed on a liberal-conservative scale. We document a pronounced generational realignment in the politics of the medical profession, with recent graduates trending sharply Democratic. Petition signing vs. non-signing is responsive to gender, specialty, geographic location, personal liberal-conservative preferences and year of graduation from medical school. Petition signers were more likely to be women (62% of signers versus 34% of non-signers), recent medical school graduates (58% of signers versus 42% of non-signers), and in lower-paying specialties (27% of signers versus 12% of non-signers).

https://openalex.org/W2952031991,"Recent study shows that 617 million children and adolescents–or six out of 10 globally- are not acquiring minimum levels in literacy and mathematics, indicating the magnitude of the learning acquisition problem. For children with disabilities in context of conflict, the situation is arguably even worse: the literature shows that they face difficulties to access the education system due to multiple barriers, and when they do access, they are not learning. Our paper examines if an active education policy promoting inclusion since 2005 in Afghanistan, a protracted crisis context, has been effective. Using two cross sectional household surveys carried out eight years apart (2005–2013), our study shows that access to school and literacy did not improve between 2005 and 2013 for children and youth with disabilities. Both access and literacy outcomes were worse for girls with disabilities, those with a mental, learning or associated disability and those living in household where the head was uneducated. Finally, odds of being mentally distressed significantly declined between 2005 and 2013 indicating that schools might play a protective role for children with disabilities in Afghanistan. Our findings suggest that a multilevel multi-pronged adaptation of the existing system to improve the learning experience and promote children’s resilience, particularly for children with disabilities, in conflict context such as Afghanistan, is required."

In a previous study, we established a markerless mutation system based on the pheS mutant as a counterselectable marker. However, the toxic effect of p-Cl-Phe on the R. anatipestifer strain expressing the pheS mutant was weak on blood agar plates. In this study, we successfully obtained streptomycin-resistant derivative of R. anatipestifer ATCC11845 using 100 μg/mL streptomycin as a selection pressure. Then, we demonstrate that rpsL can be used as a counterselectable marker in the R. anatipestifer ATCC11845 rpsL mutant strain, namely, R. anatipestifer ATCCs. A suicide vector carrying wild-type rpsL, namely, pORS, was constructed and used for markerless deletion of the gene RA0C_1534, which encodes a putative sigma-70 family RNA polymerase sigma factor. Using rpsL as a counterselectable marker, markerless mutagenesis of RA0C_1534 was also performed based on natural transformation. R. anatipestifer ATCCsΔRA0C_1534 was more sensitive to H2O2-generated oxidative stress than R. anatipestifer ATCCs. Moreover, transcription of RA0C_1534 was upregulated under 10 mM H2O2 treatment and upon mutation of fur. These results suggest that RA0C_1534 is involved in oxidative stress response in R. anatipestifer. The markerless gene mutation method developed in this study provides new tools for investigation of the physiology and pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W2952638962,"Vehicle movements at signalized intersections should follow the guidance of lane marking arrows. Turns are permitted or banned depending on the existence of lane marking arrows establishing network link connectivity. Lane markings are the interface that joins consecutive upstream and downstream intersections. Traffic flows from origins to destinations across intersections should be governed by lane markings. In this study, conventionally fixed lane markings are relaxed as binary variables to be optimized by maximizing the green bandwidths. The proposed methodology is innovative in that it extends the lane-based design framework to incorporate green band maximization for enhancing traffic signal coordination. Path flows are controlled to satisfy flow conservations and to compile turning flows at intersections. With these turning flows as inputs, lane markings can be optimized together with the coordinated traffic signal settings. Path flows, path travel times, and path choices are evaluated through new linear constraints. For path travel times, cruise times along lanes and total delays at the ends of lanes are evaluated. The non-linear total delays are approximated by the proposed linearized delay function. The model coefficients are calibrated by network data as in a previous study. The problem is formulated as a binary-mixed-integer-linear-program and solved by standard branch-and-bound techniques using a CPLEX solver. To avoid non-linearity in the problem formulation, the bandwidth maximization approach is adopted instead of minimizing the total network delay in the design of the signalized network. A network with four intersections is provided to demonstrate how optimized lane markings can create efficient network link configurations. The numerical results are promising compared with those obtained in previous studies and show that the overall network performance can be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2953116283,"Antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and clozapine have been reported to increase the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to flashes of light in the P23H rat model of retinitis pigmentosa. In order to better understand the effects of these antipsychotic drugs on the visual responses of P23H rat RGCs, I examined the responses of RGCs to a drifting sinusoidal grating of various contrasts. In-vitro multielectrode array recordings were made from P23H rat RGCs and healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat RGCs. Retinas were stimulated with a drifting sinusoidal grating with eight values of contrast (0, 4, 6, 8.5, 13, 26, 51, and 83%). Contrast response functions based on response amplitudes were fitted with a hyperbolic ratio function and contrast thresholds were determined from the fitted curves. SD rat RGCs were divided into two categories, saturating and non-saturating cells, based on whether they showed saturation of responses at high contrast levels. Most SD rat RGCs (58%) were saturating cells. Haloperidol and clozapine decreased the responses of saturating SD rat RGCs to all grating contrasts, except for the highest contrast tested. Clozapine also decreased the responses of non-saturating SD rat RGCs to all grating contrasts, except for the highest contrast tested. Haloperidol did not however significantly affect the responses of non-saturating SD rat RGCs. Haloperidol and clozapine increased the contrast thresholds of both saturating and non-saturating cells in SD rat retinas. Most (73%) P23H rat RGCs could be categorized as either saturating or non-saturating cells. The remaining 'uncategorized' cells were poorly responsive to the drifting grating and were analyzed separately. Haloperidol and clozapine increased the responses of non-saturating and uncategorized P23H rat RGCs to most grating contrasts, including the highest contrast tested. Haloperidol and clozapine also increased the responses of saturating P23H rat RGCs to most grating contrasts but these increases were not statistically significant. Haloperidol and clozapine decreased the contrast thresholds of saturating cells, non-saturating cells and uncategorized cells in P23H rat retinas, although the decrease in contrast thresholds of saturating cells was not found to be statistically significant. Overall, the findings show that haloperidol and clozapine have differential effects on the contrast response functions of SD and P23H rat RGCs. In contrast to the effects observed on SD rat RGCs, both haloperidol and clozapine increased the responsiveness of P23H rat RGCs to both low and high contrast visual stimuli and decreased contrast thresholds."
https://openalex.org/W2949160854,"Nigeria account for a significant proportion of adverse perinatal outcome. Nigerian studies assessing impact of time of delivery on perinatal outcome are scarce. This study evaluates any associations between time of delivery and perinatal outcome.This was a cross-sectional study at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki from 01 January 2016 to 30 June 2018. Data were analysed with IBM SPSS version 25.0.A total of 4,556 deliveries were analysed. Majority (72.2%) delivered on week days and 27.8% on weekends. Over 90% had 1st and 5th minutes Apgar scores ≥7. There was statistical difference in NICU admission between morning and evening hours (p = 0.009) but not between morning and night hours (p = 0.795). ENND during evening was twice higher (1.2%) than morning (0.5%); p = 0.047 and night hours (0.6%); p = 0.623.There was no difference in the risk of fresh stillbirths between morning and evening (p = 0.560), as well as morning and night hours (p = 0.75), there was also no difference in fresh stillbirths between week days and weekends (p = 0.895). There was no difference in low Apgar scores at 1st minute between morning and evening (p = 0.053) and night (p = 0.221), and between weekdays and weekends (p = 0.524). Similarly, there was no difference in low 5th minute Apgar scores between morning and evening (p = 0.165) and night (p = 0.944), as well as between week days and weekends (p = 0.529). However, ENND was twice (p = 0.085) and 1.3 times higher (p = 0.526) for evening and night hours respectively, while there was no difference between weekends and week days (p = 0.652).NICU admission and ENND were commoner during evening hours. However, work hours did not affect the rate of stillbirth and low Apgar scores during weekdays and weekends. It is pertinent for each obstetric unit to identify and modify factors responsible for unfavourable outcomes during various shifts, with the aim of improving perinatal health."
https://openalex.org/W2949713404,"Background The gold standard surgical treatment of nerve injury includes direct repair, nerve graft, and neurolysis. The underlying effects (either beneficial or detrimental) of angiogenesis during nerve regeneration by rotational muscle flap have not yet determined. We assess the neurological outcome and angiogenesis of nerve injury following a rotational muscle flap. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of the patients with severe radial nerve injury by neurolysis and rotational muscle flap; we also mimicked the clinical situation by nerve crush followed by rotational muscle flap in animals to assess associated angiogenesis factor expression. Results Twenty-three out of 25 (92%) cases of severe radial nerve injury underwent neurolysis assisted by muscle flap rotation and eventually reached their preinjury neurological outcome. In the animal study, both FITC–dextran and Dil infusion showed a remarkably increased vascular structure in the crushed nerve integrated by the muscle flap and abolished by Avastin injection. The rotational muscle flap significantly increased angiogenesis factor expression, and this was attenuated by Avastin injection. The increased angiogenesis factor expression paralleled the improvement seen in neurobehavioral and electrophysiological studies as well as the significant expression of nerve regeneration markers and the restoration of denervated muscle morphology. Conclusion Based on the clinical and animal data analysis, we conclude that muscle flap rotation provides a platform for angiogenesis in the acceleration of nerve regeneration. It appears that the muscle flap rotation augmented the nerve regeneration process which may be beneficial for nerve repair in clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2953258233,"During epigenetic reprogramming germ cells activate alternative mechanisms to maintain the repression retrotransposons. This mechanism involves the recruitment of genome defence proteins such as MAEL, PIWIL4 and TDRD9, which associate with piRNAs and promote Line-1 silencing. MAEL, PIWIL4 and TDRD9 form the piP-bodies, which organization and dynamics vary according to the stage of germ cell epigenetic reprogramming. Although these data have been well documented in mice, it is not known how this mechanism operates in the rat. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe the distribution and interaction of MAEL, PIWIL4, TDRD9 and DAZL during rat germ cell development and check whether specific localization of these proteins is related to the distribution of Line-1 aggregates. Rat embryo gonads at 15 days post-conception (dpc), 16dpc and 19dpc were submitted to MAEL, PIWIL4, TDRD9 and DAZL immunolabelling. The gonads of 19dpc embryos were submitted to the double-labelling of MAEL/DAZL, TDRD9/MAEL and PIWIL4/MAEL. The 19dpc gonads were submitted to co-immunoprecipitation assays and fluorescent in situ hybridization for Line-1 detection. MAEL and TDRD9 showed very similar localization at all ages, whereas DAZL and PIWIL4 showed specific distribution, with PIWIL4 showing shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the end epigenetic reprogramming. In quiescent 19dpc gonocytes all proteins colocalized in a nuage adjacent to the nucleus. DAZL interacts with PIWIL4 and MAEL, suggesting that DAZL acts with these proteins to repress Line-1. TDRD9, however, does not interact with DAZL or MAEL despite their colocalization. Line-1 aggregates were detected predominantly in the nuclear periphery, although did not show homogeneous distribution as observed for the nuage. In conclusion, the nuage in quiescent rat gonocytes show a very distinguished organization that might be related to the organization of Line-1 clusters and describe the association of DAZL with proteins responsible for Line-1 repression."
https://openalex.org/W2953375690,"An ancient enzyme family responsible for the catabolism of the prebiotic chemical cyanuric acid (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triol) was recently discovered and is undergoing proliferation in the modern world due to industrial synthesis and dissemination of 1,3,5-triazine compounds. Cyanuric acid has a highly stabilized ring system such that bacteria require a unique enzyme with a novel fold and subtle active site construction to open the ring. Each cyanuric acid hydrolase monomer consists of three isostructural domains that coordinate and activate the three-fold symmetric substrate cyanuric acid for ring opening. We have now solved a series of X-ray structures of an engineered, thermostable cyanuric acid ring-opening enzyme at 1.51 ~ 2.25 Å resolution, including various complexes with the substrate, a tight-binding inhibitor, or an analog of the reaction intermediate. These structures reveal asymmetric interactions between the enzyme and bound ligands, a metal ion binding coupled to conformational changes and substrate binding important for enzyme stability, and distinct roles of the isostructural domains of the enzyme. The multiple conformations of the enzyme observed across a series of structures and corroborating biochemical data suggest importance of the structural dynamics in facilitating the substrate entry and the ring-opening reaction, catalyzed by a conserved Ser-Lys dyad."
https://openalex.org/W2950830238,"Unresponsiveness to dopaminergic therapies is a key feature in the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA) and a major unmet need in the treatment of MSA patients caused by combined striatonigral degeneration (SND). Transgenic, alpha-synuclein animal models do not recapitulate this lack of levodopa responsiveness. In order to preclinically study interventions including striatal cell grafts, models that feature SND are required. Most of the previous studies focused on extensive nigral and striatal lesions corresponding to advanced MSA-P/SND. The aim of the current study was to replicate mild stage MSA-P/SND with L-dopa failure.Two different striatal quinolinic acid (QA) lesions following a striatal 6-OHDA lesion replicating mild and severe MSA-P/SND, respectively, were investigated and compared to 6-OHDA lesioned animals. After the initial 6-OHDA lesion there was a significant improvement of motor performance after dopaminergic stimulation in the cylinder and stepping test (p<0.001). Response to L-dopa treatment declined in both MSA-P/SND groups reflecting striatal damage of lateral motor areas in contrast to the 6-OHDA only lesioned animals (p<0.01). The remaining striatal volume correlated strongly with contralateral apomorphine induced rotation behaviour and contralateral paw use during L-dopa treatment in cylinder and stepping test (p<0.001).Our novel L-dopa response data suggest that L-dopa failure can be induced by restricted lateral striatal lesions combined with dopaminergic denervation. We propose that this sequential striatal double-lesion model replicates a mild stage of MSA-P/SND and is suitable to address neuro-regenerative therapies aimed at restoring dopaminergic responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2950889111,"Understanding how doctors respond to occupational and monetary incentives in health care payment systems is important for determining the effectiveness of such systems. This study examined changes in doctors' behaviors in response to monetary incentives within health care payment systems in a ceteris paribus setting.An online experiment was developed to analyze the effect of monetary incentives similar to fee-for-service (FFS) and capitation (CAP) on doctors' prescription patterns. In the first session, no monetary values were presented. In the second session conducted 1 week later, doctors were randomly assigned to one of two monetary incentive groups (FFS group: n = 25, CAP group: n = 25). In all sessions, doctors were presented with 10 cases and asked to determine the type and number of treatments.In the first session with no monetary incentives, there was no significant difference between the FFS and CAP groups in the number of treatments. When monetary incentives were provided, doctors in the CAP group prescribed fewer treatments than the FFS group. The perceived severity of the cases did not change significantly between sessions and between groups. linear mixed-effects regression model indicated the treatment choices were influenced by monetary incentives, but not by the perceived severity of the patient's symptoms.The monetary values incentivized the doctors' treatment choices, but not their professional evaluation of patients. Monetary values designed within health care systems influence the doctor's decisions in the form of external rewards, in addition to occupational values, and can thus be adjusted by more effective incentives."
https://openalex.org/W2953255226,"Background Atraumatic needles are proposed to lower complication rates after lumbar puncture (LP). Only a minority of physicians use such needles. Here we aimed to assess the impact of specific training in LP during clinical clerkship on the proportion of medical students using atraumatic needles. Methods We performed a case-control study comparing medical students undergoing clinical clerkship and students undergoing specific LP training. The 176 students of a class underwent training in LP just before beginning their clinical rotations. This training consisted of 45 minutes of theoretical training and a 90-minute practical session with a dummy. Twenty students were selected from the class at random, and their competence was assessed with a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), nine months after the specific training. These 20 cases were compared with 20 students randomly selected from a class of 180 students who had not undergone specific training in LP and were at the end of their clinical clerkship. Results We found that 60% of the students with specific training and 25% of those with classic clinical training used an atraumatic needle during the OSCE (p = 0.025). The mean MCQ (/100) scores obtained were 57±15 and 60±15 for the specific and classic training groups, respectively (p = 0.35). Overall OSCE score was similar in the two groups (63.5±9.3 vs. 65.8±9.3; p = 0.20). Conclusion Very few practicing physicians use atraumatic needles, which limits the teaching of their use to medical students. Specific training durably increases the use of appropriate needles."
