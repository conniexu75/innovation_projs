https://openalex.org/W1967428268,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly applied for the treatment of brain disorders, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. Here we evaluate the effect of basal ganglia DBS on cortical function using invasive cortical recordings in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing DBS implantation surgery. In the primary motor cortex of PD patients, neuronal population spiking is excessively synchronized to the phase of network oscillations. This manifests in brain surface recordings as exaggerated coupling between the phase of the beta rhythm and the amplitude of broadband activity. We show that acute therapeutic DBS reversibly reduces phase-amplitude interactions over a similar time course as that of the reduction in parkinsonian motor signs. We propose that DBS of the basal ganglia improves cortical function by alleviating excessive beta phase locking of motor cortex neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2025167083,"We address the mechanism by which adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) become localized to the base of each villus during embryonic development. We find that, early in gut development, proliferating progenitors expressing ISC markers are evenly distributed throughout the epithelium, in both the chick and mouse. However, as the villi form, the putative stem cells become restricted to the base of the villi. This shift in the localization is driven by mechanically influenced reciprocal signaling between the epithelium and underlying mesenchyme. Buckling forces physically distort the shape of the morphogenic field, causing local maxima of epithelial signals, in particular Shh, at the tip of each villus. This induces a suite of high-threshold response genes in the underlying mesenchyme to form a signaling center called the ""villus cluster."" Villus cluster signals, notably Bmp4, feed back on the overlying epithelium to ultimately restrict the stem cells to the base of each villus."
https://openalex.org/W1980811933,"HIV-1-neutralizing antibodies develop in most HIV-1-infected individuals, although highly effective antibodies are generally observed only after years of chronic infection. Here, we characterize the rate of maturation and extent of diversity for the lineage that produced the broadly neutralizing antibody VRC01 through longitudinal sampling of peripheral B cell transcripts over 15 years and co-crystal structures of lineage members. Next-generation sequencing identified VRC01-lineage transcripts, which encompassed diverse antibodies organized into distinct phylogenetic clades. Prevalent clades maintained characteristic features of antigen recognition, though each evolved binding loops and disulfides that formed distinct recognition surfaces. Over the course of the study period, VRC01-lineage clades showed continuous evolution, with rates of ∼2 substitutions per 100 nucleotides per year, comparable to that of HIV-1 evolution. This high rate of antibody evolution provides a mechanism by which antibody lineages can achieve extraordinary diversity and, over years of chronic infection, develop effective HIV-1 neutralization."
https://openalex.org/W2060638067,"Necroptosis represents a key programmed cell death pathway involved in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. However, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in necroptotic signaling has remained unclear. In the present study, we identify ROS as critical regulators of BV6/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-induced necroptotic signaling and cell death. We show that BV6/TNFα-induced cell death depends on ROS production, as several ROS scavengers such as butylated hydroxyanisole, N-acetylcysteine, α-tocopherol and ethyl pyruvate significantly rescue cell death. Before cell death, BV6/TNFα-stimulated ROS generation promotes stabilization of the receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1)/RIP3 necrosome complex via a potential positive feedback loop, as on the one hand radical scavengers attenuate RIP1/RIP3 necrosome assembly and phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL), but on the other hand silencing of RIP1 or RIP3 reduces ROS production. Although MLKL knockdown effectively decreases BV6/TNFα-induced cell death, it does not affect RIP1/RIP3 interaction and only partly reduces ROS generation. Moreover, the deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) promotes BV6/TNFα-induced ROS generation and necrosome assembly even in the presence of BV6, as CYLD silencing attenuates these events. Genetic silencing of phosphoglycerate mutase 5 or dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) fails to protect against BV6/TNFα-induced cell death. By demonstrating that ROS are involved in regulating BV6/TNFα-induced necroptotic signaling, our study provides new insights into redox regulation of necroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1976993918,"High-grade gliomas, glioblastomas (GB), are refractory to conventional treatment combining surgery, chemotherapy, mainly temozolomide, and radiotherapy. This highlights an urgent need to develop novel therapies and increase the efficacy of radio/chemotherapy for these very aggressive and malignant brain tumors. Recently, tumor metabolism became an interesting potential therapeutic target in various cancers. Accordingly, combining drugs targeting cell metabolism with appropriate chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy has become attractive. In light of these perspectives, we were particularly interested in the anti-cancer properties of a biguanide molecule used for type 2 diabetes treatment, metformin. In our present work, we demonstrate that metformin decreases mitochondrial-dependent ATP production and oxygen consumption and increases lactate and glycolytic ATP production. We show that metformin induces decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest, autophagy, apoptosis and cell death in vitro with a concomitant activation of AMPK, Redd1 and inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Cell sensitivity to metformin also depends on the genetic and mutational backgrounds of the different GB cells used in this study, particularly their PTEN status. Interestingly, knockdown of AMPK and Redd1 with siRNA partially, but incompletely, abrogates the induction of apoptosis by metformin suggesting both AMPK/Redd1-dependent and –independent effects. However, the primary determinant of the effect of metformin on cell growth is the genetic and mutational backgrounds of the glioma cells. We further demonstrate that metformin treatment in combination with temozolomide and/or irradiation induces a synergistic anti-tumoral response in glioma cell lines. Xenografts performed in nude mice demonstrate in vivo that metformin delays tumor growth. As current treatments for GB commonly fail to cure, the need for more effective therapeutic options is overwhelming. Based on these results, metformin could represent a potential enhancer of the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide and/or radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2080134369,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has an established role in promoting tumor progression and the acquisition of therapeutic resistance. Here, the EMT phenotype was detected in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines, and correlated with decreased miR-186 expression, increased Twist1 expression, chemoresistance and poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Introducing miR-186 into EOC cells led to a reduction in twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1) expression along with morphological, functional and molecular changes consistent with mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, G1 cell-cycle arrest and enhanced cell apoptosis, which consequently rendered the cells more sensitive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, luciferase reporter and rescue assay results showed that the EMT and drug resistance reversal in response to miR-186 was mediated by Twist1. Collectively, these findings implicate miR-186 as an attractive candidate for overcoming chemoresistance in ovarian cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2071494920,"Tumor vessels are characterized by abnormal morphology and hyperpermeability that together cause inefficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. Although vascular endothelial growth factor has been established as a critical regulator of tumor angiogenesis, the role of mechanical signaling in the regulation of tumor vasculature or tumor endothelial cell (TEC) function is not known. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) regulates tumor angiogenesis and tumor vessel maturation via modulation of TEC mechanosensitivity. We found that TECs exhibit reduced TRPV4 expression and function, which is correlated with aberrant mechanosensitivity towards extracellular matrix stiffness, increased migration and abnormal angiogenesis by TEC. Further, syngeneic tumor experiments revealed that the absence of TRPV4 induced increased vascular density, vessel diameter and reduced pericyte coverage resulting in enhanced tumor growth in TRPV4 knockout mice. Importantly, overexpression or pharmacological activation of TRPV4 restored aberrant TEC mechanosensitivity, migration and normalized abnormal angiogenesis in vitro by modulating Rho activity. Finally, a small molecule activator of TRPV4, GSK1016790A, in combination with anticancer drug cisplatin, significantly reduced tumor growth in wild-type mice by inducing vessel maturation. Our findings demonstrate TRPV4 channels to be critical regulators of tumor angiogenesis and represent a novel target for anti-angiogenic and vascular normalization therapies."

While all cells secrete proteins through the conserved Sec system, bacteria also utilize specialized secretion systems to interact with their environment (Waksman, 2012Waksman G. Bacterial secretion comes of age.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2012; 367: 1014-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These systems are particularly important for bacterial pathogens, as they allow for regulated secretion of virulence factors into eukaryotic cells during infection. The type VII secretion (T7S) system, the only specialized secretion system found exclusively in Gram-positive bacteria (Huppert et al., 2014Huppert L.A. Ramsdell T.L. Chase M.R. Sarracino D.A.

The significance of this secretion system is further highlighted by the fact that loss of the ESX-1 T7S system in M. tuberculosis is the most important genetic difference between virulent strains that cause tuberculosis and the live attenuated vaccine strain, BCG (Brodin et al., 2006Brodin P.

Med. 2003; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, despite its medical importance and its broad evolutionary conservation, the molecular architecture, mechanism of secretion, and regulation of T7S are unknown. T7S systems have been identified in many Gram-positive organisms and are defined by the presence of two conserved elements: EccC, a membrane-bound protein with three predicted ATPase domains, and EsxB, a small secretion substrate containing a WXG motif (Bitter et al., 2009Bitter W. Houben E.N.G. Bottai D. Brodin P. Brown E.J. Cox J.S. Derbyshire K. Fortune S.M. Gao L.-Y.

The ESAT-6/WXG100 superfamily — and a new Gram-positive secretion system?.Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 209-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Other components have been genetically linked to T7S, but these are not universally conserved (Abdallah et al., 2007Abdallah A.M. Gey van Pittius N.C. Champion P.A.D. Cox J. Luirink J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.J.E. Appelmelk B.J. Bitter W. Type VII secretion—mycobacteria show the way.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). EccC and EsxB interact physically (Stanley et al., 2003Stanley S.A. Raghavan S. Hwang W.W. Cox J.S. Acute infection and macrophage subversion by Mycobacterium tuberculosis require a specialized secretion system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13001-13006Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), and the last seven amino acids of EsxB constitute a “signal sequence” that is necessary and sufficient for secretion through the ESX-1 system (Champion et al., 2006Champion P.A.D. Stanley S.A. Champion M.M. Brown E.J. Cox J.S. C-terminal signal sequence promotes virulence factor secretion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Science. 2006; 313: 1632-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although additional signals adjacent to these sequences are also required for full secretion (Daleke et al., 2012Daleke M.H. Ummels R. Bawono P. Heringa J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Luirink J. Bitter W. General secretion signal for the mycobacterial type VII secretion pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA. 2012; 109: 11342-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Sysoeva et al., 2014Sysoeva T.A. Zepeda-Rivera M.A. Huppert L.A. Burton B.M. Dimer recognition and secretion by the ESX secretion system in Bacillus subtilis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 7653-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of T7S substrate-targeting selection is not known, and our understanding of substrate recognition has been mostly limited to yeast two-hybrid and genetic studies. One interesting feature of T7S is that substrates are co-dependent for secretion (Fortune et al., 2005Fortune S.M. Jaeger A. Sarracino D.A. Chase M.R. Sassetti C.M. Sherman D.R. Bloom B.R. Rubin E.J. Mutually dependent secretion of proteins required for mycobacterial virulence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 10676-10681Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), in that genetic removal of one substrate abrogates secretion of all other substrates through a specific T7S system. This unique feature of T7S has complicated the study of individual virulence factors in the context of infection and has thwarted attempts to genetically engineer these systems to secrete heterologous proteins. EccC has a unique multi-domain structure consisting of a two-pass transmembrane domain, a short domain of unknown function (DUF), and three P loop NTPase domains that share ∼20% identity to one another (Figure 1A). The ATPase domains are evolutionarily related to the ASCE (additional strand conserved glutamate) fold family that includes protein and DNA-directed mechanoenzymes such as FtsK, VirD4 (TrwB), and VirB4 (TrwK) (Erzberger and Berger, 2006Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Evolutionary relationships and structural mechanisms of AAA+ proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). These motor proteins generally assemble into hexameric rings with the ATPase activity dependent on “arginine finger” residues that extend into adjacent monomers to form the active site (Ahmadian et al., 1997Ahmadian M.R. Stege P. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Confirmation of the arginine-finger hypothesis for the GAP-stimulated GTP-hydrolysis reaction of Ras.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The individual ATPase domains of EccC are unique in that each has a long N-terminal linker that is of unknown function but contains several motifs that are highly conserved among all of the EccC proteins. We present here a series of structures of EccC, both with and without the EsxB signal sequence, that reveal that EccC exists in an autoinhibited state as a tightly integrated set of three ATPase domains joined to one another through specific linker/pocket interactions. We show that EccC activity is activated by disruption of one of these linker interactions and is further activated through substrate-mediated multimerization of the enzyme. Our findings suggest that substrates, in addition to serving roles outside of the cell, are also necessary components of the secretion apparatus itself, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the unique interdependence of substrate secretion in T7S. To understand the nature of the interaction between EccC and EsxB using an in vitro system, we screened a panel of EccC/EsxB pairs from various bacterial species and found robust expression in E. coli of the cytoplasmic portion of EccC from the thermophilic actinobacterium Thermomonospora curvata (TcEccC(cyto)) and its cognate EsxB partner (TcEsxB). The T. curvata secretion system shares close homology with other actinomycete T7S systems and contains all of the conserved components identified in the M. tuberculosis Esx systems, including EsxA, EsxB, EccC, EccD, EccB, and MycP1 (Bitter et al., 2009Bitter W. Houben E.N.G. Bottai D. Brodin P. Brown E.J. Cox J.S. Derbyshire K. Fortune S.M. Gao L.-Y. Liu J. et al.Systematic genetic nomenclature for type VII secretion systems.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000507Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). TcEccC(cyto), TcEsxA, and TcEsxB were all stable in isolation and strongly bound one another to form an EccC:EsxB:EsxA complex (Figure 1B; Figures S1B and S1C). Similar to yeast two-hybrid studies with M. tuberculosis proteins (Champion et al., 2006Champion P.A.D. Stanley S.A. Champion M.M. Brown E.J. Cox J.S. C-terminal signal sequence promotes virulence factor secretion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Science. 2006; 313: 1632-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the last seven amino acids of TcEsxB specifically targeted the substrate to TcEccC, and swapping this sequence with the C terminus of MtEsxB1 completely reversed the specificity (Figure 1C). Thus, the known EccC interactions of the virulence-associated ESX-1 system of M. tuberculosis are recapitulated in our model system. In the ESX-1 system in M. tuberculosis, MtEccC is split into two polypeptides, MtEccCa (containing the trans- and juxtamembrane regions and ATPase1) and MtEccCb (containing ATPase2 and ATPase3), which interact with one another to form a complete MtEccCab complex (Stanley et al., 2003Stanley S.A. Raghavan S. Hwang W.W. Cox J.S. Acute infection and macrophage subversion by Mycobacterium tuberculosis require a specialized secretion system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13001-13006Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The substrate MtEsxB interacts exclusively with MtEccCb and not with MtEccCa, and we found this feature was conserved in our T. curvata system. When we artificially split TcEccC into “TcEccCa” and “TcEccCb” fragments orthologous to the tuberculosis ESX-1 proteins, these fragments interacted robustly in the two-hybrid assay (Figure S1B). Likewise, EsxB interacted directly with TcEccCb, but not TcEccCa, which parallels the ESX-1 system (Figures S1B and S1D). In analogy with other phylogenetically related translocases (Guglielmini et al., 2013Guglielmini J. de la Cruz F. Rocha E.P. Evolution of conjugation and type IV secretion systems.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30: 315-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which are often strongly activated by their substrates (Massey et al., 2006Massey T.H. Mercogliano C.P. Yates J. Sherratt D.J. Löwe J. Double-stranded DNA translocation: structure and mechanism of hexameric FtsK.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 457-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that binding of TcEccC(cyto) to the substrate TcEsxB would activate its ATPase domains. However we could not measure any ATPase activity in the TcEccC(cyto) or TcEccCb proteins, either in the presence or absence of TcEsxB (Figure S1E). Likewise, the nucleotide binding state of EccC had no effect on the apparent KD of signal-sequence binding (Figure S1F). This unexpected result suggested that the binding to EccC does not immediately lead to work being done on the substrate. In order to understand the interaction between EsxB and EccC, we solved the structure of TcEccCb (containing ATPase2 and ATPase3) using data to 3.24 Å resolution, in combination with a peptide containing the last 23 residues of the TcEsxB substrate, including the C-terminal signal sequence (Figure 2A; Figure S2A and Table S2). Both ATPase2 and ATPase3 are clearly bound to ATP in the structure (Figures 2B and 2C), suggesting that the ATPase activity of these domains is indeed extremely low, even in the presence of saturating amounts of EsxB signal-sequence peptide. This ATPase-inactivated state appears to be evolutionarily conserved, as a high-resolution crystal structure of a fragment of the related EssC ATPase from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans (“GbEssCb”) has a very similar structure, with both domains bound to ATP (Figure S2B).Figure S2Co-Crystal Structure Reveals Signal-Sequence Binding Pocket in TcEccCb, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Simulated-annealing difference-density map (gold) of TcEccCb calculated without the signal-sequence peptide and contoured at 3 σ.

The C terminus of the signal-sequence peptide, which was previously thought to be unstructured (Renshaw et al., 2005Renshaw P.S. Lightbody K.L. Veverka V. Muskett F.W. Kelly G. Frenkiel T.A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Burke B. Norman J. et al.Structure and function of the complex formed by the tuberculosis virulence factors CFP-10 and ESAT-6.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), forms a short amphipathic helix (residues 96–103) that interacts exclusively with the hydrophobic pocket on ATPase3 (pocket3) (Figure 2A). This C-terminal helix is likely a common feature of all EsxB homologs (Poulsen et al., 2014Poulsen C. Panjikar S. Holton S.J. Wilmanns M. Song Y.-H. WXG100 protein superfamily consists of three subfamilies and exhibits an α-helical C-terminal conserved residue pattern.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e89313Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The helix was also present in a higher-resolution structure of the full-length TcEsxBA complex in the absence of ATPase3 (Figure 2D and Table S2). Here, we observed the characteristic helical hairpin seen in all EsxB homolog proteins; however, in our structure, the chain makes a turn through a short extended region (residues 93–95) before ending in a helix that matches the length of helix observed in the ATPase complex structure. Of note, this helix is found in a crystal contact with an adjacent symmetry related molecule, which could artificially stabilize the helical structure. Although present in the EsxB fragment crystallized with EccC, the Y-X-X-X-D/E motif implicated in secretion (Daleke et al., 2012Daleke M.H. Ummels R. Bawono P. Heringa J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M.

USA. 2014; 111: 7653-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was disordered in our crystal, suggesting that it is not involved in recognition of the signal-sequence motif. Importantly, pocket3 is distant from the ATP catalytic site, and binding of the peptide does not appear to alter the ATP binding ability of ATPase3. Mutation of any of the EsxB interaction residues on either EsxB or EccC completely abrogated the interaction, demonstrating the specificity of its binding to pocket3 (Figures 2E and S2C). Together, these data show that TcEsxB is targeted to TcEccCb through specific binding to the hydrophobic pocket3 on ATPase3, but binding of the C terminus of TcEsxB neither requires nor enhances nucleotide hydrolysis or exchange. Because EccC lacked ATPase activity with or without substrate, we examined the evolutionary conservation of each ATPase domain among many unique EccC orthologs to determine whether the residues required for ATPase activity are conserved. We found that the catalytic residues of ATPase2 and ATPase3 are highly degenerate with respect to other related ATPases, especially in the catalytic glutamate of the Walker B motif (Figure S2D). Such changes might be expected to greatly reduce or eliminate ATP hydrolysis (Wendler et al., 2012Wendler P. Ciniawsky S. Kock M. Kube S. Structure and function of the AAA+ nucleotide binding pocket.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the presence of ATP in these domains observed in our crystal structures. In contrast, ATPase1 is highly conserved with its closest known homolog, the motor protein FtsK, suggesting that ATPase1 may serve as the active motor domain for EccC. Thus, ATPase2 and ATPase3 appear to be naturally suboptimal ATPases, similar to the catalytically inactive domains of other multimeric ATPases such as dynein (Carter et al., 2011Carter A.P. Cho C. Jin L. Vale R.D. Crystal structure of the dynein motor domain.Science. 2011; 331: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and the F1-ATPase (Walker, 2013Walker J.E. The ATP synthase: the understood, the uncertain and the unknown.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2013; 41: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To understand the structure of ATPase1 and its relationship to ATPase2 and ATPase3, we solved the crystal structure of the full cytoplasmic domain of TcEccC, “TcEccC(cyto),” using data to 2.9 Å resolution (Figure 3A; Figures S3A and S3B; Table S3). Although the full protein is present in the crystal (Figure S3C), the N-terminal “DUF” domain and linker1 are disordered in the structure and could not be modeled. The structure is monomeric, as it is in solution (Figure S3D), and ATPase2 and ATPase3 are very similar in both their conformation and nucleotide binding state compared to the TcEccCb structure (RMSD 0.7 Å), showing that binding of the signal sequence does not alter EccC’s structure in these domains. The interface between ATPase1 and ATPase2 is remarkably similar to the interface between ATPase2 and ATPase3, joining together the three domains in a direct translation where the only interfaces between the domains are mediated by the inter-domain linkers. Highlighting the general importance of these linker interactions, removal of the N-terminal 34 amino acids homologous to linker2 on MtEccCb completely blocked binding to MtEccCa (Figures S3E and S3F). Single-particle electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction of TcEccC(cyto) and a related ATPase from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans revealed a similar monomeric structure that was remarkably rigid, as illustrated in the homogeneity of the class averages (Figures 3B and 3C; Figures S3G, S3H, S3I, and S3J). The DUF domain, which is required for secretion in vivo (Figure S3K), is also visible in these images, though its density is reduced, likely due to averaging of multiple flexible states.Figure S3ATPase1 Is Autoinhibited and Integrated into a Ridged Array of ATPase Domains, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) MIR phased and density modified map of TcEccC(cyto) phase extended to 2.9 Å with native data and contoured to 1.2 σ.

Although glycolysis increases throughout the reprogramming process, we show that the estrogen-related nuclear receptors (ERRα and ERRγ) and their partnered co-factors PGC-1α and PGC-1β are transiently induced at an early stage, resulting in a burst of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity. Upregulation of ERRα or ERRγ is required for the OXPHOS burst in both human and mouse cells, respectively, as well as iPSC generation itself. Failure to induce this metabolic switch collapses the reprogramming process. Furthermore, we identify a rare pool of Sca1(-)/CD34(-) sortable cells that is highly enriched in bona fide reprogramming progenitors. Transcriptional profiling confirmed that these progenitors are ERRγ and PGC-1β positive and have undergone extensive metabolic reprogramming. These studies characterize a previously unrecognized, ERR-dependent metabolic gate prior to establishment of induced pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2028939300,"Sharp wave–associated field oscillations (∼200 Hz) of the hippocampus, referred to as ripples, are believed to be important for consolidation of explicit memory. Little is known about how ripples are regulated by other brain regions. We found that the median raphe region (MnR) is important for regulating hippocampal ripple activity and memory consolidation. We performed in vivo simultaneous recording in the MnR and hippocampus of mice and found that, when a group of MnR neurons was active, ripples were absent. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of MnR neurons suppressed ripple activity and inhibition of these neurons increased ripple activity. Notably, using a fear conditioning procedure, we found that photostimulation of MnR neurons interfered with memory consolidation. Our results demonstrate a critical role of the MnR in regulating ripples and memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W1976285590,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to have critical roles in regulating cancer cell proliferation, survival and sensitivity to chemotherapy. The potential application of using miRNAs to predict therapeutic response to cancer treatment holds high promise, but miRNAs with predictive value remain to be identified and underlying mechanisms have not been completely understood. Here, we show a strong correlation between miR-621 expression and chemosensitivity to paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PTX/CBP) regimen, an effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. High level of miR-621 predicts better response to PTX/CBP regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, who also tend to achieve pathological complete response. Ectopic overexpression of miR-621 promoted apoptosis and increased chemosensitivity to PTX and CBP both in cultured breast cancer cells and in xenograft tumor model. We further show that FBXO11 is a direct functional target of miR-621 and miR-621 level is negatively correlated with FBXO11 expression in breast cancer patients. Ectopic expression of FBXO11 attenuated increased apoptosis in breast cancer cells overexpressing miR-621 upon PTX or CBP treatment. Consistently, high FBXO11 expression significantly correlated with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found in breast cancer cells FBXO11 interacts with p53 and promotes its neddylation, which suppressed the p53 transactivity. Accordingly, miR-621-dependent FBXO11 suppression enhanced p53 activity and increased apoptosis in breast cancer cells exposed to chemotherapeutics. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-621 enhances chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to PTX/CBP chemotherapy by suppressing FBXO11-dependent inhibition of p53. miR-621 may serve as a predictive biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1973256886,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is commonly activated in colon cancer. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major downstream target of the PI3K/ATK pathway and activates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of messenger RNA translation and ribosome synthesis. Rapamycin analogs Everolimus and Temsirolimus are non-ATP-competitive mTORC1 inhibitors, and suppress proliferation and tumor angiogenesis and invasion. We now show that apoptosis plays a key role in their anti-tumor activities in colon cancer cells and xenografts through the DR5, FADD and caspase-8 axis, and is strongly enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and 5-fluorouracil. The induction of DR5 by rapalogs is mediated by the ER stress regulator and transcription factor CHOP, but not the tumor suppressor p53, on rapid and sustained inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and attenuated by eIF4E expression. ATP-competitive mTOR/PI3K inhibitors also promote DR5 induction and FADD-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cells. These results establish activation of ER stress and the death receptor pathway as a novel anticancer mechanism of mTOR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1986998390,"Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitic infection is the main health constraint for small ruminant production, causing loss of weight and/or death. Red Maasai sheep have adapted to a tropical environment where extreme parasite exposure is a constant, especially with highly pathogenic Haemonchus contortus. This breed has been reported to be resistant to gastrointestinal parasite infection, hence it is considered an invaluable resource to study associations between host genetics and resistance. The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms strongly associated with host resistance in a double backcross population derived from Red Maasai and Dorper sheep using a SNP-based GWAS analysis. The animals that were genotyped represented the most resistant and susceptible individuals based on the tails of phenotypic distribution (10% each) for average faecal egg counts (AVFEC). AVFEC, packed cell volume (AVPCV), and live weight (AVLWT) were adjusted for fixed effects and co-variables, and an association analysis was run using EMMAX. Revised significance levels were calculated using 100,000 permutation tests. The top five significant SNP markers with - log10 p-values >3.794 were observed on five different chromosomes for AVFEC, and BLUPPf90/PostGSf90 results confirmed EMMAX significant regions for this trait. One of these regions included a cluster of significant SNP on chromosome (Chr) 6 not in linkage disequilibrium to each other. This genomic location contains annotated genes involved in cytokine signalling, haemostasis and mucus biosynthesis. Only one association detected on Chr 7 was significant for both AVPCV and AVLWT. The results generated here reveal candidate immune variants for genes involved in differential response to infection and provide additional SNP marker information that has potential to aid selection of resistance to gastrointestinal parasites in sheep of a similar genetic background to the double backcross population."
https://openalex.org/W2018297711,"Through in vivo selection of multiple ER-negative human breast cancer populations for enhanced tumour-forming capacity, we have derived subpopulations that generate tumours more efficiently than their parental populations at low cell numbers. Tumorigenic-enriched subpopulations exhibited increased expression of LAMA4, FOXQ1 and NAP1L3—genes that are also expressed at greater levels by independently derived metastatic subpopulations. These genes promote metastatic efficiency. FOXQ1 promotes LAMA4 expression, and LAMA4 enhances clonal expansion following substratum detachment in vitro, tumour re-initiation in multiple organs, and disseminated metastatic cell proliferation and colonization. The promotion of cancer cell proliferation and tumour re-initiation by LAMA4 requires β1-integrin. Increased LAMA4 expression marks the transition of human pre-malignant breast lesions to malignant carcinomas, and tumoral LAMA4 overexpression predicts reduced relapse-free survival in ER-negative patients. Our findings reveal common features that govern primary and metastatic tumour re-initiation and identify a key molecular determinant of these processes."

Non-flagellar T3SS (NF-T3SS) and T6SS are complex molecular machines that deliver effector proteins from bacterial cells into the environment or into other eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, with significant implications for pathogenesis of the strains encoding them. Meanwhile, T4SS is a more functionally diverse system, which is involved in not only effector translocation but also conjugation and DNA uptake/release. Development of control strategies against bacterial-mediated diseases requires genomic identification of the virulence arsenal of pathogenic bacteria, with T3SS, T4SS and T6SS being major determinants in this regard. Therefore, computational methods for systematic identification of these specialised machines are of particular interest. With the aim of facilitating this task, T346Hunter provides a user-friendly web-based tool for the prediction of T3SS, T4SS and T6SS clusters in newly sequenced bacterial genomes. After inspection of the available scientific literature, we constructed a database of hidden Markov model (HMM) protein profiles and sequences representing the various components of T3SS, T4SS and T6SS. T346Hunter performs searches of such a database against user-supplied bacterial sequences and localises enriched regions in any of these three types of secretion systems. Moreover, through the T346Hunter server, users can visualise the predicted clusters obtained for approximately 1700 bacterial chromosomes and plasmids.

https://openalex.org/W2009424856,"The osteogenic transcription factor, Runx2, is abnormally expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) and associated with metastatic disease. During bone development, Runx2 is activated by signals known to be hyperactive in PCa including the RAS/MAP kinase pathway, which phosphorylates Runx2 on multiple serine residues including S301 and S319 (equivalent to S294 and S312 in human Runx2). This study examines the role of these phosphorylation sites in PCa. Runx2 was preferentially expressed in more invasive PCa cell lines (PC3>C4-2B>LNCaP). Furthermore, analysis using a P-S319-Runx2-specific antibody revealed that the ratio of P-S319-Runx2/total Runx2 as well as P-ERK/total ERK was highest in PC3 followed by C4-2B and LNCaP cells. These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, which showed a higher percentage of PC3 cells staining positive for P-S319-Runx2 relative to C4-2B and LNCaP cells. Phosphorylated Runx2 had an exclusively nuclear localization. When expressed in prostate cell lines, wild-type Runx2 increased metastasis-associated gene expression, in vitro migratory and invasive activity as well as in vivo growth of tumor cell xenografts. In contrast, S301A/S319A phosphorylation site mutations greatly attenuated these Runx2 responses. Analysis of tissue microarrays from 129 patients revealed strong nuclear staining with the P-S319-Runx2 antibody in primary PCas and metastases. P-S319-Runx2 staining was positively correlated with Gleason score and occurrence of lymph node metastases while little or no Runx2 phosphorylation was seen in normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia or prostatitis indicating that Runx2 S319 phosphorylation is closely associated with PCa induction and progression towards an aggressive phenotype. These studies establish the importance of Runx2 phosphorylation in prostate tumor growth and highlight its value as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target."

From a broad-scale effort to match antineoplastic natural products to their cellular activities, we found that didemnin B selectively induces rapid and wholesale apoptosis through dual inhibition of PPT1 and EEF1A1. Furthermore, empirical discovery of a small panel of exceptional responders to didemnin B allowed the generation of a regularized regression model to extract a sparse-feature genetic biomarker capable of predicting sensitivity to didemnin B. This may facilitate patient selection in a fashion that could enhance and expand the therapeutic application of didemnin B against neoplastic disease."

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been the focus of research owing to their necessity of inclusion in a healthy diet. However, the effects of LCPUFAs on human osteoclast formation and function have not been explored before. A human CD14+ monocyte differentiation model was used to elucidate the effects of an ω-3 LCPUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and an ω-6 LCPUFA, arachidonic acid (AA), on osteoclast formation and activity. CD14+ monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors and stimulated with macrophage colony stimulating factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand to generate osteoclasts. Data from this study revealed that both the LCPUFAs decreased osteoclast formation potential of CD14+ monocytes in a dose-dependent manner when treated at an early stage of differentiation. Moreover, when exposed at a late stage of osteoclast differentiation AA and DHA impaired the bone resorptive potential of mature osteoclasts without affecting osteoclast numbers. AA and DHA abrogated vitronectin receptor expression in differentiating as well as mature osteoclasts. In contrast, the degree of inhibition for calcitonin receptor expression varied between the LCPUFAs with only AA causing inhibition during osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, AA and DHA down regulated the expression of key osteoclast-specific genes in differentiating as well as mature osteoclasts. This study demonstrates for the first time that LCPUFAs can modulate osteoclast formation and function in a human primary osteoclast cell line."

We investigated the role of ALADIN in the human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R1 by either over-expression or down-regulation of ALADIN. Our findings indicate that AAAS knock-down induces a down-regulation of genes coding for type II microsomal cytochrome P450 hydroxylases CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 and their electron donor enzyme cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, thereby decreasing biosynthesis of precursor metabolites required for glucocorticoid and androgen production. Furthermore we demonstrate that ALADIN deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and alteration in redox homeostasis after paraquat treatment. Finally, we show significantly impaired nuclear import of DNA ligase 1, aprataxin and ferritin heavy chain 1 in ALADIN knock-down cells. We conclude that down-regulating ALADIN results in decreased oxidative stress response leading to alteration in steroidogenesis, highlighting our knock-down cell model as an important in-vitro tool for studying the adrenal phenotype in triple A syndrome."

Ets DNA binding, selectivity, and regulation have been extensively studied; however, questions still arise regarding binding specificity outside the core GGA recognition sequence and the mode of action of Ets post-translational modifications. Here, we report the crystal structures of Etv1, Etv4, Etv5, and Fev, alone and in complex with DNA. We identify previously unrecognized features of the protein-DNA interface. Interactions with the DNA backbone account for most of the binding affinity. We describe a highly coordinated network of water molecules acting in base selection upstream of the GGAA core and the structural features that may account for discrimination against methylated cytidine residues. Unexpectedly, all proteins crystallized as disulfide-linked dimers, exhibiting a novel interface (distant to the DNA recognition helix). Homodimers of Etv1, Etv4, and Etv5 could be reduced to monomers, leading to a 40-200-fold increase in DNA binding affinity.

The AhR is widely known as a mediator of dioxin toxicity; however, it also suppresses cancer cell proliferation and recent findings have implicated its role as a tumor suppressor. We conducted a chemical library screen to identify nontoxic AhR ligands with anti-cancer effects and discovered flutamide (Eulexin) as a putative AhR ligand. Flutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of prostate cancer. We found that flutamide inhibited the growth of several cancer cell lines independent of AR status, and that suppression of AhR expression reversed the anti-proliferative effects of flutamide. We investigated the AhR-dependent mechanism of action of flutamide in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and identified that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is induced by flutamide in an AhR-dependent manner. In contrast, the potent AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin had no effect on TGF-β1 expression, indicating the ligand specificity of AhR activation. We also determined that TGF-β1 induction is required for the AhR-dependent growth inhibitory effects of flutamide.

We found that the small molecule inhibitor of NEDDylation, MLN4924, alters the morphology and increases the surface size of the nucleolus in human and germline cells of Caenorhabditis elegans in the absence of nucleolar fragmentation. SILAC proteomics and monitoring of rRNA production, processing and ribosome profiling shows that MLN4924 changes the composition of the nucleolar proteome but does not inhibit RNA Pol I transcription. Further analysis demonstrates that MLN4924 activates the p53 tumour suppressor through the RPL11/RPL5-Mdm2 pathway, with characteristics of nucleolar stress. The study identifies the nucleolus as a target of inhibitors of NEDDylation and provides a mechanism for p53 activation upon NEDD8 inhibition.

Astilbin administration started either at week 8 or week 12 of age though week 20. In the early treatment regimen, the treatment with astilbin reduced splenomegaly/lymphomegaly, autoantibody production and ameliorated lupus nephritis. Several serum cytokines were significantly decreased upon treatment including IFN-g, IL-17A, IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-6. Both spleen CD44 hi CD62L lo activated T cells and CD138+B220- plasma cells greatly declined. Furthermore, astilbin treatment resulted in decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in activated T cells and downregulated expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on LPS stimulated B cells. Similar but less profound effectiveness was observed in the mice with established disease in the late treatment regimen. These results indicate that the natural product astilbin can mitigate disease development in lupus-prone mice by decreasing functional activated T and B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2334762855,"Numerous studies indicate that p300 acts as a key transcriptional cofactor in vivo, at least, in part, by modulating activities of p53 by acetylation. Nevertheless, the regulation of the p53-p300 interplay is not completely understood. Here, we have identified the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase 24 (DDX24) as a novel regulator of the p300-p53 axis. We found that DDX24 interacts with p300, and this interaction leads to suppression of p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Notably, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous DDX24 significantly increases the acetylation levels of endogenous p53 in human cancer cells and subsequently promotes p53-mediated activation of its transcriptional targets such as p21 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). In contrast, DDX24 expression inhibits the p300-p53 interaction and suppresses p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Moreover, DDX24 is overexpressed in human cancer cells and reduction of DDX24 protein levels by RNA interference induces cell cycle arrest and senescence in a p53-dependent manner. These results reveal DDX24 as an important regulator of p300 and suggest that the modulation of the p53-p300 interplay by DDX24 is critical in controlling p53 activities in human cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1988827954,"Innate immunity plays a pivotal role in obesity-induced low-grade inflammation originating from adipose tissue. Key receptors of the innate immune system including Toll-like receptors-2 and -4 (TLRs) are triggered by nutrient excess to promote inflammation. The role of other TLRs in this process is largely unknown. In addition to double-stranded viral mRNA, TLR-3 can also recognize mRNA from dying endogenous cells, a process that is frequently observed within obese adipose tissue. Here, we identified profound expression of TLR-3 in adipocytes and investigated its role during diet-induced obesity. Human adipose tissue biopsies (n=80) and an adipocyte cell-line were used to study TLR-3 expression and function. TLR-3-/- and WT animals were exposed to a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to induce obesity. Expression of TLR-3 was significantly higher in human adipocytes compared to the non-adipocyte cells part of the adipose tissue. In vitro, TLR-3 expression was induced during differentiation of adipocytes and stimulation of the receptor led to elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, TLR-3 deficiency did not significantly influence HFD-induced obesity, insulin sensitivity or inflammation. In humans, TLR-3 expression in adipose tissue did not correlate with BMI or insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR). Together, our results demonstrate that TLR-3 is highly expressed in adipocytes and functionally active. However, TLR-3 appears to play a redundant role in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W1965601051,"Although treatment for epilepsy is available and effective for nearly 70 percent of patients, many remain in need of new therapeutic approaches. Predicting the impending seizures in these patients could significantly enhance their quality of life if the prediction performance is clinically practical. In this study, we investigate the improvement of the performance of a seizure prediction algorithm in 17 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy by means of a novel measure. Scale-free dynamics of the intracerebral EEG are quantified through robust estimates of the scaling exponents—the first cumulants—derived from a wavelet leader and bootstrap based multifractal analysis. The cumulants are investigated for the discriminability between preictal and interictal epochs. The performance of our recently published patient-specific seizure prediction algorithm is then out-of-sample tested on long-lasting data using combinations of cumulants and state similarity measures previously introduced. By using the first cumulant in combination with state similarity measures, up to 13 of 17 patients had seizures predicted above chance with clinically practical levels of sensitivity (80.5%) and specificity (25.1% of total time under warning) for prediction horizons above 25 min. These results indicate that the scale-free dynamics of the preictal state are different from those of the interictal state. Quantifiers of these dynamics may carry a predictive power that can be used to improve seizure prediction performance."
https://openalex.org/W2066785928,"On-off firing patterns, in which repetition of clusters of spikes are interspersed with epochs of subthreshold oscillations or quiescent states, have been observed in various nervous systems, but the dynamics of this event remain unclear. Here, we report that on-off firing patterns observed in three experimental models (rat sciatic nerve subject to chronic constrictive injury, rat CA1 pyramidal neuron, and rabbit blood pressure baroreceptor) appeared as an alternation between quiescent state and burst containing multiple period-1 spikes over time. Burst and quiescent state had various durations. The interspike interval (ISI) series of on-off firing pattern was suggested as stochastic using nonlinear prediction and autocorrelation function. The resting state was changed to a period-1 firing pattern via on-off firing pattern as the potassium concentration, static pressure, or depolarization current was changed. During the changing process, the burst duration of on-off firing pattern increased and the duration of the quiescent state decreased. Bistability of a limit cycle corresponding to period-1 firing and a focus corresponding to resting state was simulated near a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation point in the deterministic Morris—Lecar (ML) model. In the stochastic ML model, noise-induced transitions between the coexisting regimes formed an on-off firing pattern, which closely matched that observed in the experiment. In addition, noise-induced exponential change in the escape rate from the focus, and noise-induced coherence resonance were identified. The distinctions between the on-off firing pattern and stochastic firing patterns generated near three other types of bifurcations of equilibrium points, as well as other viewpoints on the dynamics of on-off firing pattern, are discussed. The results not only identify the on-off firing pattern as noise-induced stochastic firing pattern near a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation point, but also offer practical indicators to discriminate bifurcation types and neural excitability types."
https://openalex.org/W1973824285,"The discovery of an increasing number of new adipose-specific genes has significantly contributed to our understanding of adipose tissue biology and the etiology of obesity and its related diseases. In the present study, comparison of gene expression profiles among various tissues was performed by analysis of chicken microarray data, leading to identification of RBP7 as a novel adipose-specific gene in chicken. Adipose-specific expression of RBP7 in the avian species was further confirmed at the protein and mRNA levels. Examination of the transcription factor binding sites within the chicken RBP7 promoter by Matinspector software revealed potential binding sites for adipogenic transcription factors. This led to the hypothesis that the RBP7 promoter can be utilized to overexpress a transgene in adipose tissue in order to further investigate the function of a transgene in adipose tissue. Several lines of transgenic quail containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the RBP7 promoter were generated using lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. The GFP expression in transgenic quail was specific to adipose tissue and increased after adipocyte differentiation. This expression pattern was consistent with endogenous RBP7 expression, suggesting the RBP7 promoter is sufficient to overexpress a gene of interest in adipose tissue at later developmental stages. These findings will lead to the establishment of a novel RBP7 promoter cassette which can be utilized for overexpressing genes of interest in adipose tissue in vivo to study the function of genes in adipose tissue development and lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1998661425,"c-Src is upregulated in various human cancers, suggesting its role in malignant progression. However, the molecular circuits of c-Src oncogenic signaling remain elusive. Here we show that Fer tyrosine kinase oligomer mediates and amplifies Src-induced tumor progression. Previously, we showed that transformation of fibroblasts is promoted by the relocation of c-Src to non-raft membranes. In this study, we identified Fer and ezrin as non-raft c-Src targets. c-Src directly activated Fer by initiating its autophosphorylation, which was further amplified by Fer oligomerization. Fer interacted with active c-Src at focal adhesion membranes and activated Fer-phosphorylated ezrin to induce cell transformation. Fer was also crucial for cell transformation induced by v-Src or epidermal growth-factor receptor activation. Furthermore, Fer activation was required for tumorigenesis and invasiveness in some cancer cells in which c-Src is upregulated. We propose that the Src–Fer axis represents a new therapeutic target for treatment of a subset of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2028879725,"Hyperosmotic shock induces cytochrome c release and capase-3 activation in Xenopus oocytes, but the regulators and signaling pathways involved are not well characterized. Here we show that hyperosmotic shock induces rapid calpain activation and high levels of Smac/DIABLO release from the mitochondria before significant amounts of cytochrome c are released to promote caspase-3 activation. Calpain inhibitors or EGTA microinjection delays osmostress-induced apoptosis, and blockage of Smac/DIABLO with antibodies markedly reduces cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Hyperosmotic shock also activates the p38 and JNK signaling pathways very quickly. Simultaneous inhibition of both p38 and JNK pathways reduces osmostress-induced apoptosis, while sustained activation of these kinases accelerates the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. Therefore, at least four different pathways early induced by osmostress converge on the mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. Deciphering the mechanisms of hyperosmotic shock-induced apoptosis gives insight for potential treatments of human diseases that are caused by perturbations in fluid osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W2046886690,"Bacterial infections, even without any perinatal risk factors, are common in newborns, especially in preterm neonates. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible impairment of neutrophil chemotaxis in term and preterm neonates compared with adults as well as neonates with different modes of delivery and anaesthesia. We analysed the expression of the adhesion molecule L-Selectin as well as shape change, spontaneous and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced transmigration of neutrophils in a flow cytometric assay of chemotaxis after spontaneous delivery with Cesarian Section (CS) under spinal anaesthesia (mepivacaine, sufentanil), epidural anaesthesia (ropivacaine or bupivacaine, sufentanil) or general anaesthesia (ketamine, thiopental, succinylcholine). Chemokinesis was higher (p=0.008) in cord blood neutrophils than in the adult ones, whereas those could be more stimulated by fMLP (p=0.02). After vaginal delivery neutrophils showed a higher spontaneous and fMLP-stimulated chemotactic response compared to neonates after CS without labor. Comparing different types of anaesthesia for CS, spinal anaesthesia resulted in less impairment on chemotaxis than general anaesthesia or epidural anaesthesia. The new flow cytometric assay of neutrophil chemotaxis is an appropriate and objective method to analyse functional differences even in very small volumes of blood, essential in neonatology. Term neonates do not show reduced chemotaxis compared to adults. Preterm neonates present with reduced chemotaxis and chemokinesis, confirming the well known deficits in their neutrophil function. The side effects of maternal drugs on the neonatal immune system have to be considered especially when the immune response is already impaired, as in preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W2073554696,"The aim of the present study was to identify what influences the short half-life of the influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein and whether a prolonged half-life affects the properties of this molecule. We hypothesized that the short half-life of PB1-F2 could conceal the phenotype of the protein. Because proteasome degradation might be involved in PB1-F2 degradation, we focused on ubiquitination, a common label for proteasome targeting. A cluster of lysine residues was demonstrated as an ubiquitination acceptor site in evolutionary and functionally distinct proteins. The PB1-F2 sequence alignment revealed a cluster of lysines on the carboxy terminal end of PB1-F2 in almost all of the GenBank sequences available to date. Using a proximity ligation assay, we identified ubiquitination as a novel posttranslational modification of PB1-F2. Changing the lysines at positions 73, 78, and 85 to arginines suppressed the ubiquitination of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1)-derived PB1-F2. The mutation of the C-terminal lysine residue cluster positively affected the overall expression levels of avian A/Honk Kong/156/1997 (H5N1)- and mammalian A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1)-derived PB1-F2. Moreover, increased PB1-F2 copy numbers strengthened the functions of this virus in the infected cells. The results of a minigenome luciferase reporter assay revealed an enhancement of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in the presence of stabilized PB1-F2, regardless of viral origin. IFNβ antagonism was enhanced in 293T cells transfected with a plasmid expressing stabilized K→R mutant variants of PB1-F2. Compared with PB1-F2 wt, the loss of ubiquitination enhanced the antibody response after DNA vaccination. In summary, we revealed that PB1-F2 is an ubiquitinated IAV protein, and this posttranslational modification plays a central role in the regulation of the biological functions of this protein."

Complexes of two different gangliosides form new molecular shapes capable of enhancing recognition by anti-ganglioside antibodies. To test the hypothesis that the complex of GM1-like and GD1a-like LOSs of C. jejuni induces the development of anti-GM1b antibodies in Guillain-Barré syndrome patients. Methods Mass spectrometry analysis determined the LOS outer core structures, with which mice were immunized. IgG antibodies to single gangliosides and complex of gangliosides were tested in sera from Guillain-Barré syndrome patients from whom C. jejuni LOS had been isolated. Results Two isolates from GBS patients who had anti-GM1b antibodies, but neither anti-GM1 nor -GD1a antibodies, expressed both GM1-like and GD1a-like LOSs, but not GM1b-like LOS. Anti-GM1b antibodies were induced in one of the mice immunized with the C. jejuni bearing GM1-like and GD1a-like LOS. Sera from 20 patients had antibodies to the complex of GM1 and GD1a, all of which carried anti-GM1b reactivity. Five of these sera harbored neither anti-GM1 nor anti-GD1a antibodies. IgG antibodies to the complex were absorbed by GM1b, but by neither GM1 nor GD1a. Conclusions GM1-like and GD1a-like LOSs form a GM1b epitope, inducing the development of anti-GM1b antibodies in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome subsequent to C. jejuni enteritis. Here, we present a new paradigm that the complex of two different structures forms a new molecular mimicry, inducing the production of autoantibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2032952289,"The transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor α (ERα), the key driver of breast cancer proliferation, is enhanced by multiple cellular interactions, including phosphorylation-dependent interaction with Pin1, a proline isomerase, which mediates cis-trans isomerization of the N-terminal Ser(P)118-Pro119 in the intrinsically disordered AF1 (activation function 1) domain of ERα. Because both ERα and Pin1 have multiple cellular partners, it is unclear how Pin1 assists in the regulation of ERα transactivation mechanisms and whether the functional effects of Pin1 on ERα signaling are direct or indirect. Here, we tested the specific action of Pin1 on an essential step in ERα transactivation, binding to specific DNA sites. DNA binding analysis demonstrates that stable overexpression of Pin1 increases endogenous ERα DNA binding activity when activated by estrogen but not by tamoxifen or EGF. Increased DNA binding affinity is a direct effect of Pin1 on ERα because it is observed in solution-based assays with purified components. Further, our data indicate that isomerization is required for Pin1-modulation of ERα-DNA interactions. In an unbiased in vitro DNA binding microarray with hundreds of thousands of permutations of ERα-binding elements, Pin1 selectively enhances the binding affinity of ERα to consensus DNA elements. These studies reveal that Pin1 isomerization of phosphorylated ERα can directly regulate the function of the adjacent DNA binding domain, and this interaction is further modulated by ligand binding in the ligand-binding domain, providing evidence for Pin1-dependent allosteric regulation of ERα function. Background: Estrogen receptor α (ERα) activity in breast cancer cells is increased by Pin1, an isomerase that alters protein conformation. Results: Pin1-mediated isomerization increases ERα DNA binding affinity. Conclusion: Pin1 allosterically regulates ERα DNA binding directly via isomerization of phosphorylated receptor. Significance: Pin1 regulation of ERα provides a framework for understanding regulation by intrinsically disordered domains on transcription factor function."

Incapacity to work was reported by 27.1%. A total of 52.8% specified MS as the cause for altered working capability, whereas 20.5% cited reasons unrelated to the disorder. Even with minimal disability (EDSS < 3) a significant proportion of patients (24%) reported reduced working capability. Among the MS-specific restricting factors were fatigue (47.6%), sensorimotor deficits (31.1%), impaired vision (3.3%) and pain (2.8%).MS continues to takes its toll on the professional life of the patients early in the course. While complete incapacity becomes relevant with moderate to severe disability, many patients scale down to part-time even with minimal impairment."

Milk fat globule-EGF Factor VIII (MFG-E8), a secreted glycoprotein serves several cellular functions by binding to its receptor, αv β3-integrin. However, its role in regulating neural stem cells after stroke has not been determined yet. We therefore, aim to reveal whether MFG-E8 promotes neural stem cell proliferation and migration during stroke. Stroke was induced in wild-type (Wt) and MFG-E8-deficinet (Mfge8-/-) mice by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Commercially available recombinant mouse MFG-E8 (rmMFG-E8) was used for mechanistic assays in neural stem cell line, while the in house prepared recombinant human MFG-E8 (rhMFG-E8) was used for in vivo administration into rats with tMCAO. The in vitro effects of recombinant rmMFG-E8 for the neural stem cell proliferation and migration were determined by BrdU and transwell migration assay, respectively. The expression of cyclin D2, p53 and netrin-1, was analyzed by qPCR. We report that the treatment of rhMFG-E8 significantly improved the neurological deficit score, body weight lost and neural stem cell proliferation in a rat model of tMCAO. Conversely, decreased neural stem cell proliferation was observed in Mfge8-/- mice in comparison with the Wt counterparts underwent tMCAO. rmMFG-E8 stimulated the proliferation of mouse embryonic neural stem cells via upregulation of cyclin D2 and downregulation of p53, which is mediated by αv β3-integrin. rmMFG-E8 also promoted mouse embryonic neural stem cell migration via αv β3-integrin dependent manner in upregulating netrin-1. Our findings suggest MFG-E8 to promote neural stem cell proliferation and migration, which therefore establishes a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia."

In many situations, agents choose between discrete options. We analyze experimental data on binary opinion choices in humans. The data consists of two separate experiments in which humans answer questions with a binary response, where one is correct and the other is incorrect. The questions are answered without and with information on the answers of some previous participants. We find that a Bayesian approach captures the probability of choosing one of the answers. The influence of peers is uncorrelated with the difficulty of the question. The data is inconsistent with Weber's law, which states that the probability of choosing an option depends on the proportion of previous answers choosing that option and not on the total number of those answers. Last, the present Bayesian model fits reasonably well to the data as compared to some other previously proposed functions although the latter sometime perform slightly better than the Bayesian model. The asset of the present model is the simplicity and mechanistic explanation of the behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1992257823,"Inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is an effective therapeutic strategy against certain types of cancers such as melanoma and thyroid cancer. While demonstrated to be effective anticancer agents, B-Raf or MEK inhibitors have also been associated with early tumor progression and development of secondary neoplasms. The ligation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with its receptor, death receptor 5 (DR5), leading to induction of apoptosis, offers a promising anticancer strategy. Importantly, this is also a natural immunosurveillance mechanism against cancer development. We previously demonstrated that activated B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates DR5 expression. Hence, our current work sought to address whether B-Raf/MEK/ERK inhibition and the consequent suppression of DR5 expression impede cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis and activated immune cell-induced killing. We found that both B-Raf (for example, PLX4032) and MEK inhibitors (for example, AZD6244 and PD0325901) effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reduced DR5 levels in both human thyroid cancer and melanoma cells. Similar to the observed effect of genetic knockdown of the B-Raf gene, pre-treatment of cancer cell lines with either B-Raf or MEK inhibitors attenuated or abolished cellular apoptotic response induced by TRAIL or the DR5 agonistic antibody AMG655 or cell killing by activated T cells. Our findings clearly show that inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling suppresses DR5 expression and impairs DR5 activation-induced apoptosis and T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. These findings suggest a potential negative impact of B-Raf or MEK inhibition on TRAIL- or DR5-mediated anticancer therapy and on TRAIL/DR5-mediated immune-clearance of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002932103,"Plastic film mulching (PM) is widely utilized for maize production in China. However, the effect of PM on the grain yield of crops has not been established, and the biochemical mechanism underlying the increase or decrease in grain yield under PM is not yet understood. Grain filling markedly affects the grain yield. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of PM on maize grain filling under different irrigation levels and the relationship of such effects with hormonal changes. In the present study, PM was compared with traditional nonmulching management (TN) under 220 mm, 270 mm and 320 mm irrigation amount, and the grain filling characters of the grains located in various parts of the ear and the hormonal changes in the grains were measured. The results indicated that at 220 mm irrigation, PM significantly increased the grain filling rate of the middle and basal grains and decreased the grain filling rate of the upper grains. At 270 mm irrigation, the PM significantly increased the grain filling rate of the all grains. At 320 mm irrigation, the PM only significantly increased the grain filling rate of the upper grains. The IAA, Z+ZR and ABA content in the grains was positively correlated with the grain weight and grain-filling rates; however, the ETH evolution rate of the grains was negatively correlated with the grain weight and grain-filling rates. These results show that the effect of PM on maize grain filling is related to the irrigation amount and that the grain position on the ear and the grain filling of the upper grains was more sensitive to PM and irrigation than were the other grains. In addition, the PM and irrigation regulated the balance of hormones rather than the content of individual hormones to affect the maize grain filling."
https://openalex.org/W2089982532,"Purpose To determine whether the width of the retinal artery (RA) trajectory was associated with the presence of a macular hole (MH). Methods A retrospective cross sectional case-control study was performed. The fundus photographs were rotated 90 degrees, and the coordinates of the best fit curve of the RA trajectory were determined automatically based on these plots using the ImageJ program. The converted coordinates were fit to a second degree polynomial (ax2/100 + bx + c) equation. The width and steepness of the RA trajectory, “a”, of the eyes with a MH eye were compared to that of the fellow eyes. Results One hundred and ten eyes of 55 consecutive patients (30 women) with a unilateral MH and healthy fellow eyes were analyzed. The mean age was 64.9 years (range 47-81 years). The constant ‘a’ was significantly smaller in eyes with a MH than that of the fellow eyes (0.379 ± 0.094 vs 0.416 ± 0.121, P = 0.001, paired t test), indicating that the RA trajectory was wider in the MH eyes than in the fellow eyes. There was a significant correlation between the axial length and ‘a’ of the RA trajectory in the MH eyes (R = 0.273, P = 0.044) and in the fellow eyes (R = 0.356, P = 0.008; Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient). Conclusions Because eyes with a MH have a significantly wider and flatter RA trajectory, there may be greater traction on the fovea which is located between the RA arches. The causative role of this finding is still unclear."

Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at Stanford University Hospital in the Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Center for 12 months. Women age 21 to 43 undergoing IVF with highest FSH levels on baseline testing were included. Donor/Recipient and frozen embryo cycles were excluded from this study. Prognostic factors evaluated in association with clinical pregnancy rates were type of infertility diagnosis and IVF stimulation parameters. Results The current study found that factors associated with clinical pregnancy were: increased number of mature follicles on the day of triggering, number of oocytes retrieved, number of Metaphase II oocytes if intracytoplasmic sperm injection was done, and number of embryos developed 24 hours after retrieval. Conclusions Our findings suggest that it would be beneficial for women with increased FSH levels to attempt a cycle of IVF. Results of ovarian stimulation, especially embryo quantity appear to be the best predictors of IVF outcomes and those can only be obtained from a cycle of IVF. Therefore, increased basal FSH levels should not discourage women from attempting a cycle of IVF."

Most GPI-anchored proteins have been shown to be cleaved by GPI phospholipases. Recently, GPI-phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) was shown to be a strictly specific enzyme for GPI anchors. To investigate the involvement of GPI-PLD in the processes of neurodegeneration in prion diseases, we examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of GPI-PLD in the brains of a prion animal model (scrapie), and in both the brains and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of sporadic and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients. We found that compared with controls, the expression of GPI-PLD was dramatically down-regulated in the brains of scrapie-infected mice, especially in the caveolin-enriched membrane fractions. Interestingly, the observed decrease in GPI-PLD expression levels began at the same time that PrPSc began to accumulate in the infected brains and this decrease was also observed in both the brain and CSF of CJD patients; however, no differences in expression were observed in either the brains or CSF specimens from Alzheimer’s disease patients. Taken together, these results suggest that the down-regulation of GPI-PLD protein may be involved in prion propagation in the brains of prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2091101283,"Adaptation of saccade amplitude in response to intra-saccadic target displacement is a type of implicit motor learning which is required to compensate for physiological changes in saccade performance. Once established trials without intra-saccadic target displacement lead to de-adaptation or extinction, which has been attributed either to extra-retinal mechanisms of spatial constancy or to the influence of the stable visual surroundings. Therefore we investigated whether visual deprivation (“Ganzfeld”-stimulation or sleep) can partially maintain this motor learning compared to free viewing of the natural surroundings. Thirty-five healthy volunteers performed two adaptation blocks of 100 inward adaptation trials – interspersed by an extinction block – which were followed by a two-hour break with or without visual deprivation (VD). Using additional adaptation and extinction blocks short and long (4 weeks) term memory of this implicit motor learning were tested. In the short term, motor memory tested immediately after free viewing was superior to adaptation performance after VD. In the long run, however, effects were opposite: motor memory and relearning of adaptation was superior in the VD conditions. This could imply independent mechanisms that underlie the short-term ability of retrieving learned saccadic gain and its long term consolidation. We suggest that subjects mainly rely on visual cues (i.e., retinal error) in the free viewing condition which makes them prone to changes of the visual stimulus in the extinction block. This indicates the role of a stable visual array for resetting adapted saccade amplitudes. In contrast, visual deprivation (GS and sleep), might train subjects to rely on extra-retinal cues, e.g., efference copy or prediction to remap their internal representations of saccade targets, thus leading to better consolidation of saccadic adaptation."
