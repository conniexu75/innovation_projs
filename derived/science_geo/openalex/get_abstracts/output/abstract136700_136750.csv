Cholesterol ester formation also is hypothesized to be important in several physiologic processes, including intestinal cholesterol absorption, hepatic lipoprotein production, and macrophage foam cell formation in atherosclerotic lesions. Mouse tissue expression studies and the disruption of the mouse ACAT gene (Acact) have indicated that more than one ACAT exists in mammals and specifically that another enzyme is important in mouse liver and intestine. We now describe a second mammalian ACAT enzyme, designated ACAT-2, that is 44% identical to the first cloned mouse ACAT (henceforth designated ACAT-1). Infection of H5 insect cells with an ACAT-2 recombinant baculovirus resulted in expression of a ∼46-kDa protein in cell membranes that was associated with high levels of cholesterol esterification activity. Both ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 also catalyzed the esterification of the 3β-hydroxyl group of a variety of oxysterols. Cholesterol esterification activities for ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 exhibited different IC50 values when assayed in the presence of several ACAT-specific inhibitors, demonstrating that ACAT inhibitors can selectively target specific forms of ACAT. ACAT-2 was expressed primarily in mouse liver and small intestine, supporting the hypothesis that ACAT-2 contributes to cholesterol esterification in these tissues. The mouse ACAT-2 gene (Acact2) maps to chromosome 15 in a region containing a quantitative trait locus influencing plasma cholesterol levels. The identification and cloning of ACAT-2 will facilitate molecular approaches to understanding the role of ACAT enzymes in mammalian biology.

The ability to synthesize sterol esters is fundamental to most eukaryotic cells. Sterol esterification is thought to participate in the maintenance of cell membrane sterols at levels optimal for normal cell function. In mammalian cells, cholesterol is the predominant cellular sterol, and cholesterol esterification is catalyzed by the enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (E.C. 2.3.1.26, ACAT)1 (reviewed in Refs.1Goodman D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1965; 45: 747-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Oxygenated sterols (oxysterols) and their esters also are found in mammalian tissues (4Smith L.L. Johnson B.H. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 285-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although oxysterol esterification likely is catalyzed by ACAT (5Lichtenstein A.H. Brecher P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 751: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a systematic analysis of the enzyme (5Lichtenstein A.H. Brecher P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 751: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and substrates involved has not been done. ACAT activity has been implicated in a number of physiologic processes (1Goodman D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1965; 45: 747-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the small intestine, ACAT has been proposed to play a role in cholesterol absorption by maintaining a free cholesterol diffusion gradient across the enterocyte surface through the formation of cholesterol esters intracellularly (6Field F.J. Kam N.T.P. Mathur S.N. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Wilson M.D. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 943-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol ester formation by ACAT also has been hypothesized to be important for the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins in the intestine and the liver (reviewed in Ref. 8Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the adrenal glands and other steroidogenic tissues, ACAT synthesizes cholesterol esters that accumulate in cytosolic droplets where they can serve as cholesterol substrate stores for steroidogenesis. In macrophages, ACAT generates intracellular cholesterol esters that are stored as cytosolic lipid droplets, a characteristic feature of macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of ACAT's apparently prominent role in cholesterol metabolism, a number of ACAT inhibitors have been developed for use as anti-atherosclerosis agents (reviewed in Ref. 10Krause B.R. Bocan T.M.A. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Hollinger M.A. Inflammation, Mediators and Pathways. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 173-198Google Scholar). Some of these act by inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption (10Krause B.R. Bocan T.M.A. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Hollinger M.A. Inflammation, Mediators and Pathways. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 173-198Google Scholar) or hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and secretion (11Carr T.P. Hamilton Jr., R.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Huff M.W. Telford D.E. Barrett P.H.R. Billheimer J.T. Gillies P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1498-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and others, as specific inhibitors of macrophage foam cell formation (13Bocan T.M.A. Mueller S.B. Uhlendorf P.D. Newton R.S. Krause B.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1830-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that more than one ACAT exists in mammals. A human ACAT cDNA was first identified from a macrophage cDNA library by Chang and co-workers (14Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of the mouse homolog of this ACAT gene (Acact) yielded viable, ACAT-deficient (Acact−/−) mice that were characterized by tissue-specific reductions in cholesterol esters (15Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cholesterol ester stores were markedly reduced in adrenal cortices and cultured peritoneal macrophages; however, substantial levels of ACAT activity were present in Acact −/− livers, and intestinal cholesterol absorption was normal, indicating that another ACAT was active in these tissues (15Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Studies examining the tissue distribution of Acact mRNA expression also supported the hypothesis that more than one ACAT exists (16Meiner V. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Dong L.-M. Weisgraber K.H. Novak S. Myers H.M. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as did previous biochemical (17Kinnunen P.M. DeMichele A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7344-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and ACAT inhibitor (18Maduskuie Jr., T.P. Wilde R.G. Billheimer J.T. Cromley D.A. Germain S. Gillies P.J. Higley C.A. Johnson A.L. Pennev P. Shimshick E.J. Wexler R.R. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) studies showing differences between liver and aorta/macrophage ACAT activities. Taken together, these data led us to hypothesize that a second ACAT contributes to cholesterol esterification activity in the liver and small intestine. A precedent for eukaryotic organisms having more than one sterol esterification enzyme was established for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which have two genes encoding sterol esterification enzymes, ARE1and ARE2 (19Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Yu C. Kennedy N.J. Chang C.C.Y. Rothblatt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24157-24163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the reason for yeast having two genes is unclear, the disruption of both was necessary to render this organism deficient in sterol esterification (19Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24157-24163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification and cloning of a second mammalian ACAT, designated ACAT-2. We have expressed the ACAT-2 cDNA in insect cells and characterized its sterol esterification activity in detail. In addition, the ability to express ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 in the low-background insect cell system enabled us to compare the two enzymes with respect to substrate preferences and response to inhibitors. The characteristics of the mouse ACAT-2 gene product and its tissue distribution support the hypothesis that ACAT-2 may contribute to cholesterol esterification activity in the liver and intestine. An EST (accession number R10292) was identified by BLAST searches (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST/nph-newblast) of the human EST data base with sequences from ACAT-1. Degenerate primers derived from the EST sequences were subsequently used to amplify a partial ACAT-2 cDNA from mouse liver cDNA. Sequences for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ACAT-2 cDNA were determined by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends methodology using a mouse spleen Marathon ReadyTM cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). ACAT-2 sequences have been deposited in GenBank (accession number AF078751). Mouse ACAT-2 and human ACAT-1 baculovirus transfer vectors were constructed by inserting ACAT-2 coding sequences (amplified from mouse liver cDNA) or ACAT-1 coding sequences (amplified from HepG2 cell cDNA) downstream of the polyhedrin promoter of the pVL1392 vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Vectors were co-transfected with viral baculogold DNA into Sf9 insect cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol (PharMingen Kit), to generate recombinant baculoviruses. Viruses were plaque-purified and high titers of recombinant baculoviruses were generated by two rounds of amplification in Sf9 cells. Cells were cultured at 27 °C in Grace's medium (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For protein expression studies, H5 insect cells were cultured in optimized serum-free Express-Five medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 20 mml-glutamine. Cells were plated on day 0 at 8.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and infected on day 1 with high-titer baculovirus stocks at an optimal multiplicity of infection that was determined empirically. On day 3 (48 h after infection), cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1m sucrose, 0.05 m KCl, 0.04 mKH2PO4, 0.03 m EDTA (pH 7.2) and homogenized by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Cell homogenates were fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell membrane fraction (pellet) was resuspended in the isolation buffer, and aliquots were frozen (−80 °C) for activity assays. Protein concentrations were determined using a DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). For metabolic labeling, H5 insect cells were plated on day 0 at 2.9 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish and infected at day 1 with high-titer baculoviruses at empirically determined multiplicity of infectioins. On day 3 (48 h after infection), cells were washed and incubated in methionine-free and cysteine-free medium (SF900 II, Life Technologies) for 1 h. The medium was then replaced by 3 ml of methionine-free and cysteine-free medium containing 715 μCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pro-Mix, Amersham) and the cells were incubated for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected by low-speed centrifugation, resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4)), and sonicated. Cell lysate samples (100 μg of protein) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in 30% acetic acid, washed in 25% ethanol and 8% acetic acid, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. The rate of incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (Amersham) into cholesterol esters was assayed essentially as described by Erickson et al. (21Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 5 min with 100 μg of cell membrane protein and 25 μm oleoyl-CoA (specific activity = 18 μCi/μmol). Exogenous cholesterol (20 nmol) was added as phosphatidylcholine (PC):cholesterol (4:1 molar ratio) liposomes to measure apparent V max activities (22Smith J.L. Lear S.R. Erickson S.K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACAT activity was assayed essentially as described (22Smith J.L. Lear S.R. Erickson S.K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that unlabeled fatty acyl-CoAs and [14C]cholesterol (51.3 mCi/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) provided as cholesterol:egg PC liposomes (molar ratio = 0.2) were used. Parallel assays were performed with [14C]oleoyl-CoA (57 mCi/mmol, Amersham) and unlabeled cholesterol provided as PC liposomes (molar ratio = 0.2). The relative competition of fatty acyl-CoAs for cholesterol esterification was assessed using [14C]oleoyl-CoA diluted to ∼20,000 dpm/nmol with unlabeled fatty acyl-CoAs (∼1:6, mol:mol dilution) and unlabeled cholesterol:PC liposomes (molar ratio = 0.7). The abilities of [14C]oleoyl-CoA and [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (55.0 mCi/mmol, Amersham) to catalyze cholesterol esterification were assessed directly. Fatty acyl-CoAs, egg PC, and cholesterol were from Sigma. Briefly, membrane proteins (25 μg) were incubated in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 400 μg of bovine serum albumin and cholesterol:PC liposomes (final volume = 0.2 ml). The reaction was started by the addition of 5 nmol of fatty acyl-CoA and carried out for 2 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of CHCl3:methanol (2:1, v:v), and the products analyzed as described (21Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were in the linear range with respect to assay time and protein concentration. The ACAT assay described above was used, except that acceptors other than cholesterol were added to the incubations as acceptor:PC liposomes (molar ratio = ∼0.2) or, in the case of ethanol, added directly. The acceptors included ethanol, retinol, tocopherol, β-sitosterol, lanosterol, vitamins D1 and D2, diacylglycerol, and a number of oxysterols (25-hydroxy-, 27-hydroxy-, 7α-hydroxy-, 7β-hydroxy, 7-keto-, 24(S)-hydroxy-, 24(R)-hydroxy-, 24(S),25-epoxy-, and 24(R),25-epoxycholesterols). The sterols were assessed at three different concentrations (4, 8, and 16 μg) at a constant sterol:PC molar ratio (∼0.2). Acceptors were from Sigma or Steraloids (Wilton, NH). 24(S)-Hydroxy- and 24(R)-hydroxycholesterol (23Prasad V.V.K. Ponticorvo L. Lieberman S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 21: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Saucier S.E. Kandutsch A.A. Gayen A.K. Swahn D.K. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6863-6869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 24(S),25-epoxy-, and 24(R),25-epoxycholesterols were prepared as described (24Saucier S.E. Kandutsch A.A. Gayen A.K.

The reaction products were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography (21Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the plates exposed to x-ray film for 4 days to visualize the radioactive spots. Fatty acyl ester standards were used to identify the migration positions of the products. The spots were cut out and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (21Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Meyer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol esterification activity was assayed as described above (using [14C]oleoyl-CoA and cholesterol:PC liposomes (molar ratio = 0.2)) after a 5-min preincubation of the membranes at 37 °C with 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm para-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PHMB), or 0.1 mm progesterone. Inhibitors were purchased from Sigma. The specific ACAT inhibitors PD 132301–2 (N-[2,6-bis(1-methylethyl)-phenyl]-N′-[[1-[4-(dimethyl-amino)phenyl]cyclopentyl]methyl]urea, hydrochloride), CI-976 (2,2-dimethyl-N-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)dodecanamide), and CI-1011 ([(2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl)-acetyl]-sulfamic acid 2,6-diisopropyl-phenyl ester) were provided by Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals (Ann Arbor, MI). Stock solutions (20 mm) of the inhibitors were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C. Membrane proteins (100 μg for ACAT-1 and 50 μg for ACAT-2) were preincubated with cholesterol:PC liposomes and different inhibitors (final Me2SO concentration = 2.5%) for 30 min on ice. After equilibrating for 5 min at 37 °C, the reaction was started by adding [14C]oleoyl-CoA. Assays were performed otherwise essentially as described above. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was prepared from fresh mouse tissues, human hepatoma cells (HepG2), human small intestine, or human fibroblasts using Trizol (Life Technologies), and cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). For mouse ACAT-2, a 531-base pair fragment was amplified using sense (5′-ACTGTGCCTGGGATCTTTTGTGTC-3′) and antisense (5′-CTCGCGGGGTGGCCATGCTGGGAGTG-3′) primers. For human ACAT-2, a 742-base pair fragment was amplified using sense (5′-TCTTCTATCCCGTCATGCTG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGTCCACATCAGCACGTTCC-3′) primers. Amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (an internal control) was as described (27Farese Jr., R.V. Cases S. Ruland S.L. Kayden H.J. Wong J.S. Young S.G. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern blots, total RNA was extracted from tissues using Trizol (Life Technologies) and 10-μg aliquots were analyzed. Blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled 1.5-kb DNA fragment containing the mouse ACAT-2 coding sequences and re-probed with coding sequences for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard. Linkage analysis was performed using a panel of 67 progeny derived from a ((C57BL/6J × Mus spretus)F1 X C57BL/6J) interspecific backcross (28Warden C.H. Mehrabian M. He K.-Y. Yoon M.-Y. Diep A. Xia Y.-R. Wen P.-Z. Svenson K.L. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1993; 18: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This backcross panel has been typed for more than 400 loci distributed throughout the genome (29Welch C.L. Xia Y.-R. Shechter I. Farese R. Mehrabian M. Mehdizadeh S. Warden C.H. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1406-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, parental strain DNAs were screened for restriction fragment–length variants following digestion of genomic DNA with a panel of 10 restriction enzymes and hybridization with a fluorescein-labeled (Gene Images random prime labeling module, Amersham), 1.3-kb human Acact2 cDNA fragment. Filters were washed under conditions of high stringency (0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS, 60 °C, 20 min). Acact2hybridization products were detected by chemiluminescence (Gene Images CDP-Star detection module, Amersham). Linkage to previously typed chromosomal markers was detected using Map Manager v2.6.5, and loci were ordered by minimizing the number of recombination events betweenAcact2 and the markers (30Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The data have been deposited in the Mouse Genome Data base under accession number MGD-J:45730 (http://www.infomatics.jax.org). A human EST cDNA (accession R10292) that was highly similar to the C-terminal region of ACAT-1 was identified from BLAST data base searches. By using the EST sequence, a full-length cDNA containing the entire coding sequence was subsequently isolated from mouse liver and designated ACAT-2. The mouse ACAT-2 cDNA is predicted to encode a 525–amino acid protein that is 44% identical to mouse ACAT-1 (31Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26192-26201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The ACAT-2 protein has multiple hydrophobic domains, and its hydrophobicity plot is strikingly similar to that for ACAT-1 (Fig. 1 B). The analysis of mouse ACAT-2 sequences with a transmembrane prediction program (http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/TMPRED_form.html) indicated that ACAT-2 may have eight transmembrane-spanning regions (amino acid residues 125–143, 154–181, 192–220, 265–285, 304–326, 351–369, 439–459, and 475–496). Using the same program, mouse ACAT-1 was predicted to have seven or eight transmembrane regions. The alignment of the mouse ACAT-2 protein sequence with those of other ACAT gene family members (Fig. 2) reveals many conserved residues, especially in the C termini of these proteins. Each family member has a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site and a conserved serine residue (amino acid 248 of ACAT-2) that has been implicated in the catalytic activity of hamster ACAT-1 (32Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Figure 2Alignment of predicted protein sequences of ACAT gene family members. Sequences for yeast ARE1(accession number P25628) and ARE2 (accession numberU51790), human ACAT-1 (hACAT) (accession number P35610), mouse ACAT-1 (mACAT) (accession number I49454), mouse ACAT-2 (mACAT-2), and a putative sterol O-acyltransferase from Caenorhabditis elegans (accession number Z68131) are shown. Residues in which four or more of the six family members are identical areboxed. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites and tyrosine phosphorylation sites are shaded. The serine residue identified in the hamster homolog that is required for ACAT catalytic activity (32Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Insect cells were chosen for these expression studies because they have very low levels of cellular cholesterol and lack significant cholesterol esterification activity (33Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of cellular proteins in insect cells 48 h after infection demonstrated the expression of a ∼46-kDa protein (Fig. 3 A). The apparent molecular mass of ACAT-2 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was smaller than that predicted from the amino acid sequence (60.7 kDa), a finding similar to that reported for ACAT-1 (14Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ACAT-1, it has been suggested that the apparent size of the protein is less than predicted due to high amounts of SDS binding (33Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cell membrane preparations from insect cells infected with the ACAT-2 baculovirus were characterized by high levels of cholesterol esterification activity (Fig. 3 B). The amount of ACAT activity present in ACAT-2-infected cells was consistently 10-fold higher than that in cells infected with virus containing ACAT-1. However, metabolic labeling studies (Fig. 3 A) indicated that considerably more ACAT-2 protein may have been expressed than ACAT-1. Membrane cholesterol esterification activity was dependent upon the amount of ACAT-2 protein expressed, as demonstrated by a time course of ACAT-2 virus infection (Fig. 4).Figure 4Dependence of cholesterol esterification activity on ACAT-2 protein expression. A, metabolic labeling of cellular proteins demonstrating the time course of ACAT-2 expression after infection. H5 insect cells were infected with baculovirus containing wild-type sequences or the mouse ACAT-2 cDNA, and cells were incubated with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 2 h at the indicated time points following infection. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Infection with wild-type baculovirus was confirmed by the presence of the polyhedrin protein on Coomassie Blue–stained gels (not shown). B, cholesterol esterification activity in H5 insect cell membranes following infection with ACAT-2 baculovirus. Duplicate dishes for the experiments described in A were used to prepare membranes for assays of ACAT activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are duplicate values for one experiment; the experiment was repeated with the same result.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability to express ACAT-1 or ACAT-2 independently in insect cells enabled us to examine several biochemical properties of the enzymes. The esterification of cholesterol by both ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 was dependent on the presence of a fatty acyl-CoA substrate; in its absence, cholesterol esterification activity greater than background was not observed (data not shown). Of the fatty acyl-CoAs tested, ACAT-1 showed a slight preference for oleoyl, while that for ACAT-2 was palmitoyl ≥ linoleoyl > oleoyl > arachidonyl (Table I). The ability of unlabeled fatty acyl-CoAs to compete with [14C]oleoyl-CoA for incorporation into cholesterol esters by ACAT-1 or ACAT-2 was also examined. For ACAT-1, palmitoyl, linoleoyl, and to a lesser extent, arachidonyl, competed with oleoyl for incorporation into cholesterol esters (Table II). For ACAT-2, both linoleoyl and palmitoyl competed with oleoyl for incorporation into cholesterol esters, but arachidonyl did not. When cholesterol esterification was measured using [14C]oleoyl-CoA or [14C]palmitoyl-CoA directly, ACAT-1 had 58% higher activity with oleoyl-CoA compared with palmitoyl-CoA, while ACAT-2 showed a negligible difference (16%) (Table III).Table IFatty acyl CoA specificity for cholesterol esterification by ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 expressed in H5 cells: Esterification of [C]cholesterol using different fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates.ExperimentRelative activities (units)Oleoyl-CoAArachi"
https://openalex.org/W2068345120,"The enzyme acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) mediates sterol esterification, a crucial component of intracellular lipid homeostasis. Two enzymes catalyze this activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and several lines of evidence suggest multigene families may also exist in mammals. Using the human ACAT1 sequence to screen data bases of expressed sequence tags, we identified two novel and distinct partial human cDNAs. Full-length cDNA clones for these ACAT related gene products (ARGP) 1 and 2 were isolated from a hepatocyte (HepG2) cDNA library. ARGP1 was expressed in numerous human adult tissues and tissue culture cell lines, whereas expression of ARGP2 was more restricted. In vitro microsomal assays in a yeast strain deleted for both esterification genes and completely deficient in sterol esterification indicated that ARGP2 esterified cholesterol while ARGP1 did not. In contrast to ACAT1 and similar to liver esterification, the activity of ARGP2 was relatively resistant to a histidine active site modifier. ARGP2 is therefore a tissue-specific sterol esterification enzyme which we thus designated ACAT2. We speculate that ARGP1 participates in the coenzyme A-dependent acylation of substrate(s) other than cholesterol. Consistent with this hypothesis, ARGP1, unlike any other member of this multigene family, possesses a predicted diacylglycerol binding motif suggesting that it may perform the last acylation in triglyceride biosynthesis.

The intracellular formation of sterol esters from fatty acid and sterol is mediated by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT).1 The pathological accumulation of cholesterol esters in atherosclerotic lesions has lead to intense pursuit of ACAT inhibitors as pharmacological agents. Microsomal ACAT preparations from various tissues display differential sensitivities to some of these agents (1Maduskie T. Billheimer J. Germain S. Gillies P. Higley C. Johnson A. Pennev P.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7344-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This suggests that more than one protein mediates the esterification reaction, such as occurs in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 3Sturley S.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) has two ACAT related enzymes, Are1 and Are2, which are derived from separate genes and have been shown to independently esterify sterols (4Yang H.

In terms of contribution to the sterol ester mass of the cell, Are1 is the minor isoform relative to Are2. These genes were identified based on sequence conservation to a human gene, ACAT1, which encodes an ACAT enzyme with homologs in many mammalian species (6Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Uelman P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol.

The human ACAT1 gene encodes a 550-amino acid polypeptide and is expressed in most tissues, predominantly placenta, lung, kidney, and pancreas (6Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACAT1 has been predicted to have two transmembrane domains (6Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been immunolocalized to the endoplasmic reticulum (8Chang C.C. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A.

When murine ACAT1 was disrupted in induced mutant mice, homozygotes for the deletion were found to essentially lack ACAT activity in embryonic fibroblasts and have negligible amounts of cholesterol ester in the adrenal cortex and peritoneal macrophages (10Meiner V.M. Cases S. Myers H. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, cholesterol ester accumulation was normal in hepatocytes while dietary cholesterol absorption, an indirect marker for intestinal cholesterol esterification, was indistinguishable from control littermates. This is consistent with the concept of a multigene family for this activity. ACAT isoenzymes may be required to perform the variety of physiological roles mediated by cholesterol esterification. Increases in cellular free cholesterol above certain levels are cytotoxic and are ameliorated by cholesterol ester formation (11Warner G.J. Stoudt G. Bamberger M. Johnson W.J. Rothblatt G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5772-5778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, the bulk of cholesterol secreted in very low density lipoprotein is esterified intracellularly and determines apolipoprotein B secretion rates (12Carr T.P. Parks J.S. Rudel L.L.

Cholesterol esterification in the enterocyte may be necessary for cholesterol absorption from the lumen and secretion in chylomicrons into the lymph (15Field F.J. Kam N.T. Mathur S.N. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The formation of cholesterol ester stores could also provide a readily available substrate for steroid hormone synthesis in steroidogenic tissues (16Veldhuis J.D. Strauss J.F. d. Silavin S.L. Kolp L.A. Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Civen M. Leeb J. Morin R.J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1982; 16: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is likely that different ACAT isozymes mediate each of these processes, and the data presented here support that hypothesis. We reasoned that additional human ACAT proteins would have sequence similarity to regions conserved between human ACAT1 and yeast Are1 and Are2. (4Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Accordingly, an ACAT consensus sequence was used to screen the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST). Several cDNA entries were identified which were transcribed from two independent human genes. This study is a description of the isolation of full-length cDNA clones for twoACAT-related geneproducts (ARGP1 and ARGP2), examination of their pattern of tissue expression, and assays of enzymatic activity. We show that ARGP2 can catalyze the formation of sterol ester from cholesterol and oleoyl-CoA, leading us to rename this gene, ACAT2. By contrast, ARGP1 did not detectably esterify cholesterol and we propose that it performs acyl-CoA-dependent acylation of other molecules, such as diacylglycerol.

Three clones, H24971, R07932, and R99213, derived from a common gene (named ACAT related gene product 1, ARGP1), were identified (p< 10−4). The entire human ACAT1 protein was then used in an identical search. In addition to clones of ACAT1 and ARGP1, two entries, R10272 and W76421, with significant similarity were identified (p < 10−5). They were derived from a gene we named ARGP2. Rescreening the dbEST with these clones identified two more ARGP2 entries. Escherichia coli clones with the largest inserts corresponding to these sequences were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium and resequenced with T3, T7, or gene specific primers. Oligo(dT) primed, double stranded cDNA was reverse transcribed from human, ileal, poly(A)+ mRNA, kindly provided by Dr. Paul Dawson, and ligated to adapters using a commercially available kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Touchdown PCR (26Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar) was performed for 35 cycles with a forward primer complementary to the adapter (AP1, 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) and a reverse primer (End4A, 5′-CCACCTGGAGCTGGGTGAAGAAC) complementary to the ARGP1 dbEST cloneZ43867. The PCR mixture included 200 nm each oligo, 200 μm dNTPs, 1.75 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq, and the cDNA diluted 1:500. The 700-bp reaction product was gel isolated, ligated into YEp352 with a T overhang generated by Taq polymerase, and sequenced. A human, fetal (20 weeks post-conception) liver/spleen, oligo(dT)-primed, cDNA library in the vector pT7T3D was kindly provided by Dr. Bento Soares. PCR was performed with the cDNA, a forward primer (M13 reverse, 5′-TGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG) complementary to the vector and a reverse primer (203, 5′-CCCCATGCTGAGGTCTGTGATCAG), complementary to the ARGP2 dbEST cloneR10272, using the above conditions. The 800-bp reaction product was gel isolated, ligated into pBS:SK (Stratagene) with a T overhang generated by Taq polymerase, and sequenced. A yeast expression library of HepG2 cDNA (size selected for inserts greater than 2.0 kb in pAB23BXN, commercially available from Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA), was propagated in the E. colistrain MC1061 and plated onto 135-mm LB + ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plates at an approximate density of 5000 colonies per plate. Membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham) replicas of the plates were probed by hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled probe specific for ARGP1 (synthesized using a 420-bp NotI, PstI digestion product of the 5′ RACE product) or ARGP2 (synthesized using the 5′ RACE product) in 5 × SSC, 0.05% SDS, 0.1%N-laurolysarcosine, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 2% (w/v) blocking reagent (Boerhinger Mannheim) at 65 °C for 14–18 h. The membranes were washed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 80 min, incubated with an anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:10,000), washed in Tris-buffered saline, incubated with the peroxidase substrate CSPD (Boerhinger Mannheim), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). For ARGP1, 4 single positive clones were isolated after screening ∼20,000 clones. For ARGP2, 4 single positive clones were isolated after screening ∼30,000 clones. The longest clones for each were sequenced multiple times on both strands using vector and gene-specific oligonucleotides. Cultured human Caco2, HeLa, HepG2, and THP1 cell lines were donated by Dr. R. J. Deckelbaum and originally obtained from the ATCC. HepG2, HeLa, and Caco2 cells were maintained as cell monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) in 5% CO2. THP1 monocyte cells were maintained in suspension in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2. Differentiation of THP1 cells was stimulated with 150 ng/ml tetramyristate phorbol ester and 140 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. Whole cell RNA was isolated from confluent monolayer cultures or pelleted THP1 cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) extraction. The Caco2 cells had been confluent for approximately 21 days. Commercially obtained multi-tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) contained 2 μg of poly(A)+RNA from human adult or fetal (18–24 weeks postconception) tissues originally resolved on a 1.2% agarose, formaldehyde gel. The adult tissue membrane was hybridized with a random-hexamer primed, [32P]dCTP-labeled probe, generated using the insert of the ARGP1 dbEST clone R99213, in ExpressHyb buffer (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 68 °C. The membrane was washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 50 °C. After stripping the membrane was probed with ARGP2 (dbEST clone 10272 insert and the ARGP2 5′ RACE product) using the conditions above. The fetal tissue Northern blot was hybridized with the same ARGP2 probe. Human cDNA obtained as part of a Quick Screen cDNA Panel of Human tissues (CLONTECH) or reverse transcribed (Life Technologies, Inc. kit) from human ileal poly(A)+ mRNA was used as the template in a PCR reaction with primers specific for ARGP1 (106, GGCATCCTGAACTGGTGTGTGGTG; 110, AGCTGGCATCAGACTGTGTCTGG), ARGP2 (202, GAGTTCCCCCACATTCATCAAATCC; 206, CATGCTGCTGCTCATCTTCTTTGCA), or β-actin (Act1, GAGCTGCCTGACGGCCAGGTC; Act2, CACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGACAG). The PCR mixture included 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 400 nm of each primer, and 2 units of Taq (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following 35 cycles (94 °C, 45 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 2 min), the products were resolved on a 1% agarose, 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide gel. For RNA prepared from human cultured cells, first strand cDNA synthesis was performed, with and without reverse transcriptase (SuperscriptII, Life Technologies, Inc.) using 4 μg of whole cell RNA. A fraction of each reaction (10%) was the template in a PCR reaction (30 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 2 min) with primers specific for ARGP1 (103, GCTTCATGGAGTTCTGGATGGTGG; 106, GGCATCCTGAACTGGTGTGTGGTG), ARGP2 (201, GACACCTCGATCTTGGTCCTGCC; 202, as above) or human ACAT1 (ACATa, CGGAATATCAAACAGGAGCCCTTC; ACATb, CATTCCAAAGAACATGAAGATGCACG). The cDNA inserts of the longest ARGP1 and ARGP2 HepG2 library clones were removed by NotI, EcoRI digestion and ligated into the yeast expression vector pRS426GP which utilizes the galactose inducible GAL1/GAL10 promoter. A cDNA corresponding to the coding region of human ACAT1 flanked by 5 bp of 5′-untranslated region and 1 bp of 3′-untranslated region, in pRS426GP was described previously (27Yang H. Cromley D.

Culturing of the transformed yeast, induction of expression, microsome isolation, and sterol esterification assays were as described previously (27Yang H. Cromley D. Wang H. Billheimer J.T.

In those experiments involving diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) to modify histidine residues, a preincubation with 100 μm DEPC was performed as described (2Kinnunen P.M. DeMichele A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7344-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A comparison of the human ACAT1 protein and the two yeast ACAT orthologs (Are1, Are2) identified a highly conserved (70% identical) region of 30 amino acids (ACAT1 amino acids 391–420) near the carboxyl terminus. This peptide was used to screen the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST). The search identified several human cDNAs, the longest being 890 bp (GenBank accession number H45923), derived from a common gene we call the ARGP1. To date, 26 clones for human ARGP1 are present in the dbEST from fetal liver/spleen, infant brain, breast, cerebellum, hippocampus, kidney, placenta, testis, ovary tumor, colon tumor, and lung tumor libraries, suggesting ubiquitous and abundant expression. In addition, ARGP1 is also represented as several murine entries (e.g. GenBank accession number C75990). The dbEST was then searched using the entire ACAT1 protein sequence. Four human cDNAs, distinct from ARGP1 cDNA clones, were identified in fetal liver/spleen and fetal heart libraries and are derived from a common gene we call ARGP2. The longest entry was 600 bp (GenBank accession number R10272). To date these are the only dbEST entries for human ARGP2, although several murine entries have been identified (e.g. GenBank accession number AA410072). Northern blot analysis of human tissues (Figs. 3 and 4) showed that the initial dbEST clones for ARGP1 and ARGP2 were truncated, relative to the observed transcripts, by approximately 1000 and 1400 bp, respectively. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, 5′ RACE was performed using cDNA synthesized from human liver (ARGP1) or ileal (ARGP2) mRNA but yielded only 600 nucleotides of novel sequence for each. The respective 5′ RACE products were then used as probes to screen a size selected (>2.0 kb), HepG2 cDNA library by hybridization. The longest ARGP1 clone contained 1976 nucleotides and a 130-base poly(A)+ tract which agreed with the length of the minimal ARGP1 transcript detected by Northern blot (Fig. 3). HepG2 cells express only the 2.0-kb ARGP1 transcript. 2T. Seo, P. Oelkers, M. Giattina, R. J. Deckelbaum, and S. L. Sturley, manuscript in preparation. A similar approach identified ARGP2 clones, the longest of which contained 2040 bp of sequence with a 50-base poly(A)+ tract in accordance with the observed length of the ARGP2 transcript (Fig. 4).Figure 4Northern blot analysis of ARGP2 expression in human fetal tissues. 2 μg of mRNA from human fetal tissues (CLONTECH Fetal MTN II) was resolved on a denaturing, 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a [32P]dCTP, random-hexamer labeled, human ARGP2 probe in Express Hyb solution for 1 h at 65 °C. After washing in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 40 min, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film.

The predicted initiator methionine lies within a consensus for initiation of translation (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar) and downstream of an in-frame termination codon. Comparison to ACAT1 revealed 22% amino acid sequence identity (29% similarity) over the entire molecule. The conservation of these molecules is greatest toward the COOH terminus, such that ACAT1 and ARGP1 are 28% identical over the last 250 residues. This pattern of sequence similarity is strikingly similar to that observed from comparison of ACAT1 with the yeast Are1 and Are2 proteins. ARGP1 is predicted to be a membrane bound protein with nine putative transmembrane domains and one N-linked glycosylation site. Uniquely, ARGP1 contains a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester binding signature sequence (H.[FWY]..[KR].F..P) at amino acids 382–392 which was originally identified by comparison of protein kinase C isoforms and diacylglycerol kinases (Fig. 7) (36Billheimer J.T.

The predicted initiator methionine lies within a consensus for initiation of translation (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Over the entire molecule, the predicted protein is 47% identical (54% similar) to human ACAT1. This conservation is even more pronounced at the COOH-terminal end of the molecules, raising to 63% identity over the last 250 residues. ARGP2 is predicted to be a membrane bound protein with seven putative transmembrane domains and two N-linked glycosylation sites. ARGP2 is similar to ACAT1 in that it contains a leucine zipper (338–359) which may mediate multimerization or interaction with other proteins. ARGP2 does not possess a predicted diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding site. A sequenced tag entry (number WI-11660) for ARGP2 localizes to human chromosome 12, further distinguishing it from ACAT1, which is located on chromosome 1 (30Chang C.C. Noll W.W. Nutile-McMenemy N.

Expression of a second ACAT would be expected in tissues (e.g. liver and intestine) which exhibit normal ACAT activity in the induced mutant ACAT1 (acact−) mice (10Meiner V.M. Cases S. Myers H. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Expression of ARGP1 and ARGP2 was thus examined by Northern blot of human RNA (Figs. 3 and 4). Hybridization of an ARGP1 cDNA probe to a panel of adult tissue mRNAs detected a transcript in all tissues examined (Fig. 3). However, ARGP1 expression levels varied qualitatively among tissues with moderate expression in thyroid, stomach, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver and high expression in adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, testes, and small intestine. The presence of a 2.0-kb transcript was invariable among the tissues while a 2.4-kb transcript was observed in about half the tissues, most notably the tissues with high expression. The origin of these two transcripts has not been identified, however, their heterogeneity is unlikely to lie at the 3′ end of the message since all dbEST entries for ARGP1 cDNAs terminate at a similar position. Hybridization of the same membrane, under identical conditions, with an ARGP2 cDNA probe failed to detect a transcript in any tissue (data not shown). Since the four ARGP2 dbEST clones were in human fetal libraries, ARGP2 expression was examined in human fetal tissues by Northern blot (Fig. 4). A 2.2-kb transcript was detected in fetal liver but not in fetal brain, lung, or kidney. To further examine the expression of ACAT2 in adults, a RT-PCR was performed using cDNA generated from a variety of tissues (Fig. 5). As shown, ARGP2 is expressed in human adult heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and ileum. The identity of the PCR product was verified by Southern blotting and hybridization with an ARGP2-specific cDNA probe (data not shown). An RT-PCR analysis of ARGP1 on these same samples gave a similar pattern of expression to that determined by the Northern blot in Fig. 3. ARGP1 and ARGP2 expression in human tissue culture cell lines was also examined by RT-PCR (Fig. 6). ARGP1 was expressed in cell culture models for human endothelial (HeLa), hepatocyte (HepG2), monocyte (undifferentiated THP1), macrophage (differentiated THP1), and intestinal epithelial (Caco2) cells. Expression of ARGP2 was limited to HepG2 and Caco2 cells. This reinforces the concept that ARGP1 is widely expressed while the expression of ARGP2 is more restricted. ACAT1 was expressed in all of these cell lines confirming previous observations (7Uelman P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol.

Four different cDNAs encoding the GCC box-specific binding factors (EREBPs) have been isolated from tobacco (4Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of EREBPs neither show homology to known DNA-binding proteins and transcription factors nor do they contain basic leucine zipper or zinc finger motifs, suggesting that EREBPs are a group of novel DNA-binding proteins. EREBPs contain highly conserved 58–59 sequences of residues (designated as ERF domains in this paper, see Fig. 1) within which GCC box-specific binding activity was identified (4Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that ERF domains exist in numerous products of regulatory genes and cDNAs of unknown function from various plants (7Zhou J. Tang X. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3217-3218Google Scholar, 8Okamuro J.K. Caster B. Villarroel R. Van Montagu M. Jofuku K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whereas ERF domains are highly conserved, EREBPs exhibit some divergence. The ERF domain also has been argued to be closely related to the AP2 domain of Arabidopsis (8Okamuro J.K. Caster B. Villarroel R. Van Montagu M. Jofuku K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, it has been suggested that these transcription factors belong to two subdivisions (7Zhou J. Tang X. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3217-3218Google Scholar, 9Weigel D.

Moreover, AP2 contains two DNA-binding domains whereas EREBPs have only one (9Weigel D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Among the proteins containing the ERF domain, EREBPs (4Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), AtEBP (11Büttner M. Singh K.B. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3217-3218Google Scholar), and AtERFs (Arabidopsis ethylene-responsive transcription factor) 2M. Ohta, M. Ohme-Takagi, and H. Shinshi, unpublished data. have been shown to have GCC box-specific binding activity. However, their DNA recognition mechanism and biological function are not yet understood. It is also unclear whether each ERF domain exhibits the same binding specificity with the GCC box. Attempts in this report were made to establish the GCC box-binding specificity of ERF domain by single-base substitution of the GCC box and quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The GCC box binding affinities of three ERF domain-containing fragments, from tobacco (EREBP2 and EREBP4) and Arabidopsis (AtERF1), were examined, and the stoichiometry of their DNA interactions were established. Truncation analyses of the ERF domain fragment have revealed a minimal region for stable GCC box binding, and systematic mutation and truncation assays identified crucial bases within the GCC box responsible for specific protein-DNA interaction. The coding region of ERF domain fragments from EREBP2 (aa 88–164), EREBP4 (aa 122–222), and AtERF1 (aa 138–213), designated as EBP2-F, EBP4-F, and AtERF1-F, respectively, in this paper, were prepared by PCR, cloned into pET3C plasmid (Novagen), and expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells. After freeze-thaw and subsequent gentle sonication, the cell lysate was clarified and applied to heparin columns (Pros HE, PerSeptive Biosystems). Fractions containing ERF domain fragments were filtrated through Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and further purified by cation exchange chromatography (Resource S, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified ERF domain fragments were concentrated and dialyzed against water. For preparation of the fusion proteins with maltose-binding protein, the coding region of EBP4-F or tobacco TGA1a (12Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) were cloned into pMAL-2 plasmid (New England Biolabs Inc.), expressed in BL21 E. coli cells, and purified using amylose columns according to manufacturer instructions. Protein concentrations were measured using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and further confirmed by the methods of Gill and von Hippel (13Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5083) Google Scholar). A 16-bp GCC box fragment (5′-CATAAGAGCCGCCACT-3′) of the 5′ upstream region of the tobacco Gln2 gene was prepared by synthesizing both strands (2Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). After purification, the fragments were suspended in 1 × STE buffer, and the complementary strands were annealed. The resulting double strand oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo) and purified through a Sephadex G-50 column before binding experiments. Mutant and truncated sequences (see Table I) were made in the same way.Table ITruncational and mutational binding assays for GCC boxnameGCC box segquencesKdWt16CATAAGAGCCGCCACT70 ± 58 pmMmgtattcAGCCGCCtga52 ± 17 pmMdCATAAGAtCCtCCACT>1.0 μmT14TAAGAGCCGCCACT44 ± 17 pmT12AGAGCCGCCACT81 ± 20 pmT12aGAGCCGCCACTG71 ± 30 pmT12bAGCCGCCACTGA>1.0 μmT12cAAGAGCCGCCAC>1.0 μmT12dTAAGAGCCGCCA>1.0 μmT11GAGCCGCCACT73 ± 28 pmA 16-mer wild type GCC box sequence (Wt16) contains a core region of -AGCCGCC- (highlighted and underlined).

Open table in a new tab A 16-mer wild type GCC box sequence (Wt16) contains a core region of -AGCCGCC- (highlighted and underlined). Quantitative EMSA was performed by using Wt16 or different mutants (M) and truncates (T) and EBP2-F at various concentrations. The numbers after T indicate the length of the oligos. The data for K d values are represented as the mean of three replicates ± S.D. K d values for nonspecific binding is about 0.1–1.0 μm or higher. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) of ERF domain-DNA binding were measured by quantitative EMSA. Labeled DNA (at a concentration of 10–100-fold lower than the K d) was mixed with a gradient concentration of ERF domain fragments in 10 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer at pH 7.5, containing 40 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were run on an 8% nondenaturing PAGE, and the resulting gel was dried and visualized on a FUJIX BAS-2000 system (Fuji). Complexed and free DNA bands were scanned, their photodensity was measured, and K d was determined from binding titration analysis. The binding free energy change (ΔΔG) was calculated as: ΔΔG = RT ln [K d(mutant)/K d (wild-type)], where R is the gas constant and T is absolute temperature. Positive ΔΔG represents a decreased binding affinity, negative ΔΔG corresponds to an increased binding affinity, and zero ΔΔG means no effect on binding. A 10-fold decrease in binding affinity increases ΔΔG by about 1.3 kcal/mol. For protein cross-linking experiments, the purified proteins were incubated with glutaraldehyde in total volume of 4 μl in DNA-binding buffer (see above). After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cross-linked products were separated by standard Tris-glycine, pH 8.3, discontinuous SDS-PAGE, or for smaller polypeptide, in the Tris-Tricine system (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar). Derivatives of a fragment of EREBP2 (EBP2-F), containing an ERF domain and 10-aa N-terminal and 8-aa C-terminal flanking regions, were used to identify the minimal sequence for GCC box binding. The different truncates of this fragment were subjected to EMSA for examination of the binding activity to the 16-bp GCC box sequence (Wt16, see Table I). Fig. 2 shows that EBP2-F exhibits a high binding activity to the GCC box. Deletion of 10 aa from the N terminus (Ec, aa 98–164) or both N- and C-terminal flanking regions (Enc, aa 98–156) leads to either a dramatic decrease or complete abolition of binding activity with the GCC box. Elimination of the C-terminal flanking region (En, aa 88–156) causes only a negligible decrease in binding affinity in comparison with EBP2-F. This indicates that the short stretch of N-terminal flanking region is necessary for binding of the ERF domains to the GCC box. To measure the equilibrium binding of the EREBPs, labeled wild type 16-bp GCC box sequence was subjected to EMSA for interaction with EBP2-F, EBP4-F, or AtERF1-F. Upon titration analysis, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) was determined under the given binding condition. All three fragments exhibit a high binding affinity with K d in a range from about 1 to 120 pm. The highest binding was found with EBP4-F (K d = 5.4 ± 4.3 pm) and the lowest was with AtERF1-F (K d = 167 ± 40 pm), whereas the K d for EBP2-F was intermediate at about 70 ± 58 pm. A similarK d was also observed for the binding between full-length EREBP2 and the GCC box. The high binding activity observed above led to consideration of whether a dimer or even oligomers of ERF domain fragments form in free solution or under DNA-binding condition. The possibility of dimerization of ERF domain was investigated by EMSA using two ERF domain fragments of different sizes. A maltose-binding protein fused to EBP4-F (Mal-EBP4-F, 53 kDa) was mixed with EBP4-F (11 kDa) in varying concentration before binding to the GCC box. The results shown in Fig. 3 illustrate that a mixture of these two molecules (lanes 8–10) at equivalent concentrations shift the DNA into two bands corresponding to the individual proteins (lanes 2–7), and no extra band was observed. When the Mal-EBP4-F concentration is kept constant at 1.0 nm while varying EBP4-F from 10 pm to 0.1 μm(lane 11–13), the DNA shifts reflect an intercompetitive behavior of the proteins. These results indicate the absence of an hetero-complex under the given binding condition. To further examine the possibility of an intrinsic homo-dimer present in binding buffer or DNA-induced dimerization, EBP2-F with or without interaction of the GCC box was cross-linked with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde and then subjected to standard SDS-PAGE. In a control experiment (Fig. 4 A), the bZip protein of tobacco TGA1a, known to be a dimer in solution (12Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), was examined to confirm that glutaraldehyde cross-linking can be used to detect oligomerization. Using DNA-binding conditions in the presence or absence of the GCC box, no bands corresponding to higher forms of EBP2-F (8.3 kDa) were observed regardless of the concentration of glutaraldehyde or the presence of GCC box sequence (Fig. 4, B and C). This suggests that EBP2-F exists in binding solution as a monomer and that no dimerization is induced upon binding with GCC box. To determine the minimal GCC box motif required for stable binding by EREBPs, truncations were made at the surroundings of the GCC box (underlined) as presented in Table I, and the binding assays with EBP2-F were performed. Table I shows that the 16-bp GCC box can be shortened by up to 5 bp (T14, T12 and T12a) at the 5′ terminus without effect on binding affinity. Shortening the 3′ terminus destroys the binding completely (T12c and T12d). This indicates that the 11-bp DNA fragment (T11) is the minimal GCC box sequence bound by ERF domain fragments and that flanking sequences 1 bp at 5′ and 3 bp at 3′ terminus outside of the GCC box are necessary for the stable binding of EREBPs. Table I also shows that alteration of the entire surrounding region of the GCC box at both the 5′ and 3′ termini (Mm) has no effect on binding affinity. However, double substitution of G with T at positions 8 and 11 (Md) within the GCC box eliminates the binding. This suggests that the GCC box,i.e. AGCCGCC, is primarily responsible for specific protein binding. To further detail the ERF domain binding specificity of each individual base pair within the GCC box, EMSA with the three ERF domain fragments was performed with GCC box mutants possessing systematic single-base substitutions. Each base in the GCC box from A7 to C13 was substituted with the other three (for sequence numbering, see Fig. 5), and free energy changes (ΔΔG) were obtained from quantitative titration analysis. The results presented in Fig. 5 show that for all three ERF domain fragments, base substitutions at G8, G11, and C13, cause the greatest decrease in binding affinity, indicating that these three positions involve highly specific interactions with EREBPs. The importance of G8 and G11 in maintaining the binding specificity with EREBPs agrees with other reports (4Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 7Zhou J. Tang X. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3217-3218Google Scholar), but C13 also appears to be an important base within the GCC box. For all three ERF domain fragments tested, substitution of A at position 7 of the GCC box with other bases shows little effect on binding except for AtERF1-F, whose conversion of A7 to T7 causes an ∼10-fold decrease in binding affinity. In addition, the ERF domain fragments are differentially affected by base substitutions at positions other than G8, G11, and C13. For example, substitutions of C9 to G and C10 to T destroy EBP2-F binding completely, whereas substitution of C12 to either G or T has little effect on the binding affinity of EBP4-F. Therefore, specific contacts may occur between the EREBPs and the GCCGCC region of the GCC box, but modulated interactions may also occur with the various proteins of the ERF family. Studies with truncations of EBP2-F (see Fig. 2) have revealed that its central region, which includes the 59-aa ERF domain plus a short N-terminal stretch, is necessary for GCC box binding. This is consistent with a similar observation of Ohme-Takagi and Shinshi (4Ohme-Takagi M. Shinshi H. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). However, the ERF domain itself does not possess any binding activity, and the N-terminal flanking appears to be crucial for binding with the GCC box. It is unclear if the N-terminal amino acids specifically interact with the GCC box. Because there is no significant homology at N-terminal flanking region among the family of ERF domain-containing proteins, it may not be responsible for the specific GCC box interactions, but instead maintains an appropriate conformation of the ERF domain for DNA binding. The present study also shows that ERF domain fragments from tobacco and Arabidopsis bind to 16-bp oligonucleotides containing the GCC box from the 5′ upstream region of the tobacco PR geneGln2. All three fragments studied exhibit high binding affinity to the GCC box with K d in the pm range. Such a high binding constant is similar to that of prokaryotic repressors, such as the Cro/OR1 operator (K d = 4.0 pm, Ref. 15Takeda Y. Sarai A. Rivera V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and lac/operator (K d = 0.1 pm, Ref. 16Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeois S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and eukaryotic transcription factors such as c-Myb/enhancer (K d = 0.4 nm, Ref. 17Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K. Nishimura Y Ishii S. Sarai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). All of the latter DNA-binding proteins are either dimers or contain homologous tandem repeats, interacting with their DNA targets of 16/17-bp in a cooperative manner. However, gel shift binding assays for dimer formation revealed that each ERF domain fragments interact as independent units with the GCC box (see Fig. 3). Indeed, the results from protein cross-linking experiments (see Fig. 4) and native gel filtration of EBP2-F (data not shown) strongly suggest that the ERF domain fragment is a monomer in solution, and the GCC box does not induce dimerization upon protein binding. Furthermore, truncation assays (see Table I) reveal that the 11-bp GCC box plus 1 bp at the 5′ and 3 bp at the 3′ flanking regions are sufficient for the binding activity of EREBPs. To our knowledge, this high-affinity binding between a monomeric protein domain and such a short DNA sequence has not been reported. High affinity may be facilitated by the abundant G-C base pairs in the GCC box, the positive charge of ERF domain fragments (average pI = 10.2), and/or enhancement of intermolecular contact through conformational rearrangements of the ERF domains or DNA deformation such as DNA bending. In any case, the present results suggest that a novel mode of DNA binding is involved in interactions of ERF domains with the GCC box. Quantitative EMSA with systematic single-base substitutions of the 7-bp GCC box reveal that the strongest contacts with the ERF domain fragments occur at G8, G11, and C13, whereas A7 is minimally involved. Sequence comparison (see Fig. 1) of the conserved 59-aa ERF domain among the three ERF domain fragments studied shows that their N-terminal halves are almost identical. This region appears to coincide with the GCC box binding specificity of all three ERF domain fragments observed in this study, implying that the N-terminal half is responsible for the specific recognition of the GCC box.

A. 1997; 94: 7076-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) speculated that an N-terminal region (designated the YRG element) of EREBP-like proteins, which may be shorter than what we refer here, may function in DNA binding because of the abundance of basic amino acids at this conserved region. In addition, many proteins (those marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1) with similar N-terminal half in their ERF domain have been shown to possess GCC box binding activity. On the other hand, TINY and CBF1 (see Fig. 1) have much less sequence homology in their ERF domains, suggesting that they recognize a distinct target site. In fact, CBF1 has been shown to bind a 5-bp sequence of CCGAC (10Stockinger E.J. Gilmour S.J. Thomashow M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) rather than the 6-bp GCCGCC. The ΔΔGs obtained from the systematic mutation analysis show some variations of GCC box binding specificity at the positions such as C9, C10, and C12 among the three ERF domain fragments (see Fig. 5). This is probably related to divergence of the sequences of the C-terminal halves of the three ERF domain fragments studied, a region with high amphipathic α-helix propensity. Although this region might not interact with the GCC box directly, its sequence diversity may cause conformational difference of the ERF domains, indirectly affecting the binding specificity with the GCC box. The amphipathic α-helix might also interact with other regulatory factors because this region is common in the conserved ERF domain and often mediates protein-protein interactions (9Weigel D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Jofuku K.D. den Boer B.G.W. Van Montagu M. Okamuro J.K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The differences in GCC box binding specificity found in this study therefore may play important roles in regulating the expression of appropriate PR genes by different ERF domain-containing proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2020527627,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia arises following a reciprocal chromosome translocation t(15;17), which generates PML-retinoic acid receptor α fusion proteins (PML-RARα). We have shown previously that wild type PML, but not PML-RARα, is covalently modified by the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Kamitani, T., Nguyen, H. P., Kito, K., Fukuda-Kamitani, T., and Yeh, E. T. H. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 3117–3120). To understand the mechanisms underlying the differential sentrinization of PML versus PML-RARα, extensive mutational analysis was carried out to determine which Lys residues are sentrinized. We show that Lys65 in the RING finger domain, Lys160 in the B1 Box, and Lys490 in the nuclear localization signal contributes three major sentrinization sites. The PML mutant with Lys to Arg substitutions in all three sites is expressed normally, but cannot be sentrinized. Furthermore, the triple substitution mutant is localized predominantly to the nucleoplasm, in contrast to wild type PML, which is localized to the nuclear bodies. Thus, sentrinization of PML, in the context of the RING finger and the B1 box, regulates nuclear body formation. Furthermore, we showed that sentrinization of PML-RARα could be restored by overexpression of sentrin, but not by retinoic acid treatment. These studies provide novel insight into the pathobiochemistry of acute promyelocytic leukemia and the sentrinization pathway. Acute promyelocytic leukemia arises following a reciprocal chromosome translocation t(15;17), which generates PML-retinoic acid receptor α fusion proteins (PML-RARα). We have shown previously that wild type PML, but not PML-RARα, is covalently modified by the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins (Kamitani, T., Nguyen, H.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)1 is characterized by the presence of a balanced translocation from the long arm of chromosome 17 to the long arm of chromosome 15 (t(15q+;17q−)), which is present in 70–100% of patients (1Larson R.A. Kondo K. Vardiman J.W. Butler A.E. Golomb H.M. Rowley J.D. Am. J. Med. 1984; 76: 827-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This translocation fuses the PMLgene, located on chromosome 15, to the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) gene located on chromosome 17. Two different types of chromosome break points within the PML gene result in the production of two different PML-RARα fusion products, referred to as the A type and the B type, or the L and the S type (2Goodard A.D.

PML-RARα-A contains the entire NH2-terminal 552 amino acids of PML fused to RARα (amino acids 61–462), whereas PML-RARα-B contains the NH2-terminal 394 amino acids of PML fused to RARα (amino acids 61–462). Thus, most of the functional domains of PML and RARα are preserved in the fusion proteins. The fusion proteins, while typically responsive to retinoic acid, display both cell type- and promoter-specific differences from the wild type RARα (3Kakizuka A. Miller Jr., W.H. Umesono K.

Overexpression of PML-RARα in U937 cells prevents vitamin D3 and transforming growth factor β-induced differentiation, but enhances sensitivity to retinoic acid (7Grignani F. Ferrucci P. Testa U.

PML-RARα also reduces serum starvation-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (7Grignani F. Ferrucci P. Testa U. Talamo G. Fagioli M. Alcalay M. Peschle C. Nicoletti I. Pelicci P.

The coiled-coil region, but not the RING finger domain, of PML is involved in the dimerization of PML with PML-RARα (5Kastner P. Perez A. Lutz Y. Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.P. Durand B. Lanotte M.

EMBO Journal. 1996; 15: 4949-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PML-RARα can also dimerize with RARα and RXR (9Perez A. Kastner P. Sethi S. Lutz Y. Reibel C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3171-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, PML-RARα was postulated to function as a dominant negative protein by sequestering and interfering with the function of PML, RARα, and RXR. In normal cells, PML is localized to a discrete subnuclear compartment called the nuclear body (10Weis K. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Jansen J. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Dejean A.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In addition to PML, there are at least five other proteins that have been reported to localize to nuclear bodies. They include Sp100 (14Szostecki C. Guldner H.H. Netter H.J. Will H. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4338-4347PubMed Google Scholar), Sp140 (15Bloch D.B. de la Monte S.M. Guigaouri P. Filippov A. Bloch K.D. J.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and PLZF (18Koken M.H.M. Reid A. Quignon F. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Davies J.M. Kabarowski J.H.S. Zhu J. Dong S. Chen S.J.

Interestingly, PLZF-RARα fusion protein has also been reported in a rare form of APL (19Chen A. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The function of the nuclear body is unknown. The periphery of the nuclear body has been shown to be the preferred site where the early steps of transcription and replication of three DNA virus families take place (20Ishov A.M. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In APL cells, the nuclear bodies were dispersed into a microspeckle pattern (10Weis K. Rambaud S. Lavau C. Jansen J. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Dejean A. Cell. 1994; 76: 345-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 11Koken M.H.M. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Guillemin M.C. Viron A.

Miller W. Chen J. Kakizuka A. Evans R. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar); however, upon treatment with retinoic acid, reformation of the nuclear bodies occurred and APL cells differentiated into granulocytes. Thus, the regulation of nuclear body formation provides an important insight into the pathogenesis of APL. Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that PML, but not PML-RARα fusion proteins, is covalently modified by the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Two other laboratories have also independently reported modification of PML by sentrin or sentrin-related proteins (22Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 23Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sentrinization of PML may regulate its localization in the nucleoplasm or in the nuclear matrix, which contains the nuclear body (22Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Identification of the sentrin modification sites in PML will be very useful in further understanding the role of sentrinization in the pathogenesis of APL in particular and the biology of sentrinization in general. Sentrin was discovered in our laboratory in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the death domain of Fas as a bait (24Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.K. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that sentrin interacted with the signal-competent form of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and protected cells against anti-Fas or tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death (24Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.K. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). Sentrin is a novel protein with a ubiquitin homology domain (residues 22–97) that is 18% identical to ubiquitin (24Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.K. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). Four other laboratories have independently reported proteins with sequences identical to sentrin. These sequences were called UBL1 (ubiquitin-like 1) (25Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), PIC1 (PML-interacting clone 1) (26Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar), GMP1 (GAP modifying protein 1) (27Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), and SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-related modifier) (28Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). We have shown that the COOH terminus of sentrin is efficiently cleaved to allow Gly97 to be used for conjugation to a subset of nuclear proteins (29Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sentrin preferentially interacts with Ubc9 and forms a thiolester linkage with Ubc9 (30Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, ubiquitin was unable to form a thiol ester conjugate with Ubc9. In yeast, Ubc9 also forms a thiol ester conjugate with Smt3, a homologue of sentrin, but not with ubiquitin (31Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A specific activating enzyme complex, comprised of Uba2 and Aos1, has also been demonstrated in yeast (32Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). A similar complex was also identified in mammalian cells. 2L. Gong and E. T. H. Yeh, manuscript in preparation.2L. Gong and E. T. H. Yeh, manuscript in preparation. Taken together, the sentrinization pathway diverges from the ubiquitination pathway at the early activation steps, requires a specific conjugating enzyme (Ubc9), and has specific targets, such as RanGAP1, PML, and Sp100. In this report, we undertook the task of identifying the major sentrinization sites in PML. We showed that sentrinization of the RING finger domain and B1 box plays an important role in regulating the formation of nuclear bodies. Finally, overexpression of sentrin, but not retinoic acid (RA) treatment, could restore sentrinization of the PML-RARα fusion proteins. Thus, the mechanism of RA action is not mediated through direct sentrinization of PML-RARα, but through another mechanism. COS-M6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 16B12 (Babco, Richmond, CA) is mouse monoclonal antibody to the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA of influenza hemagglutinin (HA). Mouse anti-RH (specific for the amino acid sequence, RGSHHHH) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-sentrin antiserum was generated by the immunization with a peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal 21 amino acids (29Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To express HA-tagged sentrin-1 in COS cells, pcDNA3/HA-sentrin-1 was transfected as described previously (29Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of PMLwas prepared from the plasmid pMAMneoPML (33Mu Z.M. Chin K.V. Liu J.H. Lozano G. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6858-6867Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and ligated into pcDNA3/RH-C (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to generate pcDNA3/PML-RH. The cDNAs of PML mutants were made by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers, followed by the ligations with the vector, pcDNA3/RH-C. The full-length cDNA of RARα (34Giguere V. Ong E. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human testis cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two types of PML-RARα cDNA (5Kastner P. Perez A. Lutz Y. Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.P. Durand B. Lanotte M. Berger R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 629-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) were made by the fusion of two cDNA fragments encoding PML amino-terminal part and RARα carboxyl part. The cDNA fusion was performed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction. The cDNA of PML-RARα-A was made by using primerspml-rar-a-F(5′-TGGCGCCGGGGAGGCAGCCATTGAGACCCAGAGCA-3′) and pml-rar-a-R(5′-TGCTCTGGGTCTCAATGGCTGCCTCCCCGGCGCCA-3′) complementary to pml-rar-a-F. The cDNA of PML-RARα-B was made by using primers pml-rar-b-F(5′-CATCACCCAGGGGAAAGCCATTGAGACCC-AGAGCA-3′) and pml-rar-b-R (5′-TGCTCTGGGTCTCAATGGCTTTC CCCTGGGTGATG-3′) complementary to pml-rar-b-F. The sequences of the inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. To express RH-tagged PML, PML mutants, RARα, or PML-RARα, the plasmids described above were transfected into COS cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 29Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were harvested for nickel precipitation or immunostaining 16 h after the incubation. For treatment with all-trans-RA (Aldrich), 16 h after transfection COS cell transfectants were incubated with 10−6m RA for an additional 30 h and harvested. To investigate the conjugation of sentrin to PML, PML-RH was expressed alone or co-expressed with HA-sentrin-1 in COS-M6 cells. Since the sequence of RH-tag is RGSHHHHHH, the PML-RH derivatives can be purified by nickel-charged beads as described previously (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Total cell lysate of the transfectants expressing PML-RH with or without HA-sentrin was prepared in the lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride (pH 7.8)). DNA in the sample was sheared with a 22-gauge needle, and the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 15 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-charged agarose resin beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with the washing buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride (pH 7.8)), followed by two more rounds of washing with another washing buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride (pH 6.0)). Subsequently, the beads were washed with PBS twice and treated in 2% SDS treating solution for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-sentrin antiserum or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (16B12) to detect PML-RH conjugated with native sentrin or HA-sentrin, respectively. To document expression level of PML-RH, anti-RH antibody was also used to detect unmodified PML-RH and its derivatives. Protein samples were treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 300 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting was performed using the protocol provided by ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Immunocytochemical staining was performed by the avidin-biotin-HRP complex (ABC-HRP) method (36Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), using the VECTASTAIN ABC kit system (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Transfected COS-M6 cells on coverslip were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.1% H2O2 for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and washed with PBS. The cells were incubated for 10 min with PBS containing 5% horse serum for blocking, followed by the further incubation with anti-RH antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and then treated with the ABC reagent (avidin-biotin-HRP complex) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the enzymatic disclosing procedure was performed as reported previously (36Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that wild type PML could be modified by sentrin, whereas PML-RARα-A and PML-RARα-B could not (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Differential sentrinization of PML versus PML-RARα could play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Thus, it is of interest to define the sites in PML that are modified by sentrin or regulate the modification process. For this purpose, wild type and mutant PML molecules (see Fig. 1) were tagged with an RH epitope (RGSHHHHHH) at the COOH terminus and expressed in COS cells, as described previously (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H.

Transfected cells were lysed with 6 m guanidine HCl to denature proteins in the lysate and to prevent proteolysis or desentrinization. RH-tagged PML (PML-RH) was precipitated with nickel-charged beads and immunoblotted with either anti-sentrin-1 antiserum to detect modified PML (29Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or with anti-RH monoclonal antibody to detect both unmodified and modified PML (21Kamitani T.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, three distinct bands were identified in the wild type PML sample immunoblotted with anti-sentrin-1 antiserum (lane 2). As a control, HA-tagged PML expressed in COS cells could not be precipitated by nickle-charged beads and did not show any sentrinized bands (lane 1). Deletion of the NH2-terminal proline-rich domain (lane 3) or the COOH-terminal proline-serine-rich domain (lane 6) reduced the sizes of sentrinized proteins but did not alter the pattern of sentrinization. However, the upper two bands disappeared upon deletion of the both the proline-rich domain and the RING finger domain (lane 4). To ensure that the mutant PML proteins were expressed at a level comparable with the wild type PML, anti-RH mAb was used to detect the unmodified form of PML. As shown in lanes 8–12, the unmodified forms of PML were expressed equally well in all lanes.Figure 2Lys65 in the RING finger domain is a major sentrinization site. A, COS cells expressing HA-tagged PML (lanes 1 and 7), RH-tagged PML (lanes 2 and 8), proline-rich domain deletion mutant (lanes 3 and 9), proline-rich domain and RING finger domain deletion mutant (lanes 4 and 10), nuclear localization signal deletion mutant (lanes 5 and 11), and COOH-terminal serine-proline-rich domain deletion mutant (lanes 6 and 12) were precipitated with nickel-charged beads and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-sentrin-1 antiserum (lanes 1–6) or mouse anti-RH monoclonal antibody (lanes 7–12). B, COS cells expressing RH-tagged proline-rich domain deletion mutant (lanes 1 and 7), proline-rich domain deletion plus K65R substitution (lanes 2and 8), proline-rich domain deletion and K68R substitution (lanes 3 and 9), proline-rich domain deletion plus K65R and K490R substitutions (lanes 4 and 10), proline-rich domain and RING finger domain deletion (lanes 5 and 11), proline-rich domain and RING finger domain deletion plus K490R substitution (lanes 6 and 12) were precipitated with nickel-charged beads and analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-sentrin-1 antiserum (lanes 1–6) or mouse anti-RH monoclonal antibody (lanes 7–12).

Interestingly, the RING finger domain of PML contains two lysine residues (Lys65 and Lys68) that may function as acceptors for sentrin. To investigate this possibility, RH-tagged PML(K65R) or PML(K68R) was expressed in COS cells and analyzed as described previously (21Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, only the middle and lower bands were detected in the PML(K65R) sample (lane 2), whereas PML(K68R) (lane 3) retained all three bands. The faint upper band in lane 2 is most likely nonspecific, because it was not present in a separate experiment where HA-tagged sentrin was co-expressed with PML(K65R) (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). These results suggest that the RING finger domain of PML contains one sentrinization site (Lys65). Since deletion of the RING finger domain led to disappearance of the upper two bands (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), the RING finger domain may also regulate sentrinization at a distant site. PML contains more than 20 lysine residues that are distributed throughout the entire molecule. We attempted to identify additional sentrinization sites by making lysine to arginine substitutions spanning the PML molecule. Analysis of a large number of substitution mutants led to the identification of Lys490 as the second sentrinization site. This conclusion is supported by the experiments shown in Fig. 2 B. As shown in lane 4, combining the K490R substitution with the K65R substitution abolished the upper two bands. Furthermore, addition of the K490R substitution to the RING finger deletion led to loss of all three sentrinized bands (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). Again, the mutant PML proteins were expressed at a level comparable with the PML proline-rich domain deletion mutant (lanes 7–12). Since the PML(K65R,K490R) double mutant retained a single sentrinized band (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), there must be an additional sentrinization site. The third sentrinization site was mapped to the B1 box, because combining the K65R substitution with the B1 box deletion led to loss of the upper two bands (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). Complete loss of the three sentrinized bands was observed when the K490R substitution was added to the PML (K65R, B1 box deletion) mutant (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The B1 box contains three lysines at residues 133, 150, and 160. Thus, a Lys to Arg substitution was made to each residue and superimposed on the background of the PML(K65R,K490R) mutant. As shown in Fig. 3 A, PML (K65R,K133R,K490R) (lane 4) and PML (K65R,K150R,K490R) (lane 5) still retained the lower band. However, PML (K65R,K160R,K490R) lost all three sentrinized bands. Again, the mutant proteins were expressed at a comparable level (lanes 7–12). Interestingly, the PML(K160R) substitution mutant lost both the upper and middle bands, suggesting that this substitution affects Lys160 and another site (Lys65) (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). This was supported by the observation that the K160R and the K65R,K160R mutants had an identical pattern of sentrinization, i.e. retaining only the lower band (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, the K160R,K490R mutant lost all sentrinization bands, similar to the K65R,K160R,K490R mutant (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest that the RING domain and the B1 box could affect each other. PML has a putative nuclear localization signal located between residues 476 a"

The interaction of caveolin with several caveolae-associated signaling proteins is mediated by the binding of the scaffolding region of caveolin to a hydrophobic amino acid-containing region within the regulated proteins. The presence of a similar motif within the insulin receptor kinase prompted us to investigate the caveolar localization and regulation of the insulin receptor by caveolin. We found that overexpression of caveolin-3 augmented insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in 293T cells but not the phosphorylation of insulin receptor. Peptides corresponding to the scaffolding domain of caveolin potently stimulated insulin receptor kinase activity toward insulin receptor substrate-1 or a Src-derived peptide in vitro and in a caveolin subtype-dependent fashion. Peptides from caveolin-2 exhibited no effect, whereas caveolin-1 and -3 stimulated activity 10- and 17-fold, respectively. Peptides which increased insulin receptor kinase activity did so without affecting insulin receptor auto-phosphorylation. Furthermore, the insulin receptor bound to immobilized caveolin peptides, and this binding was inhibited in the presence of free caveolin-3 peptides.

Caveolae are cell-surface invaginations distinct from coated pits. Early studies suggested that caveolae play a role in molecular transport across the membrane; caveolae are capable of moving tracers, introduced into the blood space, across the endothelial cell by transcytosis (1Simionescu N. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1536-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Other, more recent studies have proposed that caveolae function as subcellular compartments to concentrate molecules and provide them with a site for molecular interaction at the plasma membrane (2Mineo C.

Recent studies have suggested regulatory as well as structural functions for caveolin; caveolin may directly regulate numerous signaling proteins in caveolae. Different groups have demonstrated inhibition of G proteins, Src family kinases, nitric oxide synthase, epidermal growth factor receptor, and protein kinase C by a short stretch of the membrane proximal region of the cytosolic amino-terminal caveolin domain (or the caveolin scaffolding domain), leading to the suggestion that the biological function of caveolin is to suppress cellular signaling (5Li S.

The specificity of caveolin interaction to these molecules has been confirmed by identifying a common amino acid sequence motif (ψXψXXXXψ or ψXXXXψXXψ; where ψ is an aromatic residue), which is contained in many of these regulatory molecules and in the insulin receptor (IR)1 as well (19Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Like the cell-surface receptors for many peptide growth factors and hormones, the IR contains an endogenous tyrosine kinase within its cytoplasmic domain. This kinase activity is required for transmission of downstream insulin signals, such as energy storage and cell proliferation (22Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IR tyrosine kinase is partially activated by insulin binding and fully activated following so-called “auto-phosphorylation” of the regulatory loop region within the kinase domain. Activation of the IR kinase allows the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates of the IR, i.e.the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, such as IRS-1 (22Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar,23White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

We further investigated whether there was a productive regulatory interaction between the IR and caveolin. We demonstrate that the scaffolding domain of caveolin interacts with the IR, leading to an increase in IR kinase activity. Antisera against IRS-1, the COOH terminus of the IR, and phosphotyrosine have been previously described (29Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M.

Briefly, the six peptides used most frequently in this study were as follows: a caveolin-1 non-scaffolding domain peptide (NRDPKHLNDDVVKIDFEDVIAEPEGTHSF, caveolin-1 amino acid residues 53–81); the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (DGIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR, amino acid residues 82–101); the caveolin-2 scaffolding domain peptide (DKVWICSHALFEISKYVMYK, amino acid residues 54–73); the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide (DGVWRVSYTTFTVSKYWCYR, amino acid residues 55–74); two peptides derived from IR (GLLPVRWMAPESLKDGVF, amino acid residues 1157–1174); (TTSSDMWSFGVVIWEITS, amino acid residues 1175–1192, containing the caveolin-binding motif).

Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, and IR antibodies were added overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed three times in ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaPPi, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1% SDS. Immunoblotting was performed using an antibody against phosphotyrosine or IR, and their expression was quantitated with the use of a computer densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The cytosolic domain of IRK was overexpressed using the baculovirus expression system (BIRK) as described previously (kindly provided by Dr. J. Ahn) (34Villalba M. Wente S.R. Russell D.S. Ahn J. Reichelderfer C.F. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7848-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Ahn J. Donner D.B. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7571-7576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors by sonication three times (10 s) at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the crude cytosolic source of BIRK. The purified BIRK was obtained from the cytosolic fraction through three rounds of chromatography (Fast Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and Superose-12 columns) as described previously (34Villalba M. Wente S.R. Russell D.S. Ahn J. Reichelderfer C.F. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7848-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,35Ahn J. Donner D.B. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7571-7576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IRS-1 was similarly overexpressed in insect cells and purified though gel filtration chromatography on S300 HR as described previously (29Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The purified IRS-1 was used as a substrate of BIRK. Either the cytosolic fraction of insect cells (approximately 2.5 μg/tube, which contained 2.5–5.0 pmol BIRK) or the purified BIRK (0.38 μg/tube or 7.9 pmol BIRK) was used. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in a 40-μl buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (approximately 1,000 cpm/pmol ATP), 0.1% Triton X-100, 450 mm NaCl, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 or 1% Me2SO. The purified IRS-1 (1.5 μg/tube or 8.3 pmol) or an Src substrate peptide (500 μg/tube) was used as substrate. Assays were performed at 23 °C for 20 min and were stopped by adding 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer solution containing 100 mm DTT, 50 mm EDTA, and 50 mm EGTA. After boiling the reaction mixture for 5 min, the samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiography. To separate the Src peptide, a 26% polyacrylamide gel containing 6m urea was used. Phosphorylation of the substrate was quantitated with the use of a computer densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Caveolin peptides were immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Briefly, after washing the resin with 5 bed volumes of isopropyl alcohol and Me2SO, the resin was incubated with 2 mm caveolin peptide overnight at room temperature. The coupling of peptides to the resin was confirmed by monitoring the recovery of peptides remaining in the supernatant. After 12 h, approximately 50% of the incubated peptide was bound to the resin. Any unreacted sites were blocked by the addition of an excess amount of ethanolamine. After extensive washing of the peptide-bound resin, the resin and the cytosolic solution overexpressing BIRK (approximately 0.125 mg/ml) were incubated for 10 h at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors. The resin was washed extensively four times with an excess amount of the buffer, followed by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. When BIRK binding to the resin was competed by free peptides, the cytosolic solution overexpressing BIRK (0.125 mg/ml) was preincubated with free peptides (50 μm) before adding to the caveolin peptide-bound resin. Incubation, washing, and elution procedures were as described above. Peptides derived from IR were similarly immobilized on Affi-Gel 10. Briefly, the resin was incubated with 2 mm insulin receptor peptide overnight at room temperature. Membrane protein overexpressing caveolin-3 (approximately 0.15 mg/ml) was incubated for 10 h at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Washing and elution procedures were as described above. The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Since an early histological study demonstrated that cell-surface insulin binding activity concentrated in non-coated microinvaginations (24Goldberg R.I. Smith R.M. Jarett L. J. Cell Physiol. 1987; 133: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether caveolin and the IR co-localize. We thus determined the location of the IR and caveolae in cells using a sucrose gradient method that has been commonly used to purify caveolar fractions from culture cells (7Song K.S. Scherer P.E.

CHO cells stably transfected with the IR and IRS-1 (31Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kanh C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were homogenized and fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, followed by immunoblotting to examine the distribution of the IR, caveolin, and IRS-1 (Fig. 1). Caveolin, our caveolar marker, was found in fractions 4–5, and the IR was similarly distributed. IRS-1, in contrast, was predominantly in fractions 9–12. Thus, our findings suggested that IR are present in plasmalemmal caveolae although the sucrose gradient method as well as any other currently available methods may not purify caveolae to homogeneity. Recent studies have demonstrated that caveolin subtypes are not merely structural proteins in caveolae but also interact with and regulate important signaling molecules in caveolae (5Li S. Okamoto T.

We therefore examined the effect of caveolin-3 on IR signaling in cultured cells. In order to have the greatest chance of observing an effect of caveolin-3 overexpression on IR function, we chose cells that express low levels of endogenous caveolin-1 and -3; HEK293T cells were derived from HEK293 cells by introducing the SV40 large T antigen, and like many oncogenically transformed cells (37Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), they expressed less caveolin than wild type parental HEK293 cells (data not shown). We assessed the effect of caveolin on IR activity by comparing insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the endogenous IR substrate, IRS-1, in 293T cells and 293T cells overexpressing caveolin-3. When the HEK293T cells were stimulated with insulin, the phosphorylation of endogenous IRS-1 was increased in a time-dependent manner as detected by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 A). In HEK293T cells overexpressing caveolin-3, the degree of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was approximately 2 times greater than that in mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 2 B). Insulin induced autophosphorylation of IR time-dependently; however, there was no augmentation in the degree of autophosphorylation in cells overexpressing caveolin-3. The content of IRS-1 and IR was not altered by overexpressing caveolin-3 (Fig. 2, A and C). Endogenous IGF-1 receptors were not detectable in HEK293T cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that caveolin-3 enhances insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, suggesting that caveolin can activate as well as inhibit signaling protein function (5Li S.

It is not clear, however, whether this effect is directly through the IR or whether it is mediated indirectly by other insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinases in caveolae. In order to determine whether caveolin directly stimulates the IR tyrosine kinase, we examined its effect on the IRin vitro. We initially attempted to examine the effect of purified caveolin, but purified caveolin aggregated at high concentrations (38Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We thus used a short stretch of the membrane proximal region of the cytosolic amino-terminal caveolin domain (or the caveolin scaffolding domain). By using this peptide, different groups have demonstrated the caveolin-mediated inhibition of G proteins, Src kinases, and nitric oxide synthase (5Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We overexpressed the cytosolic kinase portion of human IR in insect cells (BIRK) as described previously (34Villalba M. Wente S.R. Russell D.S. Ahn J. Reichelderfer C.F. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7848-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Ahn J. Donner D.B. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7571-7576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we examined the effect of the caveolin scaffolding domain peptides on the ability of BIRK to phosphorylate purified IRS-1 protein in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3 A, caveolin-1 and -3 scaffolding domain peptides increased BIRK activity significantly in a dose-dependent manner. The caveolin peptides from different lots or the peptides provided by different manufacturers showed similar effects. In contrast, the caveolin-2 scaffolding domain peptide, as well as a caveolin-1 non-scaffolding domain peptide (data not shown), had no effect on BIRK activity at any concentration. The degree of stimulation appeared to be greater for caveolin-3 (∼17-fold) than for caveolin-1 (∼10-fold). Auto-phosphorylation of BIRK was not altered in the presence of any of the above peptides. Similar results were obtained when immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine was conducted (Fig. 3 B). The above study demonstrated that caveolin peptides stimulated BIRK. With these initial findings, we started investigating the mechanism of caveolin-mediated activation of BIRK. We then examined the substrate specificity of the caveolin-mediated potentiation of BIRK activity because caveolin peptides may modify IRS-1 (not BIRK) to increase the degree of its IRS-1 phosphorylation. We examined the effect of caveolin peptides using an Src-derived peptide, a peptide substrate commonly used in BIRK assays (30Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3782-3789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, caveolin peptides also stimulated IR kinase activity using this substrate. The caveolin-1 and -3 scaffolding domain peptides potentiated BIRK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). The degree of potentiation of BIRK activity with an Src-derived peptide was less than that with IRS-1; however, this may be due to differences in the geometries and/or accessibilities of the substrates for the enzyme active site. Thus, caveolin stimulated BIRK activity regardless of the substrate species. We also tested whether caveolin peptides stimulated BIRK directly; caveolin peptides may increase BIRK activity indirectly through activating another factor(s) contained in the cell extract. We examined the effect of the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide on BIRK, which was purified from insect cells to yield a single major band on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the caveolin-3 peptide stimulated the purified BIRK activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the stimulation of the caveolin peptide with BIRK was direct and independent of the other factors. We also examined various deletion mutants of caveolin-1 and -3 peptides. The caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide was sequentially deleted from the amino terminus to produce 3 shorter peptides (20-mer, amino acid residues 82–101; 16-mer, amino acid residues 86–101; 14-mer, amino acid residues 88–101; 12-mer, amino acid residues 90–101). Similarly, the caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide was sequentially deleted (20-mer, amino acid residues 55–74; 17-mer, amino acid residues 58–74; 14-mer, amino acid residues 61–74; 11-mer, amino acid residues 64–74). BIRK overexpressed in H5 cells and IRS-1 was incubated in the presence of 10 μm of each peptide for assay. As shown in Fig. 6, a 16-mer caveolin-1 peptide stimulated BIRK activity to a similar degree as a 20-mer peptide, whereas the rest of the peptides (below 14-mer) were mostly ineffective. Similarly, a 17-mer caveolin-3 peptide stimulated BIRK activity to a similar degree as a 20-mer peptide, but the rest of the peptides did not, suggesting that there is a length requirement for the stimulation of BIRK activity by these caveolin peptides. Finally, to confirm the interaction of caveolin peptides with BIRK, we examined whether caveolin peptides directly bound to BIRK. The caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10, followed by incubation with BIRK. After extensive washing, the bound BIRK was eluted from the resin. As shown in Fig. 7 A, BIRK bound to the immobilized caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide or the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide, but not to Affi-Gel alone nor to the caveolin-1 non-scaffolding domain peptide. These data suggest that BIRK directly bound to the caveolin peptides that stimulate BIRK activity. We also examined whether binding of BIRK to the immobilized caveolin peptide was competed by free caveolin peptide. BIRK was preincubated with free caveolin-3 scaffolding domain peptide before adding to the caveolin-3-immobilized resin. The binding of BIRK was significantly reduced by this competition (Fig. 7 B). We also examined the importance of the caveolin-binding motif within IR. We made a 18-mer peptide derived from the region containing the caveolin-binding motif within the IR kinase domain (TTSSDMWSFGVVIWEITS, amino acid residues 1175–1192). This peptide was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10, followed by incubation with the membrane protein overexpressing caveolin-3. After extensive washing, the bound caveolin-3 protein was eluted from the resin. As shown in Fig. 7 C, caveolin-3 bound to this peptide with the motif but not to Affi-Gel alone nor to another IR peptide derived from its vicinity but lacking the motif (amino acid residues 1157–1174) (Fig. 7 C). Thus, caveolin most likely interacts with IR through the caveolin-binding motif that exists in IR. These data suggest that the interaction between caveolin peptide and insulin kinase domain was direct and specific. Taken together, our data show that the IR interacts with caveolin and binds to the scaffolding region of specific subtypes of caveolin (caveolin-3, and -1, but not caveolin-2). This insulin receptor/caveolin binding is direct and serves to increase the activity of the IR kinase independently of receptor autophosphorylation. Thus, caveolin appears to target the IR kinase to a specific subcellular location (caveolae) and stimulate the IR kinase activity toward substrates in caveolae. Since this effect is subtype-specific and caveolin subtypes have different tissue distributions, it is tempting to speculate that this is a mechanism for altering the function of the IR in a cell type-specific manner. The result of the IR/caveolin interaction is functionally different from the interaction between caveolin and other signaling molecules, as caveolin inhibits the signaling function of these other molecules (5Li S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The role of each caveolin subtype in regulating insulin signaling, however, was very similar to that previously reported with other kinase molecules (9Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 20Oka N. Yamamoto M. Schwencke C. Kawabe J. Ebina T. Ohno S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33416-33421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar); both caveolin-1 and -3 regulated the function, whereas caveolin-2 had no effects on kinase activity. The same caveolin subtypes therefore increase the activity of the IR kinase while decreasing the activity of other signaling molecules. It is teleologically unclear why caveolin would increase IR kinase activity and decrease the activity of other signaling molecules. Expression of caveolin is known to change with cellular differentiation. When fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes, caveolin expression increases with an increase in IR signaling (40Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, other growth hormone signaling such as platelet-derived growth factor is decreased (41Huppertz C. Schwartz C. Becker W. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Caveolin might play a role in cellular differentiation by coordinating the balance among different hormone and growth factor signaling. Furthermore, caveolin-3 is abundant in skeletal muscle, which strongly depends on insulin for energy metabolism. It is known that phosphofructokinase-M, a key regulatory enzyme in the glycolytic pathway in muscles, binds to caveolin-3 and that this binding is stabilized in the presence of phosphofructokinase-M activators (42Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20698-20705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolin may play an role in regulating energy metabolism in skeletal muscles as well. Although we do not know the exact molecular mechanism by which caveolin stimulates the activity of the IR tyrosine kinase, it is clear that this is due to the direct binding of the receptor by the scaffolding domains of caveolins-3 and -1. The site of binding within IR is most likely within the region containing the caveolin-binding motif (TTSSDMWSFGVVIWEITS, amino acid residues 1175–1192). The IR kinase is activated by insulin binding and further activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase regulatory domain (22Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 23White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that the kinase regulatory domain is a protein loop which sits over the active site of the kinase in the inactive state; autophosphorylation of this loop acts to move it away from the kinase domain, allowing substrate access to the site and kinase activity. Given the proximity of the putative caveolin-binding site to the regulatory region, and remembering that caveolin binding increases activity but not autophosphorylation, it is tempting to speculate that caveolin stabilizes the activated conformation of the regulatory region of the receptor in an activated state. Caveolin may selectivity regulate the function of signaling molecules accumulated in caveolae by either increasing or suppressing their enzymatic activity. Here we have provided further evidence that caveolin is regulatory as well as structural and that it can enhance, as well as inhibit, the activity of cellular signaling molecules."

The primate ACAT2 gene product was cloned from an African green monkey liver cDNA library. Sequence analysis of an isolated, full-length clone of ACAT2 cDNA identified an open reading frame encoding a 526-amino acid protein with essentially no sequence similarity to the ACAT1 cDNA over the N-terminal 101 amino acids but with 57% identity predicted over the remaining 425 amino acids. Transfection of the cloned ACAT2 cDNA into two different mammalian cell types resulted in the production of abundant ACAT activity which was sensitive to ACAT inhibitors. Northern blot analysis showed that the ACAT2 mRNA was expressed primarily in liver and intestine in monkeys. In contrast, ACAT1 mRNA was expressed in almost all tissues examined. Topologic predictions from the amino acid sequence of ACAT2 indicates that it has seven trans-membrane domains in a configuration that places the putative active site of the enzyme in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The intracellular formation of cholesteryl esters catalyzed by the action of the enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT; EC2.3.1.26)1 appears to be nearly ubiqitous in mammalian cells (1Billheimer J.T.

Elucidation of the details of the structure and catalytic mechanism of ACAT and of the regulation of its activity have been stymied by the difficulty in isolating and purifying an active form of this membrane-associated enzyme. It has taken the isolation of a cDNA for ACAT from human genomic DNA, accomplished through functional complementation of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking ACAT activity, to initiate progress in understanding the biochemistry of ACAT function (2Chang C.C.Y.

The mRNA for this ACAT is expressed in most human tissues and cDNAs with nearly identical ACAT sequences have likewise been found in a variety of tissues from mouse, hamster, and rabbit (3Uelmen P.J.

The enzyme appears to modulate the potentially toxic effects of cholesterol in cell membranes. By attaching a fatty acid to the free hydroxyl group of cholesterol, physical properties of the cholesterol molecule are changed and the solubility of esterified cholesterol in the lipids of the cell membrane is limited. Cholesteryl esters accumulate in lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, and maintenance of a balance between the free and esterified forms of cholesterol in a cell is believed to be a component of regulation of cholesterol signaling pathways (6Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 897-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar).Evidence is also accumulating that ACAT activity is important for cholesterol transport in lipoproteins by the liver and intestine. The majority of cholesterol absorbed from the intestinal lumen by the mucosal cell is esterified by ACAT (7Purdy B.H. Field F.J. J Clin Inv. 1984; 74: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and incorporated into chylomicron particles (8Klein R.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 343-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins by the liver appears to depend to an extent on ACAT-catalyzed cholesterol esterification (9Cianflone K.M. Yasruel Z. Rodriquez M.A. Vas D.

Formation of cholesteryl esters in the primate liver is promoted by oleic acid-enriched diets (12Rudel L.L. Haines J. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.S. Carr T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and is catalyzed by ACAT (13Carr T.P. Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. Arterio. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that hepatic secretion of cholesteryl esters in apoB-containing lipoproteins, as monitored during isolated liver perfusion, was strongly associated with the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis in nonhuman primates fed atherogenic diets, (12Rudel L.L. Haines J. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.S. Carr T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and was sensitive to inhibition by ACAT inhibitors (11Carr T.P. Hamilton Jr., R.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the extent of diet-induced cholesteryl ester accumulation in the liver, while correlated to the rate of hepatic cholesteryl ester secretion, was not as highly correlated to the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis as was the secretion rate (12Rudel L.L. Haines J. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.S. Carr T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possible explanation was that the hepatic ACAT enzyme that catalyzed the formation of the cholesteryl esters of lipoproteins was different from the enzyme that catalyzed the formation of cholesteryl esters of intracellular lipid droplets. In any case, an important role for hepatic ACAT in the development of coronary artery atherosclerosis was indicated.Conceptually, the presence of various forms of ACAT differentially distributed in tissues and conceivably present in separate cellular compartments is consistent with the increasing evidence for multiple roles of sterol esterification in cholesterol metabolism. The possibility that more than one ACAT enzyme is present in at least some tissues of mammalian species was highlighted by the mouse knockout experiment showing that disruption of the ACAT gene analog to the human ACAT gene cloned by Chang et al. (2Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not alter the pattern of intestinal cholesterol absorption or hepatic cholesteryl ester accumulation when cholesterol was fed (14Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the work of Sturley and colleagues (15Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and Yu et al. (16Yu C. Kennedy N.J. Chang C.C.Y. Rothblatt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24157-24163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) demonstrated two different ACAT analogs in yeast, suggesting that two or more ACAT enzymes in mammalian species would not be unprecedented. Additional work in the Sturley (17Sturley, S. L., Oelker, P. M., and Behari, A. (1997)Circulation 96, I-441 (abstr.)Google Scholar) and Farese laboratories (18Cases S. Zheng Y-W. Novak S. Meiner V. Myers H. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.): I230-I231Google Scholar) identifying at least two ACAT-related gene products (ARGP) in the EST data bases for the human and mouse genomes supports the possibility that more than one ACAT enzyme exists.In the work reported here, the complete nucleotide sequence has been determined for the cDNA of a second ACAT (ACAT2) isoform in primates which varies substantially in structure from the initially described human ACAT (2Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACAT2 is present in an organ-specific distribution (only liver and intestine) that differs from the nearly ubiquitous expression pattern seen for the original human ACAT, here termed ACAT1. The specific tissue location and topology prediction of this new ACAT2 isolate appears to adapt it to the particular function of providing cholesteryl esters for lipoprotein secretion from hepatocytes and intestinal mucosa. In this way ACAT2 may complement the ACAT1 analog, the latter being found widely distributed among tissues in the monkey apparently serving more general cell functions.DISCUSSIONEvidence in nonhuman primate models has been obtained over the past two decades indicating that the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in low density lipoprotein, with the associated low density lipoprotein particle enlargement, is highly correlated with the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis (35Rudel L.L. Kalter S.S. Uses of Nonhuman Primates in Cardiovascular Research. University of Texas Press, Austin, TX1980: 37-57Google Scholar, 36Rudel L.L. Leathers C.W. Bond M.G. Bullock B.C.

Nutr.62, (suppl.), 463S-470SGoogle Scholar). Most recently, we have shown that the secretion of cholesteryl esters from the liver, as monitored during isolated liver perfusion, is correlated with the enrichment of the low density lipoprotein particles with cholesteryl esters and is also predictive of the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis (12Rudel L.L. Haines J. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.S. Carr T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The formation of cholesteryl esters in primate liver is catalyzed by ACAT (13Carr T.P. Parks J.S. Rudel L.L. Arterio. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the secretion of cholesteryl esters and apoB by the perfused primate liver is decreased by ACAT inhibitors (11Carr T.P. Hamilton Jr., R.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When diets rich in monounsaturated fat are fed to African green monkeys, the livers accumulated excess cholesteryl ester in the form of cholesteryl oleate, the secretion of cholesteryl oleate was enhanced, and the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis occurred out of proportion to the low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (12Rudel L.L. Haines J. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.S. Carr T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Rudel L.L. Parks J.S. Sawyer J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 2101-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). All of this evidence points to a key role for hepatic cholesterol esterification by ACAT in promoting diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis in primates. Therefore, it was important for us to identify the ACAT enzymes in primate liver as a prelude to study of their regulation.The evidence supporting the conclusion that the African green monkey cDNA clone we have characterized in this publication is an authentic ACAT enzyme includes, first and foremost, that transfection of mammalian cells with this clone results in high levels of ACAT activity (Table I). The activity in the cells was shown to be associated with the microsomal fraction. The levels of activity were as high as that found in rat liver microsomes and as high or higher as that seen when monkey ACAT1 cDNA was transfected into the cells. Furthermore, the activity was inhibitable by at least two ACAT inhibitors. The AC29 cells from Chang and colleagues (2Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) used for most of these transfection studies have no ACAT activity, protein, or mRNA, providing a rigorous system in which to characterize ACAT gene expression. A second mammalian cell line, COS-1, was also successfully transfected with ACAT2 to make sure that the outcome was not peculiar to AC29 cells.The predicted primary structure of the monkey ACAT2 clone is highly analogous to that described for ACAT1. The fact that the first approximately 100 amino acids of each enzyme are of a completely different sequence suggests that this portion of the enzyme may confer separate functions for the two enzymes. However, over the remaining 425 amino acids, a 57% sequence identity occurs for human ACAT1 and monkey ACAT2 suggesting similar functions for this portion of the protein. Easily recognizable aspects of the ACAT2 sequence that may contribute to its function as an ACAT enzyme are: 1) the analog to serine residue 269, which when converted to a leucine residue in SRD-4 cells resulted in an inactive ACAT (4Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), 2) leucine heptad motifs that may facilitate protein-protein interactions important in the presumed oligomerization that may occur for active ACAT (34Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and 3) multiple transmembrane helical domains that may serve to anchor the protein in the ER membrane.Other evidence that the primary structure of the protein coded for by the monkey ACAT2 clone is as indicated in Fig. 1 was obtained duringin vitro translation studies. The primary translation product for the African green monkey ACAT2 cDNA ran at about 47,000M r compared with the primary product for monkey ACAT1, which ran at about 50,000 M r during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). These apparent differences in size are consistent with the presumed differences in the size of the two proteins based on the deduced amino acid sequences. The fact that both enzymes appear to run at molecular weights that are smaller than the predicted sizes based on primary structure has been observed by others (18Cases S. Zheng Y-W. Novak S. Meiner V. Myers H. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Circulation. 1997; 96 (abstr.): I230-I231Google Scholar, 20Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).The distribution of ACAT mRNA among 18 different primate tissues is the most detailed comparison yet made available (Fig. 4) and was facilitated by the collection of multiple tissues from monkeys being necropsied for atherosclerosis evaluations in other experiments. The fact that ACAT1 mRNA is present in most tissues, with the possible exception of skeletal muscle, is compatible with the prevalent notion that most cells can esterify excess cholesterol when the need arises. The remarkably high level of ACAT1 mRNA in adrenal, compared with that in other tissues, is likely responsible for the significant amount of cholesteryl ester accumulation that normally occurs in this organ. High adrenal cholesteryl ester levels were dramatically reduced by the disruption of the ACAT1 gene in mice (14Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).The presence of multiple bands for ACAT1 mRNA in various tissues has been noted before but the reason is unexplained (2Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pape M.E. Schultz P.A. Rea T.J. DeMattos R.B. Kieft K. Bisgaier C.L. Newton R.S. Krause B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 823-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that the banding pattern was quite similar for most tissues with the 5′-coding region probe used in these studies. We have also probed the same Northern blots with a probe specific to the 3′-end of the ACAT1 coding sequence (data not shown). This probe appeared to show some suggestive differences in band intensity among tissues that were not seen with the 5′-end riboprobe, but the same size range of bands was seen with both probes. Both the 5′- and 3′-end untranslated nucleotide sequences for ACAT1 mRNA are relatively long, especially compared with ACAT2, but any metabolic role for alternate splicing remains uncertain.With both the 3′-end and 5′-end riboprobes to ACAT2 mRNA that were made to sequences dissimilar to any found in ACAT1, the lack of reactivity in tissues other than liver and jejunum was striking, especially considering the near ubiquitous expression of ACAT1. The presence of a larger band in the kidney is believed to represent cross-hybridization with the message for an unidentified protein since the use of a riboprobe specific to the sequences in the coding region near the 5′-end did not identify the larger band in the kidney. Clearly these data suggest that ACAT2 has a specific function related to this specific tissue distribution. While we cannot be sure what this function is, the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins is carried out almost exclusively by liver and intestine, and it is possible that ACAT2 is responsible for formation of the cholesteryl esters of newly secreted lipoprotein particles. We have provided suggestive evidence that some ACAT activity is required for apoB particle secretion (11Carr T.P. Hamilton Jr., R.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the context of tissue distribution and function, the modeling of the secondary structure of the monkey ACAT1 and ACAT2 enzymes that was done with the Predict Protein technology (30Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar, 31Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) is of interest. The prediction for ACAT2, as shown in Fig. 2, is that there are seven transmembrane domains with the longer peptide loops between these helical transmembrane regions being situated mostly on the lumenal side of the ER membrane. In contrast, for the topology prediction for monkey ACAT1, the model shows eight transmembrane domains. Basically, the same seven domains as found in ACAT2 are also predicted for ACAT1, but one additional transmembrane helix is found at amino acid residues 247–264. This has the effect of moving the putative active site serine at amino acid 269 as well as the remainder of the peptide loops that likely contain other active site residues to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The NH2-terminal 100+ amino acids for both enzymes are predicted to be on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, but since there is almost no sequence similarity in this region between ACAT1 and ACAT2, this portion of the protein probably does not contain active site residues.Thus, the model predictions would be consistent with the active site of the ACAT1 enzyme being on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane where it could possibly facilitate cholesteryl ester incorporation into cytoplasmic lipid droplets, as occurs extensively in the adrenal. In contrast, ACAT2 is predicted to have its active site on the lumenal side of the ER membrane (Fig. 2). This orientation may facilitate cholesteryl ester incorporation into apoB-containing lipoproteins, as lipoprotein particle assembly and secretion is known to occur in the ER lumen. Perhaps it was the inhibition of ACAT2 by ACAT inhibitors that resulted in the decreased rate of appearance in perfusate of apoB and cholesteryl esters in the monkey liver perfusion studies (11Carr T.P. Hamilton Jr., R.L. Rudel L.L. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Table I show that ACAT2 is sensitive to two of these ACAT inhibitors. Further work is needed to test these hypotheses. The intracellular formation of cholesteryl esters catalyzed by the action of the enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT; EC2.3.1.26)1 appears to be nearly ubiqitous in mammalian cells (1Billheimer J.T. Gillies P.J. Esfahani M. Swaney J.B. Advances in Cholesterol Research. Telford Press, Caldwell, NJ1990: 7-45Google Scholar). Elucidation of the details of the structure and catalytic mechanism of ACAT and of the regulation of its activity have been stymied by the difficulty in isolating and purifying an active form of this membrane-associated enzyme.

The mRNA for this ACAT is expressed in most human tissues and cDNAs with nearly identical ACAT sequences have likewise been found in a variety of tissues from mouse, hamster, and rabbit (3Uelmen P.J.

The majority of cholesterol absorbed from the intestinal lumen by the mucosal cell is esterified by ACAT (7Purdy B.H. Field F.J.

Haines J. Sawyer J.K. Shah R. Wilson M.S. Carr T.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One possible explanation was that the hepatic ACAT enzyme that catalyzed the formation of the cholesteryl esters of lipoproteins was different from the enzyme that catalyzed the formation of cholesteryl esters of intracellular lipid droplets. In any case, an important role for hepatic ACAT in the development of coronary artery atherosclerosis was indicated. Conceptually, the presence of various forms of ACAT differentially distributed in tissues and conceivably present in separate cellular compartments is consistent with the increasing evidence for multiple roles of sterol esterification in cholesterol metabolism. The possibility that more than one ACAT enzyme is present in at least some tissues of mammalian species was highlighted by the mouse knockout experiment showing that disruption of the ACAT gene analog to the human ACAT gene cloned by Chang et al. (2Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

However, the downstream events from the caspase-3(-like) protease activation to death of cells are still unclear. Previously, we reported that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was generated by the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases in the process of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in human small cell lung carcinoma Ms-1 cells. In the present study, we examined whether generation of H2O2 is a critical event for the apoptotic pathway downstream of caspase-3(-like) protease activation by various anticancer drugs. Anticancer drugs such as camptothecin, vinblastine, inostamycin, and adriamycin induced activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases and apoptosis. Generation of H2O2 was commonly detected after treatment with each of the four anticancer drugs, and scavenging of H2O2 caused cells to fail to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, anticancer drug-induced H2O2 production was inhibited not only by an inhibitor of caspase-3(-like) proteases but also by diphenyleneiodonium chloride, an inhibitor of flavonoid-containing enzymes such as NADPH oxidase. However, activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases was not inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium chloride. These findings suggest that activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases by various anticancer drugs causes generation of H2O2 presumably through the activation of NADPH oxidase, thereby inducing apoptosis.

A family of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE)1 cysteine proteases (now called caspases) are clearly activated in apoptosis and appear to be required for certain aspects of apoptosis. Among them, caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/apopain)-like proteases are responsible for the cleavage of some substrates at the onset of apoptosis. With the developing understanding of mechanisms regulating apoptosis, it is becoming increasingly clear that a number of cytotoxic stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents, operate through similar mechanisms. Indeed, some of the insight into mechanisms regulating apoptosis has come from the examination of chemotherapy-induced death. It now appears that many inducers of cell death, ultimately converge on the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases, which then appear to launch the terminal and execution stages of apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 5Hannun Y.A.

Several lines of evidence support a role for ROS as a mediator of apoptosis. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment caused apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M.

In addition, H2O2 scavengers, such asN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), could inhibit transforming growth factor β1-, tumor necrosis factor-α-, and growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis (17Hockenbery D.M.

Furthermore, p53-mediated apoptosis was also inhibited by the treatment with diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of flavonoid-containing enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (23Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). Moreover, we reported that erbstatin-induced apoptosis was inhibited by NAC and GSH (24Simizu S. Imoto M. Masuda N. Takada M. Umezawa K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4978-4982PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ROS might play a critical role in apoptosis. Although the signaling pathway leading to ROS production has remained unclear, we previously reported that the generation of intracellular H2O2 was modulated by the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases during tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells (25Simizu S. Umezawa K. Takada M. Arber N. Imoto M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to ascertain whether generation of H2O2 by caspase-3(-like) proteases was unique to tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis and to SCLC cells. In this report, we demonstrate that anticancer agents including camptothecin, vinblastine, inostamycin, and adriamycin induced caspase-3(-like) protease activation, H2O2production, and DNA fragmentation in both SCLC and leukemia cells. Furthermore, the drug-induced H2O2 production was inhibited by the treatment with an inhibitor of caspase-3, thus suggesting that the production of H2O2 is involved in anticancer drug-induced apoptosis via caspase-3(-like) protease activation.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that H2O2generation was a common event in the process of apoptosis induced by physiological concentrations of camptothecin, vinblastine, inostamycin, and adriamycin and that scavenging of H2O2production caused cells to fail to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 2,A and B). These results suggest that the generation of H2O2 is involved in apoptosis induced by various anticancer drugs irrespective of their mode of action. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that anticancer drug-induced H2O2 generation is a consequence of the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases, which occurs independent of the cell type (Figs. 5 and 7 D). These observations are consistent with our previous findings that tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis required H2O2 generation via caspase-3(-like) protease activation not only in Ms-1 cells but also in another SCLC line, Ms-13 cells, and in non- SCLC Ma-44 cells (24Simizu S. Imoto M. Masuda N. Takada M. Umezawa K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4978-4982PubMed Google Scholar, 25Simizu S. Umezawa K. Takada M. Arber N. Imoto M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These findings are also consistent with other findings. 1) ROS production was observed during Fas-mediated apoptosis, which production was eliminated by a caspase inhibitor (35Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), and 2) activation of caspases and ROS production were sequential events in K+ deprivation-induced apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons (36Schulz J.B. Weller M. Klockgether T. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4696-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the accumulated data reveal that H2O2 generation appears to be one of critical events for apoptosis that occurs downstream of caspase-3(-like) protease activation in many types of cells.We also found that inhibition of NADPH oxidase by DPI suppressed not only anticancer drug-induced apoptosis but also anticancer drug-induced H2O2 production in both SCLC cells and leukemia cells (Figs. 6, A and B, and 7, A and D). These results indicate that NADPH oxidase acts upstream of H2O2 generation during anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, NADPH oxidase acts downstream of caspase-3 action, because DPI does not inhibit anticancer drug-induced caspase-3 activation as determined by the cleavage of PARP (data not shown). Our previous results indicated that activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were not changed during tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis under the conditions where caspase-3(-like) proteases were activated and H2O2 was produced (24Simizu S. Imoto M. Masuda N. Takada M. Umezawa K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4978-4982PubMed Google Scholar, 25Simizu S. Umezawa K. Takada M. Arber N. Imoto M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that anticancer drug-induced generation of H2O2is mediated by NADPH oxidase, which is activated by caspase-3(-like) proteases.How do caspase-3(-like) proteases activate NADPH oxidase? Although the targets for proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3(-like) proteases have been identified, the role of individual targets in mediating particular apoptotic events remains ill defined. Therefore, the precise mechanism of NADPH oxidase activation mediated by caspase-3(-like) proteases is not fully understood at present. Nevertheless, two possible mechanisms have been proposed. NADPH oxidase is a highly regulated membrane-bound enzyme complex that is composed of a number of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins (37DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Translocation is initiated by a series of highly regulated signaling events, including phosphorylation of one or more of the NADPH oxidase protein components, resulting in assembly of the active complex. Activated Rac (GTP-bound form) is an indispensable component of NADPH oxidase activation. In cells, Rac is complexed with a guanosine nucleotide exchange factor known as Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (Rho GDI), and it has been suggested that Rho GDI functions in part to keep Rac in a soluble, GDP-bound form. Rac dissociates from Rho GDI, and Rac subsequently translocates to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing the activity of the NADPH oxidase. Recent studies of a direct link between Rho GDI and caspase-3 provides a possible clue. D4-GDI, a hematopoietic Rho GDI, is a substrate of caspase-3 and is cleaved during apoptosis in Jurkat cells (9Na S. Chuang T.H. Cunningham A. Turi T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase inhibitors abrogate coordinately D4-GDI cleavage and apoptosis (9Na S. Chuang T.H. Cunningham A. Turi T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases cleaves Rho GDI, leading to Rac activation during apoptosis, thereby allowing NADPH oxidase activation in hematopoietic cells. Indeed, transgenic mice that express constitutively activated forms of Rac2 showed enhanced apoptosis in their thymus (38Lores P. Morin L. Luna R. Gacon G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent results indicated that ROS generation might be regulated by Rac in fibroblasts (39Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Solott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldscmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) and T cell lines (40Brenner B. Gulbins E. Schlottmann K. Koppenhoefer U. Busch G.L. Walzog B. Steinhausen M. Coggeshall K.M. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15376-15381Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rac-dependent pathways seem likely to be involved in caspase-3(-like) protease-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase during apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs. Another possibility is the involvement of protein kinases in caspase-mediated NADPH oxidase activation. PKC δ and θ and PAK2 are known to be cleaved and activated by caspases during apoptosis (11Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H.

Commun. 1992; 187: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylated p47 is absolutely required for NADPH oxidase activity, it is likely that anticancer drug-induced caspase activation results in cleavage and activation of PKC δ, PKC θ, or PAK2, which then phosphorylates p47, which in turn activates NADPH oxidase.The biochemical mechanism underlying H2O2-mediated apoptosis following the treatment with various anticancer drugs remains to be elucidated. Recently, caspase-activated DNase and its inhibitor, CAD and ICAD, respectively, were cloned by Nagata et al. (15Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar, 16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). CAD and ICAD are expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, and CAD contains a nuclear-localization signal (15Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar, 16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Active caspase-3 can cleave ICAD, which probably releases CAD from ICAD. Thus, CAD translocates to nucleus and hydrolyzes nuclear DNA. This mechanism is very similar to that used by the NF-κB system (45Verma L. Stevenson J. Schwarz E. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 46Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar); NF-κB is kept as a complex with IκB in the cytoplasm until various stimuli activate a kinase cascade that leads to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB. The degraded IκB dissociates from NF-κB, and the latter then enters the nucleus to activate or repress the expression of various genes. Interestingly, previous studies have suggested that the activation of NF-κB may be redox-dependent (47Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.-A. Aillet F. Virelizier J.-L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3386-3393PubMed Google Scholar, 48Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 49Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In particular, exogenous H2O2 stimulates NF-κB, whereas chemical antioxidants inhibit the activation of NF-κB by a variety of exogenous stimuli. Taken together with the similarity of the activation mechanism between NF-κB and CAD, although we do not have any evidence that CAD activation is redox-dependent, it is possible that H2O2 generated by caspase-3(-like) protease activation participates, at least in part, in the full activation and/or translocation to the nucleus of CAD released by caspase-3-mediated degradation of ICAD. However, apoptosis could be induced under very low oxygen conditions (52Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 53Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Further studies are necessary to determine whether caspases are activated under hypoxia conditions.Anthracyclines, such as adriamycin and daunomycin, are one of the most active antitumor agents used in clinical oncology. It has been documented that anthracyclines induce membrane alterations through lipid peroxidation; generate ROS due to electron transfer from the semiquinone ring; intercalate into nuclear DNA, in turn inhibiting macromolecular synthesis; and interact with topoisomerase II, leading to covalent binding of these enzymes to DNA and subsequent DNA breaks (54Epstein R.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 1990; 8: 2062-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is difficult to define which mechanism induced by adriamycin is responsible for apoptosis. In the present study, we show that NAC inhibited the adriamycin-induced caspase-3(-like) protease activation, but not adriamycin-induced RNA synthesis inhibition (Figs. 3 B and 4 D). Furthermore, Ms-1 cells are relatively resistant to etoposide, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (data not shown), possibly due to decreased expression of topoisomerase II, as seen in many etoposide-resistant SCLC cells (55Jian N. Lam Y.M. Pym J. Campling B.G. Cancer. 1996; 77: 1797-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that adriamycin-induced apoptosis may not be due to the inhibition of topoisomerase II. Taken together, it seems that ROS generation rather than the inhibition of topoisomerase II or RNA synthesis is responsible for the adriamycin-induced activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases.In summary, although the mechanisms for the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases would depend on each drug, NADPH oxidase activation and subsequent H2O2 generation appear to be a common apoptotic pathway downstream of caspase-3(-like) proteases. Furthermore, H2O2 may serve as a major mediator for anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in several types of cells. Apoptosis is a fundamental biochemical cell death pathway for normal tissue homeostasis, cellular differentiation, and development within a multicellular organism (for review, see Refs. 1Nicholson D.W.

Indeed, some of the insight into mechanisms regulating apoptosis has come from the examination of chemotherapy-induced death. It now appears that many inducers of cell death, ultimately converge on the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases, which then appear to launch the terminal and execution stages of apoptosis (for review, see Ref. 5Hannun Y.A.

Oxidative stress occurs in cells when there is an imbalance between the rate of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and removal of ROS. Several lines of evidence support a role for ROS as a mediator of apoptosis. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment caused apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.-M.

Although the signaling pathway leading to ROS production has remained unclear, we previously reported that the generation of intracellular H2O2 was modulated by the activation of caspase-3(-like) proteases during tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cells (25Simizu S.

Thus, we decided to ascertain whether generation of H2O2 by caspase-3(-like) proteases was unique to tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis and to SCLC cells.

VEGF1 is an important vascular permeability and EC proliferation/survival factor, stimulating many of the steps leading to angiogenesis (1Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Peruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S.

VEGF binds and signals through several transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, including Flk-1 (KDR) and Flt-1 (3Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flk-1 is probably necessary for VEGF-induced EC proliferation, but signaling through Flt-1 also contributes to biological actions of VEGF on both EC and nonendothelial cells (4Clauss M. Weich H.

The importance of VEGF-induced signaling is demonstrated in that genetic inactivation of either receptor leads to a complete lack of development of blood vessels in the embryo, and inactivation of Flk-1 function dramatically impairs the growth of cancer cells in vivo (5Shalaby F.

KDR activation assembles Shc-Grb2-Nck complexes, transmitting activating signals to the MAP kinase ERK through incompletely defined pathways (10Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that VEGF can stimulate ERK-dependent proliferation in cells transfected to express KDR (10Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). VEGF signaling to the c-Jun mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK) has also been demonstrated (11Liu Z.Y. Ganju R.K. Wang J.F. Ona M.A. Hatch W.C. Zheng T. Avraham S. Gill P. Groopman J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, cell biologic functions of VEGF or other growth factors, resulting from interactions between members of the MAP kinase family remain largely undefined.To delineate the role of the MAP kinases in VEGF function, we assessed the activation of ERK and JNK in primary cultures of bovine aortic EC. We found that VEGF-induced ERK was necessary and sufficient for rapid JNK activation and that both MAP kinases mediated the cell proliferation effects of VEGF, although JNK was the more important final effector. We addressed the mechanism of this communication and determined novel targets for MAP kinase cross-talk, essential to the angiogenesis-promoting actions of VEGF.DISCUSSIONWe have examined the signal transduction enacted by VEGF that may contribute to its angiogenic role (1Senger D.R.

Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar), specifically to the stimulation of EC proliferation. This is a relatively early and important step in the process of new blood vessel formation, and the essential contributions of the VEGF receptors Flk (KDR) and Flt-1 to this multistep process have been demonstrated through embryonic gene inactivation studies (5Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar, 6Fong G-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L.

Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). We report here that VEGF stimulates a potent and rapid increase in ERK activation that precedes the still rapid onset of increased JNK activity. We further showed that VEGF-induced ERK is required for JNK activation and that this occurs through ERK activating JNK kinases, including SEK-1. The importance of this MAP kinase cross-activation was demonstrated in that both ERK and JNK are required for VEGF-induced EC proliferation. The general importance of ERK in this setting has been established recently (10Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Unanticipated was our finding that JNK is the final mediator for ERK to stimulate cell proliferation, underlying the response to VEGF;i.e. JNK, not ERK, action appears directly responsible for the majority of VEGF-induced proliferation. The role of ERK is mainly to induce the activation of JNK when activated by an EC growth factor such as VEGF. Our identified role of JNK and the importance of ERK/JNK cross-activation is specifically seen for the stimulation of important G1 cell cycle events that lead to progression to S phase (DNA synthesis).The rapid cross-activation of JNK by ERK in the setting of growth factor stimulation of EC is a novel, but perhaps cell context-specific finding. Limited reported investigations in transfected cell lines and occasional primary cells have not correlated or shown ERK-induced activation of JNK (reviewed in Refs. 38Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar and 39Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). It is appreciated that ERK often mediates a transmembrane signal to the transcription of an autologous growth factor, which is then secreted, binds cell membrane receptors, and enacts autocrine JNK activation. However, this process requires several hours, and indirectly involves ERK activation of JNK. The JNK pathway was initially proposed to mediate cytokine and stress pathway-induced apoptosis (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 40Chen Y-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), where ERK was often not induced. Consistent with this idea, we found that inhibition of ERK had no effect on UV irradiation-induced JNK activity in the EC.It has been more recently appreciated that various growth factor receptors stimulate both ERK and JNK (41Minden A.

ERK is essential for induced cell division (45Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 46Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and although the role of JNK is less well defined, c-Jun is necessary for fibroblast proliferation, perhaps as one substrate for Ras and JNK-related signaling (47Clark G.J. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1677-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Here, we found that many EC growth factors, both of the tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled varieties, activate JNK through ERK cross-talk. Thus, it is likely that the activation of both MAP kinases is necessary for specific cell biologic actions induced by a variety of EC growth factors. We have recently found that inhibition of ERK or JNK activation stimulated by bFGF also inhibits EC proliferation induced by this growth factor. 2A. Pedram, M. Razandi, and E. R. Levin, unpublished observations.However, the interactive roles for each MAP kinase are not well understood in the context of cell proliferation. Previously, activated Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 were found to promote cell cycle progression through G1 and activate JNK (but not ERK). Hence, activation of signaling through the JNK pathway possibly contributes to cell cycle progression in that model (50Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). This might occur upstream of JNK as well, since Rho-activated PAK1 phosphorylates MEK-1 and probably contributes to growth factor signaling to the nucleus (51Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We found that VEGF stimulation of ERK induces JNK activation, which serves as a primary effector for ERK (i.e.increasing cyclin D1 synthesis) but may also augment the ERK signal to substrates such as Elk-1 (52Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 53Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In other contexts, however, the signals diverge, and ERK opposes JNK-induced apoptosis. This may reflect contributions from additional signaling molecules, activated in cell- or stimulus-specific fashion. In preliminary studies, we found that VEGF inhibited, while UV irradiation activated, p38 MAP kinase activity in EC, while both stimulated JNK activity.2 This differential effect on p38 probably contributes to VEGF-stimulated production of cyclin D1 and cell cycle progression, since this MAP kinase inhibits cyclin D1 transcription (54Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Also, in our model, activation of Cdk4 by ERK/JNK occurs earlier than cyclin D1 synthesis and perhaps occurs directly, since Cdk4 contains a minimal consensus phosphorylation site for these MAP kinases. This would create recognition sites for proteins such as Pin1, further modifying the structure and hence the activity of Cdk4 (55Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which ERK induces JNK is of interest. We showed that ERK cannot directly phosphorylate JNK, but rather VEGF (or ERK in the absence of VEGF) can increase the activity of this kinase via JNK kinase stimulation. This was shown using the dominant negative SEK-1 construct, implicating this kinase in the signal transduction pathway for ERK to JNK. This could occur by dominant negative SEK interfering with upstream kinase phosphorylation/activation of endogenous SEK-1 by members of the MAP kinase kinase or mixed lineage kinase families or various other kinases that have been shown in some cells to activate SEK-1 (reviewed in Ref. 56Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). This pathway would probably originate from the activation of further upstream signaling molecules, a challenge for additional investigation. Alternatively, the dominant negative SEK-1 could titrate endogenous JNK-1, not allowing access to wild type SEK-1 or other JNK-kinases. The incomplete inhibition of VEGF or ERK-triggered JNK probably reflects incomplete transfection/expression of dominant negative SEK-1, but it also points out that other JNK-kinases such as JNK kinase-2 (32Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) could contribute to this ERK-initiated pathway to JNK. In addition, the inhibition by dominant negative SEK-1 of p38 activation (32Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) could modify the ERK-JNK interaction. Based upon expression of wild type Jip-1 in the EC, we conclude that the translocation of activated JNK to the nucleus is critical for the proliferation-enhancing effects of ERK.Rapid onset and brief ERK expression underlies cell proliferation, while prolonged activation of ERK has been observed during cell differentiation (57Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It is likely that cross-talk between members of the MAP kinase family contributes to the decision by a cell to divide or terminally differentiate. For instance, in some cells, JNK stimulates ERK-directed phosphatase synthesis (MKP-1), which could limit the duration and perhaps magnitude of ERK activation (58Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, we found that dominant negative SEK-1, JNK-1, or wild type Jip-1 expression did not affect the magnitude or duration of VEGF stimulation of ERK activity.2 In the EC, various growth factors were found to enact ERK/JNK cross-activation. Therefore, many of the angiogenesis-inducing effects of VEGF or other vascular growth factors may result from currently unappreciated MAP kinase interactions. It is also possible that other primary cells may demonstrate MAP kinase cross-talk leading to essential cell functions.In summary, a novel rapid cross-activation of JNK by ERK is crucial to the ability of VEGF and probably other EC growth factors to enact cell proliferation, contributing to angiogenesis. Surprisingly, it is not the direct, nuclear action of ERK, but rather that of JNK, which leads to cell cycle progression and proliferation. It is also likely that there are additional targets for activation by growth factors that require ERK/JNK cross-talk and that lead to progression through the cell cycle. Identifying these endogenous proteins and mechanisms of regulation will provide new understanding as to how cytoplasmic signaling ultimately modulates critical nuclear events. VEGF1 is an important vascular permeability and EC proliferation/survival factor, stimulating many of the steps leading to angiogenesis (1Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Peruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 2Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar). VEGF binds and signals through several transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, including Flk-1 (KDR) and Flt-1 (3Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flk-1 is probably necessary for VEGF-induced EC proliferation, but signaling through Flt-1 also contributes to biological actions of VEGF on both EC and nonendothelial cells (4Clauss M. Weich H.

The importance of VEGF-induced signaling is demonstrated in that genetic inactivation of either receptor leads to a complete lack of development of blood vessels in the embryo, and inactivation of Flk-1 function dramatically impairs the growth of cancer cells in vivo (5Shalaby F.

KDR activation assembles Shc-Grb2-Nck complexes, transmitting activating signals to the MAP kinase ERK through incompletely defined pathways (10Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that VEGF can stimulate ERK-dependent proliferation in cells transfected to express KDR (10Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). VEGF signaling to the c-Jun mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK) has also been demonstrated (11Liu Z.Y. Ganju R.K. Wang J.F. Ona M.A. Hatch W.C. Zheng T. Avraham S. Gill P. Groopman J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, cell biologic functions of VEGF or other growth factors, resulting from interactions between members of the MAP kinase family remain largely undefined. To delineate the role of the MAP kinases in VEGF function, we assessed the activation of ERK and JNK in primary cultures of bovine aortic EC. We found that VEGF-induced ERK was necessary and sufficient for rapid JNK activation and that both MAP kinases mediated the cell proliferation effects of VEGF, although JNK was the more important final effector. We addressed the mechanism of this communication and determined novel targets for MAP kinase cross-talk, essential to the angiogenesis-promoting actions of VEGF. DISCUSSIONWe have examined the signal transduction enacted by VEGF that may contribute to its angiogenic role (1Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Peruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F.

Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar), specifically to the stimulation of EC proliferation. This is a relatively early and important step in the process of new blood vessel formation, and the essential contributions of the VEGF receptors Flk (KDR) and Flt-1 to this multistep process have been demonstrated through embryonic gene inactivation studies (5Shalaby F.

Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). We report here that VEGF stimulates a potent and rapid increase in ERK activation that precedes the still rapid onset of increased JNK activity. We further showed that VEGF-induced ERK is required for JNK activation and that this occurs through ERK activating JNK kinases, including SEK-1. The importance of this MAP kinase cross-activation was demonstrated in that both ERK and JNK are required for VEGF-induced EC proliferation. The general importance of ERK in this setting has been established recently (10Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Unanticipated was our finding that JNK is the final mediator for ERK to stimulate cell proliferation, underlying the response to VEGF;i.e. JNK, not ERK, action appears directly responsible for the majority of VEGF-induced proliferation. The role of ERK is mainly to induce the activation of JNK when activated by an EC growth factor such as VEGF. Our identified role of JNK and the importance of ERK/JNK cross-activation is specifically seen for the stimulation of important G1 cell cycle events that lead to progression to S phase (DNA synthesis).The rapid cross-activation of JNK by ERK in the setting of growth factor stimulation of EC is a novel, but perhaps cell context-specific finding. Limited reported investigations in transfected cell lines and occasional primary cells have not correlated or shown ERK-induced activation of JNK (reviewed in Refs. 38Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar and 39Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). It is appreciated that ERK often mediates a transmembrane signal to the transcription of an autologous growth factor, which is then secreted, binds cell membrane receptors, and enacts autocrine JNK activation. However, this process requires several hours, and indirectly involves ERK activation of JNK. The JNK pathway was initially proposed to mediate cytokine and stress pathway-induced apoptosis (24Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 40Chen Y-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), where ERK was often not induced. Consistent with this idea, we found that inhibition of ERK had no effect on UV irradiation-induced JNK activity in the EC.It has been more recently appreciated that various growth factor receptors stimulate both ERK and JNK (41Minden A.

ERK is essential for induced cell division (45Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 46Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and although the role of JNK is less well defined, c-Jun is necessary for fibroblast proliferation, perhaps as one substrate for Ras and JNK-related signaling (47Clark G.J. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1677-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 48Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Here, we found that many EC growth factors, both of the tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled varieties, activate JNK through ERK cross-talk. Thus, it is likely that the activation of both MAP kinases is necessary for specific cell biologic actions induced by a variety of EC growth factors. We have recently found that inhibition of ERK or JNK activation stimulated by bFGF also inhibits EC proliferation induced by this growth factor. 2A. Pedram, M. Razandi, and E. R. Levin, unpublished observations.However, the interactive roles for each MAP kinase are not well understood in the context of cell proliferation. Previously, activated Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 were found to promote cell cycle progression through G1 and activate JNK (but not ERK). Hence, activation of signaling through the JNK pathway possibly contributes to cell cycle progression in that model (50Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). This might occur upstream of JNK as well, since Rho-activated PAK1 phosphorylates MEK-1 and probably contributes to growth factor signaling to the nucleus (51Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We found that VEGF stimulation of ERK induces JNK activation, which serves as a primary effector for ERK (i.e.increasing cyclin D1 synthesis) but may also augment the ERK signal to substrates such as Elk-1 (52Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 53Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In other contexts, however, the signals diverge, and ERK opposes JNK-induced apoptosis. This may reflect contributions from additional signaling molecules, activated in cell- or stimulus-specific fashion. In preliminary studies, we found that VEGF inhibited, while UV irradiation activated, p38 MAP kinase activity in EC, while both stimulated JNK activity.2 This differential effect on p38 probably contributes to VEGF-stimulated production of cyclin D1 and cell cycle progression, since this MAP kinase inhibits cyclin D1 transcription (54Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Also, in our model, activation of Cdk4 by ERK/JNK occurs earlier than cyclin D1 synthesis and perhaps occurs directly, since Cdk4 contains a minimal consensus phosphorylation site for these MAP kinases. This would create recognition sites for proteins such as Pin1, further modifying the structure and hence the activity of Cdk4 (55Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which ERK induces JNK is of interest. We showed that ERK cannot directly phosphorylate JNK, but rather VEGF (or ERK in the absence of VEGF) can increase the activity of this kinase via JNK kinase stimulation. This was shown using the dominant negative SEK-1 construct, implicating this kinase in the signal transduction pathway for ERK to JNK. This could occur by dominant negative SEK interfering with upstream kinase phosphorylation/activation of endogenous SEK-1 by members of the MAP kinase kinase or mixed lineage kinase families or various other kinases that have been shown in some cells to activate SEK-1 (reviewed in Ref. 56Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). This pathway would probably originate from the activation of further upstream signaling molecules, a challenge for additional investigation. Alternatively, the dominant negative SEK-1 could titrate endogenous JNK-1, not allowing access to wild type SEK-1 or other JNK-kinases. The incomplete inhibition of VEGF or ERK-triggered JNK probably reflects incomplete transfection/expression of dominant negative SEK-1, but it also points out that other JNK-kinases such as JNK kinase-2 (32Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) could contribute to this ERK-initiated pathway to JNK. In addition, the inhibition by dominant negative SEK-1 of p38 activation (32Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) could modify the ERK-JNK interaction. Based upon expression of wild type Jip-1 in the EC, we conclude that the translocation of activated JNK to the nucleus is critical for the proliferation-enhancing effects of ERK.Rapid onset and brief ERK expression underlies cell proliferation, while prolonged activation of ERK has been observed during cell differentiation (57Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It is likely that cross-talk between members of the MAP kinase family contributes to the decision by a cell to divide or terminally differentiate. For instance, in some cells, JNK stimulates ERK-directed phosphatase synthesis (MKP-1), which could limit the duration and perhaps magnitude of ERK activation (58Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Templeton D.J. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, we found that dominant negative SEK-1, JNK-1, or wild type Jip-1 expression did not affect the magnitude or duration of VEGF stimulation of ERK activity.2 In the EC, various growth factors were found to enact ERK/JNK cross-activation. Therefore, many of the angiogenesis-inducing effects of VEGF or other vascular growth factors may result from currently unappreciated MAP kinase interactions. It is also possible that other primary cells may demonstrate MAP kinase cross-talk leading to essential cell functions.In summary, a novel rapid cross-activation of JNK by ERK is crucial to the ability of VEGF and probably other EC growth factors to enact cell proliferation, contributing to angiogenesis. Surprisingly, it is not the direct, nuclear action of ERK, but rather that of JNK, which leads to cell cycle progression and proliferation. It is also likely that there are additional targets for activation by growth factors that require ERK/JNK cross-talk and that lead to progression through the cell cycle. Identifying these endogenous proteins and mechanisms of regulation will provide new understanding as to how cytoplasmic signaling ultimately modulates critical nuclear events. We have examined the signal transduction enacted by VEGF that may contribute to its angiogenic role (1Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Peruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F.

https://openalex.org/W2068884283,"Oxidative stress interferes with several cellular functions, in particular transcriptional regulation. We show here that the human cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is down-regulated at the transcriptional level by oxidative stress. Basal as well as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dioxin-induced promoter activities are strongly impaired by H2O2 treatment or glutathione depletion with l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine. Tumor necrosis factor α inhibits CYP1A1 expression, and this inhibition is prevented by the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. We show that these regulations depend on the integrity of the nuclear factor 1 (NFI) site located in the proximal promoter. We therefore examined the redox regulation of this transcription factor. Treatment of human HepG2 or rat H4 hepatoma cells with H2O2 orl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine inactivates the binding of the NFI transcription factor to its DNA consensus sequence. Furthermore, H2O2 treatment leads to a dose-dependent decrease of reporter gene expressions driven by promoters containing NFI binding sites. Glutathione depletion and catalase inhibition also repress a NFI-driven promoter. Under the same conditions, the CP-1 transcription factor activity is not affected by oxidative stress. Thus, NFI seems particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. This accounts, at least partially, for the regulation of cyp1A1 gene expression. Oxidative stress interferes with several cellular functions, in particular transcriptional regulation. We show here that the human cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is down-regulated at the transcriptional level by oxidative stress. Basal as well as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dioxin-induced promoter activities are strongly impaired by H2O2 treatment or glutathione depletion with l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine. Tumor necrosis factor α inhibits CYP1A1 expression, and this inhibition is prevented by the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. We show that these regulations depend on the integrity of the nuclear factor 1 (NFI) site located in the proximal promoter. We therefore examined the redox regulation of this transcription factor. Treatment of human HepG2 or rat H4 hepatoma cells with H2O2 orl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine inactivates the binding of the NFI transcription factor to its DNA consensus sequence. Furthermore, H2O2 treatment leads to a dose-dependent decrease of reporter gene expressions driven by promoters containing NFI binding sites. Glutathione depletion and catalase inhibition also repress a NFI-driven promoter. Under the same conditions, the CP-1 transcription factor activity is not affected by oxidative stress. Thus, NFI seems particularly sensitive to oxidative stress. This accounts, at least partially, for the regulation of cyp1A1 gene expression. cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dioxine l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine tumor necrosis factor-α aryl hydrocarbon nuclear factor 1 electrophoretic mobility shift assay chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAAT transcription factor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are drug-metabolizing enzymes that play a major role in the detoxification and elimination of hydrophobic xenobiotics. Paradoxically, these enzymes also generate reactive metabolites, among them mutagens (1Kadlubar F. Hammons G. Guengerich F.P. Mammalian Cytochromes P450. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 81-130Google Scholar). CYP1A1 is a ubiquitous member of the P450 superfamily that belongs to the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) inducible gene battery. It is highly inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-p-dioxine (TCDD) and by planar aromatic hydrocarbons such as 3-methylcholanthrene or benzo(a)pyrene. The Ah receptor, once activated by such compounds, translocates into the nucleus, heterodimerizes with Arnt (Ah receptor nuclear translocator), and binds to a DNA sequence called the xenobiotic-responsive element. Extensive studies on the murine cyp1A1 gene have shown that this regulation involves a cross-talk between enhancer and promoter sequences with changes in the chromatin structure (2Whitlock J.P. Okino S.T. Dong L. Ko H. Clarke-Katzenberg R. Ma Q. Li H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A nuclear factor 1 (NFI) binding site was shown to be critical for the activity of this promoter (3Jones K. Whitlock J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5098-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The 5′ upstream region of the human cyp1A1gene contains several xenobiotic-responsive elements mediating the Ah response, a negative regulatory element (4Boucher P. Piechocki M. Hines R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5144-5151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and a proximal promoter containing a NFI site. The activity of several cytochromes P450 including CYP1A1 is altered in vivo during inflammation. Some cytokines down-regulate cytochrome P450 activity levels in human hepatocytes (5Abdel-Razzak Z. Corcos L. Fautrel A. Campion J.-P. Guillouzo A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1100-1110PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, H2O2 was shown to down-regulate CYP1A1 mRNA level in rat hepatocytes (6Barker C.W. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3985-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in this regulation were unknown, which led us to study the effect of oxidative stress on the humancyp1A1 promoter activity. Oxidative stress plays an important role in cell regulation (7Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Several studies show its role as a positive regulator of some early alert genes such as GADD153 (8Guyton K. Xu Q. Holbrook N. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and antioxidant enzymes (see Ref. 9Pinkus R. Weiner L. Daniel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13422-13429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar and references therein) via the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (reviewed in Ref. 10Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar) or the antioxidant-responsive element sequence (11Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress causes a modification of the intracellular redox status and can chemically affect redox-sensitive moieties such as sulfhydryl groups. Any protein containing strategic cysteine residues may undergo functional alterations that will largely depend upon its conformation and the residues' redox potentials. Several in vitro studies have shown that the DNA binding ability of various transcription factors could be modified by oxidative reagents: AP-1, NF-κB, Sp1, MTF-1, USF, p53, Egr-1, and Ets (for a review and references, see Ref. 12Sun V. Oberley L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The oxidation or alkylation of a thiol group located in the DNA binding domain may alter the DNA-protein interaction because of steric hindrance or lack of hydrogen bond. In addition, the variation of the intracellular redox status affects disulfide bridges and metal ion coordination (13Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the oxidation of a cysteine even not located in the DNA binding domain can result in a conformational change of the protein or influence its dimerization, which will greatly affect its DNA binding ability or its transactivating function (14Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar,15Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Yet, in vitro studies are not sufficient to prove that a transcription factor activity is modified by oxidative stress within the cell. An alternative mechanism for the regulation of transcription factors by oxidative stress is the modification of enzyme activities involved in signal transduction. For example, kinase or phosphatase activities have been shown to be modulated by H2O2 (16Mendelson K. Contois L. Terosain S. Davis R. Paulson E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 18Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Since some transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB, c-Jun, Ets, and Sp1) are targets of such enzymes (20Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. Al Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunder T. Brenner D. Karin M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), this may be critical for transcriptional control. Here, we report for the first time that NFI activity is redox-regulatedin vivo and that this regulation strongly affects CYP1A1 expression. NFI plays an important role in viral (23Archer T. Lefebvre P. Wolford R. Hager G. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and cellular gene regulation. It was originally described as a factor required for the replication of adenovirus DNA (24Gronostajski R.M. Nagata K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 81: 4013-4017Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was then shown to be part of a family of ubiquitous transcription factors encoded by four different genes (NFI A, NFI B, NFI C/CTF, and NFI X) that bind to the TGGC(N)5GCCA DNA consensus sequence after dimerization (25Kruse U. Sippel A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The highly conserved 220 N-terminal residues containing the DNA binding domain are not homologous to any well characterized class of DNA binding domains (26Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NFI is widely involved in the control of constitutive or inducible gene expression. In the liver, it has been shown to be critical for the expression of collagen I (27Anania F. Potter J. Rennie-Tankersley L. Mezey E. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1640-1648PubMed Google Scholar), albumin (28Lichsteiner S. Wuarin J. Schibler U. Cell. 1987; 51: 963-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and aspartate aminotransferase (29Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32629-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and for the specific expression of α-fetoprotein (30Bois-Joyeux B. Danan J.-L. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and vitellogenin (31Cardinaux J.-R. Chapel S. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32947-32956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the NFI family have been reported as possible targets for phosphorylation or glycosylation. Yet, this does not seem to affect their abilities to bind DNA in vitro (26Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NFI family members possess four conserved cysteines (32Novak A. Goyal N. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12986-12990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three of them were critical for DNA binding in vitro, which was abolished by their alkylation or oxidation (26Bandyopadhyay S. Gronostajski R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29949-29955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that NFI could be sensitive to modifications of the redox status within the cell. In this study, we have used hepatoma cell cultures to assess the functional impact of oxidative stress on the binding of NFI to DNA and its transcriptional activity and the consequences for thecyp1A1 gene promoter activity. H2O2 was used from a 30% stock (Merck). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (unless otherwise stated), and oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Belgium) and Genset (Paris, France). Human recombinant TNFα was obtained from Tebu (Le Perray, France). The rat hepatoma cell line H4 II EC3 (33Deschatrette J. Moore E. Weiss M. Cell. 1980; 19: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (34Knowles B.B. Howe C.D. Aden D.P. Science. 1980; 209: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) were maintained as described by Garlatti et al. (29Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32629-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion test. Cells from nonconfluent dishes were trypsinized and resuspended in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 1 ml of colorant (trypan blue 6.2 mm, NaCl 0.8 m) was then added and gently mixed. After 2 min, cells were counted. Viability was expressed as (number of non-blue cells/total number of cells) × 100. Confluent 10-cm dishes were trypsinized. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were centrifuged and then resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and allowed to swell for 15 min. Cells were lysed by adding 1.5% Nonidet P-40 and vortexing for 10 s. After centrifugation (7000 ×g, 1 min) the supernatant could be saved for cytosolic extract analysis and pellets were resuspended in a hypertonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a 15-min incubation, the mixture was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was measured according to the method of Bradford (35Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 × 106cells were harvested and allowed to swell for 15 min (cf. nuclear extract procedure). They were then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The mixture was centrifuged (13,000 × g, 7 min), and the supernatant was assayed for glutathione using the GSH-400 kit from Oxys (Portland, OR). Proteins were assayed according to the method of Bradford (35Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Glutathione levels were normalized to protein content. The NFI and CP-1 probes contained, respectively, a NFI site from adenovirus 2 (5′-TATTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATA-3′) and the CP-1 site from the mouse α-globin gene proximal promoter (−104,−75; 5′-GCCACAAACCAGCCAATGAGTAACTGCTCC-3′). The Duo probe was taken from the human α-globin gene proximal promoter (−88,−58) containing both NFI and CP-1 binding sites (5′-TGTCCCGGGCTCCGCGCCA GCCAATGAGCGCCGGA-3′). Strands were annealed and labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega) and α-[32P]dATP (ICN). Binding reactions were carried out as described previously (29Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32629-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) except for the use of dithiothreitol-free binding buffer. Samples were run in an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer for 100–120 min (260 V/13 cm) at 4 °C. The gels were then dried and autoradiographed. Densitometric studies were performed using NIH Image software (public domain) to quantitate the retarded complexes. A PhosphorImager (Storm; Molecular Dynamics) was used when indicated. Whole cell or nuclear extracts were homogenized by vigorous mixing in loading buffer (62 mmTris, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% (v/v) saturated bromphenol blue) followed by a 5-min boiling. Samples were run at 12 V/cm for 1 h in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by electroblotting (90 mA, 1 h). Blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml antibody for 1 h, washed three times 15 min, and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (50 ng/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was measured with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The rabbit polyclonal nonspecific NFI antibody targeting the N-terminal part was obtained from Tebu (Le Perray, France). Rabbit antibodies raised against NFI/CTF1 and NFI X3 were generous gifts of Drs. N. Tanese (New York University Medical Center) and B. Corthésy (EPFL, Lausane, Switzerland). RNA preparation and Northern blots were performed as already described (36Feilleux-Duché S. Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Hanoune J. Barouki R. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Probes were synthesized from cDNAs with the Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantifications were performed with a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The Firefly and Renilla luciferase expression plasmids (pGL3 basic and pRL-SV40) were purchased from Promega. The pRSV-FL plasmid was a gift from Dr M. Aggerbeck (INSERM, Paris). The pTk-CAT plasmid, a gift from Dr. C. Forest (CNRS, Meudon, France), contains the thymidine kinase gene promoter (−105,+51) of the herpes simplex 1 virus upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Recombinant plasmids were constructed as follows (see Fig. 1 A). The −1566,+73 5′ region of the human cyp1A1 gene (a gift of Dr. Maurel, INSERM, Montpellier, France), was subcloned into theKpnI–HindIII double-digested pGL3 basic vector, upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene to yield p1A1-FL. The pmut1A1-FL is identical to the p1A1-FL except for a double mutation at positions −49 and −50 in the NFI site (GCCA →CGCA). It was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis on p1A1-FL, using a mutated oligonucleotide and the GeneEdit kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A double-stranded oligomer deriving from the 3′-end of the human α-globin gene proximal promoter (−79,+1) was synthesized with point mutations at the bases shown in italics, in order to change Sp1-like binding sites and BglII 5′ and HindIII 3′ ends: 5′-GATCTCCGCACCAGCCAATGAGCGAATTCCGACCGAGGCTTCCCCTGCGTCACAGGTATAAACCCTGACGCACTCACGGACCAGCAC-3′. It was subcloned into the BglII-HindIII double-digested pRL-SV40 vector (thus deprived of the SV40 early promoter) upstream of the Renilla luciferase reporter gene to yield pαglob-RL, which was used as a control in transfection experiments. A NFI site, present in the human α-globin gene promoter upstream of position −79, was not included in this sequence. A double-stranded oligomer containing the rat cyp1A1 gene proximal promoter (−60,+1) was synthesized with XhoI 5′ and HindIII 3′ ends: 5′-GAGAAGGAGGCGTGGCCAACAGACAGTCATATAAAGGTGGTGGTGCCTTCACCCTAACCA-3′. It was subcloned into the XhoI–HindIII double-digested pGL3 basic vector, upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene to yield pNFI/TATA-FL . For pmutNFI/TATA-FL, a similar strategy as for pNFI/TATA-FL was used: 5′-GAGAATGATGCGTGCGCAACAGACAGTCATATAAAGTGGTGTGCCTTCACCCTAACCA-3′. The TriNFI double-stranded oligomer (5′-AGCTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATTGGATTGAAGCCAATATTGGATTGAAGCCAAGA-3′, containing three adjacent NFI consensus sites and HindIII-compatible ends) was subcloned into theHindIII site located in the thymidine kinase promoter of pTk-CAT to give the pTriNFI-CAT plasmid. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing analysis. Transfection experiments were performed in HepG2 cells as described previously (29Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32629-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37Massaad C. Lombès M. Aggerbeck M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Barouki R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These cells were used because the endogenous cyp1A1 gene was regulated by H2O2 (cf. Fig. 2) and because of their excellent transfection efficiency. Briefly, 1 day prior to the transfection, cells (0.5 × 106 cells/5-cm dish) were seeded into the usual culture medium. The CAT plasmids (3 μg of DNA) and the firefly and/or Renilla luciferase expression vectors (3 and 1 μg, respectively) were introduced into the cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique followed by a 2-min glycerol shock. Cells were treated by adding various agents to the culture medium. After an overnight incubation, cells were homogenized for enzymatic assays. The CAT and firefly luciferase activities were determined as described previously (29Garlatti M. Aggerbeck M. Bouguet J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32629-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37Massaad C. Lombès M. Aggerbeck M. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Barouki R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Dual luciferase assay (firefly and Renilla) was performed with a Promega kit.Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize the transfection efficiency in all culture dishes (38De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. Deluca M. Helsinki D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Blanks were obtained by assaying CAT or luciferase activity in mock-transfected cells. The experiments described above have been performed using an internal control for transfection. In initial assays, we tested several promoters commonly used for this purpose. We noticed that some of those promoters, particularly SV40, were sensitive to even moderate amounts of H2O2 (Fig. 1 B) and thus cannot be used as internal controls. During the study of the effect of H2O2 on several transcription factors, we found that CP-1 was not sensitive to such a treatment. 2Y. Morel and R. Barouki, unpublished observations. We therefore synthesized the plasmid pαglob-RL, which contains a promoter derived from the proximal part of the human α-globin gene promoter upstream of the Renilla luciferase reporter gene. This promoter consists of a CP-1 site and a TATA box and is insensitive to the H2O2 concentrations used here (Fig. 1 B). Neumann-Kheuls and Student's two-tailedt tests were performed using analysis of variance software (PLC Inc.). In both human HepG2 and rat H4 hepatoma cells, TCDD increased CYP1A1 mRNAs. The level of CYP1A1 mRNA in cells treated with TCDD is dramatically reduced by prior treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 2). The use of l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine synthase (39Michiels C. Remacle J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which causes a strong decrease of the intracellular GSH pool (cf. Table I), also caused a down-regulation. The basal levels were weak. This effect was more potent in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 than in the rat hepatoma H4.Table IGlutathione assay following H2O2 or BSO treatmentControlH2O2BSOGSH (%)10055 ± 9.225 ± 7.6H4 cell cultures were treated with either 2 mmH2O2 for 1 h or with 50 μm for 24 h. GSH content was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The result (mean ± S.E., n = 5) of each condition was expressed as the percentage of control (untreated) cells. Open table in a new tab H4 cell cultures were treated with either 2 mmH2O2 for 1 h or with 50 μm for 24 h. GSH content was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The result (mean ± S.E., n = 5) of each condition was expressed as the percentage of control (untreated) cells. To determine whether the CYP1A1 mRNAs down-regulation by oxidative stress was accounted for by a modification of the gene promoter activity, we transfected the p1A1-FL plasmid containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene controlled by the human cyp1A1 gene promoter (−1566,+73 fragment) in HepG2 cells. The treatment of cells by increasing concentrations of H2O2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the reporter gene expression (Fig. 3 A, curve a). A BSO-induced GSH depletion also impaired the expression driven by this promoter (Fig. 3 B, open bars). Dioxin (TCDD) induced cyp1A1 promoter activity 20-fold (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 C(open bars), the induced activity was also strongly inhibited by H2O2, suggesting that the decrease in steady-state mRNAs levels are mainly due to a decrease in promoter activity. The effect of H2O2 was more potent on the TCDD-induced activity than on the basal activity. In some cellular systems, the cytokine TNFα is known to increase cellular H2O2 levels (40Krieger-Brauer H. Kather H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyeart R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, TNFα decreased cyp1A1 promoter activity by 40% (Fig. 3 D, open bars). This effect is prevented in the presence of the antioxidant PDTC, suggesting that it is mediated by a redox mechanism. In the same experiments, TNFα did not affect the expression driven by a CP-1/TATA promoter (not shown). Since both basal and induced activities were altered by oxidative stress, we hypothesized that the proximal NFI site may be implicated in the H2O2 effect. In order to test this hypothesis, we mutated this site in the cyp1A1promoter. We first verified by EMSA that this mutation inhibited NFI binding (not shown). The mutated promoter displayed decreased basal activity (8-fold decrease, Fig. 3 A). It also displayed decreased TCDD inducibility, 11- versus 20-fold induction for pmut1A1-FL and p1A1-FL, respectively (not shown). The role of the NFI site in the basal and induced activities of the 1.6-kilobase pair-long human promoter is in agreement with previous studies using the mouse promoter (3Jones K. Whitlock J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5098-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effect of H2O2 and BSO on the basal activity was abolished by the mutation of the NFI site (Fig. 3 A, curve b and Fig. 3 B, shaded bars). Similarly, the activity of the dioxin-induced mutated promoter was not altered by oxidative stress (Fig. 3 C, shaded bars). We conclude that NFI site integrity is required for the inhibitory effect caused by oxidative stress. Furthermore, this site is also required for the inhibition of promoter activity by TNFα, since this cytokine had no effect on the activity of the mutated promoter (Fig. 3 D, shaded bars). In order to further characterize the contribution of NFI to the oxidative regulation of gene expression, the activity and regulation of short promoter fragments containing critical NFI sites were tested. We first tested a promoter containing a NFI site upstream of a TATA box (pNFI/TATA-FL plasmid containing the 60-base pair-long proximal promoter of the cyp1A1 gene). As shown in Fig. 4 A, increasing concentrations of H2O2 down-regulated this promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the NFI site of this promoter fragment was mutated, the inhibitory effect of H2O2 was prevented (the basal activity of the mutated promoter was decreased but remained at least 3 times higher than the one obtained with the pGL3 basic vector). The effect of other compounds modifying the redox status within the cell was also tested. BSO inhibited this promoter activity (not shown). Aminotriazole, an inhibitor of the H2O2 scavenging enzyme catalase, also decreased this promoter activity, which was further repressed by H2O2 (Fig. 4 B). Finally, TNFα down-regulated the NFI/TATA promoter activity in the absence, but not in the presence, of PDTC (Fig. 4 C). To study the influence of H2O2 on NFI activity in a heterologous context, we transiently transfected HepG2 cells with a recombinant Tk-CAT plasmid. The pTriNFI-CAT construct (three NFI sites inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter) displayed a basal CAT expression 4 times higher than the pTk-CAT. The reporter gene expression decreased dramatically when cells were treated with increasing concentrations of H2O2. The dose-dependent inhibition of NFI transcriptional activity was maximal at a 1 mm concentration (75% decrease) as shown in Fig. 4 D. Under the same conditions, the CAT gene expression driven by the HSV-Tk promoter (pTk-CAT) was also decreased but to a lesser extent (see Fig. 4 D, inset). It has been reported that the HSV-Tk promoter contains a CCAAT box (42Jones K. Yamamoto K. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), which could bind NFI, and two Sp1 binding sites, which could account for this observation. In the experiments reported here, the concentration of H2O2 used was within the 100 μmto 2 mm range. However, we observed, by a spectrophotometric method (43Aebi H.E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1974: 277-282Google Scholar), a rapid degradation of H2O2 in the culture medium, in agreement with previous studies in liver cells (6Barker C.W. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3985-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, only a minor fraction of the initial H2O2 introduced in the medium could reach the intracellular location. In our experiments, cells did not suffer significant irreversible cytotoxicit"
https://openalex.org/W2032204995,"Escherichia coli cells possess several mechanosensitive ion channels but only MscL, the channel with the highest conductance, which is activated at the highest membrane tension, has been cloned. We investigated the putative involvement of MscL in the effluxes caused by osmotic downshock. Osmotic shock caused the release of potassium glutamate, trehalose, and glycine betaine from wild type cells and cells lacking MscL. There was no difference between the two strains, but the extreme rapidity of the efflux process, as shown herein for glycine betaine, suggests that it is channel-mediated. Osmotic downshock also induces the release of some cytosolic proteins from EDTA-treated cells. We investigated the release of thioredoxin. This protein was totally released from wild type cells but was retained by MscL− cells. Release was restored by expression of the gene coding for MscL. Thus MscL is not necessary for the excretion of osmoprotectants, but it does open in vivoduring shock and catalyzes the efflux of thioredoxin and possibly other small cytosolic proteins. It follows that the other mechanosensitive channels, which are known to be activated at lower tension, must also open during osmotic shock. Their opening and that of MscL could account for the rapid release of osmolytes.

Their opening and that of MscL could account for the rapid release of osmolytes. mechanosensitive. Mechanosensitive (MS)1ion channels are channels gated by mechanical forces exerted on cell membranes. They are present in a large variety of cells, in animals, plants, and bacteria. In bacteria, these channels have been documented by patch-clamp experiments in Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis(reviewed in Sukharev et al. (1Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)). A characteristic of bacterial MS channels (which distinguishes them from their counterparts in animal cells) is their multiplicity and high conductance. High conductance MS channels are also present in Archaea (2Le Dain A.C. Saint N. Kloda A. Ghazi A. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12116-12119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). InE. coli, on the basis of conductance and kinetics, three families of MS channels were distinguished: MscM (M for mini), MscS (S for small), and MscL (L for large). These channels are activated at different thresholds of applied pressure; the higher the conductance of a channel, the higher the pressure needed to trigger its opening (3Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The MscL channel has been purified and its gene has been cloned (4Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Expression of the mscL gene is necessary and sufficient for activity of the MS channel with the highest conductance (4Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C.

The protein is located in the plasma membrane (6Blount P. Sukharev S.I. Moe P.C. Shroeder M.J. Guy H.R. Kung C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Häse C.C. Minchin R.F. Kloda A. Martinac B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Homologues of mscLhave been identified in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (9Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The genes coding for the other MS channels have not been identified. Complete genome sequencing of organisms such as E. coli and B. subtlis shows that these genes probably have sequences different from that of mscL, for which no paralogue has been found. The function of the MS channels in bacteria is still a matter of speculation. It has been known for a long time that hypo-osmotic shock causes the release of solutes from E. coli, without lysis of the cells (10Tsapis A. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 469: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The localization of high conductance MS channels in the plasma membrane of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (11Zoratti M. Petronilli V. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Berrier C. Coulombe A. Houssin C. Ghazi A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Zoratti M. Petronilli V. Szabó I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that shock-induced effluxes are mediated by these channels (14Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabó I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). More specifically, it was proposed that the physiological role of these channels is to catalyze the efflux of osmolytes or osmoprotectants upon osmotic shock (14Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabó I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Bakker E.P. Alkali Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 349-358Google Scholar). Cultivated in high osmolarity media, bacteria such as E. coli are able to synthesize or accumulate high concentrations of osmoprotectants and potassium which counterbalance the outside osmolarity (reviewed in Czonka and Epstein (16Csonka L.N. Epstein W. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1210-1223Google Scholar)). Upon a shift to a low osmolarity medium, excretion of compatible solutes is required to restore normal turgor. The efflux of potassium and osmoprotectants, triggered by osmotic downshock, has indeed been reported in E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (17Meury J. Robin A. Monnier-Champeix P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Lamark T. Styrvold O.B. Strom A.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 75: 149-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schleyer M.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6979-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to species of low molecular weight (ions, metabolites, and osmoprotectants), some cytoplasmic proteins including elongation factor Tu (24Jacobson G.R. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1976; 261: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), thioredoxin (25Lunn C.A. Pigiet V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11424-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and DnaK (26El Yaacoubi A. Kohiyama M. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are also excreted fromE. coli upon osmotic downshock (27Beacham I.R. Int. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The release of thioredoxin and DnaK occurs under conditions in which other cytoplasmic proteins are totally retained (25Lunn C.A. Pigiet V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11424-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26El Yaacoubi A. Kohiyama M. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); how these cytoplasmic proteins can be excreted in the absence of cell lysis constitutes a riddle. To examine the possible involvement of MscL in these processes, we studied the efflux of various molecules triggered by osmotic downshock in the wild type and mscL − strains of E. coli. E. coli thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin were supplied by IMCO (Stockholm, Sweden). The thioredoxin antibody was obtained from Sigma. [methyl-14C]Choline chloride was obtained from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed using the parental E. coli AW 405 strain (28Armstrong J.B. Adler J. Dahl M.M. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 390-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and various derivatives, E. coli AW405 (referred to here as the wild type strain), AW405 carrying a chromosomal insertion in themscL gene (referred to here as the MscL−strain), and a MscL− RecA− strain carrying the mscL expression plasmid p5-2-2 (referred to here as the restored strain) (4Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These strains were kindly donated by Dr. P. Blount. Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing 20 μg/ml thiamine, 40 μg/ml l-threonine, 40 μg/ml l-leucine, 40 μg/ml l-histidine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 22 mm glucose as the carbon source with, in addition, 50 μg/ml ampicillin for the restored strain. Expression of mscL in this strain was induced with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. In some experiments (trehalose assays, detection of MalE) glucose was replaced with 44 mm glycerol or 20 mm maltose. Culture at high osmolarity was performed by adding 500 mm NaCl (final concentration) to the culture. K+ efflux was studied with a valinomycin K+-selective electrode, connected to a microcomputer, which was used to monitor the appearance of K+ in the external medium, as described previously (29Boulanger P. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9767-9775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended at A 650 = 50 (25 mg dry weight/ml) in 10 mmHepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, and 0.4% glucose. The resulting suspension was diluted 25-fold in the shock medium (Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, NaCl ranging from 0 to 80 mm). Growing cells (A 650 between 0.1 and 0.2) were subjected to an osmotic upshock by addition of NaCl (500 mmfinal concentration). Osmotic downshock was achieved by a 5-fold dilution with the same medium but devoid of NaCl. At various time intervals, 10-ml samples of the cell suspension were withdrawn and centrifuged. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of M9 medium, and the cells were disrupted with a vibro-disrupter (MM2000 type, Retsch, Germany). Glutamate content was determined enzymatically, as described by Beutler (30Beutler H.O. Bermeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 8. Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL1985: 369-376Google Scholar), using a Boehringer kit assay. Cell growth was monitored in parallel by absorbance measurement. Growing cells were subjected to an osmotic upshock followed by an osmotic downshock as described above. At various time intervals, 8-ml samples of the cell suspension were withdrawn and centrifuged. The pellets were treated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the trehalose content was measured using the phenol method, as described previously (31Dinnibier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cell growth was monitored in parallel by absorbance measurement. [N-methyl-14C]Glycine betaine was synthesized enzymatically by oxidation of [N-methyl-14C]choline (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol) and was purified as described previously (32Ikuta S. Matuura K. Imamura S. Misaki H. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells grown at high osmolarity were harvested by centrifugation and suspended atA 650 = 0.5 in 10 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.2, 600 mm NaCl, containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose. Transport was initiated by the addition of [N-methyl-14C]glycine betaine (1 mm final concentration). At given time intervals, 100-μl samples were withdrawn, filtered through Millipore HA filters, and washed with 5 ml of buffer. The radioactivity of the filters was counted. Osmotic downshock was performed as described in the figure legends. To increase the time resolution of the filtration experiments, a rapid filtration assay was used. An aliquot (100 μl) of the suspension of cells that had accumulated betaine at a high NaCl concentration was deposited onto the filter, and vacuum was applied. Under these conditions the bacteria were adsorbed to the filter and retained their glycine betaine for at least 15 s, as shown by control experiments in which the filters were washed with 5 ml of iso-osmotic solution, after adsorption of the cells. Various volumes (from 5 ml to 800 μl) of shock buffer were rapidly applied to the filters onto which the bacteria were adsorbed. The filters were then washed with 5 ml of buffer containing 600 mm NaCl. The permeation rate of the shock buffer through the filter, when vacuum was applied, was determined independently and found to be 4 ml/s. Thus, the cells loaded with glycine betaine and adsorbed onto the filters were in contact with the shock solution for times varying from 1.25 s to 200 ms. A volume of 800 μl of the shock buffer was the smallest that wetted all the bacteria deposited on the filter. Also, for smaller volumes, the time required to deliver the solution manually became limiting. Cells were suspended at A 650 = 5 in a plasmolysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20% (w/v) sucrose, in the absence or presence of 2.5 mm EDTA, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The iso-osmotic dilution or the hypo-osmotic shock were performed by diluting 200 μl of the cell suspension 5-fold with suspension buffer or distilled water, respectively. The cells were then separated from the medium by centrifugation in a bench centrifuge. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of electrophoresis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 1% mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 4 min. A 4-μl aliquot was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 15% acrylamide gel. A 200-μl aliquot of the supernatant was incubated overnight with 20% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged in a bench centrifuge. The precipitated proteins were suspended in 20 μl of electrophoresis buffer and boiled for 4 min. A 4-μl aliquot was subjected to electrophoresis. For determination of total thioredoxin cell content, 1 ml of cells at A 650 = 1 were centrifuged, and the pellet was suspended in 100 μl of electrophoresis buffer. A 4-μl sample was loaded onto the gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed as described elsewhere (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were used for immunodetection. Release of the periplasmic protein MalE was detected with MalE antibodies provided by Dr. G. Richarme. Control experiments with pure commercial thioredoxin, in the presence of gadolinium, were performed to ensure that this ion does not modify immunodetection. Quantification of the intensity of protein bands was performed by scan densitometry. Thioredoxin was determined enzymatically with thioredoxin reductase as described previously (34Holmgren A. Ohlsson I. Grankvist M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 430-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic downshock was performed as described above. To determine the total thioredoxin cell content, cells were disrupted by two passages through a French press cell. The resulting suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 rpm in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments), and the supernatant was kept for thioredoxin determination. All measurements were made in triplicate. The first response of E. coli cells to an osmotic upshock is an uptake of potassium (35Epstein W. Schultz S.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1965; 49: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) which is released when the external osmolarity is lowered (14Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabó I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Meury J. Robin A. Monnier-Champeix P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Schleyer M. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The uptake and release of potassium by E. coli cells, in response to changes in the external NaCl concentration, were determined by monitoring the external potassium concentration with a valinomycin electrode (29Boulanger P. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9767-9775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells, resuspended in a 200 mm NaCl medium were diluted 25-fold in media containing 0 to 80 mm NaCl. Upon shock, the cells lost 50–85% of their potassium content. Whatever the intensity of the osmotic downshock, no difference was observed between wild type and MscL− strains (not shown). In parallel with the uptake of potassium, cells synthesize and accumulate glutamate (31Dinnibier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 36McLaggan D. Naprstek J. Buurman E.T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1911-1917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, cells (wild type, MscL−, and restored) growing in minimal medium were subjected to a large osmotic upshock by addition of NaCl (500 mm final concentration). This resulted in the synthesis of glutamate, the level of which reached some 300 nmol/mg of dry weight within 10 min before declining, probably as trehalose was synthesized. A 5-fold dilution with NaCl-free medium resulted in a monophasic release of 80% of the internal glutamate from wild type, MscL− strains, and from the restored strain (not shown). No clear differences between the three strains were observed in three separate experiments. In a second phase of adaptation to high osmolarity media, E. coli synthesizes trehalose, which accumulates in the cytoplasm and partially replaces potassium and glutamate (31Dinnibier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 37Larsen P.I. Sydnes L.K. Landfald B. Strom A.R. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 147: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cells (wild type, MscL−, and restored) growing in minimal medium were shocked by addition of NaCl (500 mm final concentration). This resulted in the synthesis of trehalose, the level of which reached some 300 nmol/mg of dry weight within 2 h (Fig. 1). A 5-fold dilution with NaCl-free medium caused similar releases of trehalose from the wild type (Fig. 1 A), MscL− (Fig. 1 B) and restored strains (not shown). Interestingly, the release of trehalose was clearly biphasic with a rapid and a slow component in each of three similar experiments. E. coli cells subjected to an osmotic shock accumulate glycine betaine if it is present in the external medium (38Perroud B. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 393-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycine betaine then replaces potassium glutamate or trehalose (31Dinnibier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, cells were grown in minimal medium in the presence of 500 mm NaCl, washed, and suspended at room temperature in Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 600 mm NaCl. Addition of 1 mm radioactive glycine betaine to the medium resulted in the uptake of more than 1 μmol/mg of dry weight (Fig. 2). Given the cell volume, previously measured under similar osmotic conditions and in the presence of glycine betaine (39Houssin C. Eynard N. Shechter E. Ghazi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this corresponds to a concentration higher than 1 m. A 5-fold dilution of the cell suspension with NaCl-free medium resulted in the total release of glycine betaine, which was then accumulated back to a much lower level. If, immediately after the hypo-osmotic shock and release of glycine betaine, the initial high osmolarity of the medium was restored by addition of concentrated NaCl, the internal concentration of glycine betaine returned to a level similar to that present initially. This shows that the massive efflux of glycine triggered by osmotic downshock occurred without damage to the cells. We studied the release of betaine from wild-type and MscL− strains as a function of the intensity of the shock. Cells that had previously accumulated glycine betaine in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 600 mm NaCl, were shocked in media of decreasing concentrations of NaCl. Efflux of glycine betaine occurred only above a threshold corresponding to a change of about 200 mm in external NaCl concentration. The extent of betaine release paralleled that of the shock intensity, and no significant difference between the two strains could be observed, regardless of intensity of the shock, in three separate experiments (Fig. 3).Figure 3Release of accumulated glycine betaine as a function of shock intensity in wild type (▪) and MscL−(•) strains. Cells that had accumulated glycine betaine in a buffer containing 600 mm NaCl were subjected to osmotic shock by a 5-fold dilution of the suspension with shock media of various NaCl concentrations (0–600 mm). The diluted suspension was filtered, and the filters were counted for radioactivity. The glycine betaine content retained in the cells after the shock is plotted against the NaCl concentration of the shock medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gadolinium is the only known inhibitor of bacterial MS channels (14Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabó I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and it is unfortunately relatively nonspecific. It could not be used in the trehalose experiments because it precipitates with phosphate in culture media. We examined its possible inhibitory effect on the release of glycine betaine. However, in the absence of shock, when the cells were simply diluted in an iso-osmotic medium containing 1 mm gadolinium, 30% of the internal glycine betaine was released as compared with the control. The reason for this effect is unclear. In all these experiments, the release of glycine betaine was completed within the 3–4 s required to dilute and filter the cell suspension. We attempted to increase the time resolution of our experiments by performing the rapid filtration assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that the complete release of glycine betaine took less than 200 ms, the limit of resolution for this assay. No difference was observed between the strains for this type of assay, whatever the intensity of the shock. Some small cytosolic proteins are released by osmotic shock from Tris-EDTA treated E. colicells (24Jacobson G.R. Rosenbusch J.P.

Our results confirm this surprising finding for thioredoxin. Cells were resuspended in a plasmolysis medium and subjected to an osmotic downshock by a 5-fold dilution in water as described previously (25Lunn C.A. Pigiet V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11424-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and release of thioredoxin was monitored by immunodetection. The Tris-EDTA treatment that disrupts the outer membrane was found essential; no release of thioredoxin was observed in the absence of treatment (Fig. 4 A). While no release of thioredoxin was observed when Tris-EDTA-treated cells were simply diluted in an iso-osmotic medium, the release was total when the cells were osmotically shocked (Fig. 4 B). Release was totally blocked by 1 mm gadolinium in the shock medium (Fig. 4 B). In the MscL− strain, release was severely impaired and most of the thioredoxin remained in the cells (Fig. 4 C). Significantly, in the restored strain, the efflux of thioredoxin was similar to that found for the wild type strain (Fig. 4 C). A trivial explanation for these results could be that, for unknown reasons, the outer membrane in MscL− is more resistant to the Tris-EDTA treatment; thioredoxin would then simply remain trapped in the periplasm. Fig. 4 D shows that such is not the case. The release, triggered by osmotic shock, of the periplasmic maltose binding protein MalE was similar in both wild type and MscL− cells (n = 2). The impairment of thioredoxin release in MscL− was observed in six separate experiments. However, it was never complete. Moreover, it showed some variability; the amount of thioredoxin released by MscL−cells ranged from 19 to 40% of the total cell contentversus 99–100% in wild type cells (e.g. compare Fig. 4, C and D). Finally, we studied the same phenomenon using a different, quantitative, assay in which thioredoxin was enzymatically determined with thioredoxin reductase (34Holmgren A. Ohlsson I. Grankvist M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 430-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all three strains, the cell thioredoxin content was found to be about 60 pmol/mg of dry weight in good agreement with a previous determination (25Lunn C.A. Pigiet V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11424-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In three separate experiments, a 90–100% release of thioredoxin was observed from wild type EDTA-treated cells upon osmotic shock. In contrast, MscL− EDTA-treated cells released only 16–20% of their total thioredoxin. In the mutant expressing themscL gene, 82–90% of thioredoxin was released upon shock. The study of osmoregulation in bacteria had initially focused on the accumulation of potassium and osmoprotectants following osmotic upshock. More recent reports, dealing with different bacterial species, have shown that osmoprotectants are released upon osmotic downshock (18Lamark T. Styrvold O.B. Strom A.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 75: 149-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schleyer M. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 160: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Koo S.P. Higgins S.F.

As shown here for glycine betaine, efflux occurs without lysis of the cells, and the cells are able to accumulate glycine betaine again immediately after the shock if necessary. This efflux is thus clearly an important physiological process, probably widespread in bacteria, which allows an immediate release of membrane tension. The efflux pathways have not been identified, but they clearly differ from the transport systems used for influx. In L. plantarum a fast and a slow efflux of glycine betaine were reported (21Glaasker E. Konings W. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10060-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). No slow phase of glycine betaine efflux was observed in our experiments, but it may have been masked by reuptake. It is noteworthy that we observed a biphasic release of trehalose, which is not transported back into the cells. It was proposed that the slow component of glycine betaine efflux in L. plantarum is carrier-mediated. A similar system may exist for trehalose in E. coli. A fast component of efflux was observed for all osmoprotectants. It is highly probable that it is channel-mediated. This conclusion is dictated by the extreme rapidity of the phenomenon. In this study we attempted to increase the time resolution. The efflux rate of glycine betaine was found to be higher than 300,000 nmol/min/mg of dry weight, a figure which is not compatible with a carrier-mediated process. The high conductance MS channels present in the cell membrane of bacteria are therefore obvious candidates for the fast efflux pathway (14Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabó I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Bakker E.P. Alkali Transport Systems in Prokaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 349-358Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we have shown here that deletion of mscL, the only known gene that codes for a bacterial MS channel (4Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), has no detectable effect on the release of K+, glutamate, trehalose, and glycine betaine. However, as MscM and MscS channels are present (3Berrier C. Besnard M. Ajouz B. Coulombe A. Ghazi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), this does not rule out the involvement of MS channels in the process. A few cytoplasmic proteins including thioredoxin, translation elongation factor Tu, and DnaK are known to be released by osmotic shock (24Jacobson G.R. Rosenbusch J.P. Nature. 1976; 261: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Lunn C.A. Pigiet V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11424-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26El Yaacoubi A. Kohiyama M. Richarme G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Release of these cytoplasmic proteins has been documented in Tris-EDTA-treated cells. When this treatment was omitted, thioredoxin was not excreted into the external medium (23Verheul A. Glaasker E. Poolman B. Abee T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6979-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (this study). As the Tris-EDTA treatment disrupts the outer membrane, in intact cells, thioredoxin is in fact released during shock from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. Thioredoxin is a 12-kDa protein that participates in several thiol-dependent, cellular-reductive processes (40Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this transfer of thioredoxin into the periplasm is unclear. The release of thioredoxin was severely impaired in cells lacking MscL, and was totally blocked by gadolinium, an inhibitor of bacterial MS channels (14Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabó I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and in particular of MscL (5Häse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This demonstrates clearly that most of the thioredoxin efflux occurs via MscL. Residual thioredoxin efflux may be carried by MscS. The finding that a protein can pass through a channel is unexpected and surprising. However, the conductance of MscL (1500 pS in 0.1 m KCl) is unusually high for an endogenous channel. The size of the open channel pore was recently probed experimentally by measuring blockade of MscL by large organic polymers (poly-l-lysines) of increasing sizes. The open pore diameter was estimated to be around 40 Å, consistent with direct calculation based on the channel conductance (41Cruickshank C.C. Minchin R.F. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The size of the thioredoxin molecule, determined by x-ray diffraction studies, is 25 × 30 × 35 Å (42Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). It is thus compatible with that of the pore. In this context, it is noteworthy that high conductance MS channels of B. subtilis, reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer, have recently been found to be able to catalyze the transfer of double-stranded DNA (43Szabó I. Bathori G. Tombola F. Brini M. Coppola A. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25275-25282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate for the first time that the opening of MscL does occur in vivo, during osmotic shock. This could not be inferred from previous patch-clamp studies. In these experiments, negative pressure is applied via the pipette to the patch, but the relevant parameter is the membrane tension which is related to pressure by Laplace's law, via the radius of curvature of the patch. The radius of curvature of the patch, which cannot be evaluated easily, differs from that of the cells. These considerations have precluded a simple comparison between the pressure applied in patch-clamp experiments and the intensity of osmotic shock felt by intact cells. MscL is the channel with the highest conductance, which requires the highest tension to open (2Le Dain A.C. Saint N. Kloda A. Ghazi A. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12116-12119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, if MscL opens during osmotic shock, so do the other MS channels, MscM and MscS. It is thus highly probable that rapid efflux of osmoprotectants occurs via these channels (and via MscL in the wild type). MscL is present in a the large number of bacteria (9Moe P.C. Blount P. Kung C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). If it is not required for osmoprotectant efflux, at least when MscS and MscM are present, what is its physiological role? One possibility is that, being activated at the highest tension, it is an emergency device used as a last resort. The multiplicity of MS channels present in bacteria would reflect a redundancy dictated by the importance of osmoregulation for cell viability. Another possibility, which might account for the unusually high conductance of MscL, is that transfer of some proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm during osmotic shock, as documented herein for thioredoxin, has a physiological meaning which is not understood at present. In conclusion, we have shown that MscL opens during osmotic downshock and is responsible for the release of thioredoxin, and possibly of other small proteins. A full understanding of the process taking place during osmotic downshock will require the identification of the various genes coding for MS channels in E. coli. We are grateful to Dr. P.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs on the IRS proteins bind to the SH2 domains in proteins that mediate downstream signals, including phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, GRB-2, and SHP-2. We investigated the function of the two SHP-2 binding COOH-terminal tyrosines of IRS-1 by replacing them with phenylalanine (IRS-1FCT). IRS-1FCT failed to bind SHP-2 or mediate its tyrosine phosphorylation during insulin stimulation. Although several reports suggest a critical role for SHP-2 in insulin stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and cell proliferation, IRS-1FCT mediated these effects normally in 32D cells. Indeed, IRS-1FCT exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase binding and activation of protein synthesis in response to insulin. These results suggest that SHP-2 attentuates the phosphorylation and downstream signal transmission of IRS-1 and that the interaction of IRS-1 and SHP-2 is an important regulatory event which attenuates insulin metabolic responses.

Insulin transmits cellular signals by binding the cell surface insulin receptor and activating the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (1Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The activated tyrosine kinase transmits downstream signals largely through the action of a class of intermediary docking proteins, including GAB-1, Shc, and a set of signaling molecules known as the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1 proteins, IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4 (2Yenush L.

The NH2-terminal region of the IRS proteins contains extended domains that cooperate in receptor recognition (1Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

While each IRS protein contains unique tyrosine phosphorylation sites, three classes of sites are well conserved across the IRS proteins, multiple YMXM motifs responsible for binding regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinsositol (PI) 3′-kinase, a YXNX motif that binds GRB-2, and a pair of COOH-terminal motifs (YIDL and YASI) responsible for binding the SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase. The role of the PI 3′-kinase and GRB-2 binding motifs on IRS-1 have been extensively studied, but the role of the SHP-2 binding sites in IRS-1 signaling is unclear (1Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). SHP-2 is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase that contains two SH2 domains (8Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U .S .A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and appears to be the homolog of the Drosophila corkscrew gene responsible for activation of p21 downstream of a variety of tyrosine kinases (9Perkins L.A.

Coordinate binding of the two SH2 domains of SHP-2 to double tyrosine motifs in target proteins such as IRS-1 increases the affinity of the association and activates the phosphatase by moving the NH2-terminal SH2 domain away from the phosphatase active site (11Sun X.J.

Homozygous disruption of SHP-2 in mice is early embryonic lethal, suggesting that SHP-2 plays a critical role in cell growth or differentiation. Consistent with this result, microinjection or overexpression of a catalytically inactive SHP-2, the SHP-2 SH2 domains, or αSHP-2 antibodies inhibits insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis and MAP kinase activation in a number of cell types (15Milarski K.L.

These approaches, however, interfere with all SHP-2-mediated signaling, rather than the IRS-1/SHP-2 signaling pathway specifically. In this report, we examine signaling by a mutant IRS-1 molecule that lacks the COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites and does not bind SHP-2. During insulin stimulation, this mutant is more highly phosphorylated and more strongly activates the PI 3′-kinase pathway, including protein synthesis, than does wild-type IRS-1. In contrast, MAP kinase activation and DNA synthesis occur normally. Thus, although SHP-2 may serve multiple roles, its association with IRS-1 appears to attenuate certain insulin signals important for metabolic responses. Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor (CHOIR) or the human insulin receptor and rat IRS-1 (CHOIR/IRS-1) have been described (19Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G.

The mutagenic primer 5′-AAG/AGT/CTT/AAC/TTT/ATA/GAC/TTG/GAT-3′ and its complement were used with outside primers flanking the EcoRI and AatII sites in the rat IRS-1 cDNA to mutate Tyr1172. This product was subjected to another round of mutagenesis using the mutagenic primers 5′-GAT/TTA/AGC/ACC/TTT/GCC/AGC/ATC/ACC-3′ and its complement and the same outside primers. The rat IRS-1 cDNA in pBluescript and mutant polymerase chain reaction products were digested with EcoRI and AatII, and the mutant polymerase chain reaction fragments were inserted in place of the wild-type sequence. The presence of the desired mutations and the absence of adventitious mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the mutant cDNA constructs. All mutant cDNAs were sucloned into the pCMVhis expression vector for expression in mammalian cells using the restriction enzymes SacI and HindIII. Quiescent confluent CHOIRcells growing on 15-cm dishes were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin as indicated, the medium was aspirated, and cells were immediately washed with ice-cold PBS. Quiescent 32DIR cells were stimulated as indicated and collected by centrifugation after the addition of ice-cold-phosphate-buffered saline.

Nuclei and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. Supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with antibodies for several hours to overnight before being collected with protein A-Sepharose 6 MB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

The reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 8 nHCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:methanol (1:1) and centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate (Merck) that had been coated with 1% potassium oxalate (27Ruderman N.

TLC plates were developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized and quantitated on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Proteins in cell lysates prepared as for PI 3′-kinase assays or from immunoprecipitates similarly prepared were denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-PAGE.

Briefly, cells in log phase growth were washed and seeded into RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum alone, 5% IL-3-containing WEHI-3-conditioned medium, or with various concentrations of insulin. Cells were grown for 48 h at 37 °C, [3H]thymidine (ICN) was added to 0.5 mCi/ml, and incubation was continued for 3 h. Cells were collected onto glass microfiber filters and lysed, and unincorporated nucleotide was removed by repeated washing with water. Filters were dried and counted in scintillation fluid for 1 min. 32D cell lines were maintained at concentrations of 5 × 105 cells/ml and starved in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 6 h. Following starvation, 1-ml aliquots of cells were taken and incubated in the presence of IL-3 or various concentrations of insulin. Cells were incubated with [35S]methionine (10 μCi/aliquot) in methionine-free RPMI 1640 for 60 min, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm methionine, and lysed in 0.5m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. Protein was precipitated with 12% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mmmethionine, collected on glass filters, and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid and ethanol. Filters were air-dried, and incorporated radionuclide was quantitated by liquid scintigraphy in an aqueous fluor. In order to investigate the role of IRS-1/SHP-2 interactions in insulin signaling, we generated IRS-1FCT, in which the two predicted SHP-2-binding residues (Tyr1172and Tyr1222) on IRS-1 were replaced by phenylalanine, and we expressed IRS-1FCT in CHOIR and 32DIR cells at similar levels as wild-type IRS-1 (Fig. 1). We assayed insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 isoforms in the CHOIRcells by αPY immunoblotting immunoprecipitated IRS-1. While tyrosine phsophorylation of endogenous hamster IRS-1 was weakly detected in the CHOIR cells, robust insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of overexpressed IRS-1 and IRS-1FCT was readily detected (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and SHP-2 association of IRS-1 isoforms in CHOIRcells. Quiescent CHOIR cell lines expressing the indicated IRS-1 isoforms were incubated for 5 min in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 100 nm insulin before being lysed. Lysates were clarified and immunoprecipitated with eitherA, αIRS-1 or B, αSHP-2 antisera. Immunoprecipitates were collected, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE before being analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antisera and being exposed to autoradiography.

SHP-2 was detected in the αIRS-1 immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated CHOIR/IRS-1 cells, but not the other cell lines. Thus, IRS-1FCT failed to associate with SHP-2 in intact cells. αPY immunoblots of αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates from CHOIR cells revealed that tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 associated with SHP-2 during insulin stimulation, consistent with previous results (32Sugimoto S.

In addition, overexpression of wild-type IRS-1 greatly increased the amount of SHP-2-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. Furthermore, SHP-2 became tyrosine-phosphorylated during insulin stimulation of CHOIRcells, and the overexpression of wild-type IRS-1 similarly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 during insulin stimulation. The identity of the approximately 60-kDa tyrosyl phosphoprotein in αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates was confirmed to be SHP-2 by reblotting with αSHP-2 antibodies and demonstrating that the bands overlay (data not shown). In contrast, IRS-1FCT did not associate with SHP-2; nor did IRS-1FCT increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. Thus, the COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites in IRS-1 mediated the binding of SHP-2 and IRS-1 in these cells, and this interaction mediated the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 during insulin stimulation. A 95–100-kDa phosphoprotein (p100) also associated with αSHP-2 immunoprecipitates during insulin stimulation; its association similarly depended upon the presence of the COOH-terminal tyrosines on IRS-1 In order to examine the function of IRS-1FCT during insulin signaling, we used the 32DIR cells, which contain no endogenous IRS-proteins (21Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We first examined tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-1FCT during insulin stimulation in the 32DIR cell lines (Fig. 3). At all doses of insulin the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1FCT was greater than that of wild-type IRS-1 (Fig. 3); after normalizing for variations in expression of IRS-1 and IRS-1FCT, the phosphotyrosine content of IRS-1FCT was approximately 2-fold greater than for wild-type IRS-1 during stimulation with a range of insulin concentrations (Fig. 3, graph). We investigated whether the increased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1FCT enhanced IRS-1 downstream signals by assaying PI 3′-kinase activity in αIRS-1 immunoprecipitates: Indeed, PI 3′-kinase activity associated with IRS-1FCT was increased compared with wild-type IRS-1, and to a similar extent as tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1FCTwas increased (Fig. 4 A). We furthermore assessed downstream signaling by IRS-1FCT by assaying generalized insulin-stimulated protein synthesis, which requires IRS-1-mediated PI 3′-kinase activity in the 32D cells (34Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Mendez R. Kollmorgen G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5184-5192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). As previously shown, expression of the insulin receptor alone in 32DIR cells was insufficient for the stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin, whereas co-expression of IRS-1 in these cells mediated insulin-stimulated protein synthesis. As with tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3′-kinase binding, IRS-1FCT enhanced insulin-stimulated protein synthesis compared with wild-type IRS-1. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Tyr1172 and Tyr1222 on tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3′-kinase activity carries over to the stimulation of protein synthesis. The insulin receptor partially activates MAP kinase via the Shc/GRB-2 pathway in 32DIR cells and expression of IRS-1 enhances this signal by recruiting GRB-2 to Tyr895 in IRS-1 (29Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Schlessinger J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Since reagents which interfere with SHP-2 block insulin-stimulated MAP kinase signaling, we assayed the insulin-stimulated activation of MAP kinase in 32DIR cells expressing the SHP-2 binding-defective IRS-1FCT (Fig. 5 A). Insulin stimulated the activation of MAP kinase in 32DIR cells, and IRS-1 expression increased the sensitivity and intensity of the response. Furthermore, insulin stimulated MAP kinase activity similarly in 32DIR/IRS-1FCT and 32DIR/IRS-1 cells, demonstrating that IRS-1 and IRS-1FCT signal similarly to MAP kinase in 32DIR cells. Therefore, the SHP-2-binding COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites in IRS-1 are not involved in the insulin-stimulated MAP kinase signaling pathway in the 32DIR cells. Although insulin receptor expression alone mediates some activation of MAP kinase in the 32D cells, insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis, like protein synthesis, requires IRS-1 expression (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to the effects observed in signaling to protein synthesis, however, IRS-1FCT did not increase the proliferative response to insulin compared with wild-type IRS-1. Thus, the COOH-terminal tyrosines on IRS-1 mediate neither positive nor negative proliferative signals in 32DIR cells. We have examined the role of the COOH-terminal tyrosines (Tyr1172 and Tyr1222) of IRS-1 for interactions with SHP-2 during insulin signaling. When phosphorylated by the insulin receptor, the motif containing Tyr1172 binds to the NH2-terminal SH2 domain and the motif containing Tyr1222 binds to the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 (11Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of these motifs to the SH2 domains of SHP-2 activates the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the SHP-2 molecule by altering the conformation of the NH2-terminal SH2 domain such that the active site of SHP-2 becomes available (12Pluskey S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11631-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SHP-2 likely regulates insulin signaling by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on IRS-1 or associated molecules. Previous work on IRS-1 and SHP-2 has focused largely on interactions between purified proteins. Here we confirm in intact cells that the association of IRS-1 and SHP-2 depends upon Tyr1172 and Tyr1222. Using the yeast two-hybrid system or purified proteins in vitro, others have suggested that SHP-2 and the insulin receptor can interact directly, without IRS-1 (36Kharitonenkov A. Schnekenburger J.

Sawka-Verhelle D. Gamha A. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Our data in CHOIR cells suggest that IRS-1 is necessary to link SHP-2 to the insulin receptor; insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 when it is associated with IRS-1. The simplest interpretation of this data is that SHP-2 is phosphorylated when recruited to the insulin receptor-IRS-1 complex by the phosphorylated Tyr1172 and Tyr1222 of IRS-1. Furthermore, although previous reports suggest that SHP-2 enhances the coupling between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor, IRS-1FCT, which does not bind SHP-2, mediates signaling as well or better than wild-type IRS-1. Thus SHP-2 is not required for insulin receptor-IRS-1 coupling in this system. Numerous studies have suggested that SHP-2 activity is required for the insulin-stimulated activation of MAP kinases and proliferation. We examined the function of the SHP-2-binding defective IRS-1FCT in insulin signal transmission in 32DIR cells, as these cells contain no endogenous IRS proteins and facilitate the analysis of IRS-1 mutants (21Myers Jr., M.G.

White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); IRS-1FCT mediates MAP kinase activation and proliferation similarly to wild-type IRS-1 in the 32DIR cells. Thus, at least in this system, IRS-1/SHP-2 interactions are not required for these two insulin-mediated events. In contrast, mutation of the SHP-2 binding site in IRS-1FCT results in enhanced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1; this increases the association of PI 3′-kinase with IRS-1FCT, which in turn enhances insulin-stimulated protein synthesis. These data suggest a negative regulatory role for the COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 and, by extension, for the IRS-1/SHP-2 interaction. A reasonable model for this effect is that tyrosine phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal sites on IRS-1 recruits and activates the SHP-2 phosphatase in complex with IRS-1. In this complex, SHP-2 dephosphorylates IRS-1 and/or the insulin receptor, reducing tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3′-kinase binding YMXM motifs in IRS-1 (Fig. 6); indeed, others have shown that dephosphorylation of IRS-1 by SHP-2 in vitro is mediated by the IRS-1/SHP-2 interaction (38Kuhne M.R.

Hence, our model of SHP-2/IRS-1 interactions is consistent with the emerging model of SHP-2/gp130 interaction; mutation of the SHP-2 binding sites in gp130 (the shared subunit of many IL-6-type cytokine receptors) prolongs activation of the associated JAK tyrosine kinase and the downstream STAT signaling proteins during oligomerization of gp130 or during CNTF signaling (39Servidei T.

Although, like IRS-1, these SHP-2 binding proteins are dephosphorylated by SHP-2, dephosphorylation in this case correlates with increased MAP kinase activation and proliferation. Thus, while SHP-2 dephosphorylates a variety of bound tyrosyl phosphoproteins, this dephosphorylation may either inhibit downstream signals (as in the case of IRS-1 and gp130) or mediate positive signals as in the case of SIRP/SHPS and p95–100. While our data show no link between IRS-1/SHP-2 interactions and MAP kinase and proliferative signaling, a large body of data suggests that SHP-2 is required for insulin-stimulated activation of the p21 → MAP kinase → c-Fos pathway and proliferation (15Milarski K.L.

These studies, however, have investigated SHP-2 signaling by overexpressing or microinjecting reagents (such as catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutants, SHP-2 SH2 domains, or αSHP-2 antibodies) which interfere with SHP-2 signaling. This approach blocks not only the SHP-2/IRS-1 interaction, but the interaction of SHP-2 with other proteins, such as SIRP/SHPS and p95–100. In contrast, we have examined the SHP-2/IRS-1 interaction specifically. Thus, we are able to draw conclusions specifically about the role of the SHP-2/IRS-1 interaction without disrupting signaling by other important SHP-2 interacting molecules which may mediate positive signals. The function of IRS-1FCT also highlights differences between the signaling pathways connecting IRS-1 to protein synthesis and proliferation (Fig. 6). Although both pathways require PI 3′-kinase, the increased PI 3′-kinase activity generated by the IRS-1FCT enhances insulin-stimulated protein synthesis without altering insulin-stimulated proliferation. Similarly, an IRS-1 mutant whose only tyrosines are three YMXM motifs (and thus lacks the other 15 tyrosines in wild-type IRS-1, including six other YMXM motifs and both COOH-terminal tyrosine) mediates enhanced activation of PI 3′-kinase and protein synthesis, but impaired proliferation compared with wild-type IRS-1 (34Mendez R.

White, submitted for publication. Thus, activation of PI 3′-kinase and its downstream pathways suffices to stimulate general protein synthesis, while signals in addition to PI 3′-kinase (and which are not modified by the COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites) are required for proliferation. A certain level of PI 3′-kinase may be required for proliferation, but PI 3′-kinase independent pathways mediated by IRS-1 must be limiting for this effect. PI 3′-kinase and its downstream mediators control insulin stimulated protein synthesis directly, and may suffice to control other aspects of energy storage, such as glucose transport, as well (1Myers Jr., M.G.

The COOH-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 may therefore offer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of insulin resistance, since they appear to regulate PI 3′-kinase-mediated metabolic signals without affecting proliferative signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2057211153,"Protein kinase C-epsilon (PKC-ε) contains a putative actin binding motif that is unique to this individual member of the PKC gene family. We have used deletion mutagenesis to determine whether this hexapeptide motif is required for the physical association of PKC-ε and actin. Full-length recombinant PKC-ε, but not PKC-βII, -δ, -η, or -ζ, bound to filamentous actin in a phorbol ester-dependent manner. Deletion of PKC-ε amino acids 222–230, encompassing a putative actin binding motif, completely abrogated this binding activity. When NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing either PKC-ε or the deletion mutant of this isozyme were treated with phorbol ester only wild-type PKC-ε colocalized with actin in zones of cell adhesion. In binary reactions, it was possible to demonstrate that purified filamentous actin is capable of directly stimulating PKC-ε phosphotransferase activity. These and other findings support the hypothesis that a conformationally hidden actin binding motif in the PKC-ε sequence becomes exposed upon activation of this isozyme and functions as a dominant localization signal in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. This protein-protein interaction is sufficient to maintain PKC-ε in a catalytically active conformation."

ATP and dATP, the only nucleotides hydrolyzed by Dna2, served to stimulate Dna2 to utilize duplex DNA, indicating their hydrolysis is required. Dna2 was able to unwind short duplex only under the condition where the endonuclease activity was minimized. This finding implies that Dna2 unwinds only partially the 3′-end of duplex DNA and generates a stretch of ssDNA of limited length, which is subsequently cleaved by the ssDNA-specific endonuclease activity. A point mutation at the conserved ATP-binding site of Dna2 inactivated concurrently ssDNA-dependent ATPase, ATP-dependent nuclease, and helicase activities, indicating that they all reside in Dna2 itself. By virtue of its nucleolytic activities, the Dna2 protein may function in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity, such as repair or other related process, rather than in propagation of cellular replication forks. To gain further insights into the biological functions of Dna2, previously known as a cellular replicative helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we examined biochemical properties of the recombinant Dna2 protein purified to homogeneity.

Maintaining the integrity of chromosomal DNA in eukaryotes is of critical importance to the cell and requires a series of complicated enzymatic processes. This is reflected in the complexity and redundancy of the enzyme systems that participate in DNA metabolism, such as replication, repair, and recombination (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In addition, DNA metabolism is tightly linked to cellular control pathways that regulate the cell division cycle (3Murray A. Hunt T. The Cell Cycle: An Introduction.

Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 109-132PubMed Google Scholar). One of the enzymes required to achieve DNA replication, repair, or recombination is the DNA helicase, which uses the energy of ATP to translocate in a specific direction along a DNA strand melting the duplex regions it encounters (10Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 11Thömmes P. Hübscher U.

Cell. 1996; 86: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1generated by the helicase is utilized by other enzymes that participate in the subsequent steps in DNA metabolic pathways. Recently, theDNA2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was implicated in chromosomal DNA replication (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). DNA2 was originally identified by screening for cell division cycle mutants of S. cerevisiae and was shown to be essential for cell viability and to encode a 172-kDa protein with characteristic DNA helicase motifs (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Analyses of a temperature-sensitive mutant of DNA2 demonstrated that the mutant cell arrested in the S phase of the cell cycle and was deficient in DNA synthesis but not RNA synthesis upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity purified Dna2 fusion protein displayed a DNA-dependent ATPase activity as well as 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity specific for fork-structured substrates (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutation in the ATP binding motif of DNA2 led to the inactivation of the ATPase and helicase activities and rendered the mutant cell inviable (16Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These findings recommend the Dna2 protein as a candidate for a cellular replicative DNA helicase. Therefore, we decided to study Dna2 in the hopes of gaining understanding of initiation events of DNA replication in eukaryotes. Despite the results reported previously, it was not demonstrated unambiguously that Dna2, by itself, constituted a DNA helicase. The enzyme preparation used in these studies was obtained by an immunoaffinity purification step and contained other protein(s). One such protein present in the Dna2 enzyme preparation was yeast Fen1 (yFen1, also called Rad27/Rth1), a structure-specific endonuclease. A specific association of yFen1 and Dna2 was demonstrated both genetically and biochemically (17Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The Fen1 protein is a multifunctional enzyme found in various organisms; it has been shown to be involved in (i) Okazaki fragment maturation in lagging-strand DNA synthesis in human and simian virus 40 replication in vitro(also called 5′- to 3′-exonuclease, DNase IV, or MF1) (18Ishimi Y.

Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), and (iii) maintenance of dinucleotide repeat stability in yeasts (23Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Given these functions for Fen1, the observation that Dna2 is associated biochemically with yFen1 suggests that Dna2 is not directly involved in advancing replication forks as suggested from previous studies (15Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Budd M.E. Choe W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26766-26769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Rather, it is likely to participate in one of the other key aspects of DNA metabolism. In addition to its true physiological function in vivo, two important issues related to the native structure of Dna2 have not been resolved yet: (i) are there any unidentified polypeptide(s) other than yFen1 that are associated with Dna2, and (ii) if there are any, do the associated protein(s) influence the biochemical activities of Dna2? It is, therefore, necessary to define the biochemical activities of Dna2 protein alone in order to address the issues involved in the native structure of the Dna2 protein. For this purpose, we clonedS. cerevisiae DNA2 using a gap repair strategy and constructed a recombinant baculovirus in order to overexpress Dna2 protein in insect cells. The initial biochemical characterization of recombinant Dna2 purified to homogeneity gave rise to the unexpected finding that it possessed an intrinsic endonuclease activity in addition to the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity reported previously. Interestingly, Dna2 appeared to melt the duplex DNA only partially, based on the observation that the 3′-end duplex was susceptible to the endonucleolytic activity of Dna2. This finding suggests that the Dna2 protein by itself does not possess marked DNA helicase activity. If it is to participate in DNA replication as a processive DNA helicase, it may require an additional protein(s) such as yFen1 or other unidentified protein(s) that enable Dna2 to attain a vigorous DNA unwinding activity. Alternatively, Dna2 may be involved in other essential aspects of DNA metabolism that require its unique endonuclease activity. All oligonucleotides used for the construction of various DNA substrates (20, 24, 26, 27, 52, 73, and 98 nucleotides (nt) in length) and for PCR primers to clone the DNA2 gene were synthesized commercially (BioServe, MD). Oligonucleotides greater than 30-mer were gel-purified prior to use. The 52- and 73-mers were described elsewhere (24Park J.S. Choi E. Lee S.H. Lee C. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18910-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 24-mer (5′-CGG CAA ATG GAA CGC ACA TGC GCA-3′) was complementary to the 5′-end region of the 73-mer, and the 26-mer (5′-GGA AAA CAT TAT TAA TGG CGT CGA GC-3′) was complementary to the 3′-end region of the 73-mer (see Fig. 6 D for the substrate constructed with these oligonucleotides). The 98-mer (5′-GAA TAC AAG CTT GGG CTG CAG GTC GAC TCT AGA GGA TCC CCG GGC GAG CTC GAA TTC CGG TCT CCC TAT AGT GAG TCG TAT TAA TTT CGA TAA GCC AG-3′) contained 5′-end sequences complementary to 20-mer (5′-CTG CAG CCC AAG CTT GTA TT-3′) and 3′-end to 27-mer (5′-CTG GCT TAT CGA AAT TAA TAC GAC TCA-3′). The oligonucleotides used as PCR primers were as follows: Dna2A (5′-CCG GAA TTC GGA ACT ACT TCA AAG CTA C-3′) and Dna2B (5′-CGC GGA TCC TGA CGA TCT CTT CAA TTG-3′) were used to amplify a 5′-flanking region of the DNA2 gene, whereas Dna2C (5′-CGC GGA TCC ATA ACA GGA AAG CTA TCA C-3′) and Dna2D (5′-CTA GTC TAG AGT TGC TTG GTG CCA CGA-3′) were used for a 3′-flanking region of the gene; Dna2E (5′-CGCGGATCC ATG CCC GGA ACG CCA CAG AA-3′) and Dna2F (5′-CCG GAA TTC AGT CGA TTA GGG ACT ATA G-3′) were used to introduce BamHI site (underlined) at the initiation codon (bold type) of the DNA2 gene. ΦX174 sscDNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. Nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The following proteins were obtained commercially: restriction endonucleases, the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase were from Promega, and polynucleotide kinase was from Bio-Rad. DNA substrates used to examine the DNA unwinding and ATP-dependent nuclease activities of the Dna2 protein were prepared by hybridizing the 52-mer or 73-mer to ΦX174 sscDNA as described (24Park J.S. Choi E. Lee S.H. Lee C. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18910-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A partial duplex substrate used to quantify the endonuclease activity of Dna2 was prepared by annealing both 20- and 27-mers (40 pmol each) to the 98-mer (10 pmol) under the conditions as described previously (24Park J.S. Choi E. Lee S.H. Lee C. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18910-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This substrate contained a single-stranded region (49-nt) flanked by duplex regions (20- and 27-base pairs (bp)). The 3′-ends of the two short oligonucleotides annealed to the 98-mer were labeled by incorporating [α-32P]dCTP, chased with excess unlabeled dCTP in the presence of the Klenow fragment. The substrate was gel-purified prior to use, and its specific activity was approximately 3,000 cpm/fmol. Substrates used to analyze the ssDNA-specific endonuclease activity of Dna2 were prepared by annealing either the 24-mer (40 pmol) or 26-mer (40 pmol) to 10 pmol of the 73-mer (named 3′-overhang and 5′-overhang partial duplex, respectively). In order to prepare 3′-overhang partial duplex substrates, the 73-mer (10 pmol) was first labeled at either its 3′-end by incorporating [α-32P]dideoxy-ATP with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase or at its 5′-end by incorporating [γ-32P]ATP with polynucleotide kinase. The 73-mers thus labeled were then annealed to the 24-mer (40 pmol). The 5′-overhang partial duplex was labeled with Klenow by incorporating [α-32P]dCTP at the 3′-end of the 73-mer annealed to the 26-mer. In order to construct a substrate with partial duplexes at each end, both the 24- and 26-mers (40 pmol each) were annealed to the 73-mer (10 pmol) and labeled at the 3′-end of the 73-mer as described above for the 5′-overhang partial duplex. These substrates were also gel-purified prior to use. The specific activities of both substrates were comparable and ranged from 2,000 to 3,000 cpm/fmol. Standard assays for measuring DNA-dependent ATPase activity were carried out in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmDTT, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 250 μm cold ATP, 20 nm [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol), and 50 ng of M13 sscDNA. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, an aliquot (2 μl) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate (J. T. Baker, Inc.), which was then developed in 0.5m LiCl, 1.0 m formic acid solution. The products were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The reaction mixture (20 μl) used to examine DNA unwinding activity contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm ATP, and the 3′-32P-labeled partial duplex ΦX174 DNA substrate (15 fmol). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, reactions were stopped with 6× stop solution (4 μl; 60 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.6% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol). The reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 150 V through 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5× TBE (45 mmTris-base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried on a DEAE-cellulose paper and subjected to autoradiography. Labeled DNA products were quantitated with the use of a PhosphorImager. The reaction conditions used to examine Dna2 nuclease activity were the same as those for the DNA unwinding reaction except that ATP was omitted. The three substrates used to examine the ssDNA-specific endonuclease activity of Dna2 were the following linear partial duplex DNA substrates: 3′-overhang and 5′-overhang partial duplexes and partial duplex at both ends with internal ssDNA (refer to Fig. 6 for the structures). In order to examine the effects of ATP on the nuclease activity of Dna2, ATP (2 mm) was added to the reaction mixture that contained the 3′-32P-labeled partial duplex ΦX174 DNA (15 fmol). When necessary, the nucleolytic products were subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 35 watts in 1× TBE through 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea and analyzed as described above. The 5′-flanking (397 bp) and 3′-flanking (365 bp) regions of the DNA2 gene were first cloned by PCR with the primers described above and inserted into the yeast plasmid pRS316 (25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain pDNA2FL. This plasmid was introduced into S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa, ade2–101, ura3–52, lys2–801, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1), and theDNA2 gene was cloned with the use of a gap repair strategy as described (26Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The retrieved plasmid (pDNA2) contained an intactDNA2 gene, which was confirmed by both restriction and DNA sequencing analyses (27Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Friedmann T. Air G.M. Barrell B.G. Brown N.L. Fiddes J.C. Hutchison C.A. Slocombe P.M. Smith M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) of the 5′- and 3′-regions. A BamHI site was introduced by using a PCR-amplified fragment that contained aBamHI site prior to the start codon (see above for the sequence of PCR primer Dna2E), and then the DNA2 gene was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBlueBacHis2A (Invitrogen) to generate pHX-DNA2. To prepare DNA2 with N-terminal 405 amino acid deletion, the NdeI-EcoRI fragment of pHX-DNA2 was subcloned into pBlueBacHis2C (Invitrogen) cleaved withBamHI and EcoRI. The ssDNA overhangs generated byNdeI and BamHI were made blunt using Klenow prior to the second cleavage with EcoRI. Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculoviruses encoded wild type DNA2 and mutantDNA2 with N-terminal 405-amino acid deletion produce recombinant wild type and mutant Dna2 proteins (HX-Dna2 and HX-Dna2Δ405N, respectively) with additional 37 amino acid residues (MPRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDRWGS). These included six histidines (bold type) and the Xpress epitope (underlined) fused to its N-terminal methionine to facilitate detection and purification of the recombinant Dna2 proteins. The recombinant baculoviruses containing theDNA2 gene were infected into Hi-5 insect cells for 48 h at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The infected cells (1 × 106 cells/ml, 2 liters) were harvested, resuspended in 160 ml of buffer T (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.15 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain) containing 100 mmNaCl, and disrupted by sonication (7 cycles of a 30-s pulse and a 2-min cooling interval). The extracts (3.35 mg/ml) were cleared by centrifuging at 37,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman 45 Ti rotor, and the supernatant was applied directly to a heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 8 cm, 39.2 ml) equilibrated with buffer T plus 100 mm NaCl (buffer T100, hereafter, the number indicates the concentration of NaCl added to buffer T). The column was washed with 10 volumes of the same buffer containing neither DTT nor EDTA and eluted with buffer T600 (−DTT, −EDTA) plus 5 mm imidazole. The peak protein (1.82 mg/ml, 45 ml) was pooled and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA agarose (Quiagen) column (1.5 × 3.5 cm, 6.2 ml) equilibrated with buffer T600 (−DTT, −EDTA) plus 5 mm imidazole. After extensive washing with buffer T600 (−DTT, −EDTA) plus 20 mm imidazole, the column was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient of 20–400 mm imidazole in buffer T600 (−DTT, −EDTA). Fractions containing the DNA-dependent ATPase activity were pooled and dialyzed for 3 h against buffer T100. The dialysate (0.25 mg/ml, 180 ml) was loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1.5 × 3 cm, 5.3 ml) equilibrated with buffer T100. After washing with 5 column volumes of buffer T100, the column was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl in buffer T. The DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which peaked at 300 mm NaCl, was pooled (1.0 mg/ml, 20 ml) and concentrated 5-fold. Aliquots (250-μl) were applied to glycerol gradients (5 ml, 15–35% glycerol in buffer T) in the presence of 500 mm NaCl (high salt gradient) and subjected to centrifugation for 24 h at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor. Fractions (220 μl) were collected from the bottom of the gradients and assayed for the DNA-dependent ATPase activity and nuclease activities. The active fractions, which contained more than 90% of the total DNA-dependent ATPase activity, were pooled and stored at −80 °C. One microgram of the purified enzyme hydrolyzed 8.9 nmol of ATP/min at 37 °C, and this preparation was used to examine the ATPase and nuclease activities, unless otherwise stated. A 5′-32P label at the substrate duplex end was not removed after prolonged incubation with this preparation, thus the pool did not contain phosphatase activity. HX-Dna2Δ405N was purified employing the same procedure used for HX-Dna2 as above. In order to confirm that the endonuclease and ATP-dependent nuclease activities copurify with HX-Dna2, additional purification steps were introduced. Active fractions (1.0 ml, 700 μg/ml) obtained from high salt glycerol gradients were adjusted to 100 mmNaCl with buffer T and directly loaded onto FPLC Mono Q (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The column was washed and then eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 100–600 mm NaCl in buffer T. The peak fractions (1.0 ml, 145 μg/ml) were concentrated 5-fold and loaded to a second glycerol gradient (5 ml, 15 to 35% glycerol in buffer T) in the absence of NaCl (low salt gradient). The centrifugation was performed, and the resulting fractions were analyzed as described for the high salt gradient. A monoclonal antibody against the Xpress epitope was purchased from Invitrogen. Polyclonal antibody specific for Dna2 was generated as follows: HX-Dna2 (2 mg) from the high salt gradient was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining. Gel slices containing protein were pulverized, then emulsified in (MPL + TDM + CWS) adjuvant (Sigma), and injected into two rabbits (3.5 kg, New Zealand White) according to the manufacturer's instructions (250 μg, each injection). At 21 and 50 days after the primary injections, rabbits were injected a second time (a “boost”) with equal amounts of HX-Dna2. Sera were collected 7 days after boosting. The IgG fraction was purified with the use of protein-A Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 309-311Google Scholar). Crude extracts prepared from insect cells infected with the recombinant Dna2 baculovirus contained significant levels (approximately 1to 3% of total proteins) of full-length HX-Dna2 protein (Fig. 1, lane 2), whereas HX-Dna2 was not observed in control extracts prepared from uninfected cells (Fig. 1, lane 1). The expression of recombinant HX-Dna2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using two antibodies, anti-Dna2 polyclonal antibody (anti-Dna2) (Fig. 1, lane 5), which was raised against full-length HX-Dna2, and anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (anti-Xpress) (Fig. 1, lane 9), which only detects protein with an intact N terminus. Uninfected cell extracts did not contain any material that cross-reacted with either of the two antibodies (Fig. 1,lanes 4 and 8), whereas purified protein was detected by both antibodies (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7, anti-Dna2; lane 10, anti-Xpress). A collection of polypeptides was present in the crude extracts (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 9), as well as in the purified enzyme preparation obtained from the high salt gradient (Fig. 1, lane 6). These polypeptides apparently arose by proteolysis, as they cross-reacted with anti-DNA2 or anti-Xpress. Our control antibody (polyclonal antibody directed against bovine papillomavirus (E1) did not cross-react with HX-Dna2 at all (data not shown). Because we observed elevated ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity in the baculovirus-infected cell extracts, we decided to purify HX-Dna2 from crude extracts by monitoring ATP hydrolysis in the presence and absence of ssDNA. The protocol for isolation of HX-Dna2 from crude extracts is as summarized under “Experimental Procedures.” The initial purification steps included heparin-Sepharose, a Ni2+-NTA agarose column, SP-Sepharose, and glycerol gradient sedimentation in the presence of 0.5m NaCl (high salt gradient). Fractions eluted from the Ni2+-NTA agarose column that were enriched for a 172-kDa polypeptide also showed an increase in the specific activity of ATPase (data not shown). The high salt gradient did not display a further increase the specific activity of HX-Dna2 (data not shown), indicating that the enzyme preparation was maximally pure at this stage of purification. High salt gradient fractions containing the ATPase activity coincided with those that carried the 172-kDa protein (data not shown). An SDS-PAGE analysis of Mono Q column fractions yielded results identical to those above in that the 172-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2 A) copurified with the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, we investigated whether HX-Dna2 was able to displace the 73-base oligonucleotide annealed to ΦX174 sscDNA (5′-tailed substrate with a non-complementary 21-nt tail at the 5′-end). When the DNA unwinding activity of HX-Dna2 was examined in the presence (Fig. 2 B) and absence of ATP (Fig. 2 C), we obtained a somewhat puzzling observation. The DNA species generated by HX-Dna2 were not dependent on the presence of ATP (Fig. 2, B and C) but required MgCl2 in the reaction mixture (data not shown). In addition, the DNA products did not appear to correspond to the 73-base oligonucleotide, as they were not uniform in their migration; rather, migration retardation of these DNA was inversely proportional to the amount of HX-Dna2 present in each fraction (Fig. 2, A and B). Notable was the observation that the 32P label at the 3′-end of the annealed oligonucleotide was released in an ATP-dependent fashion when HX-Dna2 concentration was enriched (compare Fig. 2,B and C). This observation suggests that the enzyme may possess an exonucleolytic activity that is able to act on dsDNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction and in an ATP-dependent manner. This activity, termed ATP-dependent nuclease activity, of HX-Dna2 was analyzed further and is discussed in detail below. Taken together, our observation suggests that the DNA species observed in Fig. 2 most likely result from a nuclease activity of HX-Dna2, indicating that Dna2 possesses at least one type of nuclease activity but not a strong DNA unwinding activity. However, we were able to detect a weak DNA unwinding activity using a 20-mer oligonucleotide-annealed ΦX174 sscDNA as substrate under the condition where the endonuclease activity was inhibited (see below; Fig. 9)Figure 9DNA unwinding activity of HX-Dna2 protein is observed in a condition where nuclease activity is suppressed.Schematic structure of the partial duplex substrate (20-mer (5′-GGC GAT TGC GTA CCC GAC GA-3′) annealed to ΦX174 sscDNA) is shown atleft. The asterisk indicates a radioisotopic label at the 3′-end. HX-Dna2K1080E has a substitution of glutamate for the conserved lysine residue in the ATP binding motif as reported (16Budd M.E. Choe W.C.

HX-Dna2Δ405N has a deletion of N-terminal 405 amino acids as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzymes (40 ng of HX-Dna2 and HX-Dna2K1080E; 20 ng of HX-Dna2 Δ405N) were added to reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 15 fmol of the 20-mer annealed ΦX174 substrate in the presence of indicated amounts of Mg2+ and ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After incubation, the products were subjected to electrophoresis for 1.5 h at 150 V through 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS in 0.5× TBE. S and B denote substrate alone and boiled substrate controls, respectively. The arrow indicates the position where the 20-mer oligonucleotide migrated. The amounts of substrate unwound and 3′-end labels released were measured with the use of a PhosphorImager, and the results are presented at thebottom of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

We find that these motifs are interpreted differentially in various polarized epithelial cell types. The H,K-ATPase β subunit, which contains a tyrosine-based motif in its cytoplasmic tail, was expressed in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells. This protein was restricted to the basolateral membrane in MDCK cells, but was localized to the apical membrane in LLC-PK1 cells. Similarly, HA-Y543, a construct in which a tyrosine-based motif was introduced into the cytoplasmic tail of influenza hemagglutinin, was sorted to the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells and retained at the apical membrane of LLC-PK1 cells. A chimera in which the cytoplasmic tail of the H,K-ATPase β subunit protein was replaced with the analogous region of the Na,K-ATPase β subunit polypeptide was localized to both surface domains of MDCK cells. Mutation of tyrosine-20 of the H,K-ATPase β subunit cytoplasmic sequence to an alanine was sufficient to disrupt basolateral localization of this polypeptide. In contrast, these constructs all remain localized to the apical membrane in LLC-PK1 cells. The FcRII-B2 protein bears a di-leucine motif and is found at the basolateral membrane of both MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells.

Polarized epithelial cells serve as barriers between compositionally dissimilar environments. Their plasma membranes are divided into apical and basolateral domains, which are separated by tight junctions. These domains are composed of distinct sets of proteins and lipids, allowing them to serve diverse physiological functions (1Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 2Matlin K. Caplan M.J. Giebisch G. Seldin D.W. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology, Second Edition. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 447-473Google Scholar). Newly synthesized membrane proteins are delivered to the sites of their ultimate functional residence and retained there throughout continuous remodeling of the plasma membrane. Information specifying sorting behavior must, therefore, be encoded within the structure of each individual plasma membrane protein. Furthermore, these signals must be correctly recognized and interpreted by sorting machinery to dictate proper targeting. A number of sequence motifs, which mediate the sorting of membrane proteins to various polarized domains, have recently been described. The transmembrane (3Kundu A. Avalos R.T. Sanderson C.M.

Several classes of sequences have been found to direct specific sorting to the basolateral domain in the polarized kidney epithelial cell line, MDCK.2 pIGR (8Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) contains a unique basolateral sorting sequence that does not appear to be found in other basolateral polypeptides. A second class of basolateral sorting motif, which encompasses a critical tyrosine residue, has been found in a wide variety of membrane proteins (9Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K.

Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These motifs appear to take the form YXX-aliphatic amino acid (14Thomas D. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar sequences have also been shown to mediate internalization into endosomes via clathrin-coated pits (15Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A representative of such an internalization signal is the YXRF sequence found in the cytoplasmic tail of the transferrin receptor (17Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In addition, Brewer and Roth found that a single point mutation introducing a tyrosine-dependent endocytosis sequence (HA-Y543) into the cytoplasmic tail of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein was sufficient to override the apical sorting signal previously demonstrated in that protein. HA-Y543 is sorted to the basolateral domain of MDCK cells (12Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-independent di-leucine endocytosis sequence motifs constitute yet a third class of basolateral sorting signal (18Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20Hunziker W. Fumey C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2963-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We have begun to identify the protein domains of a heterodimeric ion pump, the gastric H,K-ATPase, which are responsible for its localization in polarized epithelial cells. We have previously demonstrated that the H,K-ATPase β subunit is sorted both to the apical domain and to a subapical population of endosomes in an epithelial cell line derived from the mammalian kidney, LLC-PK1 (21Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Analysis of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the H,K-ATPase β subunit revealed the presence of a putative tyrosine-based motif (FRHY). Because the H,K-ATPase β subunit is a type II membrane protein, this motif is presented in reverse orientation to the YXX-aliphatic amino acid sequence discussed above. However, reversing the orientation of similar tyrosine-based motifs in the transferrin and LDL receptors has been shown to reduce, but not to abolish, their competence to mediate internalization (22Girones N. Alvarez E. Seth A. Lin I.-M. Latour D.A. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19006-19012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that this motif mediates internalization of the H,K-ATPase from the surfaces of gastric parietal cells in vivo (51Pathak R.K. Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because tyrosine-dependent motifs have been shown to direct basolateral sorting in MDCK cells, we wondered whether the apical localization of this protein in LLC-PK1 cells was indicative of a cell-type specific difference in the interpretation of this motif. It has previously been demonstrated that the H,K-ATPase β subunit is able to leave the endoplasmic reticulum without the requirement for assembly with it's corresponding α subunit (23Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase β subunit cannot leave the endoplasmic reticulum before assembly with the Na,K-ATPase α subunit. Although the Na,K-ATPase β subunit is approximately 35% identical to the H,K-ATPase β subunit, it does not contain a comparable tyrosine-dependent motif. We have taken advantage of these attributes in creating constructs designed to determine whether the tyrosine-based motif present in the H,K-ATPase β subunit is responsible for the different sorting behavior of this polypeptide in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells. Furthermore, the distribution of the FcRII-B2 polypeptide, which contains a di-leucine motif (18Hunziker W. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), was examined to determine whether other classes of sorting signals are differentially interpreted by these two polarized cell types. MDCK cells (gift of K. Matlin, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. LLC-PK1 (gift of K. Amsler, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium alpha medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented as described for the MDCK cells. All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2atmosphere. The rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase β cDNA was kindly provided by M. Reuben and G. Sachs (University of California, Los Angeles, CA) (25Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Sachs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6767-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The rat Na,K-ATPase β1 cDNA was kindly provided by E. Benz (Johns Hopkins University). FcRII-B2 was kindly provided by I. Mellman (Yale University, New Haven, CT). All cDNAs, including the wild type HA and the HA-Y543 mutant, were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-based mammalian expression vector pCB6 (12Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and transfected into MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells as described previously (21Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Transfected MDCK and LLC-PK1 colonies were selected in 0.9 or 1.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, and screened by immunofluorescence and Western blot. LLC-PK1 cells expressing HA-Y543 were sorted by means of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter to generate high and low expressing cell lines. In this procedure, cells were trypsinized and suspended in media containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody directed against the anti-HA protein (gift of L. Roman, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Cells in the highest and lowest deciles of fluorescence above background were recovered and expanded after washing. The H,K/Na,K-ATPase β subunit constructs were each generated by two separate polymerase chain reactions. Reaction I generated the amino terminus, containing the unique ClaI restriction enzyme site, up to the proposed mutation. Reaction II generated from the proposed mutation to a unique restriction enzyme site contained within the transmembrane domain of the H,K-ATPase β (AflII). The products from these reactions were then annealed at the overlapping mutation sites and amplified. A new restriction enzyme site, EagI, was introduced into βN28H to provide an overlapping region for annealing the halves of this chimera. The introduction of this restriction site did not alter amino acid sequence. The full-length β subunit chimeras were isolated on 1.5% low melting temperature agarose gels, purified by Gene Clean (BIO 101, Vista, CA) and subcloned into H,K-ATPase β pCB6. All full-length chimeras were sequenced for fidelity. H,K-ATPase β pCB6 and Na,K-ATPase β1 pBluescript SK+ (only reaction I, βN28H) were used as template cDNAs. Primers introducing the appropriate mutations (bold) are indicated; βN28H, 5′-GGTCCGGCCGAGAAACTC3-′, and βH-Y20A, 5′-GTTCCAGCAGGCGTGGCGGAA3-′ (35Courtois-Coutry N. Roush D. Rajendran V. McCarthy J.B.

These products were isolated and purified on 1.5% low melting temperature agarose gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The gel slices were melted at 80 °C for 5 min and the appropriate halves of each chimera annealed at their internal overlapping regions. To anneal the reaction products, 50-μl reactions containing 1:1 ratios of reaction product I to reaction product II in place of primers were run for 10 cycles according to the conditions specified: βH-Y20A; melt; 97 °C, 15 s; anneal; 37 °C, 90 s; extend; 72 °C, 30 s; 30 cycles, βN28H; melt; 97 °C, 15 s; anneal; 45 °C, 60 s; extend; 72 °C, 60 s; 30 cycles, dGTP was replaced with a 3:1 ratio of 7-deaza-2′-dGTP to dGTP. Annealed front to back chimeras were then amplified by the addition of 2 μm of the outermost (unique restriction enzyme containing) primers and continuation of the reaction for an additional 20 cycles. Cells were plated on 0.4 μm Transwell polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar Inc., Cambridge, MA) and allowed to establish confluency for 5–7 days. Filters were moved to 4 °C, rinsed with PBS + 0.1% BSA and incubated in HKβ primary Ab (monoclonal antibody against the H,K-ATPase β subunit was kindly provided by J. Forte and D. Chow; University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley CA) diluted 1:10 in PBS++ (PBS, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) + 0.1% BSA for 4–5 h. Nonspecific Ab binding was removed in three consecutive 10 min washes in PBS++ + 0.1% BSA. Cells were fixed in cold methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min, followed by permeablization and incubation with a goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) as described previously (21Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence was conducted as described previously (21Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde and permeablized in 0.3% Triton X-100 before incubation in 1:500 rat monoclonal FcRII-B2 antibody (6B7B, gift of I. Mellman). Confocal images were generated using a Zeiss LSM 410 laser-scanning confocal microscope. All images were line averaged 8-fold. Cross-sections were generated with a 0.2 μ motor step. Contrast and brightness settings were adjusted so that all pixels were in the linear range. Cells grown on Transwell filters (Corning Costar) were rinsed twice in PBS++ and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% gluteraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were labeled with anti-HA antibody, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Biosys). Filters were labeled with peroxidase, embedded, and sectioned according to standard protocol (26Machamer C. Mentone S. Rose J.K. Farquar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MDCK cells expressing H,K-ATPase β or the H,K/Na,K-ATPase β chimeras were grown to confluencey on Transwell filters (Corning Costar). The filters were biotinylated at pH 7.5 from either the apical or basolateral membrane at 4 °C as described previously (27Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotin was quenched with the addition of 100 mm glycine and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. One-eighth of the total lysate was then immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of a 50/50 slurry of avidin-agarose. The biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating to 80 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and probed for 1 h at room temperature with 1:500 HK β antibody diluted into TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) plus 5% powdered milk. The blot was then washed for 1 h in TBS + milk, and incubated with 1:1000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Following further washes in TBS, the blot was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham). Measurements of HA-Y543 endocytosis were performed according to Brewer and Roth (12Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-Y543-expressing cells grown to confluency on Transwell filters were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in Met-Cys-free medium and labeled for 30 min with 35S-Met and Cys (ICN Radiochemicals, Irving, CA). Cells were chased with complete medium for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced with ice-cold medium, and the cells were transferred to 4 °C. Anti-HA antibody was added to the medium in either the apical or the basolateral compartment, and the filters were incubated on ice for an additional 40 min. Filters were then washed twice in low HCO3 DMEM containing 10 mm Hepes and 0.5% BSA and once in DMEM, 10 mm Hepes. Warmed (37 °C) DMEM, 10 mm Hepes was placed on the filters, which were moved to a 37 °C water bath for 1 min and then returned to 4 °C. Compartments previously containing antibody were treated with 100 μg/ml trypsin for 40 min; soybean trypsin inhibitor (200 μg/ml) was added to the opposite compartment. HA still remaining on the surface was cleaved into two fragments. Filters were rinsed in medium containing 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min, 4 °C, and the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 units of aprotinin. HA-Y543 was recovered by immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose, separated by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and detected by fluorography using Autofluor (National Diagnostics, Manville, NJ). Band intensity was determined by densitometry. Percent internalized was calculated as uncleaved HA divided by total (uncleaved plus cleaved) HA. MDCK cells were stably transfected with the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase β subunit cDNA. Steady state localization of the H,K-ATPase β subunit polypeptide was determined by surface immunofluorescence, employing a monoclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain of the β subunit. Stably transfected MDCK cells were grown as confluent monolayers on polycarbonate filters and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with monoclonal Ab present in both the apical and basolateral chambers. The monolayers were fixed and stained with a goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary Ab. Fluorescent images, both en face and in X/Z cross-section, were gathered with a laser-scanning confocal microscope. As can be seen in Fig. 1, A and B, the steady state distribution of the H,K-ATPase β subunit is restricted to the basolateral membrane. Cell surface biotinylation was also performed on transfected MDCK monolayers grown on filters. These studies verify that the H,K-ATPase β subunit is localized 94 ± 4% to the basolateral membrane domain (Fig. 5, A and B). Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that, when expressed in mammalian cells, the H,K-ATPase β subunit does not form a stable complex with the endogenous Na,K-ATPase α subunit (data not shown). The H,K-ATPase β subunit basolateral localization is consistent therefore, with the possibility that this protein contains a signal that is interpreted as a basolateral sorting determinant in MDCK cells. Interestingly, when this protein is examined in another cell line derived from mammalian kidney, LLC-PK1, it maintains a very different steady state distribution. In stably transfected LLC-PK1 cells, surface immunofluorescence reveals that the H,K-ATPase β subunit is localized predominately to the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 1, C and D).Figure 5Biotinylation of the H,K/Na,K-ATPase β constructs in MDCK cells. Stably transfected cells were grown on polycarbonate filters and biotinylated from either the apical (A) or the basolateral (Bl) domain at pH 7.5. Biotinylated proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation on streptavidin-agarose beads and analyzed by Western blot. Mature H,Kβ, βN28H and βHY-20A all run as heavily glycosylated bands between 50–60 kDa. Although H,Kβ is restricted to the basolateral membrane, significant populations of βN28H and βH-Y20A are accessible from the apical membrane (panel A). Four experiments for each construct were quantitated using the IS-1000 Digital Imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) (panel B).Solid black bars, percentage of apically localized protein;hatched bars, percentage of basolaterally localized protein.

Mutation of HA Cys-543 to a tyrosine creates an overlapping sorting and internalization sequence that directs the polypeptide to the basolateral membrane of MDCK cells (12Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Immunoperoxidase-stained electron micrographs of LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing either the wild type HA protein or HA-Y543 are depicted in Fig. 2, A and B. HA-Y543 is predominately intracellular, consistent with its steady state distribution in MDCK cells (12Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). HA-Y543 is localized to the apical domain (Fig. 2 B) when surface staining is detected in cells selected for low level expression. Polarized distribution is lost when HA-Y543 is expressed at high levels (data not shown). Recent work demonstrates that the tyrosine-motif in HA-Y543 (YRIC) constitutes a relatively weak signal, which accounts for the loss of polarity at high levels of expression (32Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3928-3933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3H. Y. Naim and M. G. Roth, unpublished observations. The observations that the same proteins were sorted to distinct domains in cell lines resembling different nephron segments might reflect functional differences in the apical membranes of those cell types. Many tyrosine-based motifs contain overlapping information for intracellular sorting and for internalization from the plasma membrane (9Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Leitinger B. Weiss M. Huggel K. Griffiths G. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20772-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C.

Localization of proteins containing these motifs to the opposite surfaces in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells may reflect different capacities for endocytosis at these membrane domains in the two cell types. To test this hypothesis, the relative apical and basolateral rates of endocytosis of HA-Y543 were determined in the MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells. Cells grown on polycarbonate filters were labeled with 35S-Met and Cys and chased for 2 h. The cells were then cooled to 4 °C and anti-HA antibody added to either the apical or the basolateral medium. After warming the filters to 37 °C for 1 min, surface bound Ab was removed by the addition of trypsin to the medium compartments. Internalized HA-Y543 was immunoprecipitated and the resulting SDS-PAGE bands quantified. In MDCK cells, apical endocytosis occurs at only 14% of the rate of basolateral endocytosis (Table I). However, in LLC-PK1 cells, the apical surface is considerably more endocytically active, with internalization occurring at 41% of the basolateral rate (Table I).Table IInternalization of HA-Y543 in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cellsCell typeApicalBasolateralMDCK1.3 ± 0.38.8 ± 0.6 n = 3LLC-PK17.0 ± 0.617.1 ± 1.1 n = 3Values are the percent of HA-Y543 present at the designated surface domain internalized after 1 min. Open table in a new tab Values are the percent of HA-Y543 present at the designated surface domain internalized after 1 min. To determine whether the tyrosine-dependent sequence motifs play a role in sorting to the different membrane domains of the MDCK and LLC-PK1 cell lines, a chimera between the H,K-ATPase and the Na,K-ATPase β subunits was created. The Na,K-ATPase β subunit does not contain an equivalent tyrosine-based motif. The βN28H chimera replaces the cytoplasmic tail of the H,K-ATPase β subunit, excluding the three amino acids immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain, with the cytoplasmic tail of the Na,K-ATPase β subunit. The βH-Y20A construct mutates Tyr-20 to an alanine. Similar point mutations in other proteins have been shown to significantly reduce the capacity of this motif for internalization (33Alvarez E. Girones N. Davis R.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 267: 31-35Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This mutation also disrupts internalization of the functional gastric H,K-ATPase holoenzyme from the surfaces of gastric parietal cellsin vivo when it is expressed in transgenic mice (35Courtois-Coutry N. Roush D. Rajendran V. McCarthy J.B. Geibel J. Kashgarian M. Caplan M.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The constructs are depicted in Fig. 3. These constructs were stably transfected into the MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells lines and their steady state distributions determined as described for the wild type H,K-ATPase β subunit. In MDCK cells, significant fractions of both the βN28H and βH-Y20A chimeras were localized at steady state to the apical membrane domain (Fig. 4, A–D). This observation supports our hypothesis that sorting information is contained within the cytoplasmic tail and, more specifically, within the tyrosine-based sorting motif of the H,K-ATPase β subunit. Cell surface biotinylation confirms the steady state localization of the β subunit chimeras to both the apical and basolateral me"

In the mutantsmnn2 and mnn5, the addition of the first and second of these two mannoses, respectively, is defective. In this paper, we report the identification of the genes corresponding to these mutations. The two genes encode closely related proteins with distant homology to the known Mnn1p α-1,3-mannosyltransferase. We show that these proteins are localized in an early compartment of the yeast Golgi and that they are not physically associated with each other or with the two protein complexes known to be involved in synthesizing the α-1,6-linked backbone.

The N-linked oligosaccharides on the glycoproteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exist in two major forms, which differ in the length of a mannose outer chain attached to theN-linked core (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 2Orlean P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar). The glycoproteins of the internal compartments have a single α-1,6-linked mannose attached to one arm of the core, to which two or three further mannoses may be added (3Ballou L. Hernandez L.M. Alvarado E. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3368-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,4Trimble R.B. Atkinson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9815-9824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, many of the proteins of the cell wall and periplasmic space have attached at the same position a large “mannan” structure of up to 200 mannoses. This consists of a long α-1,6-linked backbone with branches of up to three residues in length, the first two being α-1,2-linked and the final one being α-1,3-linked (Fig. 1 A) (1Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 3Ballou L. Hernandez L.M. Alvarado E. Ballou C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, a phosphomannose residue is attached to the first mannose on some of the branches. The large amount of mannose in this structure results in mannoproteins being 40% of the dry weight of the cell wall (6Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). These mannans are thought to shield the cell from digestive enzymes and neutralizing antibodies, to contribute to cell wall integrity, and to serve as ligands for cell-cell associations such as flocculation and host cell attachment during invasive growth (6Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 7Stratford M. Yeast. 1992; 8: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Calderone R.A. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the soluble proteins of the periplasmic space, the large sugar structures may prevent loss through the cell wall by contributing to hydrodynamic volume. Similar large mannose-containing oligosaccharides are also found on the cell wall proteins of many fungi and yeasts including Aspergillus, Candida, Fusarium, Schizosaccharomyces, and Trichophyton, suggesting that they are a general feature of yeast and fungi (9Shibata N. Ikuta K. Imai T. Satoh Y. Satoh R. Suzuki A. Kojima C. Kobayashi H. Hisamichi K. Suzuki S. J. Biol.

The backbone is usually α-1,6-linked mannose, and the first branch is usually an α-1,2-linked mannose, but the rest of the side chain varies greatly between species. Mannoses of varying number can be present in a variety of linkages, and other sugars can be incorporated including N-acetylglucosamine and galactose. This variation of the side chain may reflect evolutionary pressures to evade cell wall-digesting hydrolases, immune responses, and sugar-binding killer toxins from other yeasts. As well as having its own biological relevance, the synthesis of yeast mannan provides as a model system to study how cells make the large and complex carbohydrate structures found in many other species such as the glycosaminylglycans of animals and the hemicelluloses and pectins of plants. Like yeast mannans, these molecules have a long backbone carrying diverse modifications and are synthesized in the secretory pathway rather than being directly extruded through the plasma membrane. Understanding of the mechanism of S. cerevisiaemannan synthesis has come from both genetic and biochemical studies. Conditional mutations that block the yeast secretory pathway have allowed the delineation of the processing steps into the different compartments of the pathway (14Novick P. Ferro S. Schekman R. Cell. 1981; 25: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 15Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, several genetic screens have identified yeast mutations that cause defects in the synthesis of mannan including the mnn (mannan),och (outer chain), ngd(N-glycosylation defective), and ldb (low dye binding) sets of mutants (16Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 17Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck A. Kopetzki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Nagasu T. Shimma Y.I. Nakanishi Y. Kuromitsu J. Iwama K. Nakayama K.I. Suzuki K. Jigami Y. Yeast. 1992; 8: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Manas P. Olivero I. Avalos M. Hernandez L.M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been possible to identify mannosyltransferase activities in yeast extracts and, in some cases, correlate these to the products of genes identified in the above screens (20Verostek M.F. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Häusler A. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6846-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). From these studies, a basic pathway has emerged. The core structure of the N-linked glycan is attached to nascent proteins in the ER1 and, as in mammals, is trimmed to Man8GlcNAc2 before the proteins leave the ER (22Esmon B. Esmon P.C. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10322-10327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon arrival in the Golgi, a single α-1,6-linked mannose is initially added to all of the core structures by the Och1p transferase (17Lehle L. Eiden A. Lehnert K. Haselbeck A. Kopetzki E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Nakayama K. Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Kuromitsu J. Jigami Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2511-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Then, on a subset of proteins, this mannose is extended to a long α-1,6-mannose backbone by two complexes of proteins. The first contains Mnn9p and Van1p, and the second contains Mnn9p, Anp1p, Hoc1p, and Mnn11p (24Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). At present, it is not clear if all these proteins are α-1,6-mannosyltransferases, but both complexes possess such activity. What causes the Mnn9p-Van1p complex to only initiate this backbone on a subset of yeast glycoproteins is not understood, but it presumably reflects recognition of some feature of the proteins themselves. Of the enzymes involved in synthesizing the mannose branches, that responsible for adding the final α-1,3-linked mannose has been identified as the product of the MNN1 gene (20Verostek M.F. Trimble R.B. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. MacKay V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Some of the branches also receive phosphomannan groups, and there is evidence that the MNN6 gene product is responsible for this addition (27Wang X.-H. Nakayama K. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18117-18124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, the enzymes responsible for attaching the two first α-1,2-linked mannoses of the branches are at present unknown. However, two of the mnn mutations specifically affect these steps. Thus, the mnn2 mutant is defective in the addition of the first α-1,2-linked mannose as it has no branches on the backbone (Fig. 1 A). Likewise, the mnn5mutant is defective in the addition of the second mannose as the branches on its mannan consist of a single α-1,2-linked mannose. In this paper, we report the identification of the MNN2 and MNN5 genes and show that they encode proteins that are related to the Mnn1p mannosyltransferase and that are located in the early Golgi of yeast. Standard protocols were used for the growth and mating of yeast strains, transformation by the lithium acetate method, and preparation of genomic DNA and alcian blue staining (16Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). The wild-type strain used was SEY6210 (Matαura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3, 112 trp-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9) (29Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1980; 255: 7700-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). YBR015c and YJL186w were either disrupted by replacing the entire ORF, or epitope tagged precisely at the C terminus using homologous recombination with appropriate polymerase chain reaction products containing theSchizosaccharomyces pombe HIS5 or Kluyveromyces lactis URA3 genes; polymerase chain reaction was used to check the integrants (32Baudin A.

Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagging integrations added the amino acid sequence GAGAG followed by either three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) tag or nine copies of the Myc tag. For COOH-terminal protein A fusions, polymerase chain reaction products were amplified from plasmid pZZ-HIS5, which contains the HIS5 marker and encodes a linker sequence starting GAGAGASENLYFQGAHDEAVDNK …, where SENLYFQ/G is the TEV protease cleavage site (34Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and VDNK is the start of the first of two synthetic protein A “Z” domains (35Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahmsen L. Elmblad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged invertase, Mnn1p, Mnt1p were expressed in strains using an integration plasmid or CEN plasmids, respectively (26Wiggins C.A.W. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 36Dean N. Poster J.B. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Myc epitope tag was detected with mouse monoclonal 9E10; the HA tag was detected with mouse monoclonal 12CA5 or rat monoclonal 3F10 (Boehringer Mannheim). In addition, rabbit antisera against both tags (Santa Cruz), Anp1p (24Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and α-1,6 mannose (37Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), were used for protein blotting and immunofluorescence. Total yeast proteins were prepared by resuspending cells at 1 A 600 unit per 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, vortexing with glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) for 5 min at 4 °C, and denaturing for 5 min at 65 °C. For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoresed onto nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% dried milk. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (38Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rat Ig (Southern Biotech., 1/50) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1/700) and a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Yeast cell growth was stopped in log phase by addition of 10 mm sodium azide, and 50 A 600 units of cells were resuspended in 5 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 9.4, 10 mm sodium azide and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of spheroplasting solution (1m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium azide, 100 units of zymolyase (20T, ICN)) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, or until spheroplasting was complete. Spheroplasts were then washed in spheroplasting solution without zymolyase at 4 °C and lysed at 4 °C for 30 min by gentle rolling in 1 ml of T/D/I buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin, 2 mm EDTA supplemented by protease inhibitors). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C (10 min at 14,000 × g), and the supernatant was precleared by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 12CA5 immunoprecipitations or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 9E10. Antibody was then added (12CA5, 3.8 μg/ml or 9E10 2.7 μg/ml) followed after 2–4 h by 12.5 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose; complexes were precipitated by gentle agitation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed in T/D/I buffer and either eluted with SDS sample buffer at 65 °C for 5 min or used directly for mannosyltransferase assays. For preparative scale isolation of protein A fusions, spheroplasting and lysis was carried out as above using 1000A 600 units of cells with the volumes of buffers scaled up accordingly. After lysis and subsequent pelleting of cell debris at 14,000 × g, the supernatant was removed, and 25 μl of IgG-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. After binding overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking, the beads were washed at 4 °C (four times in 1 h in 1 ml of T/D/I buffer, with gentle agitation). The beads were then resuspended in 50 μl of T/D/I buffer containing 10 units of TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Cleaved product was separated from the beads by pelleting the beads in a microfuge and removing the supernatant. This step was repeated several times to ensure no beads were carried over. For Endo H treatment, the samples were diluted to 1 × SDS sample buffer and heated at 65 °C for 5 min. The denatured samples were then diluted 5-fold and made 50 mm phosphate-citrate (pH 5.9), 0.1% Nonidet P-40. 500 units of Endo H (New England Biolabs) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Protein was then precipitated by methanol/chloroform extraction, resuspended in SDS buffer by sonication, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After Coomassie staining, gel slices were excised and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic fragment masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry using a Perceptive Voyager mass spectrometer (39Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Mannosyltransferase assays on beads were essentially a modified version of that used by Nakajima and Ballou, as described previously (24Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 40Nakajima T. Ballou C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein A fusions precipitated on IgG-Sepharose beads were washed once with T/D/I buffer (4 °C, 15 min) and once briefly with buffer II (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 0.4% digitonin, 10 mm MnCl2). Then, 50 μl of buffer II was added to the beads, supplemented by 0.6 mm GDP-d-mannose, 10 mmα-1,6-d-mannobiose (Dextra Labs), 62 nCi GDP-d-[U-14C]mannose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the mixture was gently agitated for 2 h at 30 °C. For reactions lacking Mn2+, MnCl2 was also omitted from the buffer II wash. Reactions were terminated by applying the supernatant of the mixture to a 0.5 × 5-cm Dowex 1-X8 column, eluting the neutral reaction products with 800 μl of water, and their radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Neither the MNN2 gene nor the MNN5 gene has been correlated to an ORF in the sequence of the complete yeast genome. However, the mnn2 locus was mapped to chromosome II, between the centromere and gal1 (41Ballou D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 616-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of this section of chromosome II reveals 19 ORFs, and we examined them for homology to known glycosyltransferases. Only ORF YBR015c has such a homology, a distant relationship to Mnn1p, an α-1,3-mannosyltransferase of the yeast Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1 B). Like Mnn1p, the protein encoded by YBR015c has a single amino-terminal transmembrane domain and a predicted type II orientation, as seen for all known Golgi glycosyltransferases in both mammals and yeast. Indeed, when this ORF was sequenced as part of the genome project, it was also given the description TTP1 for type II protein (42Romero P.A. Athanassiadis A. Lussier M. Herscovics A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Mnn1p has three close homologues in the yeast genome of unknown function, and searching the data bases with the sequence of YBR015c revealed homology to these, but also to a second ORF, YJL186w, that was much closer to YBR015c than the Mnn1p family. In addition, there is an ORF in Pichia pastoris that is closer to YBR015c and YJL186w than toMNN1 (Fig. 1 B). Finally, it has been observed recently that the activity of Mnn1p requires an aspartate-containing motif (26Wiggins C.A.W. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This motif is found to be conserved in many families of glycosyltransferases, and it is also conserved in YBR015c and YJL186w (Fig. 1 B). These observations suggested that YBR015c was a good candidate to be MNN2, and as mnn2 and mnn5 both affect the addition of an α-1,2-linked mannose, it seemed possible that the closely related ORF YJL186w might beMNN5. To examine the possibility that the ORFs YBR015c and YJL186w correspond to MNN2 and MNN5, we made disruptants of the genes in a haploid background and examined the resulting phenotypes. Both deletion strains were viable with no obvious growth defect. One characteristic of the mnn2, but not themnn5, mutation is that the loss of branches on the α-1,6-linked backbone results in greatly increased binding by anti-α-1,6-mannose antisera (31Cohen R.E. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7700-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that when total proteins from the stains are separated on a protein gel, blotted, and probed with an anti-α-1,6 antisera, greatly increased antibody binding is seen with the ΔYBR015c strain. We also examined the mobility of the protein invertase in the deletion strains. TheN-linked glycans of invertase are modified with hypermannose structures, and the invertase in the ΔYBR015c strain showed a slightly increased mobility on an SDS gel, consistent with a defect in the N-linked mannan (Fig. 2 A). Bothmnn2 and mnn5 strains are known to show loss of binding of the cationic dye alcian blue (31Cohen R.E. Ballou L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7700-7707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ballou C.E. Kern K.A. Raschke W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4667-4673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to an absence of phosphate in the mannan structure, apparently caused by the branches being too short for recognition by the phosphomannose-transferase. Fig. 2 C shows that the staining of cells by alcian blue is greatly reduced by deletion of either YBR015c or YJL186w. Thus, deletion of YBR015c results in an exposed α-1,6 backbone and a reduction in cell wall phosphate, whereas deletion of YJL186w causes only the latter defect, the same phenotypes seen with mnn2 and mnn5, respectively. To demonstrate that YBR015c and YJL186w correspond to MNN2 and MNN5, complementation tests were carried out. The deletion strains were mated with mnn2 and mnn5 strains, and the resulting diploids were examined for glycosylation defects. Fig. 2 shows that mating the mutant strains to wild type results in restoration of normal glycosylation as expected from the recessive nature of the mnn2 and mnn5mutations. In contrast, diploids from the mating of mnn2with ΔYBR015c have not recovered the low levels of anti-α-1,6 binding or high levels of alcian blue binding, indicating a failure of the YBR015c to complement the mnn2 mutation (Fig. 2,B and C). Similarly, diploids from the mating of mnn5 with ΔYJL186c do not recover high levels of alcian blue binding (Fig. 2 C). These specific losses of complementation indicate that YBR015c is allelic with MNN2and YJL186w with MNN5. From now on, we will refer to these ORFs by their original MNN gene names. To further characterize the proteins encoded byMNN2 and MNN5, triple HA epitope tags were directly inserted at the COOH terminus of the genes in the genome by homologous recombination. Immunoblots of total cellular proteins revealed that the two proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3 A). Mnn2p ran as two closely migrating bands, the upper of which disappeared upon treatment with Endo H, indicating partial use of one of three potential sites forN-linked glycosylation. Mnn5p ran as a single band that shifted c6kD upon Endo H treatment, suggesting use of at least three of the four potential glycosylation sites. After Endo H treatment, a minor slower migrating band was also visible, suggesting a small degree of modification by O-linked glycosylation. The apparent molecular weights of deglycosylated Mnn2p-HA and Mnn5p-HA (72 and 69 kDa) correspond closely to their predicted sizes (71.8 and 71.3 kDa, respectively). Examination of the intracellular localization of Mnn2p and Mnn5p by immunofluorescence showed that both proteins were distributed in a punctate pattern characteristic of yeast Golgi (Fig. 3 B). Double label immunofluorescence showed that for both proteins, these spots showed substantial colocalization with the cis Golgi protein Anp1p, but not with the medial Golgi proteins Mnn1p and Mnt1p (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). The distribution of Mnn2p and Mnn5p were compared by tagging them with different epitope tags, and a high degree of colocalization was observed. The distribution of Anp1p and of Mnn2p or Mnn5p was never absolutely identical, with occasional spots being positive for only one or the other marker. A similar situation has been observed for other yeast Golgi proteins in both the cis and medialcompartments, and this presumably reflects the rapid recycling and movement of resident proteins within the Golgi stack (24Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Ketela T. Bussey H. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 985-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Golgi proteins involved in synthesizing the α-1,6-linked mannan backbone are found in two multi-protein complexes, which share Mnn9p as a common component (24Jungmann J. Munro S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Since Mnn2p and Mnn5p are apparently required for the next steps in mannan synthesis, we were interested to determine if these proteins are associated with either of these Mnn9p-containing complexes or, indeed, with any other Golgi proteins. Thus, the epitope-tagged Mnn2p and Mnn5p were immunoprecipitated from cells lysed with the mild detergent digitonin, and the immunoprecipitates were blotted for the presence of known Golgi enzymes. Fig. 4 Ashows that precipitation of Mnn2p or of Mnn5p did not result in the coprecipitation of either Van1p or Anp1p, components of the two complexes that synthesize the α-1,6-linked backbone. Likewise, neither Mnn2p nor Mnn5p showed association with either Mnn1p, which adds the α-1,3-linked mannose to the α-1,2-linked mannose that is missing in the mnn5 mutant, or with Mnt1p, an α-1,2-mannosyltransferase that modifies O-linked glycans. Finally, examination of a strain expressing epitope-tagged forms of both Mnn2p and Mnn5p showed that when one is precipitated, the other does not coprecipitate (Fig. 4 B). Thus, it seems that neither Mnn2p nor Mnn5p associates with other Golgi enzymes involved in mannan synthesis. To investigate whether these proteins have any binding partners, a different system for precipitation was used that gives low background even with mild detergent conditions. To achieve this, a protein A tag was inserted at the COOH terminus of both MNN2 and MNN5 (Fig. 5 A). The linker between the ORF and the protein A contains a cleavage site for the sequence-specific protease from TEV (34Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein A fusions can be precipitated from digitonin-solubilized cells on IgG-Sepharose, washed, and then eluted with TEV protease under non-denaturing conditions. This elution method releases the tagged protein and any binding partners while leaving behind the proteins stuck nonspecifically to the beads, thereby minimizing the background. Fig. 5 B shows the results of such a precipitation performed with protein A-tagged Mnn2p and Mnn5p. When the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue, a single predominant band was observed in both cases, suggesting that neither protein is stoichiometrically associated with a second component. For both proteins, an additional faint band could be seen that was specific to the precipitated protein (Fig. 5 B). To identify these bands and to confirm the identity of the major band, they were excised from the gel and digested in the gel slice with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The masses of the tryptic fragments confirmed that the major bands were indeed Mnn2p and Mnn5p. In addition, the minor band migrating ahead of Mnn2p produced tryptic peptides characteristic of Mnn2p, suggesting that it"

Alterations in the patterns of gene expression occur in cells in response to environmental challenges or stresses. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, response to a diverse spectrum of stresses is mediated via a pentanucleotide element, STRE1 (STressResponse Element; C4T), and the transcriptional activator proteins, Msn2p and Msn4p (1Martinez-Pastor M.T.

A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Several genes have been shown to be regulated via the Msn2p/Msn4p/STRE pathway. Molecular analyses of the upstream region of the DDR2 has shown that stress regulation occurred exclusively via the STRE (3Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4036-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) transcription induction is mediated by sequences containing STREs. The promoter regions of these genes contain multiple STREs, which function independently of their orientation relative to the TATA box (3Kobayashi N. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that the STREs are not only necessary but are sufficient for mediating the multistress response. A synthetic STRE-containing oligonucleotide with altered spacing between two STREs and changes in the flanking sequence conferred multistress control to an Escherichia coli galKreporter gene following 10 different stress conditions. The pattern of stress responses was similar to the response of oligonucleotide 31/32 derived from the DDR2 gene (4Treger J.M. Magee T.R. McEntee K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have used this structural and functional information as the basis for a computer search of the entire yeast genome and have generated a list of 186 potential STRE-regulated genes. Using Northern hybridization to analyze the regulation of eight of these genes, we show that three of these loci are stress-regulated and require Msn2p/Msn4p for their activation. Among the genes identified in the STRE pattern search were several yeast heat shock protein (HSP) genes assumed to be regulated exclusively via the heat shock factor/heat shock element (HSF/HSE) pathway. Using a series of multiple regulatory mutants, we demonstrate that several HSP genes are redundantly controlled by both the Msn2p (Msn4p)/STRE and HSF/HSE pathways following heat shock.

McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3174-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The sporulated culture was treated exhaustively with glusulase to disrupt the asci and vortexed with glass beads to separate the spores (10Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The spores were plated onto SC his−, SC ura−, and SC his−ura− plates to recover msn2Δ, msn4Δ, and msn2Δ msn4Δ haploid strains, respectively. From each mating and subsequent sporulation, 20 red ade− haploid colonies were isolated, restreaked to isolate individual colonies, and patched to SC plates lacking one of several nutrients to determine their phenotypes. The resulting strains, JT616 (msn2Δ), JT620 (msn4Δ), and JT624 (msn2Δ, msn4Δ), were subsequently mated to strain MYY385 (mas3) to generate diploid strains JT628, JT629, and JT632, respectively. These three strains were sporulated and haploid ade− colonies containing the appropriate markers were identified as described above. The presence of the disrupted msn2Δ and msn4Δalleles was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis of genomic DNA. Temperature-sensitive growth at 37 °C and the loss of heat shock induction of the SSA3 transcript were scored to confirm the presence of the mas3 mutation. Cells were subjected to stress treatment as described previously (4Treger J.M. Magee T.R. McEntee K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to 0.07% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) for 60 min. For post-diauxic shift (PDS), cells were harvested 1–2 h after the diauxic shift from fermentative to respiratory growth. The diauxic shift was determined by monitoring optical density of the culture and was reached approximately 12–14 h after the control sample was harvested at a cell density of ∼7 × 106 cells/ml. For heat shock (HS) treatment, cultures were grown at 23 °C, and an aliquot was shifted to 37 °C for 20 min. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (11Treger J.M. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3174-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Denatured RNA (25 μg) was electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. RNA blots were UV-cross-linked and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled probes and washed as described (4Treger J.M. Magee T.R. McEntee K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Northern blots were exposed to x-ray film and quantitated using an Ambis radio-imager system (Scanalytics). The probes used for hybridization were the 1.45-kb HindIII fragment of DDR2 from plasmid pBRA2 (12McClanahan T. McEntee K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2356-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the 1.3-kbPstI-BglII fragment of HSP26 from plasmid pS26-1 (S. Lindquist); the 3.2-kb HindIII fragment of UBI4 from plasmid pUC-UBI4, the 1.3-kb HindIII fragment of HSP78 from pLS12 (T. Mason), and the 1.4-kbHindIII-SstI fragment of HSP104 from plasmid pYS104 (13Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The remaining probes were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from selected coding regions of appropriate genes using genomic DNA from individual M12B colonies as templates. The regions amplified were: nucleotides +1 to +714 of ACT1, +142 to +768 of PGM2, +599 to +1120 of PDE2, +249 to +694 of YKL151C, +44 to +501 of RPB4, +1558 to +1930 of SSA3, +1 to +326 of HSP12, and +1 to +424 of HSP82. The PatScan pattern matcher, maintained at Argonne National Laboratory (http://www-c.mcs.anl.gov/home/overbeek/PatScan/HTML/patscan.html), was used to search the yeast genome for candidate STRE-regulated genes. The search was performed against both strands of the entire genomic sequence of S. cerevisiae accessed from the EBI nucleotide sequence data base (Release 49). The following pattern was used for the search: CCCCT 1 … 200 CCCCT 1 … 300 TATA in which letters represent direct matches to nucleotides and numerals represent an interval between x and y nucleotides. We demonstrated previously that C4T pentanucleotides function as stress response elements independently of nucleotide sequence context or spacing (4Treger J.M. Magee T.R. McEntee K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that we could identify stress-controlled genes based upon the presence of multiple upstream STREs. Using a computer-aided pattern matching strategy, we searched the fully sequenced S. cerevisiae genome for candidate genes containing two or more STREs separated by up to 200 bp and lying within 300 bp of a TATA sequence. The search returned approximately 350 matches and of these, 186 matches were found to define groups of STREs located immediately upstream of characterized genes or predicted open reading frames (within 500 bp of the translation start). Eighty-three of these candidates corresponded to known yeast genes, while the remaining 103 sequences represented uncharacterized open reading frames. A diverse group of genes was identified, including those encoding mitochondrially localized gene products (CIT1, MCR1, and MDH1), known or predicted transporter proteins (GAL2, MEP1, PUT4, and YGR224W), known or predicted proteases (PAI3, PRC1, STE23, and YBR139W), homologs of DnaJ (MDJ1, YNL077W, and YPR061C) and several HSP genes (HSP12, HSP26, HSP42, HSP78, and HSP104). Eight candidates (PDE2, PGM2, RAS2, RPA14, RPB4, SMC2, YGR067C, and YKL151C; see Table II) were selected and tested for STRE control by Northern hybridization analysis. Genes under STRE control exhibit the following characteristics: (i) transcript levels are elevated after heat shock, DNA damage, or other stresses; (ii) stress induction is curtailed or greatly reduced in strains that lack the STRE-binding transcription factors, Msn2p and Msn4p; and (iii) basal transcript levels are significantly elevated in a strain overexpressing Msn2p (2Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, three of the eight candidates tested (PDE2, PGM2, and YKL151C) were found to be STRE-regulated (Fig. 1).Table IIGenes examined for STRE-regulation and the location of the STREs in the promoterCandidateSTREsRef.PDE2(3′,5′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase)−135, −289, −33626Sass P.

Boucherie H. Jacquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that 39 proteins induced during diauxic shift are dependent upon Msn2p/Msn4p for their expression. Among the genes identified are several that were found in our pattern search, includingHSP104, HXK1, PGM2, TPS1, and YBR149W. These results reinforce the notion of a large family of yeast stress genes that are co-regulated via conserved STREs. Transcription of the PDE2, PGM2, and YKL151C genes was stress-inducible in the wild-type strain, but no transcripts accumulated in the msn2Δ msn4Δ double mutant strain following stress. However, each STRE-controlled gene exhibited different characteristics with respect to stress induction in the various yeast mutants examined. Stress induction of PGM2transcripts was completely abolished, even in the msn2Δsingle mutant strain. This result contrasted with the results observed for other genes, which showed residual levels of induction in themsn2Δ mutant strain. DDR2, the positive control, exhibited residual heat shock induction in themsn2Δ mutant strain, a result that agrees with earlier studies (2Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). YKL151C transcript induction appeared more complex. Stress induction was clearly reduced in the msn2Δ strain, but was not abolished unless both MSN2 and MSN4 genes were disrupted. The PDE2 gene exhibited a behavior that was unique among all STRE-controlled genes studied. Stress induction of its transcripts appeared completely refractory to the msn2Δdisruption, while accumulation was abolished in the msn2Δ msn4Δ double mutant strain. Previous studies showed that overexpression of Msn4p partially suppressed the defect in transcript induction occurring in an msn2Δ strain (2Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, the dominance of Msn4p in the regulation of PDE2 demonstrates the role of the MSN4 gene in STRE-regulated gene expression when it is present as a single chromosomal copy. Thus, there appears to be substantial variation in the relative contribution of Msn2pversus Msn4p in the transcriptional control of different STRE-regulated genes. Perhaps with the characterization of more STRE-controlled genes from the pool of candidates, regulatory patterns will emerge that will allow prediction of MSN2 versus MSN4 control based on sequence characteristics among and around the STRE elements. Five genes encoding known heat shock proteins were identified in the pattern search for STRE-controlled genes (HSP12, HSP26, HSP42, HSP78, and HSP104). Significantly, the promoters of these genes contain HSEs, which have been shown to be required for heat shock activation of several genes in yeast and higher eukaryotes (15Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5745-5751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Leonhardt S.A. Fearson K. Danese P.N. Mason T.L. Mol. Cell.

To evaluate the contribution of the STREs to HSP gene regulation, we constructed a series of regulatory mutant strains containing the msn2Δ, msn4Δ, and mas3(hsf1) mutations, singly or in combination. As reported previously (2Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), heat shock induction of DDR2 transcription was solely regulated by the STRE pathway as judged by Northern blots of RNAs from these different regulatory mutants (Fig. 2; Table III). For the SSA3 gene, encoding an Hsp70 cognate, regulation by heat shock was mediated exclusively through a functional HSF gene and showed no requirement for Msn2p or Msn4p. This result is consistent with earlier studies (19Boorstein W.R. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,20Boorstein W.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3262-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The two small HSPs, HSP12 and HSP26, showed differential requirements for the STRE and HSE pathways.HSP12 was predominantly regulated via Msn2p/STRE after heat shock with very little heat shock induction attributable to the HSF/HSE pathway. Conversely, regulation of HSP26 expression after heat shock occurred predominantly via HSF/HSE with little contribution to heat shock regulation through its STREs. In each case, however, transcript accumulation was completely abolished following heat shock exposure of the triple mutant strain (msn2Δ, msn4Δ, mas3; Fig. 2; Table III). Thus, these two pathways accounted for all the heat shock induction of transcripts from these two genes.Table IIIQuantitation of the transcript levels of HSP genes following heat shock induction in mutant strainsWild-typemas3msn2Δmsn4Δmas3 msn2Δmas3 msn4Δmsn2Δ msn4Δmas3 msn2Δ msn4ΔDDR2100881975189612SSA31002709213562HSP121005329113766101HSP2610075495413571UBI410059729253586946HSP78100668116168707632HSP104100827113757636717HSP82100597313261408380The Northern blots used in Fig. 2 were quantified using an Ambis radioimager.

Open table in a new tab The Northern blots used in Fig. 2 were quantified using an Ambis radioimager. The amount of message for each gene was normalized to the amount of actin message present in each lane. The normalized amount of message remaining in each lane was expressed as a percentage of the wild-type set as 100%. For two HSP genes, HSP78 and HSP104, and the stress-regulated polyubiquitin gene, UBI4, we observed that heat shock induction was redundantly regulated by the two pathways. As shown in Fig. 2, each pathway alone was capable of activating transcription to nearly wild-type levels. When both pathways were inactivated in the triple mutant strain, however, there was a substantial decrease in the accumulation of these transcripts following heat shock. However, for each of these genes, unlike HSP12and HSP26, there was residual transcript accumulation in the triple mutant suggesting that additional transcriptional activators or pathways are involved in stress activation of these genes (Fig. 2; Table III). Surprisingly, for the HSP82 gene, inactivation of both the Msn2p(Msn4p)/STRE and HSF/HSE pathways had relatively little effect on transcript accumulation following heat shock (Fig. 2; Table III). There was negligible contribution to the heat shock regulation of theHSP82 gene by the Msn2p(Msn4p)/STRE pathway, while themas3 mutation reduced HSP82 heat shock-induced transcript levels by about 40%. Thus, it appears that the Msn2p(Msn4p)/STRE pathway plays no role in heat shock induction of theHSP82 gene and that the HSF/HSE pathway plays a less significant role in HSP82 regulation following heat shock than previously thought (21Gross D.S. Adams C.C. English K.E. Collins K.W. Lee S. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The mas3 mutation, originally isolated by Smith and Yaffe (22Smith B.J. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2647-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) based upon its temperature-sensitive defect in mitochondrial protein import, is an amber mutation located in the portion of the gene encoding the trimerization domain of HSF. This mutation is suppressed in yeast strain MYY385 by an uncharacterized nonsense suppressor, which renders the protein thermolabile. The temperature-sensitive phenotype can be recapitulated by site-directed mutagenesis of the position corresponding to the mas3 amber mutation within the HSF trimerization domain. Moreover, HSF protein levels remain unchanged after heat shock of the mas3mutant. 2M. P. Yaffe, personal communication. These results indicate that the temperature sensitivity associated with themas3 allele is due to an intrinsic thermolability of this mutant transcription factor. The residual accumulation of transcripts following heat shock of themas3 mutant strains is not likely to result from incomplete inactivation of HSF upon the temperature shift. HSF contains two regions responsible for transcription activation following heat shock stress (23Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thiele and co-workers (24Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have shown that CUP1transcription is induced by heat shock and requires a carboxyl-terminal activation domain in HSF, while heat shock activation of SSA3 gene expression requires an amino-terminal activation domain (23Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the mas3 mutation inactivates both domains as shown by the failure to induceSSA3 transcription following heat shock (Fig. 2) and our finding that the mas3 allele blocks CUP1expression at 39 °C (data not shown). Taken together, these results argue that the transcript accumulation observed in the mas3mutants was not due to residual HSF activity but was due to a distinct regulatory mechanism(s). The redundant nature of HSP gene regulation following heat shock was demonstrated using the multiple regulatory mutant strains we constructed. Indeed, there were several HSP genes where inactivation of all three transcription factors (HSF, Msn2p, and Msn4p) did not completely abolish transcript induction. Several explanations for the residual accumulation of transcripts in the msn2Δ msn4Δ mas3 triple mutant are possible. First, a third independent stress regulatory pathway might account for heat shock induced expression of these genes. However, sequence comparisons of the upstream region of several of these genes did not reveal any consensus elements, other than the HSEs and STREs, which might identify this hypothetical pathway (data not shown). Second, it remains possible that the observed transcript levels increased because of transcript stabilization rather than increased transcriptional initiation. Such a mechanism might be expected to produce kinetic differences in the rates of transcript accumulation between mutant and wild-type cells. Our preliminary results indicate that there were no meaningful differences in the kinetics of transcript accumulation between the mas3 mutant and wild-type (data not shown). Last, residual transcripts may result from the action of another transcription factor acting through the STRE. Consistent with this explanation, we have obtained preliminary evidence that all HSF-independent heat shock-induced transcription of the UBI4 gene requires at least one intact STRE (data not shown). One candidate for this putative transcription factor (YER169W) was identified during an expression library screening using an STRE-containing oligonucleotide (2Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This factor bound STREs specifically but is structurally unrelated to Msn2p except for the presence of a zinc finger domain. However, disruption of YER169W, singly or in combination with mutations in the HSF1, MSN2, and MSN4 genes, had little or no effect on heat shock induction of several STRE-containing genes (data not shown). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more additional zinc finger transcription factors act to control residual-induced expression of these stress response genes. Transcription of five candidate genes identified from the computer pattern search was noninducible following heat shock or MMS and showed no dependence upon MSN2 or MSN4 for their expression (data not shown). Additionally, the STREs in theHSP26 promoter were not functional following heat shock. To determine whether the STREs might function in response to different stress conditions, we tested the requirement for Msn2p and Msn4p for transcriptional activation of the HSP26 gene during PDS growth. As seen in Fig. 3, the transcriptional induction of the HSP26 gene during PDS was dependent on the Msn2p and Msn4p transcriptional activators. Furthermore, carbon source starvation induction of HSP26required the Msn2p (Msn4p)/STRE pathway (1Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Similarly, Inoue et al. (25Inoue Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2977-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that GLO1-lacZ expression was controlled via the Msn2p/Msn4p pathway only following osmotic shock. There was no inducible expression of the same GLO1-lacZfusion gene by other stresses such as heat shock, ethanol, or hydrogen peroxide, which have been shown to mediate their effects on the transcription of the CTT1 and DDR2 genes via upstream STREs (1Martinez-Pastor M.T.

Thus, for some genes, such asDDR2, transcriptional control following all stress conditions tested is under the regulation of the STREs and Msn2p/Msn4p (4Treger J.M. Magee T.R. McEntee K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, function of STREs in the promoters of other genes such asHSP26 may be more limited. Presently, we do not understand the reason for the ”inactivity“ of STREs in the upstream regions of some genes following specific stresses. It is possible that the binding of additional regulatory factors to neighboring elements in the promoters of some genes, such as HSP26, may interfere with or modulate the binding of Msn2p or Msn4p to the STREs. Analysis of the STREs and their possible interactions with other promoter elements or regulatory factors should help us understand the relationship between STRE and dependence upon the Msn2p and Msn4p transcriptional regulators following stress.

We isolated a novel mouse α1,3-fucosyltransferase gene, named mFuc-TIX, from an adult mouse brain cDNA library using the expression cloning method. On flow cytometric analysis, Namalwa cells transfected stably with the mFuc-TIX gene showed a marked increase in Lewis x epitopes but not sialyl Lewis x epitopes.

Stage-specific embryonal antigen-1 (SSEA-1), having the Lex epitope at its carbohydrate chain terminus, is highly expressed in the morulae of mouse embryos and decreases rapidly after compaction. The Lex epitope on SSEA-1 is considered to play a role as a cell-cell interaction molecule during compaction. The developmentally regulated expression of the Lex(CD15-reactive) epitope in the CNS has also attracted much attention since the Lex epitope may be involved in the neurodevelopmental process. However, little is known as to which α1,3Fuc-T is responsible for the Lex synthesis in such native tissues. The α1,3Fuc-T partially purified from human neuroblastoma cells exhibited the ability of Lex and Ley synthesis, but not that of sLex synthesis, its substrate specificity being similar to that of hFuc-TIV, but quite different from those of the other four (44Foster C.F.

However, the transcript for the mFuc-TIV gene was not detected in mouse brain on Northern blot analysis (11Gersten K.M. Natsuka S. Trinchera M. Petryniak B. Kelly R.J. Hiraiwa N. Jenkins N.A.

The above results raise a possibility that the Lex epitope in the CNS may be synthesized by unknown α1,3Fuc-T(s), of which genes have not been cloned yet. In the present study, we isolated a novel α1,3Fuc-T gene from a mouse brain cDNA library by the expression cloning method and named it the mFuc-TIX (mFUT9) gene. The transcript for the mFuc-TIX gene, which was mainly expressed in brain and kidney, was apparently detected in neuronal cells but not in glial cells including astrocytes in the CNS on in situhybridization in the present study. Previous immunohistochemical studies revealed the existence of the CD15 (Lex) epitope in both neuronal cells and astrocytes (32Bartsch D. Mai J.K.

Poly(A)+-rich RNA was isolated with OligotexTM-dT30<Super> (Roche, Tokyo, Japan) from an adult BALB/c mouse brain. Complementary DNAs were synthesized with oligo(dT) primers derived from poly(A)+-rich RNA using a Superscript Choice System for cDNA Synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cDNA library was constructed by inserting size-fractionated cDNAs (more than 1.5 kb) into an expression vector, pAMo (7Sasaki K. Kurata K. Funayama K. Nagata M. Watanabe E. Ohta S. Hanai N.

We obtained about 1 × 106 independent clones as a cDNA library and extracted plasmid DNAs from the library. The expression cloning method involving Namalwa cells (human Burkitt lymphoma cells) was described in detail in our previous papers (7Sasaki K. Kurata K. Funayama K. Nagata M. Watanabe E. Ohta S. Hanai N. Nishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14730-14737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Sasaki K. Watanabe E. Kawashima K. Sekine S. Dohi T. Oshima M. Hanai N. Nishi T. Hasegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Namalwa cells were transfected with cDNAs from the cDNA library by electroporation using a Gene-Pulser (Bio-Rad) and selected in the presence of geneticin (0.6 mg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks to obtain stable transformant cells. The Namalwa cells growing after the geneticin selection were stained with an anti-Lexmonoclonal antibody (mAb) (PM-81; IgM), followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Cappel) and then cell sorting with an Epics Elite cell sorter (Coulter). The cells expressing the Lex epitope were enriched by four rounds of cell sorting. The plasmids were recovered from the Lex-positive cells by Hirt's method (56Margolskee R.F. Kavathas P. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2837-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA isolated, we excised the insert by KpnI and HindIII digestion, and then the insert was subcloned into a pBluescript SK(−) vector (pBS). Sequencing of the insert was performed by an ordinary method,i.e. the dideoxy chain termination method using an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA obtained was named murine Fuc-TIX (mFuc-TIX). Namalwa cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The pAMo plasmid DNA containing the mFuc-TIX cDNA (pAMo-mFT9) was transfected into Namalwa cells. After exposure to geneticin for 2 weeks, we established Namalwa cells which stably expressed the mFuc-TIX cDNA (Namalwa-mFT9 cells). In previous studies, we established a series of Namalwa cells stably expressing each of five different human α1,3Fuc-T genes, named Namalwa-hFT3, -hFT4, -hFT5, -hFT6, and -hFT7 cells (18Kimura H.

Shinya N. Watanabe R. Honda H. Takemura F. Narimatsu H. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated the mFuc-TIV gene by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, as described later, and inserted themFuc-TIV gene into the pAMo vector, by which we established Namalwa cells stably expressing mFuc-TIV (Namalwa-mFT4 cells). These stable transformant cells were used as controls in the following experiments in comparison with Namalwa-mFT9 cells. The mFuc-TIX and mFuc-TIV genes were subcloned into the pCDM8 vector for transient expression of the genes in COS-1 cells. The hFuc-TVI and hFuc-TIII genes, which were subcloned into the pCDM8 vector in the previous study, were also transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. The COS-1 cells transfected transiently with the respective genes were subjected to flow cytometry analysis, and the cell homogenates were used for measurement of enzyme activity toward oligosaccharides. For flow cytometry analysis, the cells were incubated with each of the mAbs, i.e. two anti-Lex mAbs, PM-81, which was a kind gift from Dr. D. Marcus, and 73–30 (IgM), which was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), an anti-sLexmAb, KM-93 (IgM), and an anti-Lewis a (Lea) mAb, 7LE (IgM), which were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo, Co., Ltd., and an anti-Ley mAb, AH-6 (IgM), which was a kind gift from Otsuka Inc. (Tokushima, Japan). After incubation with the first antibody (10 μg/ml), the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Cappel) and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis with an Epics Elite cell sorter. Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) were purchased from Oxford Gycosystems (United Kingdom) and pyridylaminated according to the method of Kondo et al. (58Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Pyridylaminated LNnT (LNnT-PA) was sialylated with the recombinant β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferase expressed in Namalwa cells (55Sasaki K. Watanabe E. Kawashima K. Sekine S. Dohi T. Oshima M.

Fifteen micrograms of pCDM8 DNA containing each gene was transfected into COS-1 cells in combination with 1 μg of the β-actin promotor-driven luciferase expression vector as an indicator of the transfection efficiency. Lysates of COS-1 cells transfected transiently with the respective genes were used for assaying the substrate specificities toward LNT-PA, LNnT-PA, and α2,3-sialyl LNnT-PA. The cells were harvested after 48 h incubation and separated into 3 aliquots. Total RNA was extracted from 1 aliquot.

Myelin and oligodendrocyte (OLG)1 are targets of immune-mediated attack in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Complement activation plays a critical role in EAE.

The complement-activating property of myelin and OLG in the absence of antibody may also play a significant role in myelin damage and functional alteration of OLG in MS (7Vanguri P.

Generation of membrane-inserted TCC can stimulate a variety of biological activities in the cell in the absence of lysis. The activities include expression of c-jun and c-fosproto-oncogenes, production of growth factors bFGF (bovine fibroblast growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), and induction of mitosis (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shearer W.T. Atkinson J.P. Frank M.M. Parker C.W. J. Exp.

Increased cytosolic Ca2+ and protein kinase C activity are primarily induced by the pore-forming complexes C5b-8 and C5b-9, and generation of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and ceramide begins at the stage of C5b-7 (14Wiedmer T.

TCC also activate heterotrimeric Gi proteins, and transduce Ras, Raf-1, MEK-1, and ERK1 pathway through the Gβγ subunits (17Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin M.L. J. Biol.

This Gβγ-mediated ERK1 signaling pathway is required for TCC to induce cell cycle (18Niculescu F. Rus H. van Biesen T. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4405-4412PubMed Google Scholar,19Rus H. Niculescu F. Badea T. Shin M.L. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Assembly of TCC in myelin activates neutral proteases, and induces hydrolysis of myelin basic protein (MBP) (20Vanguri P. Shin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7228-7234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), effects that may be responsible for demyelination of central nervous system organ cultures (21Liu W. Vanguri P. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 778-782PubMed Google Scholar). Sublytic complement attack on OLG, on the other hand, induces changes in cellular phenotype, that are potentially beneficial to the cell. These changes include enhancement of mRNA degradation encoding MBP and proteolipid protein, cell cycle induction up toS-phase, and inhibition of OLG apoptosis (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shirazi Y. Rus H.G. Macklin W.B. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4581-4590PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. We have used differential display (DD) to screen for genes expressed by OLG in response to complement activation to identify new genes that may be implicated in cell cycle activation and progression. We identified one candidate, RGC-32. In this paper, we report the structure, expression, and the putative biological activity of RCG-32 gene. O-2A (OLG progenitor cell identified by monoclonal antibody A2B5) progenitor cells, isolated by a series of differential shaking of stratified mixed glial culture, were differentiated into OLG for 3 to 4 days in defined medium (DMEM/F-12 with 500 ng/ml transferrin (Sigma), 75 ng/ml insulin (Sigma), 75 μg/ml FGF (Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, MA) and 1 mm sodium pyruvate) (22Shirazi Y. Rus H.G. Macklin W.B. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4581-4590PubMed Google Scholar). At this stage, over 90% of the cells were positive for galactocerebroside (GC) and 85% for MBP. Normal human serum (NHS) from several healthy adult donors was pooled and used as a source of complement. The hemolytic activity of complement was inactivated by heating NHS at 56 °C for 45 min (HI-NHS). Cells were exposed to sublytic complement attack by sensitizing OLG with a fixed dose of anti-GC antibody (Ab), then incubating with NHS, HI-NHS (at a final dilution of 1/10) or C7D (1/20) ± C7 (10 μg/ml) for various time periods. The sublytic doses of Ab and NHS were previously determined by measuring the release of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase as an indicator of cell death (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar, 15Carney D.F. Lang T.J. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 623-629PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shirazi Y. Rus H.G. Macklin W.B. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4581-4590PubMed Google Scholar). Oligodendrocytes were treated with Ab and NHS, as described above for 1 and 3 h. Total RNA was purified free of contaminating DNA using Message Clean kit (GenHunter Corp., Brookline, MA). The mRNA differential display was performed with RNA image kit 1 (GenHunter Corp.). Primers consist of three 1-base-anchored oligo-dT primers designated as H-T11(A, -C, -G) to subdivide the mRNA population, and the second primer set represented by arbitrary 13 mer designated as H-AP1 to H-AP7. The OLG mRNA was reverse-transcribed in three separate tubes for each RNA sample; each tube contained one of the three different 1-base-anchored H-T11 primers in the presence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT). The RT mixture was amplified using each of the anchored oligo-dT primers and seven H-AP primers, [α32P]dCTP in the presence of Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Samples (3.5 μl of each) were loaded on a 6% DNA sequencing gel, and electrophoresed for 4–5 h at 60 W. The gel was exposed to Kodak BioMax film. Bands with altered expression on autoradiogram were excised from the gel. Then the DNA was extracted, precipitated, and reamplified. Each PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transformed in TOP′10 FEscherichia coli competent cells. The purified inserts were sequenced at the University of Maryland Biopolymer Facility. The nucleotide sequence of these clones was compared with known sequences from GenBankTM Data Bank using BLASTN, TBLASTN, and BLASTX searches. We have approached the RGC-32cloning using expressed sequence tag (EST) data base homology analysis, RT-PCR, and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Relevant ESTs were identified by running the nucleotide sequence of rat RGC-32 DD against EST data base and GenBankTM through BLASTN search. The ESTs were retrieved with the ENTREZ service and aligned in a contig. Based on the cDNA sequence of ESTs identified (Table I) and RGC-32 DD cDNA sequence, two PCR primers were designed and used for RT-PCR amplification from mRNA of OLG treated with Ab and NHS for 1 h. The 3′ primer was from RGC-32 DD clone (5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTATTATGACCTCCAACT-3′) and the 5′ primer was from the EST clone aa003381 (5′-GCGGTACCACTTCCAACTATGAGGAGCA-3′), which was part of the contig. A 572-bp PCR product designated RGC-32A containing theRGC-32 DD sequence was then obtained. To clone the full-length rat RGC-32, we used Marathon RACE amplification kit (CLONTECH). Because rat RGC-32mRNA was detected during active EAE by Northern blot (data not shown), poly(A) RNA (1 μg) purified from spinal cords of EAE rats on day 19 after immunization was used for cDNA synthesis, and the second strand synthesis was followed by ligation to Marathon cDNA adaptor. The 5′ RACE was performed using the designed gene-specific primer, 5′-GTCCAGATTAGCGATGAAGTCTTCGAG-3′, together with the AP-1 primer present in the Marathon adaptor. The PCR was performed using XL PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer).Table IESTs from GenBank used in RGC-32 cloningOrganismEST no.Tissue sourceMouseaa02837519.5-day total fetusaa036075aa4337314 weeks heartaa1251674 weeks thymusaa00338113.5–14.5-day total fetusaa049111w83865 Open table in a new tab Total RNA from the spinal cord of EAE rats was examined by Northern analysis for the expression of RGC-32 mRNA. RNA was purified by ultracentrifugation through a 5.7 m CsCl cushion for 18 h at 35,000 rpm using a SW 60 Beckman rotor, fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto Nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shirazi Y. Rus H.G. Macklin W.B. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4581-4590PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was then hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe generated from theRGC-32 855-bp cDNA using the oligolabeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression of RGC-32 mRNA in primary rat OLG was determined by RT-PCR analysis, using the primers employed for the cloning of RGC-32A. In brief, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus RT in the presence of 2.5 μm oligo(dT) primer and 20 μm dNTP for 1 h at 37 °C. PCR amplification was carried out by incubating specific primers with cDNA, 1unit of Taq polymerase, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. Primers used to quantitate β-actin mRNA expression were from Stratagene. RGC-32 open reading frame was subcloned in pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with GST gene. Recombinant fusion protein (GST-RGC-32) was extracted from lysates of E. coli BL21 pLysS cells overexpressing RGC-32 open reading frame, followed by thrombin cleavage. Protein was purified by chromatography using Redipack GST purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies were raised against GST-RGC-32 by immunization of rabbits and IgG fraction of the antisera was screened by Western blot (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). OLG grown on glass coverslips were stained for RGC-32 by indirect immunoperoxidase as described previously (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). TheRGC-32 cDNA was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites pcDNA3.1His vector (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions. Expression vectors carryingRGC-32 gene (pcDNARGC-32) or empty vectors (pcDNA3.1) were then transfected into OLGxC6 glioma cell hybrids, clone ROC-1 (23Shirazi Y. McMorris A. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4385-4391PubMed Google Scholar), by CaCl2 method (24Lang T. Badea T.C. Wade R. Shin M.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine incorporation was determined as described (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). Using DD-PCR, we have identified 32 bands representing mRNAs with altered expression in response to complement activation. We designated the cDNA bands asRGC-1 to -32 according to the order of identification (Fig. 1). Most of them are mRNAs with increased expression. The nucleotide sequence of seven DD cDNA clones selected for the initial studies was compared with known sequences from GenBankTM Data Bank using BLASTN, TBLASTN, and BLASTX searches. Three clones, RGC-1, -2, and -10, identified as a part of known genes, encode murine heat shock protein 105, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and murine IP-10, respectively. Four clones, RGC-8, -30, -31, and -32, had no matches to any of the GenBankTM Data Bank entries. Initial studies onRGC-32 clone are presented. By running 175-bp rat RGC-32sequence against EST data base using BLASTN and TBLASTN searches, various ESTs showing significant homology were identified. One group of relevant EST mouse clones formed a contig (Table I), which contains an open reading frame and a putative stop codon. To obtain and confirm the DNA sequence, we amplified the fragment with a set of primers predicted by the consensus sequence derived from the EST contig. The DNA sequence of the 572-bp PCR product was identical to the sequence predicted through bioinformatics and contained the rat RGC-32 DD. To clone the full-length rat RGC-32, Marathon RACE cDNA amplification was carried out. The 5′ of the Marathon RACE reaction yielded a product of 551 bp. This segment together with the previously obtainedRGC-32 sequences formed an 889-bp cDNA. To obtain and confirm this DNA sequence, RT-PCR was performed using mRNA derived from OLG stimulated with Ab + NHS for 1 h and two primers, one in the 5′ RACE product (5′-TGAACCACCCGAGCGGAC-3′) and the other in theRGC-32 DD clone (5′-CAAAAATATATTATGATGGGAAAG-3′). The 855-bp PCR product, which represents the full-length ratRGC-32 (Fig. 2 A), contains a start codon in position 101 and encodes a protein of 137 amino acids (Fig. 2 B). The rat RGC-32 open reading frame predicted a 14.7-kDa protein. Data bank analysis showed that RGC-32 had no homology with any other proteins known to date, and contained no motif that would indicate its putative biochemical function. Therefore, RGC-32 may represent the prototype of a novel type of genes. RGC-32 does not contain signal sequences. Hydrophobicity analysis indicated no transmembrane domains. Approximately 1 kb mRNA encodingRGC-32 was expressed by adult rat kidney, heart, brain, lung, skin, spleen, and thymus, but not in testis or liver, as determined by Northern blot (Fig. 3). By Northern analysis, RGC-32 mRNA expression was observed in rat brains of EAE on day 9 through 23 following immunization (data not shown). In primary rat OLG, RGC-32 mRNA, detected by RT-PCR, showed an increased expression at 3 and 6 h following exposure to Ab + NHS (Fig. 4 A), but not with Ab + HI-NHS at 6 h (data not shown). At 18 h, the mRNA level declined below the basal level. C7D + C7 induced an increase from 1.8- to 2-fold in RGC-32 mRNA expression over the C7D level, indicating the requirement of TCC assembly (Fig. 4 B). To demonstrate that RGC-32 is indeed expressed in OLG, polyclonal anti-GST-RGC-32 antibody was raised in rabbits. By indirect immunoperoxidase, RGC-32 staining was localized to the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 5 A). By Western blot, an immunoreactive band of about 15 kDa was detected with recombinant purified RGC-32 (Fig. 5 B).Figure 4Expression of RGC-32 in oligodendrocyte determined by RT-PCR. Two-μg aliquot of total RNA was reverse transcribed. Then the expression of RGC-32(30 cycles) and β-actin (35 cycles) were examined by PCR. The amplified cDNA separated on agarose gel was visualized by autoradiography. Time course of RGC-32 mRNA expression by primary rat OLG following treatment with Ab and NHS is shown (A, upper panel). B, expression of RGC-32 by OLG treated with C7D or C7D + C7 for 3 h is shown (upper panel). The mRNA band density was determined by scanning densitometric analysis (Molecular Dynamics), and the results are presented as RGC-32/β-actin density ratio (A and B, lower panels). Data shown are representative results from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Immunostaining and immunoblot analysis of RGC-32 protein in OLG. A, immunostaining of OLG for RGC-32 protein. Cells grown on plastic slides were incubated with rabbit IgG to recombinant RGC-32 and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (RGC-32). In control immunostaining, rabbit IgG was used instead of anti-RGC-32 (CTR). B, RGC-32 recombinant protein and lysates of antibody-sensitized OLG treated with NHS or HI-NHS for the indicated time period were immunoprecipitated with anti-cdc2 IgG (anti-cdc2 IP), separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Membrane was incubated with anti-RGC-32 IgG and with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, followed by ECL (RGC-32). The membrane was stripped and then incubated with anti-cdc2 IgG (cdc2). Anti-cdc2 IgG did not react to the recombinant purified RGC-32 protein. As expected, a 34-kDa immunoreactive band representing cdc2 was detected in OLG. C, OLG treated with Ab and NHS for 3, 6, and 18 h were lysed, and the anti-RGC-32 immunoprecipitate (anti-RGC-32 IP) was examined for the presence of cdc2 and RGC-32 by Western blotting. Both cdc2 and RGC-32were present in the RGC-32 immunoprecipitate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sublytic complement activation induces OLG to enter cell cycle and an increase in cdc2 kinase activity in G1 (10Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore a possible association of RGC-32 and cell cycle kinase was examined. Unstimulated OLG as well as antibody sensitized OLG treated with NHS for 6 and 18 h, or with HI-NHS for 6 h were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-cdc2 IgG. By Western blot, a 15-kDa band of immunoreactive anti-RGC-32 was detected in anti-cdc2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5 B). Intensity of this band was highest at 6 h and declined at 18 h. Similar amounts of RGC-32 were immunoprecipitated from control cells and cells exposed to Ab + HI-NHS (Fig. 5 B). The same nitrocellulose membrane, previously examined for the presence of RGC-32when reacted with anti-cdc2 IgG, revealed a cdc2 34-kDa band, as expected (Fig. 5 B). The anti-cdc2 antibody did not react with recombinant purified RGC-32 (Fig. 5 B). Antibody-sensitized OLG treated with NHS for 3, 8, and 18 h were also examined for the presence of cdc2 in anti-RGC-32 immunoprecipitate. Cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-RGC-32 IgG in the presence of Protein A/G-agarose as described previously (18Niculescu F. Rus H. van Biesen T. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4405-4412PubMed Google Scholar). The cdc2 protein was present in anti-RGC-32 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5 C), and the intensity of this band was highest at 6 h and declined at 18 h. These results indicated that RGC-32 and cdc2 are co-immunoprecipitated in a specific manner, and their levels are increased by complement activation. The increasedRGC-32 mRNA expression in response to sublytic C5b-9 assembly in G1 phase and the presence of RGC-32in anti-cdc2 immunoprecipitate led us to examine its role in cell cycle induction. OLGxC6 glioma cell hybrids were transfected with expression vector carrying full-length RGC-32 cDNA (pcDNARGC32). Cells expressing RGC-32 grown in 10% FBS showed significantly increased DNA synthesis (Fig. 6) when compared with cells transfected with control vector (pcDNA 3.1) and placed in 10% FBS (p < 0.01) or transfected with RGC-32 and placed in serum-free medium (p < 0.01). The results suggest that RGC-32 may play a role in activation and progression of cell cycle in OLG. This is also indicated by the increase in RGC-32 protein level co-immunoprecipitated with cdc2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, we can speculate that this new protein may play a role in cell cycle by regulating cell cycle-dependent kinases. We have cloned a novel gene, RGC-32, induced by complement activation in primary rat oligodendrocytes and involved in cell cycle activation. Increased expression in rat brains with active EAE also suggests a role for RGC-32 in inflammatory demyelination. Further exploration is needed to elucidate the biological function of this new gene. The authors express appreciation to Dr. M. Chi for outstanding work in isolating and preparing purified primary rat oligodendrocyte cultures and to N. Dehghan for typing the manuscript."

CD146 expression is not restricted to the endothelium; it is also detected in nonmalignant and malignant cells from other tissues (3Shih I.M. Elder D.E. Speicher D. Johnson J.P. Herlyn M.

CD146 (113–119 kDa) is a highly glycosylated monomer that belongs to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (1Bardin N. George F. Mutin M. Brisson C. Horschowski N.

CD146 contains five extracellular Ig-like homology domains (V-V-C2-C2-C2), one transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail (10Lehmann J.M. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9891-9895Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). CD146 molecular cloning has revealed significant homology to other Ig superfamily adhesion molecules such as B-CAM, ALCAM, BEN/DM-GRASP/SC1, KG-CAM, the chicken HEMCAM, and gicerin (11Taira E.

CD146 function is still not elucidated, although recent data suggest its involvement in cell-cell adhesion. Indeed, the expression of CD146 on melanoma cells correlates with an invasive phenotype, indicating that CD146 may be used as a cell surface marker of tumor progression and metastasis formation (17Luca M. Hunt B. Bucana C.D. Johnson J.P. Fidler I.J. Bar-Eli M. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Sers C. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P.

Indeed, CD146 has been shown to be involved in tumor-endothelial cell interactions that might lead to extravasation of tumor cells (20Johnson J.P. Bar-Eli M. Jansen B. Markhof E. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 769-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shih I.E. Speicher D. Hsu D. Levine E. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3835-3840PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that CD146 mediates a Ca2+-independent homotypic melanoma cell adhesion by promoting heterophilic interaction through a still unknown ligand (19Xie S. Luca M. Huang S. Gutman M. Reich R. Johnson J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2295-2303PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shih I.E. Speicher D. Hsu D. Levine E. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3835-3840PubMed Google Scholar). CD146 is located at the interendothelial junctions. It is found in cytoskeletal protein-rich fractions and colocalizes with α-actinin (22Ming I.E. Elder D.E. Speicher D. Johnson J.P. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2514-2520PubMed Google Scholar). 2N. Bardin, V. Francès, J. Sampol, and F. Dignat-George, manuscript in preparation.2N. Bardin, V. Francès, J. Sampol, and F. Dignat-George, manuscript in preparation. It is well documented that proteins present at the interendothelial junctions promote adhesion through their extracellular domain and mediate intracellular signaling to the complex network of cytoskeletal proteins through their intracytoplasmic part (23Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CD146 possesses potential recognition sites for protein kinases in its cytoplasmic tail (9Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbächer U. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) which might be involved in signal transduction. Nevertheless, CD146 involvement in outside-in signaling in HUVECs has not been investigated. In this present report, we investigated the signaling pathways initiated by CD146 engagement. Because the ligand of CD146 is unknown, CD146 clustering was performed using anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody (mAb) on HUVECs. Results indicate that cross-linking of CD146 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a large panel of proteins, among which p125FAK and paxillin associate with each other. However, CD146 is not directly bound to these proteins but becomes associated with p59fyn. Thus, our results indicate that CD146 engagement may initiate a reorganization of the cytoskeleton through a p59fyn- and p125FAK-dependent pathway. The following mAbs and polyclonal antibodies were used: S-Endo-1 (F(ab′)2 fragment) and 7A4 mAbs, both specific for CD146 and kindly given by Biocytex (Marseilles, France); anti-Tyr(P) 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) mAbs; anti-p125FAK, anti-paxillin, anti-p53/56lyn, p59fyn mAbs (Transduction Laboratories); rabbit anti-p72syk (kindly given by Dr. R. Geahlen, IN); isotype-matched IgG1 or IgG2a (Sigma, St. Louis, MO); horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse (GAMIg) and its F(ab′)2 fragment (Jackson laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). HUVECs were isolated from cord blood (24Jaffe E. Nachman R. Becker C. Minick C. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar). They were used at confluence after one passage. They were rendered quiescent by incubation in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum 2 h before cell activation. Quiescent HUVECs were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min at 4 °C with either isotype-matched IgG1 (control cells) or 10 μg/ml S-Endo-1 F(ab′)2 mAb for CD146 clustering; when indicated, cells were further stimulated with 20 μg/ml F(ab′)2 GAMIg for 30 min at 37 °C. After three washes at 4 °C, the cells were lysed for immunoblotting. Genistein, Herbimycin, and Cytochalasin D (Alexis, San Diego, CA) were used at 50, 10, and 5 μm, respectively. HUVECs were incubated with the drugs in serum-free Hanks' balanced salt solution 1 h before the clustering of CD146 with S-Endo-1 mAb. Peroxovanadate (NaV) was generated as described previously (25Donnadieu E. Trautmann A. Malissen M. Trucy J. Malissen B. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32828-32834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HUVECs were incubated in presence of a 100 μm NaV solution for up to 15 min. After activation, the cells were lysed at 4 °C in 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). After adjustment to a protein concentration of 300–500 μg, i.e. 3–6 × 106 cells (bicinchoninic acid assay, Pierce, Rockford, IL), cell lysates were precleared by incubation with irrelevant IgG1 or IgG2a mAbs and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared samples were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg for 3 h at 4 °C followed by a 2-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations using anti-CD146 and anti-Tyr(P) were performed, respectively, with S-Endo-1 and 4G10 mAbs. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose C+ filters. After blocking in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 3% bovine serum albumin (TBS-T BSA), they were incubated in TBS-T BSA containing protein-specific antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG and ECL reagent. Western blotting using anti-CD146 was performed with 7A4 mAb. When required, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 60 °C and reblotted with the indicated antibodies. Engagement of CD146 was obtained by incubating HUVECs with S-Endo-1 F(ab′)2 mAb and subsequently by cross-linking the complexes with GAMIg. Whole cell lysates were analyzed on a 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) mAb. In HUVECs, engagement of CD146 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a large panel of proteins (Fig. 1, lane 2), which was increased further upon cross-linking with GAMIg at 37 °C for 30 min (Fig. 1, lane 3). The complex pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins consistently includes proteins at apparent molecular masses of 46, 55–60, 70–80, 100, 125, and 150 kDa. A 2-h pretreatment of HUVEC with 50 μm genistein (Fig. 1,lane 4) or 2 μm herbimycin (Fig. 1, lane 5) greatly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by CD146 engagement. Kinetic analysis of the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation upon CD146 engagement revealed a rapid onset after 5 min, a maximum at 30 min, followed by a decrease thereafter (data not shown). In contrast, in HUVECs treated with a control isotype-matched (IgG1) antibody cross-linked with GAMIg, a pattern of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was barely detectable (Fig. 1, lane 1). The presence of a tyrosine residue at position 641 (Tyr-Ile-Asp-Leu) in CD146 cytoplasmic tail suggests a potential site of phosphorylation of the molecule (9Sers C. Kirsch K. Rothbächer U. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8514-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The capacity of CD146 engagement to phosphorylate Tyr641 was studied. As shown in Fig. 2 (upper panel), anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting of anti-CD146 immunoprecipitation revealed that CD146 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated, either in isotype-matched control (lane 1) or in CD146-stimulated cells (lane 2). Reciprocal experiments, using anti-CD146 immunoblotting of anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation, led to similar results (Fig. 2, upper panel, lane 4). As a control, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-CD146 mAbs revealed the presence of CD146 in these samples (Fig. 2, lower panel). NaV is a potent inducer of tyrosine phosphorylation (25Donnadieu E. Trautmann A. Malissen M. Trucy J. Malissen B. Vivier E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32828-32834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was tested for its ability to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of CD146. HUVECs were treated with 0.1 mm NaV for 15 min and lysed. No tyrosine phosphorylation in the molecular weight range of CD146 was observed in anti-Tyr(P) immunoblots of anti-CD146 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, lane 3), although CD146 was present in the cell lysate after reblotting. The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation in CD146 was observed irrespective of the dose of NaV (0.2–3 mm) and time of incubation (2–30 min) used in the experiments (data not shown). The colocalization of CD146 with cytoskeletal proteins2 and the tyrosine phosphorylation of a band in the molecular weight range of 125,000 suggested that p125FAK could be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD146 engagement (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). To examine whether CD146 engagement stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in HUVECs, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p125FAK mAb and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) mAb. Fig. 3 A shows that a constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK occurs in isotype-matched control cells (lane 1). CD146 engagement caused a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Disruption of the actin network by a 2-h pretreatment of the HUVEC monolayer with 5 μm cytochalasin D inhibited the p125FAKtyrosine phosphorylation mediated by CD146 clustering (Fig. 3 A, lane 3).Figure 4Association of CD146 with p59 fyn . CD146 engagement was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated using S-Endo-1 mAb. Immunoprecipitates were first immunoblotted with the indicated anti-PTK antibodies (upper panel) and reblotted with 7A4 mAb (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A direct association between CD146 and p125FAK was investigated in response to CD146 engagement. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD146 and immunoblotted with anti-p125FAK. No protein in the molecular mass range of ≈125 kDa was detected (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), although reprobing with anti-CD146 mAb indicated that CD146 was present in anti-CD146 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). These results showed that CD146 cross-linking induces p125FAKphosphorylation but does not induce an association between CD146 and p125FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a substrate for p125FAK (27Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its association with p125FAKwere investigated in response to CD146 engagement. Results in Fig. 3 C indicate that CD146 cross-linking induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein in the range of ≈70 kDa detected by anti-paxillin mAb after immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyr(P) (lane 1). Association of paxillin with p125FAKwas then examined. Detection of paxillin in anti-p125FAKimmunoprecipitates was observed after CD146 engagement (Fig. 3 C, lane 3) and was not revealed in lysates from cells stimulated with isotype-matched control mAb (Fig. 3 C, lane 2). A 2-h treatment of HUVECs with 5 μmcytochalasin D before CD146 cross-linking inhibits paxillin association with p125FAK entirely (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). Because CD146 engagement induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin, we investigated whether CD146 engagement results in the recruitment of PTK(s) in the vicinity of CD146. In this regard, p125FAK possesses several binding sites for Src or Src-related kinases (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). In addition, CD146 engagement induces tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with molecular masses (≈55–80 kDa) close to those of Src-related kinases such as p53/56lyn and p59fyn, as well as other PTKs such as p72syk, all known to bind p125FAK. We next determine whether these PTKs are involved in CD146 signal pathway. No association between p53/56lyn or p72syk with CD146 was detected (Fig. 4, upper panel), although reprobing with anti-CD146 mAb confirmed the presence of CD146 in anti-CD146 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4, lower panel). These results indicated that CD146 cross-linking induces the recruitment of p59fyn kinase to CD146. The results reported here demonstrate that in cultured HUVECs, engagement of CD146 initiates a PTK-dependent signaling cascade. Activation of this pathway results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a complex pattern of proteins, including p125FAK and paxillin as well as the association of p59fyn with CD146. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating an outside-in signaling pathway downstream of CD146. Dimerization of cell surface receptors represents a key event in signal transduction (28Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding of S-Endo-1 mAb to the extracellular part of CD146 induces a dimerization of CD146 sufficient to promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins. Cross-linking of CD146 dimers by a secondary antibody leads to an oligomerization of CD146 which subsequently increases the intensity of the phosphorylation events. This process is time- and dose-dependent and requires genistein- and herbimycin-sensitive kinases. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues plays an important role in signal transduction by creating docking sites for SH2 domains of signaling molecules (29Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Although the CD146 molecule contains a tyrosine residue (Tyr641) in its cytoplasmic tail (10Lehmann J.M. Riethmüller G. Johnson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9891-9895Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), we cannot detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of CD146 upon anti-CD146 mAb or upon NaV treatment. These results indicate that CD146 does not serve as a docking site for an SH2 adaptor/effector signaling molecule. We also show here that upon aggregation, CD146 associates with p59fyn, a nonreceptor PTK belonging to the Src family kinases (30Kypta R.M. Hemming A. Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). p59Fyn possesses adjacent Src homology SH2 and SH3 domains involved in the binding to target proteins (31Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Zhou S. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The lack of tyrosine-phosphorylable CD146 excludes the binding by the SH2 domain of p59fyn(32Small S.J. Shull G.E. Santioni M.J. Akeson R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2335-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an other way, it is known that the SH3 domains bind to a proline-rich sequence. Although the CD146 cytoplasmic tail contains proline residues, no consensus sequence for SH3 binding site is found (33Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Therefore, the molecular basis of the p59fyn interaction with CD146 is still unknown. Consistent with the recruitment of p59Fyn to the membrane upon CD146 engagement, we observe the tyrosine phosphorylation of two major proteins involved in the formation of focal adhesion plaques, p125FAK and paxillin. These results indicate that CD146 cross-linking induces downstream events that activate p125FAK and mediate its association with its substrates such as paxillin. Both p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with paxillin depend on the integrity of the cytoskeleton as they are inhibited by pretreatment of cytochalasin D (34Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that p125FAK possesses high affinity binding sites for members of Src family kinases, including p59fyn, which in turn can phosphorylate other tyrosines on p125FAK (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). p59fyn participates in the phosphorylation of Tyr at positions 397, 576, 577, and 925, present in the catalytic and COOH-terminal domains of p125FAK (27Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These phosphorylations create multiple binding sites for substrate proteins (26Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 38Schaller M.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) including paxillin, tensin, and p130Cas(39Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 40Lo S.H. Weisberg E. Chen L.B. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein that localizes to sites of adhesion and binds to two sequences present in the carboxyl terminus of p125FAK (42Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 43Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Its association with p125FAKis thought to modulate the localization of p125FAK to focal adhesion plaques (44Turner C.E. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Bellis S.L. Miller J.T. Turner C.E. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results suggest that CD146 engagement mediates the formation of a complex among CD146, p59fyn, p125FAK, and paxillin, which promotes focal adhesion assembly. It is tempting to speculate that CD146 engagement does not only involve an outside-in PTK pathway in HUVEC but also initiates an inside-out PTK-dependent signaling pathway. In mice, p125FAK gene inactivation impairs cell motility (47Illic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Alzawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar), whereas its overexpression stimulates cell migration (48Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p125FAK and paxillin phosphorylations are increased by cell density (37Batt D.B. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (s): 3408-3414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Preliminary results2 indicate that CD146 expression on the plasma membrane is also increased by cell density. CD146 might therefore participate in the establishment of the endothelial monolayer by initiating downstream events that promote cell proliferation and monolayer formation. Taken together, the data presented here indicate a role of CD146 in signaling. They suggest that interaction of CD146 with its still unknown ligand might lead to a similar signaling pathway.

The biological activity of REST was further investigated using a battery of model promoters containing strong promoters/enhancers and REST binding sites. REST functioned as a transcriptional repressor when REST binding motifs derived from the genes encoding synapsin I, SCG10, α1-glycine receptor, the β2-subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the m4-subunit of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were present in the promoter region. No differences in the biological activity of these REST binding motifs tested were detected. Moreover, we found that REST functioned very effectively as a transcriptional repressor at a distance. Thus, REST represents a general transcriptional repressor that blocks transcription regardless of the location or orientation of its binding site relative to the enhancer and promoter. This biological activity could also be attributed to isolated domains of REST. Both repressor domains identified at the N and C termini of REST were transferable to a heterologous DNA binding domain and functioned from proximal and distal positions, similar to the REST protein.

RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST)1, also known as neuron-restrictive silencer factor, functions as a transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in nonneuronal tissues (1Chong J.A.

We have shown recently that the REST binding motif within the synapsin I promoter is responsible for restricting the expression of synapsin I to neuronal cells (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Deletion of the REST binding site abolished neuron-specific expression of the reporter gene entirely, allowing constitutively acting elements of the promoter to direct expression in a nontissue specific manner. The REST binding motif termed the neural-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) was identified at various positions in those genes regulated by REST. NRSEs were found in the promoter region as shown for the synapsin I and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m4-subunit genes (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Mieda M. Haga T. Saffen D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14221-14225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the SCG10 gene, an NRSE is located farther upstream at position −1472 to −1452 (10Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), whereas in the NgCAM gene, five NRSEs have been discovered within the first intron (3Kallunki P. Jenkinson S. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21291-21298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genes encoding the α1-glycine receptor and the β2-subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor contain NRSEs in the 5′-untranslated region downstream of the transcriptional start site (11Deneris E.S. Connolly J. Boulter J. Wada E. Wasa K. Swanson L.W. Patrick J. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1988; 1: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Grenningloh G. Schmieden V. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Siddique T. Mohandas T.K. Becker C.-M. Betz H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that REST switches its activity from repressing to activating transcription when REST binds to an NRSE located in the 5′-untranslated region or less than 50 base pairs upstream from the TATA box (13Blessis A. Champtiaux N. Chatelin L. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5906-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Most of the NRSEs known so far were detected by homology to the initial NRSEs described in the SCG10 and type II sodium channel gene. Therefore, the biological activity for many NRSEs in recruiting REST and by that means leading to transcriptional repression still has to be shown. A core NRSE has been proposed with the sequence NNCAGCACCNNGCACAGNNNC, and it was shown that sequences with six or more deviations from the consensus as found in genes encoding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7-subunit, the sodium/potassium ATPase α3-subunit, and dopamine β-hydroxylase did not bind REST (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Here, the biological activity of REST was first analyzed on a natural target gene, the synapsin I gene. In addition, the ability of REST to silence (or activate) transcription from proximal and distal positions was investigated with model promoters containing strong promoters/enhancers of viral and mammalian origin. REST binding sites derived from the genes encoding synapsin I, SCG10, α1−glycine receptor, the β2-subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the m4-subunit of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were inserted at various positions within the transcription unit. Transfection experiments using these reporter constructs together with an expression vector encoding human REST revealed that REST is able to block transcription of a promoter/enhancer from proximal and distal positions. REST functions, therefore, as a silencer-binding protein in a similar, but opposite manner, as an enhancer-binding protein, i.e. REST blocks transcription of a gene when the NRSE is located upstream or downstream of the open reading frame in either orientation and in both a distance- and a gene-independent manner. A transcriptional repressor is typically composed of a DNA-tethering domain, which anchors the protein to DNA, and a repressor domain. This modular structure was investigated to define the DNA binding domain of REST and to elucidate which part of the molecule is involved in transcriptional repression (or activation). DNA binding activity and transcriptional repressor activity could be attributed to different domains within the REST protein. We found two repressor domains, one located at the N terminus and the second at the C terminus. Both repressor domains were transferable to a heterologous DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and functioned when bound to distal and proximal positions within a gene. Thus, REST and fusion proteins consisting of the REST repressor domains and the DNA binding domain of GAL4 repress transcription by a mechanism that is independent of the position and orientation of the binding site within a transcription unit. All reporter constructs are derivatives of OVEC (15Westin G. Gerster T. Müller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 17: 6787-6798Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSV40OVEC, OVEC-S, and ICPOref have been described (16Gerster T. Balmaceda C.-G. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1635-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Thiel G. Schoch S.

Plasmid pgrpOVEC containing the enhancer of the ratgrp78 gene was constructed by inserting a 291-nucleotideSmaI/Eco147I fragment derived from plasmid E43 into the filled-in SalI site of OVEC. Plasmid E43 was a kind gift of Amy S. Lee, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA (18Lin A.Y. Chang S.C. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 1235-1243Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

Binding sites for the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (upstream activating sequence (UAS)) were all derived from plasmid pG5EC, a kind gift of Ivan Sadowski, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (21Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and cloned into the OVEC reporter plasmids in a similar way. Cloning of the human REST cDNA was described elsewhere. 2Lietz, M., Cicchetti, P., and Thiel, G. (1998)Biol. Chem. 379, in press.Plasmid pCMVmycREST, encoding the full-length cDNA of human REST together with an N-terminal myc tag under the control of the CMV promoter/enhancer was generated by subcloning the cDNA of human REST as a XhoI/HindIII fragment into the expression vector pCMV5. The myc tag was introduced by inserting the annealed synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TCGACGCCACCATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGGGAGGAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCCTCCCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCCATGGTGGCG-3′. The fusion proteins encoding the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and various domains of REST were all constructed using plasmids pM1–3 (21Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The GAL4-REST fusion proteins encoded by plasmids pGAL4-REST1 to pGAL4-REST9 contained the following sequences from REST: amino acids 1–152 (pGAL4-R1), amino acids 62–152 (pGAL4-R2), amino acids 441–637 (pGAL4-R3), amino acids 604–859 (pGAL4-R4), amino acids 636–859 (pGAL4-R5), amino acids 526–859 (pGAL4-R6), amino acids 849–1050 (pGAL4-R7), amino acids 526–952 (pGAL4-R8), and amino acids 953–1097 (pGAL4-R9). The murine neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y, the neuroblastoma × glioma cell line NG108-15, and CHO-K1 cells were cultured and transfected as described (22Thiel G. Greengard P. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3431-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The β-globin reporter plasmid (5 μg) and internal reference plasmid ICPOref (3–5 μg) were transfected into cells grown on 100-mm plates. The pCMVmycREST expression plasmid and the GAL4-REST expression vectors were used at a concentration of 2.5 μg/plate. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted 40 to 48 h after transfection and analyzed by RNase protection mapping as described (17Thiel G. Schoch S. Petersohn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All transfection experiments were performed at least two times giving similar results. COS cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described (23Cibelli G. Schoch S. Pajunk H. Brand I.A. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of GST-fusion proteins were done as described (24Cibelli G. Jüngling S. Schoch S. Gerdes H.-H. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 226: 171-179Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pGEX-REST was constructed by inserting aEcl136II/SspI fragment of the REST cDNA into the filled-in XhoI site of plasmid pGEX-KG. The fusion protein encoded REST amino acids 154 to 440, encompassing the cluster of eight zinc fingers. Two additional GST expression vectors were generated encoding amino acids 953 to 1097 and 1051 to 1097. The expressed fusion proteins contained the single zinc finger motif located at the C terminus of REST. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (17Thiel G. Schoch S. Petersohn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Scholl T. Stevens M.B. Mahanta S. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1448-1457PubMed Google Scholar) using the NRSEs derived from the synapsin I and the SCG10 gene as DNA probes. The DNA probe containing the X2 box of the human major histocompatibility complex class II DPA gene (25Scholl T. Stevens M.B. Mahanta S. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1448-1457PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by annealing the synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCCCAGCAACAGAGAATGTCAGCTCTATGATG-3′ and 5′-TCGACATCATAGAGCTGACATTCTCTGTTGCTGGGC-3′. An antiserum recognizing REST was generated in rabbits injected with a purified GST fusion protein encodingSchistosoma japonicum GST and REST amino acids 636 to 839. Anti-REST antibodies were affinity-purified (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Tissue culture supernatant containing the anti-myc tag antibody 9E10 was a kind gift of Dr. Angela Seelig, Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne. For Western blot analysis, proteins from transfected COS cells were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (pore size 0.2 mm). Blots incubated with anti-REST antiserum were developed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots probed with antibody 9E10 were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We reported recently that the REST binding motif is crucial for the neuron-specific transcription of the synapsin I gene (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To confirm that REST is the major regulator of synapsin I gene transcription, transfection experiments were performed. The expression vector pCMVmycREST was constructed encoding human REST with an N-terminal myc tag under the control of the CMV immediate-early gene promoter/enhancer (Fig. 1 A). The vector was first tested in COS cells. REST migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at ≈200 kDa as shown by Western blot analysis using antibodies against REST and the myc tag (Fig. 1 B). The pCMV-mycREST expression vector was subsequently used in transfection experiments together with synapsin I promoter/β-globin constructs as reporters. Plasmid pSyOVEC contained the synapsin I promoter sequence from −422 to −22, which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for neuron-specific gene transcription (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As a control for REST function, a deletion from −234 to −200 was introduced into the synapsin I promoter-forming plasmid pSyOVECΔNRSE. The deletion included the REST binding site (Fig. 1 C). Plasmids pSyOVEC and pSyOVECΔNRSE were introduced into NS20Y and NG108-15 cells together with plasmid ICP0ref, a mutated β-globin gene under the control of the herpes simplex virus ICP0 gene promoter, to correct for variations in transfection efficiencies. Forty to 48 h post-transfection, cytoplasmic RNA of the transfected cells was isolated, hybridized to a β-globin-derived cRNA probe, and analyzed by RNase protection mapping. REST reduced transcription of the β-globin reporter gene in NS20Y and NG108-15 cells when the reporter was controlled by synapsin I promoter sequences containing a REST binding site (Fig. 1 D). REST had no effect upon transcription from a synapsin I promoter/β-globin gene lacking the REST binding (plasmid pSyOVECΔNRSE). These data demonstrate that REST and the REST binding motif are crucial for the neuron-specific expression of the synapsin I gene via silencing synapsin I promoter activity in nonneuronal cells. The REST binding sites termed NRSEs have been identified in neuronal genes at various locations, i.e. in promoter and enhancer positions, in the 5′-untranslated region as well as in introns. The NRSEs derived from the genes encoding synapsin I, SCG10, α1-glycine receptor, the β2-subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the m4-subunit of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were tested to determine whether they display similar biological activities. All sequences fit with the NRSE consensus NNCAGCACCNNGCACAGNNNC (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 2 A. The main difference between these NRSEs is their location within the transcription unit. Moreover, the orientation of the NRSE derived from the α1-glycine receptor is opposite to the NRSEs found in the synapsin I, SCG10, m4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, and the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β2-subunit genes. To test the biological activity of these NRSEs we decided to use model promoters to exclude influences from other neuron-specific elements. The transcription unit contained the β-globin gene as reporter. The enhancer of the glucose-regulated protein 78 (grp78) gene was inserted upstream of the TATA box. The grp78 gene is transcribed constitutively in many different tissues and cell types (27Resendez E.J. Atenello J.W. Brafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and is not regulated by REST. Upstream of the grp78enhancer, two copies of the different NRSEs were inserted (Fig. 2 B). The reporter plasmids, the internal reference plasmid ICP0ref, and the REST expression vector pCMVmycREST (+) or the empty vector pCMV5 (−) were transfected into NS20Y and NG108-15 cells. Transcription of the β-globin reporter gene was analyzed by RNase protection mapping. The effect of REST upon transcription of thegrp78 gene is shown on the left hand side (see plasmid pgrpOVEC). The presence of REST binding sites, however, together with expression of REST via transfection of a REST expression vector caused a striking decrease in transcription. This effect could be observed in NS20Y as well as in NG108-15 cells. No major differences were detected between the NRSEs tested. Thus, the NRSEs derived from the genes encoding synapsin I, SCG10, α1-glycine receptor, the β2-subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the m4-subunit of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor are functionally identical in recruiting REST and by that means, lead to repression of grp78 enhancer-stimulated transcription. Putative REST binding sites have been identified in introns of various neuronal genes, most prominent in the first intron of the NgCAM gene where five NRSEs were found (3Kallunki P. Jenkinson S. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21291-21298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An NRSE was also detected within the second intron of the L1 gene (5Kallunki P. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To address the question if REST is able to repress transcription from distant positions, a reporter plasmid was constructed containing the β-globin reporter gene and the grp78 promoter/enhancer. REST binding sites derived from the synapsin I gene were inserted in both orientations 2.3 kilobase pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3 A). The reporter plasmids, the internal reference plasmid ICP0ref, and the REST expression vector pCMVmycREST (+) or the empty vector pCMV5 (−) were introduced into NS20Y cells, and transcription was measured by RNase protection mapping of the β-globin mRNA. REST did not influence the activity of the grp78 enhancer (Fig. 3 B, plasmid pgrpOVEC). The presence of REST binding sites 2.3 kilobase pairs downstream of the cap site together with synthesized REST protein led to the transcriptional repression of grp78 enhancer activity. This effect was independent of the orientation of the NRSE (Fig. 3 B, plasmids pgrpOVECSyINRSE4(s) and pgrpOVECSyINRSE4(as)). Next, we tested whether REST is also able to repress an enhancer located at a distant remote position. The reporter plasmid pSp12OVEC-S contained the β-globin gene, a TATA box, and two copies of an Sp1 binding site derived from the HSV IE-3 promoter. The SV40 enhancer was inserted downstream of the β-globin open reading frame. This enhancer in a remote position is inactive unless there is at least one copy of an upstream factor binding site in addition to the TATA box (28Seipel K. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, the SV40 enhancer together with two Sp1 binding motifs in the promoter generated a strong transcriptional activation potential as seen in Fig. 3 D(plasmid pSp12OVEC-S). To test the biological activity of REST two copies of the synapsin I or SCG10 gene, NRSEs were inserted into the reporter construct upstream of the Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 3 C). Expression of REST in NS20Y cells had no impact on transcription of the reporter gene pSp12OVEC-S that lacked REST binding sites (Fig. 3 D). This was confirmed by using a BAS1000 Bio-imaging analyzer. Quantification of the amount of β-globin mRNA relative to the signal generated from the internal reference plasmid ICP0ref revealed that REST did not influence transcription mediated by the SV40 enhancer together with Sp1 (data not shown). This result is in agreement with in vitroDNA-protein binding assays showing that Sp1 did not interfere with the DNA binding activity of REST (Fig. 5, see below). The presence of REST binding sites in the transcription unit, however, led to a striking reduction in β-globin mRNA synthesis due to the repressor effect of REST (Fig. 3 D, plasmids pSyINRSE2Sp12OVEC-S and pSCG10NRSE2Sp12OVEC-S). No functional differences were observed between the NRSEs derived from the synapsin I or SCG10 genes. We conclude that REST, in addition to repressing transcription from distant positions, is also able to block the activity of an enhancer in a remote position. It was recently proposed that REST represents a dual activator/repressor molecule dependent upon the location of the REST binding site. REST was proposed to work as a transcriptional activator when the NRSE was either in the 5′-nontranslated region or less than 50 nucleotides upstream from the TATA box (13Blessis A. Champtiaux N. Chatelin L. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5906-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To confirm these results, reporter plasmids were constructed that had two or four copies of the synapsin I gene NRSE in their regulatory regions (plasmids pSyINRSE2OVEC and pSyINRSE4OVEC, Fig. 4 A). The spacer between the NRSE and the TATA box was 12 nucleotides. The reporter plasmids, the ICP0ref internal reference plasmid, and the REST expression vector were transfected into NS20Y cells, and transcription was measured by RNase protection assay. No transcriptional activation could be observed when REST was synthesized in NS20Y cells via transfection of a REST expression vector (Fig. 4 B). As a control, plasmid pSyNRSE2Sp12OVEC-S was included in the assay showing the repressor effect of REST upon a transcription unit composed of the SV40 enhancer and two Sp1 binding sites. In support of this, no activation of transcription was measured in CHO-K1 cells using the reporter plasmids pSyINRSE2OVEC and pSyINRSE4OVEC (data not shown). In CHO-K1 cells, an endogenous REST-like activity is present as shown in the analysis of the synapsin I promoter (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the endogenous REST activity in CHO-K1 as well as REST activity generated by transfection in neuroblastoma cells did not promote transcription of the reporter genes containing REST binding sites in proximity to the TATA box. From these data we conclude that REST by itself has no transcriptional activator properties. The N-terminal zinc finger domain of REST was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with S. japonicum GST, and the recombinant protein was used for in vitro DNA-protein binding experiments (Fig. 5). These experiments showed that REST binds to the NRSE of the human synapsin I promoter as well as to the NRSE derived from the SCG10 gene. This interaction could be competed by adding an excess of cold probe and also by adding DNA containing a homologous motif derived from the SCG10 or synapsin I promoter, respectively. No competition was observed with DNA binding sites for the zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 and egr-1, indicating the specificity of the DNA binding activity of REST. No competition was obtained with an unrelated transcription factor binding site, the cAMP response element. In contrast, a fusion protein encoding GST together with the C-terminal zinc finger motif of REST did not bind NRSEs derived from the synapsin I or SCG10 gene (data not shown). Furthermore, no DNA-protein interaction could be detected between the N-terminal zinc finger cluster or the C-terminal zinc finger motif of REST with an X2-box DNA probe derived from the major histocompatibility complex class II DPA gene promoter as proposed (25Scholl T. Stevens M.B. Mahanta S. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1448-1457PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, the C-terminal zinc finger motif exhibited transcriptional repressor activity instead of DNA binding activity as shown below. To locate the REST repressor domain(s), various regions of REST were expressed as fusion proteins with the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Fig. 6). The reporter plasmids pUAS5grpOVEC and pUAS5SV40OVEC contained thegrp78 promoter/enhancer or the SV40 promoter in their regulatory region. In addition, five binding sites for GAL4 were present 5′ of the promoter (Fig. 7,A and C). Reporter plasmids, the ICPOref internal reference plasmid, and the REST expression vector were transfected into NS20Y cells, and transcription was measured by RNase protection assay. Two repressor domains within the REST molecule were identified using the reporter plasmids pUAS5grpOVEC and pUAS5SV40OVEC (Fig. 7, B and D) encompassing the N-terminal 152 and the C-terminal 144 amino acids of REST. Thus, the REST molecule contains two distinct repressor domains that were transferable to a heterologous DNA binding domain and functioned upon strong viral or eukaryotic promoters. A weak transcriptional repressor activity was generated by GST-REST fusion proteins 4 to 6, all containing the repeat region of REST. Expression of the GAL4-REST fusion protein 8, however, which also contained this region, had no effect upon transcription, arguing against a general role of the repeat region in transcriptional repression. Moreover, the repressor activity of GST-REST fusion proteins 4 to 6 was negligible in comparison to the GST-REST fusion proteins 1 and 9 containing the N-and C termini of REST.Figure 7Mapping and biological activity of the repressor domains of REST. A and C, reporter plasmids pUAS5grpOVEC and pUAS5SV40OVEC containing the β-globin reporter gene, a TATA box, and the promoter/enhancer derived from the grp78 gene or the SV40 virus. Upstream of the promoter/enhancers, five copies of GAL4 binding site, termed UAS, were inserted. B and D, the reporter plasmids pUAS5grpOVEC (B) or pUAS5SV40OVEC (D), the ICP0ref internal standard plasmid, and the GAL4-REST expression vectors 1 to 9 were introduced into CHO-K1 cells. Forty-eight h post-transfection, cytoplasmic RNA of the transfected cells was isolated, hybridized to a β-globin-derived cRNA probe, and analyzed by RNase protection mapping. For definitions of test and ref, see legend to Fig. 1.M, size marker HaeIII-digested pBR322 is shown in lane M.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether these major repression domains were functional not only from proximal but also from distal positions, two additional reporter plasmids were constructed (Fig. 8 A). Plasmid pUAS5Sp12OVEC-S contained the SV40 enhancer and two Sp1 binding sites as described for plasmids pSyINRSE2Sp12OVEC-S and pSCG10NRSE2Sp12OVEC-S (Fig. 3 C). The NRSE motifs were changed to UAS to allow binding of the GAL4-REST fusion proteins. The reporter plasmid pUAS51105SV40OVEC contained the rabbit β-globin reporter gene, a TATA box, the SV40 promoter, and five binding sites for GAL4. The UAS motifs and the SV40 promoter were separated by 1105 nucleotides. The reporter plasmids and the expression plasmids pGAL4-R1 and pGAL4-R9 encoding the N- and C-terminal repressor domains of REST together with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the ICPOref internal reference plasmid were transfected into NS20Y cells, and transcription was measured by RNase protection assay (Fig. 8 B). Both GAL4-REST fusion proteins repressed transcription mediated by Sp1 together with SV40 enhancer-binding proteins (reporter plasmid pUAS5Sp12OVEC-S), indicating that both repressor domains of REST were able to repress transcription of a strong enhancer in remote position (Fig. 8 B, left panel). Both repressor domains also blocked transcription of the SV40 promoter that was located 1105 nucleotides downstream of the binding site of the GAL4-REST fusion proteins (Fig. 8 B, right panel). The N-terminal repression domain of REST showed a slightly higher activity in repressing transcription of the SV40 promoter than the C-terminal repression domain, suggesting that both repressor domains of REST are distinct and differ not only in their primary structure but also in their biological activity. The REST binding motif within the synapsin I promoter is crucial for neuron-specific gene transcription. Deletion of the REST binding site abolished neuron-specific expression of the reporter gene entirely, allowing constitutively acting elements of the promoter to direct expression in a nontissue-specific manner (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that the synapsin I promoter worked perfectly in nonneuronal cells. However, the NRSE had to be deleted to allow transcription, indicating that the presence of REST in those cells normally represses synapsin I promoter activity. The negative regulatory mechanism of synapsin I transcription was further supported by experiments reported here, showing that expression of REST in neuroblastoma cells by transfection of a REST expression vector blocked transcription of the reporter gene under control of synapsin I promoter sequences. REST had no effect upon transcription from a synapsin I promoter/reporter gene when the REST binding site had been deleted. We have shown recently that the expression pattern of synapsin I and REST in human neuroblastoma cells was inverse.2 REST and synapsin I were, however, coexpressed in the neuroblastoma cell lines tested, although at different concentrations, indicating that low levels of REST are tolerable for allowing neuron-specific gene transcription. Thus, the concentration of REST is important for REST function and expression levels of neuronal genes. Recently, REST mRNA was also detected in neurons throughout the nervous system (29Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of REST in neurons must be, however, too low to repress neuronal gene transcription as seen for the widespread expression of synapsin I in neurons of the central nervous system. REST is a transcriptional repressor that is able to block transcription mediated by strong heterologous promoters of viral and eukaryotic origin such as the grp78 promoter/enhancer or the SV40 promoter. REST repressed transcription independent of the nature of the heterologous promoter. Moreover, we showed that REST also repressed transcription despite the location or orientation of its binding site within a gene. REST blocked transcription of a viral promoter from a remote position, downstream of the open reading frame. Similarly, the activity of a strong enhancer in remote position was repressed by REST bound several kilobases upstream of the enhancer in the promoter region. Thus, REST fullfils the criteria of a transcriptional silencer-binding protein that blocks transcription irrespective of the location or orientation to the enhancer and the promoter. The positions of naturally occurring REST binding sites at different sites within neuron-specific genes is consistent with the ability of these motifs to silence transcription from any position within a transcription unit. As already mentioned, NRSEs were identified not only in promoter and enhancer positions but also in the 5′-untranslated region as well as in introns, suggesting that the actual binding position within a neuronal gene plays obviously no role for the biological activity of REST. In this study, five NRSEs were analyzed derived from genes encoding synapsin I, SCG10, α1-glycine receptor, the β2-subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and the m4-subunit of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. All of these motifs fit with the proposed consensus sequence NNCAGCACCNNGCACAGNNNC (14Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). No differences in the biological activities of these NRSEs were detected, although in their natural context, they differ in their orientation and location. The NRSE of the α1-glycine receptor gene affected a heterologous promoter in a manner indistinguishable from the other NRSEs, although in the α1-glycine receptor gene it is found in the 5′-untranslated region in inverse orientation to the synapsin I gene NRSE. We conclude that a NRSE functions as a REST binding motif independent of orientation and location as long as it fits with the proposed core NRSE. Recently it had been proposed that REST is a dual enhancer/silencer-binding protein dependent on the location of the REST binding site. In particular, transcriptional activation of REST should take place in promoters with a REST binding site close to the TATA box (13Blessis A. Champtiaux N. Chatelin L. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5906-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence argue against a role of REST in transcriptional activation. First, transcription of a reporter gene containing NRSEs in proximity to the TATA box was not activated by REST overexpressed in the neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y. Second, the same transcription unit was inactive in CHO-K1 cells exhibiting an endogenous REST-like activity (7Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), again arguing against a role of REST in transcriptional activation. Third, an analysis of the modular structure of REST identified two repressor domains within the REST molecule but no activation domain. Thus, we conclude that REST is a transcriptional repressor but not a dual activator/repressor protein as it has been reported for the transcription factors YY-1, p53, or cAMP response element binding protein 2 (30Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 31Bartsch D. Ghirardi M. Skehel P.A. Karl K.A. Herder S.P. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

Moreover, those proteins are ubiquitously expressed, indicating that the promoter context of their target genes determines the specificity of activating or repressing transcription. In contrast, the expression levels of REST vary between different cell types, and the actual REST concentration determines whether REST is able to repress transcription of its target genes. Thus, the specificity of REST function is determined by the REST concentration and not by the promoter context. As shown and discussed here, the location of the REST binding site within a transcription unit is not important for the biological activity of REST. A dissection of important domains of REST identified the DNA-tethering domain that anchors the protein to DNA and two repressor domains located at the N and C termini of the molecule. No activation domain could be detected. The repressor domains located at the N and C termini were transferable to the heterologous DNA binding domain of GAL4 and functioned when bound to distal and proximal positions within a gene. We were unable to detect any DNA binding activity of the zinc finger motif located at the C terminus of REST using either NRSEs or the X2-box of the major histocompatibility complex class II DPAgene, suggesting that this domain is a transcriptional repressor domain and not a DNA binding domain (25Scholl T. Stevens M.B. Mahanta S. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1448-1457PubMed Google Scholar). Two repressor domains located on both termini of the REST molecule were also identified by others (33Tapia-Ramı́rez J. Eggen B.J. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). REST is thus comparable with the thyroid hormone receptor or the zinc finger proteins containing Krüppel-associated boxes (34Baniahmad A. Köhne A.C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 35Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K.-H. Vissing H. Thiesen H.-J. Rauscher III, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). All of these proteins contain powerful repressor domains that work perfectly with a heterologous DNA binding domain. REST is unique in having two repressor domains that are clearly distinct in their primary structure. In addition, we found that the C-terminal repressor domain is not as active as the N-terminal repressor domain in repressing transcription from a distant position. In support of this, we recently found that both repressor domains of REST have to interact with distinct nuclear factors to repress transcription, 3M. Leichter and G. Thiel, manuscript in preparation. indicating that two different modes of action were used by REST to repress transcription. How the transcriptional repressor REST works on the molecular level is currently under investigation in the laboratory.

In previous studies, we identified and cloned the gene coding for a DNA-binding protein, translin, exhibiting general binding activity to consensus sequences at breakpoint junctions of chromosomal translocations in many cases of lymphoid neoplasms (19Aoki K.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1109-1115PubMed Google Scholar). Further molecular analysis revealed that the native form of translin is a ring-shaped octamer connected by the leucine zipper motifs of each dimer and that this structure is responsible for the binding to target sequences situated only at single-strand DNA ends (23Kasai M. Matsuzaki T. Katayanagi K. Omori A. Maziarz R.T. Strominger J.L. Aoki K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11402-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequently, to investigate the functional significance of translin, we examined whether it might interact with other proteins using yeast two-hybrid interaction analysis and identified an associated 33-kDa protein partner, TRAX, with extensive amino acid homology (28Kadesch T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 31-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). During the course of screening for translin-associated molecules in the yeast two-hybrid system, which was designed to avoid self-association of translin to form the ring-shaped structure, we finally selected one clone D15 whose product gave the strongest activation only with the translin bait lacking the leucine zipper motif. The protein encoded by D15, named RP58, contains a POZ domain in its amino-terminal region and Kruppel-type zinc finger motifs separated by a short conserved motif, TGEKP(Y/P)X (H/C link) in the carboxyl-terminal region. The goal of this study was to elucidate the biological role of RP58 and, especially, its possible involvement in transcriptional regulation. In transient cotransfection experiments, RP58 was shown to repress transcription from a promoter linked to its target sequence containing the E box motif. Immunogold electron microscopic study revealed that RP58 is localized in condensed chromatin regions, suggesting a role for the sequence-specific transcriptional repression in the heterochromatin structure. DNA encoding the translin domain lacking a leucine zipper motif (amino acids 1–189) was cloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain vector, pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmid, GAL4bd-Tra (LZ delete), was used as bait to screen a human spleen cDNA library in two-hybrid interaction analysis which was performed following the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System Protocol (CLONTECH). Positive yeast clones were screened by activation of hisand lacZ reporter genes. After transformation of yeast DNA into Escherichia coli, plasmids containing cDNA clones were identified by restriction mapping and further characterized by DNA sequencing. 5′-Amplification of cDNA ends was carried out using a 5′-RACE1 system (Life Technologies, Inc.). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA of NALL-1 cells (non-T and non-B-ALL) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a RP58-specific primer, 5′-ACTATGGTCTGGAAACTCCAT-3′ (primer R1, complementary to nt 524–544). An anchor sequence was then added to the 3′ end of the cDNA using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. A nested PCR amplification was performed using a primer complementary to the anchor and specific primers, 5′-ACATGTCCCTGAATTTTAATC-3′ (primer R2, complementary to nt 389–409) and 5′-GACAAGACCTAAATGCCAGAAG-3′ (primer R3, complementary to nt 333–355). The resulting PCR products (380 bp) were cloned into pBluescript II, and seven clones were selected for further sequencing. A GST fusion protein containing the RP58 lacking a POZ domain (amino acids 122–522), GST-RP58 (ΔPOZ), was expressed using pGEX 4T-1 vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After induction with 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h, the bacteria were suspended in Lysis Buffer containing 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and lysed by sonication. The bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed three times with the Lysis Buffer, and used for a CAST experiment. The full-length RP58 protein carrying a histidine hexamer tag (RP58-HIS) was also expressed using the pQE-9 plasmid (Qiagen) and purified by nickel chelate chromatography as previously reported (19Aoki K. Suzuki K. Sugano T. Tasaka T. Nakahara K. Kuge O. Omori A. Kasai M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The eluted fractions containing RP58-His were dialyzed against the CAST binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μmZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) and used for EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). DNA portions for the production of GST-RP58 (ΔPOZ) and RP58-HIS were amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) using the following primers: D15POZdelete (AGGGATCCACCACGGAGGCAGACAGC) and D15M26 (ATGTCGACTTATTTCCAAAGTTCTTG) for GST-RP58 (ΔPOZ) and D15P26 (ATGGATCCATGGAGTTTCCAGACCAT) and D15M26Hind (ATAAGCTTATTTCCAAAGTTCTTG) for RP58-HIS. GST-RP58 (ΔPOZ) immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads was equilibrated to CAST binding buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and washed two times with the same buffer. The duplex degenerate oligonucleotide (10 μg), CAST DDG (AGACGGATCCATTGCA(N)20CTGTAGGAATTCGGA), the immobilized proteins (30 μl), and 400 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were mixed in 50 μl of CAST binding buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The complex was then washed five times in the same buffer and subjected to 10, 14, or 18 cycles of PCR amplification using the primers, CAST-16(+) (AGACGGATCCATTGCA) and CAST-15(−) (TCCGAATTCCTACAG). Following six rounds of selection, the final 30 cycles of PCR were performed, and then the resulting products of approximately 50 bp were digested withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) for sequencing. To generate the luciferase reporter construct (BS10-pGL2C), BS10 (a DNA fragment containing 10 repeats of the binding core sequence, (A/C)ACATCTG or its antisense (Fig. 4 B)) was digested with KpnI and SacI, and it was cloned into KpnI/SacI sites of pGL2C, a luciferase control reporter vector (Promega). To construct the plasmid expressing the RP58 protein, pcDNA3.1-RP58, RP58 cDNA was PCR-amplified with the following primers: D15P/Bam/KOZ (5-ATGGATCCAGCCATGGAGTTTCCAGACCAT-3) and D15M26Hind. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and then cloned intoBamHI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). Similarly, the plasmid expressing the TRAX protein, pcDNA3.1-TRAX was constructed by PCR amplification of the TRAX cDNA (24Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the following primers: TRAXP/Bam/KOZ (5-TTGGATCCAGCCATGAGCAACAAAGAAGGA-3) and TRAXM/Hind (5-TAAAGCTTAAGAAATGCCCTCTTCTT-3), and then subcloned into theBamHI/HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(−). Cells (Cos-7) maintained in culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 10% newborn calf serum) were grown to 50% confluence in 12-well plates and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For cotransfection experiments, the reporters and various amounts of effectors were mixed with the medium without serum (final volume of 75 μl), followed by addition of 7.5 μl of Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). pβgal-control plasmids (CLONTECH) expressing bacterial β-galactosidase (0.5 μg) were also cotransfected to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, each mixture was added to wells with 400-μl aliquots of culture medium and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed once with PBS and incubated for 48 h in 1 ml of the culture medium. The assay for luciferase activity was performed as follows. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 100 μl of LCβ lysis buffer (Nippongene). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 3 min, 20 μl of extract were mixed with 100 μl of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega), and the produced light was measured over 3 s using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold). Similarly, the β-galactosidase activity was measured using a Luminescent β-galactosidase Detection Kit II (CLONTECH). To investigate the localization of RP58 by immunogold electron microscopy, IMR32 cells (human neuroblastoma) were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, washed with PBS, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde. The samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, embedded in Lowicryl K 4M resin, and then allowed to polymerize for 6 days under UV irradiation. Ultra-thin sections were cut and mounted on 200-mesh nickel grids. To block nonspecific binding sites, they were incubated with 0.3% non-fat dried milk in PBS for 30 min. The sections were then incubated with an affinity purified rabbit antibody to the carboxyl-terminal peptide of RP58 (diluted 1:100) for 12 h at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 15-nm colloidal gold (British Biocell International) for 1 h at 37 °C. They were rinsed in PBS followed by distilled water and stained with 4% uranyl acetate. Samples were observed under an electron microscope (Hitachi H-7000) operating at 75 kV. For immunofluorescence studies, IMR32 cells were spread on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min in a cytocentrifuge and were treated with 0.1% Tween 20 for 5 min to permeabilize cell membrane. The antibody to the carboxyl-terminal peptide of RP58 was used at 1:500 dilution, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel), at a dilution of 1:500. After washing with PBS, the cells were examined on a Zeiss microscope (Axioplan 2). To understand better the functional significance of translin and its relation to other proteins, we examined whether it might be a member of a multicomponent complex using a protein-protein interaction analysis. To avoid self-association of translin to form the ring-shaped structure, DNA encoding its domain lacking the leucine zipper motif (amino acids 1–189) was cloned into the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain vector and used as bait to screen a human spleen cDNA library in two-hybrid interaction analyses. From screening 6.2 × 106 individual colonies for activation of thehis reporter gene, 20 clones were obtained. Of these 20, nine were selected by activation of the lacZ reporter gene, but eight turned out to be the gene coding for TRAX showing extensive homology with translin (24Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We finally selected one clone D15 (2024-nt cDNA) whose product gave the strongest activation with the translin bait. In contrast to the TRAX, which was selected by both the full-length and deleted translin, the D15 clone was obtained only when translin lacked its leucine zipper motif. In order to generate a full-length cDNA, we used 5′-RACE PCR to extend the D15 in the 5′ direction. Analysis of seven resultant clones resulted in the identification of an additional 207-nt sequences in all cases, preceding the 5′ end of the original clone, suggesting that this position might be a major transcription start site. Further screening of a human spleen cDNA library with the D15 probe resulted in the identification of several overlapping clones extending 2015-nt sequences in the 3′ direction. As a result, we could construct the composite cDNA (4246 nt) including the AATAAA polyadenylation signal and poly(A) tract (Fig. 1 A, GenBankTMaccession number AJ001388). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 522 amino acids with a molecular mass of 58 kDa, RP58. Since no other favorable ORF was identified, we assumed that the ATG codon (nt 524–526) immediately 3′ of the in-frame termination codon (TGA) was the translational initiation codon. The RP58 protein contains the putative nuclear localization signal in the amino-terminal region (KKKLKEK, amino acids 114–120). The carboxyl-terminal region of the RP58 protein contains 4 sets of Kruppel-type zinc finger motifs separated by a short conserved motif, TGEKP(Y/P)X (H/C link). Data base searches using BLAST and FASTA programs revealed that the amino-terminal region (amino acids 1–115), termed the POZ domain here, is highly conserved in a number of C2H2zinc finger proteins (30–40% identity), including the human BCL-6 protein, the human HIC-1 protein, the human PLZF protein, the human KUP protein, clone 18, mouse ZF-5, and human ZID (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, the central region between the POZ domain and zinc finger motifs was not found to have any significant similarity with previously described proteins. To determine the size and expression pattern of RP58 mRNA, multi-tissue Northern blots were probed with a 1.5-kb RP58 ORF. A major transcript of approximately 4.3 kb was detected in lymphoid tissues, testis, heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and pancreas and at much lower levels in other tissues, along with a minor band at 9 kb (Fig. 1 C). The size of the major transcript was consistent with that of RP58 cDNA, suggesting that the RP58 cDNA contains a full-length cDNA. Interestingly, a faint band at 7 kb appeared to be expressed only in brain. Our preliminary studies suggested that this 7-kb RNA may be derived from a particular portion of the brain. The expression of several different transcripts is suggestive of alternative splicing, as is frequently observed for mRNAs encoding zinc finger proteins (25Schneider-Gadicke A. Beer-Romero P. Brown L.G. Mardon G. Luoh S.W. Page D.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Bordereaux D. Fichelson S. Tambourin P. Gisselbrecht S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 925-927PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 D illustrates expression of RP58 protein in various human tissues, studied by immunoblotting with an anti-RP58 antibody. Specific binding was found for a 60-kDa band which corresponds to the full length of RP58 protein. In addition, a 48-kDa band, thought to be the truncated form, 2K. Aoki, G. Meng, R. Ishida, and M. Kasai, manuscript in preparation. was detected. The results clearly indicated that there is no direct correlation between the mRNA level and the amount of protein in the spleen, brain, and skeletal muscle (compare Fig. 1, C and D). Comparison of protein samples revealed that the 60-kDa protein level in brain is several hundredfold higher than in any other tissues (Fig. 1 E), suggesting post-transcriptional control. We have employed a CAST protocol (27Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) to determine the consensus binding sequence for RP58. Based on previous reports (1Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 2Numoto M. Niwa O. Kaplan J. Wong K.-K. Merrell K. Kamiya K. Yanagihara K. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) showing inhibition of its DNA binding ability by the amino-terminal domains of ZID and ZF5, a truncated form of RP58 (a GST fusion protein lacking the POZ domain), GST-RP58 (ΔPOZ), was immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads and incubated with a pool of synthetic oligonucleotides. The bound complexes were isolated and subjected to 10, 14, or 18 cycles of PCR amplification. Following several rounds of amplification, the resulting products of approximately 50 bp were cloned and sequenced. Fig. 2 A lists the sequences of the central portions of each clone obtained after cloning using the CAST protocol. Some of the clones, especially CAST4, overlapped 26 out of the total of 56 clones. All of the sequences contained a (A/C)ACATCTG core within a conserved 10-bp (A/C)ACATCTG(G/T)(A/C) sequence (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the most conserved sequence of the core was found to be the consensus E box sequence, CANNTG (28Kadesch T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 31-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether the consensus binding sites determined by CAST really bind to the RP58, an EMSA was performed with the recombinant RP58 using the various sequences listed in Fig. 2 A. In this experiment, to avoid possible steric hindrance by GST, full-length RP58 containing a six-histidine tag was used instead of the GST fusion protein. Of six fragments studied, CAST4 or CAST2-2, which have a perfect match for the core sequence, bound to the RP58 with the highest affinity. The binding affinity decreased with the increase of mis-match sequences and the pool of unselected sequences, N20, did not form the complex, suggesting RP58 binding specificity (Fig. 3 A). In competition assays using cold CAST4 or N20 fragments, the binding specificity of RP58 was again confirmed (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, DNA-protein complex formation was efficiently inhibited by the addition of anti-RP58 antibody, but not by normal rabbit IgG, suggesting the involvement of RP58 protein in the complex.Figure 3A, identification of the RP58-DNA complex by EMSA. EMSA was performed as described earlier (21Kasai M. Aoki K. Matsuo Y. Minowada J. Maziarz R.T. Strominger J.L. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant RP58 (0.4 μg) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled various oligonucleotides selected by CAST and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in CAST binding buffer. DNA-protein complexes were then separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. The names of the clones used as probes are shown. B, competition assay. A competition assay was performed using the CAST4 fragment as a probe. Increasing amounts of cold CAST4 or N20 fragments (10, 50, and 250 ng) and anti-RP58 antibody (rabbit Ig G), anti-RP58, or normal rabbit IgG,NR-IgG (0.1 and 0.5 μg), were added as competitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Some of the POZ/zinc finger proteins including BCL-6, PLZF, and ZF5 are known to function as sequence-specific transcriptional repressors (2Numoto M.

A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Based on the consensus binding sequence for RP58, we asked whether RP58 can also repress the transcription of reporter genes from promoters linked to the DNA target site, BS10, containing 10 copies of the binding core sequence for RP58 (Fig. 4 B). The RP58 expression vector, pcDNA3.1-RP58, and the BS10-pGL2C reporter vector containing the luciferase gene driven by the SV40 early promoter (SV) linked to the DNA target site, BS10, were cotransfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 A). In this experiment, no significant difference was detectable between the basal levels of luciferase expressions of BS10-pGL2C and pGL2C (data not shown). The results indicate that the pcDNA3.1-RP58 led to a strong and dose-dependent repression of the reporter gene expression, whereas the plasmid expressing the TRAX protein, pcDNA3.1-TRAX, did not affect the transcriptional activity (Fig. 4 C). The transrepression activity of RP58 proved to be specific and dependent upon the presence of the RP58 domain in the effector vector and the BS10 sequence in the reporter vector. The properties intrinsic to RP58, sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, transcriptional repression, and the presence of nuclear localization signal in the amino-terminal region, raise the possibility that it may localize to a particular region of the nucleus. Therefore, we examined localization of RP58 in the nucleus of IMR32 cells (human neuroblastoma) by immunofluorescence experiments. Indirect immunofluorescence of RP58 proteins revealed a punctate nuclear staining pattern, especially in regions adjacent to the nuclear membrane (Fig. 5). To investigate further its distribution at the ultrastructural level, we performed immunogold cytochemistry. When sections of IMR32 cells were labeled with anti-RP58 antibody, followed by the second antibody conjugated with 15-nm gold particles, over 90% of the gold particles were found to be distributed in the electron-dense chromatin (Fig. 6).Figure 6Immunogold electron microscopic detection of RP58. IMR32 cells were processed for immunogold labeling by incubation with an affinity purified rabbit antibody to the carboxyl-terminal peptide of RP58, followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 15-nm colloidal gold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results suggest that the transcriptional repression activity of RP58 might be important in controlling heterochromatin-mediated gene inactivation processes. We have isolated a novel zinc finger protein, RP58, sharing homology with a number of transcription regulators at the amino terminus and determined the RP58 consensus binding site using the CAST technique. Interestingly, the preferred binding sequence consensus for RP58, (A/C)ACATCTG(G/T)(A/C), contains the E box sequence of CANNTG, with most clones containing a CATCTG core. E boxes were first identified as in vivo protein-binding sites in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer (29Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 30Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 31Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 236: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Subsequently, E box binding activity was found for members of the helix-loop-helix class of proteins (28Kadesch T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 31-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) including a number of developmentally relevant examples like MyoD and c-Myc, and the proteins encoded by the Drosophila genes Daughterless, Twist, and Achaete-scute. The presence of an E box motif in the RP58-binding site raises the possibility that RP58 competes with other transcriptional regulators such as the helix-loop-helix class of proteins carrying the E box binding activity. We have demonstrated that in transient transfection assays the RP58 protein can mediate a sequence-specific transcriptional repression. Transcriptional repression activities have been proposed for other POZ/zinc finger proteins including BCL-6 (32Chang C.C. Ye B.H. Chaganti R.S.K. Dalla-Favera R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 33Seyfert V.S. Allman D. He Y. Staudt L.M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2331-2342PubMed Google Scholar), ZF5 (2Numoto M. Niwa O. Kaplan J. Wong K.-K. Merrell K. Kamiya K. Yanagihara K. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and PLZF (34Hong S.H. David G. Wong C.H. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although a number of the POZ/zinc finger proteins studied so far have displayed a consistent transcriptional repression activity, some POZ/zinc finger proteins display transcriptional activation (4Sugawara M. Scholl T. Ponath P.D. Strominger J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8438-8450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or the ability to modify nucleosomal structure (35Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), suggesting multi-functional aspects of this protein family. Other lines of evidence have indicated that the POZ domain acts in specific protein-protein interactions serving to organize higher order macromolecular complexes and thereby affect transcriptional activity (1Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 6Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that transcriptional repression is not an intrinsic property of the POZ domain. Therefore, the repressor activity of RP58 protein might be regulated by controlling the affinity to its target sequence through interaction with the POZ domains of other partner proteins. A search of the eukaryotic promoter data base using the BLAST program revealed that the binding core sequence of RP58 is present in the putative promoter regions of various genes including the rat and bovine preprotachykinin genes (GenBankTM accession numbers E30009and E11122), the human, mouse, and rat anion exchanger (AE1 or Band3) genes (GenBankTM accession numbers X77739, E25042, andL02942), the human Na/H exchanger (NHE-1) gene (GenBankTM accession number E40005), and the human protein C gene (GenBankTM accession number E320001) (Table I). The binding core sequences for RP58 were found 46–252 bp upstream from the transcription start sites, suggesting that these genes are possible targets for the RP58 protein. Since levels of RP58 protein vary in human tissues, it is likely that transcription of target genes is regulated by the differential expression. Considering the extraordinary amount of RP58 protein expressed in brain, further studies focused on brain might provide a clue as to its functional significance.Table IConsensus binding sequence for RP58 in the putative promoter regions of various genesGene namePromoter region sequencePositionBovinePreprotachykininAACCCAATTGGGTCC˙A˙G˙A˙T˙G˙T˙T˙ATGCGC−172 to −165RatPreprotachykininAACCCAATTTGGTCC˙A˙G˙A˙T˙G˙T˙T˙ATGGAC−168 to −161Human anion exchanger 1GACTCACAGCTGTCC˙A˙G˙A˙T˙G˙T˙G˙GGTAAG−182 to −175Mouse anion exchanger 1GATGCACAGCTGTCC˙A˙G˙A˙T˙G˙T˙G˙GGTGAG −53 to −46Rat anion exchanger 1GATGCACAGCTGTCC˙A˙G˙A˙T˙G˙T˙G˙GGTGAG−165 to −158Human Na/H exchangerTTATGAGACTGC˙A˙G˙A˙T˙G˙T˙G˙GACGTGAAA−252 to −245Human protein CAAATGAGACC˙A˙C˙A˙T˙C˙T˙G˙TCAAGGGTTTT−176 to −169The binding core sequence for RP58 is indicated by dots, and one-base mis-matched sequences are underlined.

The translation start site is numbered +1. A number of heterochromatin-associated proteins contain a conserved domain, designated the “chromodomain” that is necessary for chromosome binding and sufficient to define binding specificity (36Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The chromodomain-containing proteins are not thought to bind to DNA directly but probably associate with heterochromatin through protein-protein interactions. Since RP58 does not contain the chromodomain, it is of particular interest to determine whether it associates with condensed chromatin regions through interaction with other domains of partner proteins or binds to DNA even when the DNA is highly compacted in the mitotic chromosome. Our observations also support the previous studies indicating that the DrosophilaGAGA transcription factor, which belongs to the zinc finger protein family with POZ domain, can associate with specific DNA regions of heterochromatin throughout the cell cycle (11Raff J.W. Kellum R. Alberts B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5977-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast to the GAGA factor functioning as a transcriptional activator, RP58 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with a transcriptional repression activity, the first to be reported to associate with condensed chromatin. RP58 was originally found by screening for translin-associated molecules in yeast two-hybrid interaction analyses, the protein demonstrating interaction with translin lacking its leucine zipper motif, but not with full-length translin. Although it seems likely that the interaction occurs in the processing of multimeric translin structure, final conclusions can only be drawn when the interaction of these molecules is proven in vivo. Transcriptional repression is an important component of gene regulation, but its mechanism is not yet as fully understood as that for transcriptional activation. The experiments reported here provide the molecular basis for addressing many intriguing questions such as the relation between gene-specific repression and the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus (37Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 38Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and its implications for human diseases associated with the silencing mechanisms involved in genetic imprinting. Further investigation of RP58 functions is certainly warranted to acquire a better understanding of these problems. We thank J. C. Wang and J. L. Strominger for valuable suggestions."

Each enzyme forms the final product with a specific chain length. The product specificity of an enzyme is thought to be determined by the structure around the unknown path through which the product elongates in the enzyme. To explore the path, we introduced a few mutations at the 5th, the 8th, and/or the 11th positions before the first aspartate-rich motif of geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase or farnesyl-diphosphate synthase. The side chains of these amino acids are situated on the same side of an α-helix. In geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase, a single mutated enzyme (F77S) mainly produces a C25 product (Ohnuma, S.-I., Hirooka, K., Hemmi, H., Ishida, C., Ohto, C., and Nishino, T. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 18831–18837). A double mutated enzyme (L74G and F77G) mainly produces a C35 compound with significant amounts of C30 and C40. A triple mutated enzyme (I71G, L74G, and F77G) mainly produces a C40compound with C35 and C45. Mutated farnesyl-diphosphate synthases also show similar patterns. These findings indicate that the elongating product passages on a surface of the side chains of the mutated amino acids, the original bulky amino acids had blocked the elongation, and the path is conserved in prenyltransferases. Moreover, the fact that some double and triple mutated enzymes can also form small amounts of products longer than C50 indicates that the paths in these mutated enzymes can partially access the outer surface of the enzymes.

Prenyltransferases, also referred to as polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases, are indispensable for biosyntheses of more than 20,000 naturally occurring isoprenoids and constitute a broad family of enzymes that catalyze the sequential condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP, C5)1 with allylic prenyl diphosphates (1Poulter C.D. Rilling H.C. Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 161-224Google Scholar). These enzymes are classified into two groups according to the stereochemistry of the E or Zdouble bond that is formed by the condensation. Although organisms useZ-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases only for the synthesis of dolichols for N-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis,Z-polyprenols for peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacteria, and natural rubber, E-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases are used for the synthesis of a vast variety of important natural isoprenoids (Fig. 1). A number of enzymes that yield (all-E)-prenyl diphosphate have been isolated from various organisms. Geranyl-diphosphate (GPP, C10) synthase, found in plants (2Heide L. Berger U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), catalyzes the single condensation of IPP with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C5) to give GPP. The GPP is the precursor of all monoterpenes. Farnesyl-diphosphate (FPP, C15) synthase, which is one of the key enzymes of the biosynthesis of steroids, cholesterol, farnesylated proteins, sesquiterpenes, and so on, catalyzes the consecutive condensation of two molecules of IPP with DMAPP to give FPP as the ultimate product. Geranylgeranyl-diphosphate (GGPP, C20) synthases are thought to be classified in two groups. One type uses DMAPP, GPP, or FPP as the allylic substrate (plant, bacteria, and archaea), and the other utilizes FPP as a substrate (fungi and animals) to give an amphiphilic molecule containing four isoprene units, GGPP, which is a precursor of diterpenes, carotenoids, geranylgeranylated proteins, and ether-linked lipids of archaea. LongE-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases producing compounds with chain lengths from C30 to C50 are involved in respiratory quinone biosynthesis. Chicle and Gutta-percha are high molecular weight compounds like a natural rubber (3Tanaka Y. Nunogaki K. Kageyu A. Mori M. Sato Y. J. Nat. Rubber Res. 1988; 3: 177-183Google Scholar, 4Tanaka Y. J.

These enzymes have several conserved regions in their amino acid sequences, which include two aspartate-rich motifs. Thus, these enzymes are presumed to have evolved from the common ancestor. However, what difference of amino acid causes the product specificity and how the enzymes have evolved into today's variety of prenyltransferases were almost unknown (8Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M.

In both Sulfolobus acidocaldarius GGPP synthase and Bacillus stearothermophilus FPP synthase, we have found that the fifth amino acid before the first aspartate-rich motif (FARM) is extremely important for the ultimate chain length determination (21Ohnuma S.

From the analysis of the amino acid, we demonstrated that the ω terminus of an elongating allylic product directly contacts with this amino acid residue, and the interaction must prevent further condensation of IPP (23Ohnuma S.

Although we examined various FPP synthases and GGPP synthases mutated at the 5th position before FARM, there was no mutated enzyme that could yield any products longer than C30 (21Ohnuma S.

Therefore, we hypothesized that another amino acid upstream from FARM must block the further elongation and that the alteration of this amino acid would be essential to create from GGPP synthase and FPP synthase an enzyme that produces compounds longer than C30. To demonstrate our hypothesis, we introduced mutations in the upstream region from FARM of S. acidocaldarius GGPP synthase and B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase and analyzed their products. This information should elucidate a path through which products formed by long E-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases elongate and might elucidate a common mechanism of chain termination of longE-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthases. Furthermore, this information might enable investigators to design of a “no stop” prenyltransferase.

For the construction of pGGPS-L6 and pGGPS-L7, a single-strand DNA template was isolated from Escherichia coli CJ236 containing pGGPS-L4, and then the second mutagenesis was carried out using oligo-F77A, 5′-CATACTGCTACGCTTGTTCATGATG-3′ or oligo-F77G, 5′-CATACTGGTACGCTTGTTCATGATG-3′.

Each primer also contains an additional restriction enzyme site, and mutations are indicated by bold letters. We have confirmed the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing using a model 373A DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). E. coli XL1-Blue was transformed with the plasmids containing mutated GGPP synthase genes and cultured according to the method described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

In the procedures, we had used heat treatment to eliminate a majority of thermolabile endogenous protein. Thus, we confirmed that all mutated enzymes are still thermostable (Table I). The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 25 nmol of [1-14C]IPP (37 GBq/mol), 25 nmol of the indicated allylic substrate (DMAPP, GPP, (all-E)-FPP, (all-E)-GGPP), 5 μmol of MgCl2, 10 μmol of phosphate buffer (pH 5.8), and the same amount of indicated enzyme. This mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by chilling quickly in an ice bath. The mixture was shaken with 3.5 ml of 1-butanol that had been saturated with H2O. The 1-butanol layer was washed with water saturated with NaCl, and the radioactivity in the 1-butanol layer was determined with a liquid scintillation counter.Table IPrenyltransferase activity of the mutated GGPP synthaseEnzymeSpecific activityRelative activityThermostabilityDMAPPGPPFPPGGPPnmol/min/mg%Wild type (C20)6.4 ± 0.41100 ± 1.7100 ± 6.748 ± 9.21.7 ± 0.7395 ± 5.2Mutant 3 (C25, F77S)7.3 ± 0.3596 ± 1.0100 ± 4.859 ± 1.911 ± 2.7120 ± 3.4GGPS-L1 (C25, V73A, F77S)9.1 ± 0.5883 ± 7.1100 ± 6.872 ± 1.711 ± 3.5110 ± 11GGPS-L2 (C25, V73G, F77S)8.1 ± 0.3489 ± 8.5100 ± 4.268 ± 3.314 ± 3.6110 ± 7.3GGPS-L3 (C25, L74A, F77S)7.1 ± 0.1690 ± 2.4100 ± 2.364 ± 1.910 ± 1.3120 ± 11GGPS-L4 (C30, L74G, F77S)4.0 ± 0.13130 ± 4.0100 ± 3.341 ± 3.522 ± 0.78140 ± 5.8GGPS-L5 (C20, L74G)9.0 ± 0.5886 ± 7.8100 ± 7.042 ± 3.33.4 ± 0.3795 ± 12GGPS-L6 (C30, L74G, F77A)6.1 ± 0.51100 ± 6.9100 ± 8.739 ± 5.118 ± 2.7110 ± 5.0GGPS-L7 (C35, L74G, F77G)1.2 ± 0.022300 ± 19100 ± 2.160 ± 4.144 ± 6.3100 ± 4.1Each name of the mutated GGPP synthases is shown with the carbon number of the main long chain product and the amino acid replacement(s) in parentheses.

The plasmid encoding FPS-F1 was constructed by polymerase chain reaction method using pEX11 (8Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem.

Mutated nucleotides are indicated by bold letters, and the restriction sites are indicated by an underline. An upstream fragment and a downstream fragment were amplified using a combination of primers 1 and 2 and of primers 3 and 4, respectively. The upstream fragment obtained from the digestion with NcoI and BspHI and the downstream fragment obtained from the digestion with BspHI and HindIII were ligated back into the NcoI and HindIII sites of the original pEX11 plasmid. For the construction of the plasmid encoding FPS-F2, we used two primers as follow: primer 5, 5′-ATGGACAACGATGATTTGCG-3′ and primer 6, 5′-CAAATCATCATGGATCAAAG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using these primers and the plasmid encoding FPS-F1 as the template. The plasmid encoding FPS-F2 was formed by self-ligation of the blunt-ended amplified fragment. We have also confirmed the mutagenesis by the same way as the mutated GGPP synthase. E. coli XL1-Blue was transformed with the plasmids encoding mutated FPP synthases and cultured according to the method described previously (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The assay mixture contained, in a final volume of 200 μl, 25 nmol of [1-14C]IPP (37 GBq/mol), 25 nmol of the indicated allylic substrate (DMAPP, GPP, (all-E)-FPP, (all-E)-GGPP), 1 μmol of MgCl2, 10 μmol of NH4Cl, 10 μmol of 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μmol of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), and a suitable amount of enzyme. After the incubation at 55 °C for 20 min, the activity was determined by the 1-butanol extraction method described above. After the enzymatic reaction, the polyprenyl diphosphates were extracted with 1-butanol, and then the 1-butanol was evaporated under a N2 stream. The resulting polyprenyl diphosphates were treated with acid phosphatase according to the method of Fujii et al. (27Fujii H. Koyama T. Ogura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The hydrolysates were extracted with n-pentane and analyzed by reversed-phase thin layer chromatography using LKC-18 developed with acetone/H2O (9:1). To determine the chain length of long products, polyprenyl diphosphates extracted from 10 ml of the reaction mixture were treated with the similar method and analyzed by reversed-phase thin layer chromatography using HPTLC RP-18 developed with acetone/hexane (19:1). Authentic standard alcohols were visualized with iodine vapor, and the absolute radioactivities of the spots were measured with a Bio-image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji). Each amount of an allylic product was determined by division of the absolute radioactivity by the number of IPPs incorporated into the product. In our previous study, we made two mutated GGPP synthases that have the replacement of phenylalanine by serine or leucine at position 77, which is the 5th position before FARM (22Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Hemmi H. Ishida C. Ohto C. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18831-18837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These two artificial enzymes can mainly produce geranylfarnesyl diphosphate (GFPP, C25) with a small amount of HexPP (C30). However, we failed to create an enzyme yielding a product longer than C30. We have also reported that, in B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase, the replacement of tyrosine at the corresponding position causes a similar change in the ultimate product and that the amino acid at this position seems to contact directly with the ω terminus of FPP (21Ohnuma S.

Based on the fact that the mutated GGPP synthases did not yield long products, we have hypothesized that an amino acid that is situated 1 isoprene unit distant from the above mutated site directly blocks the further condensation. Tarshis et al. (28Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10871-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) have determined the three-dimensional structure of avian FPP synthase, which shows a considerable amino acid sequence similarity to S. acidocaldarius GGPP synthase and B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase. In the structure, the region around FARM forms an α-helix. The average number of residues is 3.6 per turn in an α-helix, which corresponds to 5.4 Å. This helix pitch is almost the same as the length of 1 isoprene unit of ∼5.1 Å, which was calculated based on the length of carbon bonds. Thus, assuming that a growing polyprenyl diphosphate elongates along the α-helix and that the elimination of the blocking side chain of the amino acid situated at one pitch of α-helix distant from the fifth amino acid before FARM enables the mutated enzyme to catalyze the synthesis of products longer than C30, we constructed several double mutated GGPP synthases; the first mutation is at the fifth amino acid before FARM, the second mutation is at the third or the fourth amino acid before the first mutation (Fig. 2). If one of the double mutated GGPP synthases can produce polyprenyl diphosphate longer than C30, it will be strong evidence for our hypothesis and will indicate that the elongating product directs to the side chain of the second mutated amino acid. Cells of E. coli XL1-Blue were transformed with the plasmids encoding the double mutated GGPP synthases, and the mutated enzymes were prepared according to the method reported previously. The specific activities of the mutated enzymes were determined by measuring the radioactivity in 1-butanol extractable materials of the reaction using DMAPP, GPP, FPP, or GGPP as the primer substrate (Table I). When assayed using GPP, all enzymes except for GGPS-L7 and GGPS-L4 showed comparable prenyltransferase activities. All mutated GGPP synthases and the wild type enzyme had similar relative activities for DMAPP, GPP, and FPP. On the other hand, the relative activities for GGPP based on GPP activities vary from 1.7 to 44%. The wild type enzyme hardly accepts GGPP as the primer substrate. The activity of GGPS-L5 for GGPP is also low, suggesting that the single mutation at position 74 is not enough to change the substrate specificity much. The relative activities of GGPS-L1, GGPS-L2, and GGPS-L3 are very similar to that of mutant 3 concerning total radioactive products, whereas the relative activities for GGPP of GGPS-L4, GGPS-L6, and GGPS-L7 are higher than those of GGPS-L1, GGPS-L2, and GGPS-L3. These results suggest that the mutation at position 73 has no effect on the chain length of product, whereas the leucine to glycine mutation at position 74 for mutants GGPS-L4, -6, and -7 is effective in changing the product specificity in such a way that L74G yields longer products than does mutant 3. To confirm these observations, the reaction products were analyzed. After treatment of 1-butanol extractable products with acid phosphatase, the chain length distribution of the resultant polyisoprenols and their amounts were analyzed by reversed-phase TLC. Prenyltransferases are supposed to utilize the intermediates that are initially formed and released in the reaction solution as the primer substrates again. To determine the chain length of the initially formed products as much as possible, the prenyltransferase reaction was terminated before 10% of the substrates were consumed. When the enzyme reaction was carried out using 25 μm [1-14C]IPP and 25 μmDMAPP, the wild type GGPP synthase mainly produced GGPP and did not give any products longer than GGPP (Fig. 3 A). Mutant 3, which has only a mutation of F77S, mainly produced GFPP with small amounts of FPP, GGPP, and HexPP. The product distribution was similar to that previously reported (22Ohnuma S. Hirooka K. Hemmi H. Ishida C. Ohto C. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18831-18837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The product distribution did not change when the second substitutions at the position 73 were introduced as shown in the results of GGPS-L1 and GGPS-L2. On the other hand, GGPS-L3 gave a small amount of HepPP although the main product is still C25. GGPS-L4 gave C30 product as the main product in the long chain region (>C20), with a large amount of HepPP. Moreover, GGPS-L4 can form small amounts of several polyprenyl diphosphates longer than C35. These data show that the second mutation at position 74 can influence the chain length determination. Furthermore, they show that the mutated enzyme with a smaller amino acid at this position tends to produce longer products (Leu-74 < Ala-74 < Gly-74) (Fig. 3 A). We have reported in a previous paper (23Ohnuma S. Narita K. Nakazawa T. Ishida C. Takeuchi Y. Ohto C. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30748-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that, in the case of B. stearothermophilus FPP synthase, the chain length of product was dramatically changed by the replacement of the amino acid at the fifth amino acid before FARM and that the average chain length of products is almost inversely proportional to the accessible surface area of the substituted amino acid. Moreover, we also observed similar phenomena in S. acidocaldarius GGPP synthase. Main products of single mutated enzymes of F77S and F77G are C25 and C30, respectively (data not shown). By analogy of these results, we have constructed two more additional artificial GGPP synthases, GGPS-L6 and GGPS-L7, each of which has the replacement with a small amino acid, alanine or glycine, at position 77 in addition to L74G. When the assay was carried out using DMAPP as the primer substrate, the relative amount of HexPP formed in the reactions by GGPS-L6 is about twice greater than that by GGPS-L4. GGPS-L7 mainly forms HepPP (C35) regarding"
https://openalex.org/W1980980623,"The neuregulins comprise a subfamily of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors that elicit diverse cellular responses by activating members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although neuregulin-1 and neuregulin-2 are both binding ligands for the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, they exhibit distinct biological activities depending on cellular context. In MDA-MB-468 human mammary tumor cells, neuregulin-2β (NRG2β) inhibits cell growth, whereas neuregulin-1β (NRG1β) does not. In these cells, NRG2β appears to preferentially act through the EGF receptor, stimulating receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ, Cbl, SHP2, and Shc to that receptor. NRG1β preferentially acts through ErbB3 in these cells by stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Shc to that receptor. In MDA-MB-453 cells, both NRG1β and NRG2β stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors to similar extents, but only NRG1β potently stimulates morphological changes consistent with their differentiation. The profiles of SH2 domain-containing proteins that are efficiently recruited to activated receptors differ for the two factors. These observations indicate that despite their overlapping receptor specificity, the neuregulins exhibit distinct biological and biochemical properties. Since both of these cell lines express only two of the known ErbB receptors, our results imply that EGF-like ligands might elicit differential signaling within the context of a single receptor heterodimer. The neuregulins comprise a subfamily of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors that elicit diverse cellular responses by activating members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although neuregulin-1 and neuregulin-2 are both binding ligands for the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, they exhibit distinct biological activities depending on cellular context. In MDA-MB-468 human mammary tumor cells, neuregulin-2β (NRG2β) inhibits cell growth, whereas neuregulin-1β (NRG1β) does not. In these cells, NRG2β appears to preferentially act through the EGF receptor, stimulating receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ, Cbl, SHP2, and Shc to that receptor. NRG1β preferentially acts through ErbB3 in these cells by stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Shc to that receptor. In MDA-MB-453 cells, both NRG1β and NRG2β stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors to similar extents, but only NRG1β potently stimulates morphological changes consistent with their differentiation.

NRG1 and NRG2 have at least two splice alternatives in their EGF-like domains, resulting in α and β isoforms of each. These EGF-like domains are sufficient for growth factor receptor binding and activation and are thought to be critical for neuregulin function (11Carraway III, K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).The EGF-like growth factors elicit their cellular responses through the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes the EGF receptor, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Each of these receptors is composed of a large extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion that contains a protein-tyrosine kinase activity and a carboxyl-terminal tail (21Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains are ∼40% homologous among the four family members, and the kinase domains display 60–85% homology, whereas the carboxyl-terminal tails are highly divergent. Specific tyrosine residues within the tail regions become phosphorylated in response to ligand binding, creating docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains (22Cantley L.C.

Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar).As suggested above, the neuregulins are capable of eliciting a variety of responses depending on the cellular context. A key question in ErbB-mediated signaling pertains to the biochemical mechanisms involved in specifying the cellular response to the EGF-like ligands. Such studies focus on how the different EGF-like ligands can induce different responses in a single cell type, and how a single EGF-like ligand can induce different responses in different cell types. Since signaling specificity begins with ligand recognition, intense interest has developed in ErbB receptor-ligand and receptor-receptor interactions and the mechanisms of signal propagation across the plasma membrane.An accumulating body of evidence suggests that each EGF-like growth factor binds with high affinity to specific ErbB receptors, but can activate heterologous receptors via ligand-stimulated receptor heterodimerization and cross-phosphorylation (24Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For example, NRG1 binds with high affinity to either ErbB3 or ErbB4 (25Carraway III, K.L. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R. Platko J.V.

In fact, it appears that the ErbB receptors undergo an extensive network of ligand-stimulated receptor-receptor interactions and that the different receptor homo- and heterodimeric combinations can give rise to different cellular responses (29Riese D.J., II Van Raaij T.M.

Hence, it is believed that a major mechanism by which the different EGF-like ligands can elicit diverse responses is by preferentially stimulating different pairs of ErbB receptors (35Riese D. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Differences in cellular responses then may arise from the capacity of the various ErbB receptors to recruit and activate distinct SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules (20Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar).Numerous studies indicate that ErbB3 and ErbB4 are the binding receptors for the α and β forms of both NRG1 and NRG2 (6Carraway III, K.L.

However, our previous studies suggest that although the β isoforms of NRG1 and NRG2 bind to the same receptors and exhibit ∼50% identity in their EGF-like domains, they exhibit different biological potencies toward cultured cells. In the present study, we have examined this further by characterizing NRG-stimulated signaling pathways in two human mammary tumor cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453. We find that the two growth factors elicit different cellular responses in the two cell lines and stimulate differences in the recruitment of SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins to activated receptors. Since each of these cell lines expresses predominantly only two of the known ErbB receptors, the preferential heterodimerization model discussed above cannot fully account for differential signaling by the neuregulins. Our results point to another level of growth factor receptor regulation where two different ligands that engage identical receptors elicit distinct responses.DISCUSSIONThe neuregulins have been observed to elicit a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and apoptosis (1Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 2Lemke G. Mol. Cell.

Jannot C.B. Beerli R.R. Graus P.D. Maurer F.G. Hynes N.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3804-3811PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested in elucidating the biochemical mechanisms that underlie the pleiotropic activities of these factors. Our previous studies (6Carraway III, K.L. Weber J.L. Unger M.J. Ledesma J., Yu, N. Gassmann M. Lai C. Nature. 1997; 387: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), as well as those from other laboratories (18Chang H. Riese D.J., II Gilbert W. Stern D.F. McMahan U.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 36Higashiyama S. Horikawa M. Yamada K. Ichino N. Nakano N. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J. Matsushita N. Nagatsu T. Taniguchi N. Ishiguro H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that NRG1β and NRG2β bind to the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors, with no detectable affinity for the EGF receptor or ErbB2. Despite the identical receptor binding specificity and 53% amino acid identity shared by the EGF-like domains of NRG1β and NRG2β, we have found that these two factors elicit distinct biological responses in MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468 cells. In this study, we have examined the biochemical responses of these two cell lines to NRG1β and NRG2β and found evidence for differential signaling via two new mechanisms of neuregulin action. In MDA-MB-468 cells, it appears that the two growth factors preferentially stimulate and signal through different ErbB receptors. In contrast, NRG1β and NRG2β stimulate the same receptors in MDA-MB-453 cells, but the stimulated receptors differ in their signaling capacities.In MDA-MB-468 cells, NRG1β potently stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 and the recruitment of signaling proteins to that receptor, whereas NRG2β had little effect. NRG1β did not affect the rate at which these cells progress through the cell cycle. However, a growth stimulatory effect of NRG1β may be masked in these tumor cells by their high basal rate of growth. On the other hand, NRG2β stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and the recruitment of signaling proteins to that receptor, whereas NRG1β had no detectable effect. Many of the effects of NRG2β on the EGF receptor mimic those of EGF; likewise, both EGF and NRG2β retard the progression of MDA-MB-468 cells through the cell cycle. The major difference between NRG2β and EGF effects on these cells is that EGF induced apoptosis, whereas NRG2β only slowed cellular growth. Since only EGF stimulated STAT3 recruitment to the EGF receptor and its activation by tyrosine phosphorylation,2 our results suggest that STAT3 may play a role in mediating EGF-stimulated cell death. This is consistent with a previous report demonstrating that STAT3 was insensitive to EGF treatment in variants of MDA-MB-468 cells that did not undergo EGF-induced apoptosis (39Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which the two NRGs define their signaling receptors in these cells is unclear. MDA-MB-468 cells express abundant EGF receptor and moderate levels of ErbB3, but no ErbB2 or ErbB4. Given this receptor complement, homodimers of the EGF receptor or ErbB3 or heterodimers consisting of the EGF receptor and ErbB3 are possible signaling entities. Since ErbB3 lacks an intrinsic kinase activity (41Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that ErbB3 homodimers mediate signaling. Our previous observations and unpublished studies 3A. J. Diamonti and K. L. Carraway, unpublished observations. using EGF receptor expressed in insect cells, which lack expression of other ErbB receptors, indicate that neither NRG1β nor NRG2β binds to or stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in the absence of the other ErbB receptors. Hence, it is unlikely that EGF receptor homodimers mediate neuregulin signaling. Therefore, both NRG1β and NRG2β are likely signaling through heterodimers of the EGF receptor with ErbB3. In support of this notion, we have observed that a monoclonal anti-ErbB3 antibody that blocks NRG binding to ErbB3 inhibits NRG1β-stimulated ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation and NRG2β-stimulated EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.2Therefore, it appears that although EGF receptor-ErbB3 heterodimers are the signaling entities for both NRG1β and NRG2β in MDA-MB-468 cells, diversity is generated by the preferential activation of ErbB3 by NRG1β and of the EGF receptor by NRG2β within the heterodimeric receptor context.An interesting observation resulting from our studies with the MDA-MB-468 cells concerns correlations between total receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the efficiency of signaling. For ErbB3, there is a strong correlation. Tyrosine phosphorylation is stimulated strongly by NRG1β, moderately by EGF, and poorly by NRG2β. Likewise, the recruitment of the signaling proteins Shc and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase follows the same pattern. There is no similar correlation between the total tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and the biological or biochemical responses mediated by this receptor. We estimate that EGF induces at least a 20-fold higher degree of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation than does NRG2β. However, the two growth factors inhibit cellular growth to similar extents and stimulate the recruitment of similar levels of some signaling molecules, including phospholipase C-γ, Cbl, SHP2, and Shc, to the EGF receptor.Two possibilities might account for this effect. First, NRG2β may preferentially and stoichiometrically induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of sites on the total EGF receptor population responsible for mediating its interaction with phospholipase C-γ, Cbl, SHP2, and Shc. In this model, EGF would induce a wider range of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation events. This possibility seems unlikely because ErbB3, which appears to mediate the response of the EGF receptor to NRG2β, is present at limiting quantities and would need to act in a catalytic manner to stimulate the total EGF receptor pool. Alternatively, it is possible that only a subset of the total EGF receptor population is capable of recruiting phospholipase C-γ, Cbl, SHP2, and Shc following treatment with either NRG2β or EGF. This explanation implies that there are subsets of receptors that are predisposed to mediate signaling events by interacting with SH2 and PTB domain-containing intracellular proteins and that remaining receptors may be functionally inert. Hence, the population of EGF receptors that associate with ErbB3 upon EGF binding or those localized to specific domains at the cell surface where signaling molecules reside may be the functionally active species. The overactivation of the EGF receptor in response to saturating EGF may then stimulate the phosphorylation of the receptor at sites responsible for STAT3 recruitment.The MDA-MB-453 cells exhibit a different response than the MDA-MB-468 cells. NRG1β and NRG2β stimulate the gross tyrosine phosphorylation of the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors to similar extents, but the degree to which signaling molecules associate with the receptors differs depending on the stimulating ligand. NRG2β reproducibly stimulated lower levels of ErbB2 association with the SH2 and PTB domain-containing signaling molecules we examined. However, within the same experiment, the degree to which these signaling molecules associated with ErbB3 varied with the ligand presented to the cells. NRG2β stimulated the recruitment of SHP2 and Shc to ErbB3 as efficiently as did NRG1β, but less efficiently stimulated Grb2 recruitment.Again, the mechanism underlying the differential recruitment is unclear. These cells express abundant levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 and very low levels of EGF receptor and ErbB4. We have observed that a monoclonal anti-ErbB3 antibody that blocks binding of NRG to ErbB3 abrogates the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3, stimulated by both NRG1β and NRG2β.2 Hence, signaling in these cells is undoubtedly mediated by heterodimeric interactions between ErbB2 and ErbB3. One possibility is that the two different growth factors stimulate the same tyrosine phosphorylation events on ErbB2 and ErbB3, but induce different conformations of the heterodimer such that certain intracellular interactions are sterically precluded. Another possibility is that the two ligands preferentially induce phosphorylation of different tyrosine residues on ErbB2 and ErbB3. Future experiments will address these possibilities.

Recently, an overlapping Sp1·EGR-1 binding site has been identified within the interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene promoter directly upstream of the binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). We used transfection assays to study how the abundantly and constitutively expressed Sp1 protein and the immediate early EGR-1 zinc finger protein regulate IL-2 gene expression. Here, we identify EGR-1 as an important activator of theIL-2 gene. In Jurkat T cells, EGR-1 but not Sp1 acts as a potent coactivator for IL-2 transcription, and in combination with NFATc, EGR-1 increases transcription of an IL-2 reporter construct 200-fold. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that recombinant EGR-1 and NFATc bind independently to their target sites within the IL-2 promoter, and the presence of both sites on the same DNA molecule is required for EGR-1·NFATc·DNA complex formation.

T cell receptor engagement induces sequential signaling reactions that are converted to the nucleus, where transcription of novel genes is induced. Most of the directly activated immediate early genes encode transcription factors that regulate the nuclear events essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and T cell effector function.

EGR1 proteins are closely related within their zinc finger regions; however, their flanking domains are much less conserved. Although all four recombinant EGR proteins have been reported to bind to the same consensus sequences GCG(G/T)GGGCG, binding studies with recombinant EGR-1 and EGR-4/pAT133 proteins expressed in eukaryotic systems revealed different binding affinities and recognition of distinct target sequences (16Nardelli J.

A large number of regulatory GC-rich promoter elements that represent overlapping binding sites for EGR-1 and Sp1 have been recently identified (20Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

As both zinc finger proteins bind alternatively to these elements, it is of interest to define which protein mediates transcriptional regulation through these overlapping binding sites.The regulation of the EGR-1 gene is well characterized; however, the functional mechanisms of this protein in gene transcription are less defined. EGR consensus or binding sites are present in promoters of a number of tissue specifically expressed genes such as cytokines, growth factors, and genes involved in cell cycle regulation, e.g. IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-α, tumor growth factor-β, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-α, β chain, EGR-1, EGR-4/pAT133, hox 1.4, and nur77 (18Zipfel P.F.

Eibel H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2678-2684PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this dual function, several activating and one inhibitory domain have been localized within the EGR-1 protein (33Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell.

Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ZIP element is located immediately upstream of the distal binding element for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Transfection experiments revealed that both the ZIP site and the distal NFAT site have activating functions (19Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol.

In most of these promoters, NFAT binding sites are adjacent to binding sites for AP-1 proteins (e.g. in theIL-2, IL-4, IL-5, CD40L, and GM-CSF gene promoter; reviewed in Ref. 45Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar), and a cooperation of NFAT factors with AP-1 increases the binding affinity to DNA and stabilizes the NFAT·AP-1·DNA complex (47Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Boise L.H. Petryniak B. Mao X. June C.H. Wang C.Y. Lindsten T. Bravo R. Kovary K.

Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Besides this cooperation with AP-1 proteins, a functional interaction of NFATp with the proto-oncogene c-Maf in transcription of the murine IL-4gene has been reported (50Ho I.C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar).To characterize which of the two ZIP binding proteins mediatesIL-2 gene transcription, we have analyzed the regulatory role of these zinc finger proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factor Sp1 has no effect on IL-2 transcription but that EGR-1 and NFATc interact synergistically. EGR-1 and NFATc bind independently to adjacent sites within the IL-2 gene promoter to form an EGR-1·NFATc·DNA complex. Although by itself EGR-1 has little transactivating capacity, this zinc finger protein enhances NFATc transactivation 25-fold. This is the first report that describes a functional interaction between the early growth response protein EGR-1 and a member of the NFAT family of transcription factors.DISCUSSIONThe EGR-1 gene is induced in a wide variety of cells by a number of distinct agents and links biochemical signaling to gene transcription. Little is known how this abundantly expressed zinc finger protein regulates tissue-specific gene expression. We have analyzed the function of EGR-1 in IL-2 gene induction, as transcription of this cytokine gene is highly restricted to lymphoid cells (40Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 41Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Within the IL-2 promoter, EGR-1 binds to the regulatory ZIP element, which contributes significantly to IL-2 transcription. The ZIP element, which serves as an overlapping binding site for EGR-1 and the constitutively expressed transcription factor Sp1 (19Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), is located immediately upstream of the distal NFAT·AP-1 binding site. This NFAT·AP-1 element is important for IL-2 gene transcription, and at this site NFAT factors interact with AP-1 proteins (40Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 48Boise L.H. Petryniak B. Mao X. June C.H. Wang C.Y. Lindsten T. Bravo R. Kovary K. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments suggest a cooperation between factors binding to the ZIP, NFAT, or AP-1 elements. Here, we demonstrate that EGR-1, but not Sp1, mediates IL-2 transcription via the ZIP site by functioning as a potent coactivator for the transcription factor NFATc. Binding studies with recombinant proteins show that the two factors bind independently to the adjacent promoter sites and form complexes when their binding sites are present on the same DNA molecule.Due to its tissue-specific expression and its essential role in immune response, regulation of the human IL-2 gene is extensively analyzed. Initial studies have shown that a 300-bp promoter fragment confers tissue specificity and inducibility in T cells (38Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar); however, additional regulatory elements have been described further upstream (60Avots A. Hoffmeyer A. Flory E. Cimanis A. Rapp U.R. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several regulatory elements representing binding sites for distinct transcription factors have been identified within the 300-bp promoter element (40Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A critical role was reported for a regulatory domain around position −290 that turned out to be a binding site for a combination of NFAT and AP-1 proteins (38Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 39Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Four distinct members of the NFAT family are identified, and NFATc and NFATp are considered to play a key role in cytokine gene expression (45Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar, 46Timmerman L.A. Healy J.I. Ho S.N. Chen L. Goodnow C.C. Crabtree G.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2735-2740PubMed Google Scholar). Adjacent NFAT and AP-1 binding sites are common in cytokine gene promoters (e.g. IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and CD40L) and a cooperation between these nuclear proteins has been reported in terms of DNA binding, stability of the DNA-bound complex, and transactivating functions (49Jain J.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 837-848PubMed Google Scholar).Within the human IL-2 gene promoter, the distal NFAT site is directly flanked by the regulatory ZIP element. Transfection assays revealed that a combination of the ZIP and the distal NFAT element interact in a synergistic fashion and contribute substantially toIL-2 gene transcription (19Skerka C.

The synergistic effect observed for these adjacent promoter elements is mediated by the nuclear factors EGR-1 and NFATc but not by Sp1. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies, both EGR-1 and NFATc form specific DNA-protein complexes and bind simultaneously to an oligonucleotide that reflects the native IL-2 promoter. Unlike other interacting transcription factors, the two proteins lack prominent domains typical for protein-protein interaction, and they do not form homo- or heterodimeric protein-protein complexes (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that binding of EGR-1 and NFATc is independent, and apparently each of the two proteins does not influence binding of the partner protein (Figs. 6 and 7). Independent binding of the two proteins is further confirmed by transfection experiments, as the coactivator function of EGR-1 requires the presence of a ZIP site (Fig. 2).The close proximity of the ZIP-, NFAT-, and AP-1 sites suggests a direct cooperation of all three proteins in gene transcription. Previous studies have reported a regulatory role of AP-1 proteins on IL-2 transcription and a cooperation between the AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun and NFATp. NFATp·AP-1 cooperation increases the stability of the NFAT-DNA complexes about 20-fold, and AP-1 protein influences the transcriptional activity of NFATp (49Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 57Jain J. Miner Z. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 837-848PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirm an interaction of the AP-1 proteins c-Fos and c-Jun with NFAT proteins, as c-Fos and c-Jun increase NFATc transcriptional activity 4-fold (Fig. 2). Although AP-1 regulates NFAT binding and transcription, apparently this factor fails to further enhance the synergy of EGR-1 and NFATc.In addition to the ZIP and the distal NFAT site, several regulatory elements and binding factors have been defined within theIL-2 gene promoter (40Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 41Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A negative regulatory element seems important for repression of IL-2 gene transcription (61Williams T.M. Moolten D. Burlein J. Romano J. Bhaerman R. Godillot A. Mellon M. Rauscher III, F.J. Kant J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and expression of this inhibitory factor in unstimulated Jurkat T cells may explain the lack of NFATc activity on the intactIL-2 gene promoter (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the synergy of EGR-1 and NFATc induces a reporter construct containing the complete 366 bp of the human IL-2 promoter in T cells. Thus, the activating capacity of the two factors can overrule the action of repressive factor(s) that function in unstimulated Jurkat cells.The exact mechanisms of the synergistic interaction between EGR-1 and NFATc are currently unknown. A similar functional synergy has recently been reported for EGR-1 and Rel A, another member of Rel protein family (37Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Apparently, EGR-1 does not form physical complexes with NFATc or with RelA. However, upon binding to the IL-2 gene promoter, EGR-1 and NFATc are in close proximity, and the proteins may even contact each other. The use of deletion mutants confirmed the existence of positive and negative regulatory domains within the EGR-1 protein (Fig. 3) (34Russo M.W. Matheny C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The functional assay shows that both the N- and the C-terminal deletion mutants act independently as strong coactivators in NFATc-mediated transcription (Fig. 3). The even stronger activity of the C-terminal deletion mutant of EGR-1 indicates the existence of an additional repressor domain located within the C-terminal part of the protein. The regulatory domains–potentially the activation domains–of the two proteins may form a cluster that may recruit additional factors relevant for gene activation. This recruited factor(s) may represent part of the general transcription complex. The weaker effect observed for EGR-1 and NFATc interaction in non-lymphoid 293 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells (60- and 30-fold) (Fig. 4 and data not shown) compared with Jurkat T cells (204-fold induction; Table I) suggests a restricted expression of this recruited factor(s).The EGR-1 protein is one of the factors that links common biochemical signaling pathways to regulation of gene expression. As demonstrated here for the IL-2 gene promoter, EGR-1 plays a central role in inducible gene transcription. By synergistic interaction with a restrictively expressed transcription factor, the ubiquitously induced EGR-1 protein contributes to expression of the IL-2 gene in T lymphocytes. The large number of gene promoters containing EGR-1 target sites and in particular the increasing number of promoters with overlapping EGR-1- and Sp1 sites (21Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) indicates for EGR-1 a general and important role in gene transcription. To further define the transcriptional role of EGR-1 in tissue-specific gene expression it will be of great interest to identify the mechanisms of interaction with transcription factors like NFATc. Antigenic activation of resting T cells initiates a cascade of biochemical and metabolic events that lead to cell proliferation, cytokine release, and T cell effector function (1Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 2Zipfel P.F. Irving S.G. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell.

T cell receptor engagement induces sequential signaling reactions that are converted to the nucleus, where transcription of novel genes is induced. Most of the directly activated immediate early genes encode transcription factors that regulate the nuclear events essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and T cell effector function. In general terms the proteins encoded by the transiently expressed immediate early genes either inactivate immediate early gene transcription in an autoregulatory fashion or they function as transcriptional activators of early gene expression.

Schlesinger M.J. Lipid Modification of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 83-134Google Scholar, 17Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev.

These proteins are structurally related in that they all contain a signal sequence for secretion in the N terminus and a GPI signal for an attachment to a GPI in the C terminus. The GPI-signal region is composed of three domains: a GPI attachment region comprising ω, ω+1, and ω+2 sites; a spacer of 5–10 amino acids; and a hydrophobic stretch of 10–15 amino acids. A protein containing the GPI-signal is cleaved at the ω site, and the resulting carboxyl terminus of the protein becomes covalently bound to a GPI moiety. This reaction occurs in the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum and, in yeast, requires GAA1 (19Hamburger D. Egerton M. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and GPI8 (20Benghezal M. Benachour A. Rusconi S. Aebi M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6575-6583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) gene products. The GPI-attached proteins are then transported to the cell surface, where they are exposed on the extracytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. During the transportation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane, the proteins are mannosylated and become GPI-anchored mannoproteins. In protozoa and mammals, the GPI-anchored mannoproteins remain on the plasma membrane and take biological functions related to cell-cell and cell-environment interactions (18Nosjean O. Briolay A. Roux B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 153-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21McConville M. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 22Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Takeda J. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 57-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the above functions, some of the GPI-anchored mannoproteins in the yeast are further processed and are incorporated into the cell wall. The incorporation of GPI-associated proteins into the cell wall is thought to occur in two steps: detachment of a GPI moiety from the protein and linking of the GPI-detached protein to β-1,6-glucan of the cell wall (3De Nobel H. Lipke P.N. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 42-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our knowledge of this process is very rudimentary. The addition of 30–40 amino acids from the C terminus of GPI-dependent cell wall proteins to a reporter protein directs incorporation of the chimeric proteins into the cell wall (23Van Barkel M.A.A. Caro L.H.P. Montijn R.C. Klis F.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen.

Microbiol. 1998; 27: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This suggests that the short C-terminal sequences contain all the information necessary for the incorporation of proteins into the cell wall. Therefore, it is possible that there is a gene product that would recognize a sequence or structural motif in the C-terminal region of GPI-associated proteins and direct their final cellular localization. A sequence alignment from our previous study on GPI-dependent cell wall proteins (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested that there is some sequence similarity among the ω-minus regions, corresponding to regions upstream of the ω site, of GPI-dependent cell wall proteins identified in the yeast. In this study, we examined, in detail, the amino acid sequences of the ω-minus regions and determined the sequence requirement for the incorporation of GPI-attached proteins into the cell wall. All experiments were carried out in S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (Mat a,his3 leu2 trp1 ura3; Ref. 26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1986; 122: 19-27Crossref Google Scholar).

The reporter gene is transcribed through the PGK1 promoter. A DNA fragment covering the C-terminal amino acids of a GPI-attached protein and about 200 base pairs of its 3′-noncoding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers containing a SalI orBamHI restriction site. The resulting fragment was inserted into the SalI and BamHI sites of pEαGALHA and then used to transform the yeast strain YPH499. Replacement of amino acid residues and construction of chimeric fusion genes were carried out by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (29Kitada K. Yamaguchi E. Hamada K. Arisawa M. Curr.

Mannoproteins liberated from the cell wall with the laminarinase treatment were heated at 100 °C for 10 min in LM buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Recombinant Endo H (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the solution to a final concentration of 0.3 milliunit/ml with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction solution was incubated overnight at 37 °C and then further incubated at 37 °C for a further 3 h after the addition of the same amount of Endo H. Potential ω sites for GPI attachment are predictable based on the consensus rules described by Nuoffer et al. (33Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by Udenfriend and Kodukula (17Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). A sequence analysis of putative GPI-associated proteins has suggested that in S. cerevisiae two amino acid residues, Asn and Gly, are preferentially used as ω site residues (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Caro L.H.P. Tettelin H. Vossen J.H. Ram A.F.J. Van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis of the ω site residue in Gas1p, a well characterized yeast GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein (41Vai M. Gatti E. Lacana E. Popolo L. Alberghina L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12242-12248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Nuoffer C. Jeno P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), has shown selectivity of the ω site residue. Substitution of the ω site residue from Asn, an authentic ω site residue, with Ser, Gly, Ala, Asp, or Cys slightly decreased the efficiency of GPI attachment, while replacement of Asn with other amino acid residues including Gln, Glu, and Thr resulted in an almost complete loss of the GPI attachment efficiency (33Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this selectivity of the ω site residue, we determined the ω sites of two GPI-dependent cell wall proteins, Yjr151c (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Ydr077w/Sed1p (15Van der Vaart J.M. Biesebeke R. Chapman J.W. Toshka H.Y. Klis F.M. Verrips C.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 615-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and two GPI-anchored plasma membrane proteins, Yir039c (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Ylr120c/Yap3p (43Ash J. Dominguez M. Bergerson J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Bourhonnais Y. J. Biol.

The C-terminal sequences, shown in Fig. 1 A, with mutated amino residues at the putative ω site were fused to the reporter gene, and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in yeast cells. GPI anchoring of the fusion proteins was examined by using phase separation of membrane proteins with Triton X-114 and digestion with PI-PLC (Fig. 1 B). In the C-terminal sequences of Ydr077w and Ylr120c containing the wild type residue Asn at the putative ω site, the fusion proteins were detected in the detergent phase and were released into the aqueous phase by the PI-PLC treatment, indicating GPI-dependent anchoring in membranes. Mutant fusion proteins with replacement of Asn with Gly or Asp at the ω site were also extracted in the detergent phase. The amounts of these proteins were comparable with that of the wild type, and they were also PI-PLC-sensitive. On the other hand, mutant fusion proteins with replacement of Asn with Gln, Glu, or Thr at the ω site were not detected in the detergent phase as much as the wild type. The amounts of these proteins detected were quite low, and most of them were not PI-PLC-sensitive, indicating loss of GPI anchoring efficiency. All these effects on GPI anchoring efficiency suggest the same selectivity of the ω site residue for GPI anchoring to that previously reported in Gas1p (33Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained with amino acid changes at the ω sites for the C-terminal sequences of Yjr151c and Yir039c (data not shown). From these results, it could be concluded that for all four proteins the N residues function as the ω sites for GPI attachment. Our previous study (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) has shown that the addition of the most C-terminal 40 amino acids of Yjr151c or Ydr077w to a reporter protein directs the resulting fusion proteins into the cell wall and that the addition of the C-terminal amino acids of Yir039c or Ylr120c directs their fusion proteins to the plasma membrane. This indicates that the C-terminal amino acid sequences determine the final cellular localization of GPI-associated proteins. These C-terminal amino acid sequences can be divided into two regions: the ω-plus and ω-minus regions with the ω site as a center (Fig. 1 A). The ω-plus region contains the residues of ω, ω+1, and ω+2 that function as the sequence required for GPI attachment; a spacer sequence of 5–10 amino acids; and a hydrophobic stretch of 10–15 amino acids. The ω-minus region is N-terminal to the ω site. To determine which of the two regions is responsible for determination of cellular localization, chimeric genes between the two regions were made and expressed in yeast cells, and the cellular localization of their corresponding chimeric fusion proteins was examined (Fig. 2). The chimeric proteins of the ω-minus region from either Yjr151c or Ydr077w and the ω-plus region from either Yir039c or Ylr120c were detected in the cell wall as much as those of the wild type Yjr151c and Ydr077w (Fig. 2 B). They were released only by digestion of the cell wall with glucanase. On the other hand, the chimeric proteins of the ω-minus region from either Yir039c or Ylr120c and the ω-plus region from either Yjr151c or Ydr077w were slightly detected in the cell wall (Fig. 2 B) Their amounts were as low as those observed in the wild types of Yir039c and Ylr120c. All chimeric proteins were determined to be membrane-associated GPI-associated proteins, because they were released from membrane fractions by the PI-PLC treatment (Fig. 2 C). From these results, it could be concluded that only the ω-minus region is responsible for determination of the final cellular localization of GPI-associated proteins. Short ω-minus sequences of 15 amino acids were used in these experiments (Figs. 1 A and 2 A). Therefore, a signal determining the final cellular localization could be located within these short ω-minus sequences. To identify amino acid sequence required for the cell wall incorporation, we further examined the ω-minus regions of Yjr151c and Ydr077w. Since the ω-minus regions of the GPI-dependent cell wall proteins examined are Ser- and/or Thr-rich (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Caro L.H.P. Tettelin H. Vossen J.H. Ram A.F.J. Van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we replaced each amino acid residue in the sequence with Ser and examined the effects of the mutations on the incorporation of Yjr151c- and Ydr077w-derived fusion proteins into the cell wall (Fig. 3 A). All fusion proteins examined were expressed in almost same levels (data not shown, but see Fig. 3 C, lanes T). For the C-terminal sequence of Yjr151c, changes only within the sequence VSINT corresponding to the ω-5 to ω-1 sites reduced the efficiency for the cell wall incorporation (Fig. 3 B, CT22). This reduction was not due to a decrease of GPI-anchoring efficiency, because the amount of the fusion proteins released by the PI-PLC treatment of the membrane fractions was comparable with that of a fusion protein with the wild type sequence (Fig. 3 C). Within the sequence VSINT, a single change of Val to Ser at the ω-5 site severely reduced the incorporation efficiency into the cell wall (Fig. 3 B, CT22-M05). Single or double amino acid replacement including the ω-2 site residue moderately reduced the cell wall incorporation (Fig. 3 B, CT22-M07-09). Furthermore, a double replacement at both the ω-5 and the ω-2 sites caused the most severe reduction in the cell wall incorporation efficiency (Fig. 3 B, CT22-M11). Similarly, for the C-terminal sequence of Ydr077w, amino acid replacements only in the sequence VVINS corresponding to the ω-5 to ω-1 sites reduced the efficiency for the cell wall incorporation. Single changes of the ω-5 or ω-2 site residue in the sequence showed a partial reduction of the cell wall incorporation efficiency (Fig. 3 B, CT26-M04 and -M08), while double replacements of both ω-5 and ω-2 site residues caused a severe reduction of cell wall incorporation (Fig. 3 B, CT26-M09). From these results, it could be concluded that the signal for the cell wall incorporation would be located in the sequence of the ω-5 to ω-1 sites and that within the sequence the ω-5 and ω-2 sites are the most important. A sequence alignment of the ω-minus regions in the GPI-dependent cell wall proteins (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) indicates that residues Ile and Val preferentially appear at the ω-5 site and residues Tyr and Asn are predominant at the ω-2 site. We examined the requirement of these amino acid residues for the cell wall incorporation by using a model construct. It contains a stretch of 15 serines followed by the ω site and the ω-plus region of Ylr120c/Yap3p, a well characterized GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein (43Ash J. Dominguez M. Bergerson J.J.M.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), fused to a HA-tagged α-galactosidase (Fig. 4 A, SCT01). As expected, this model fusion protein was mostly localized in membranes as a GPI-anchored protein (data not shown). However, a small amount of the fusion protein was detected in the cell wall as a glucanase-extractable protein (Fig. 4 B, SCT01). The addition of the ω-minus sequence containing the ω-5 to ω-1 region from Yjr004c/Agα1p, Yjr151c, Ydr077c/Sed1p, Ygr189c, and Yar050w/Flo1p, all GPI-dependent cell wall proteins, significantly increased the amount of fusion proteins incorporated into the cell wall (Fig. 4 B, SCT02-06). Their amount of incorporation was various among the five constructs. We replaced Ser with Val at each residue between the ω-6 and ω-1 sites and examined their effects on the cell wall incorporation of the fusion proteins (Fig. 4 B, SCT07-12). Only a change at the ω-2 site increased the incorporation efficiency of these fusion proteins. A similar result was obtained when each Ser was changed to Ile (data not shown). Next, Ser at the ω-2 site was replaced with Val, Ile, Tyr, Asn, or Lys (Fig. 4 B, SCT11-16). The efficiency of the cell wall incorporation was increased strongly by the replacement with Val or Ile and weakly by the replacement with Tyr or Asn. No increase was observed by the replacement with Lys. Finally, in addition to the change of Ser to Tyr at the ω-2 site, a change of Ser to Ile at the other sites was introduced (Fig. 4 B, SCT14-20). The additional changes at the ω-5 or ω-4 site further increased the efficiency of the cell wall incorporation. In SCT01, only 4.1 ± 0.9% of the total fusion protein was detected in the cell wall, while in SCT18 and SCT19, 26.6 ± 4.2 and 24.9 ± 3.7%, respectively, of the total fusion proteins were detected in the cell wall. The efficiency of the cell wall incorporation was enhanced 6-fold by combining the mutation of Ser to Ile at the ω-5 or ω-4 site with a mutation of Ser to Tyr at the ω-2 site. Similar enhancement of the cell wall incorporation was observed by the replacement of Ser with Val at the ω-5 or ω-4 site and of Ser with Asn at the ω-2 site (data not shown). A slight enhancement of the cell wall incorporation effect was observed by a change of Ser to Val at the ω-4 or ω-5 site in addition to the change of Ser to Val at the ω-2 site (data not shown). From all of these results, it could be concluded that combinations of Ile or Val at the ω-4 or -5 site and Tyr, Asn, or Val at the ω-2 site act to promote the incorporation of fusion proteins into the cell wall. S. cerevisiae Yap3p, an aspartic protease, is a GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein (43Ash J. Dominguez M. Bergerson J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Bourhonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20847-20854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 44Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using this protein, we tested whether the replacement of amino acid residues at the ω-4 or -5 and ω-2 sites directs the protein into the cell wall. First, the C-terminal sequence of Yap3p including the ω-minus region was used (Fig. 5 A). The fusion protein with this C-terminal sequence was not detected in the cell wall as a glucanase-extractable protein (Fig. 5 B, CT05). Changes of the ω-minus region from the wild type TSSKR to VSSVS, SVSVS, ISSYS, or VSSYS resulted in the fusion protein being incorporated into the cell wall (Fig. 5 B, CT05-M02-05). These sequences correspond to the ω-5 to ω-1 regions of GPI-dependent cell wall proteins. Interestingly, a change from TSSKR to SSSSS also led to the incorporation of the fusion protein in the cell wall, but its amount was very low (Fig. 5 B, CT05-M01). Second, the intact Yap3p tagged with HA was used. The Yap3p protein prepared from membrane fractions was detected as a broad band around 70 kDa after digestion with Endo H (Fig. 6 B). Yap3p was extracted in a detergent phase of two-phase separation with Triton X-114 and was released from membrane fractions by treatment with PI-PLC (Fig. 6 B), indicating that Yap3p is a GPI-anchored membrane protein. Mutant Yap3p proteins examined were also detected as GPI-attached membrane proteins (Fig. 6 C). Next, incorporation of the wild type and mutant Yap3p proteins into the cell wall was examined. Yap3p proteins liberated from the cell wall by glucanase were further digested with Endo H, because without the Endo H treatment they formed diffused bands near the origin of gels in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Compared with the wild type Yap3p, large amounts of three mutant Yap3p proteins were released from the cell wall fractions by the glucanase treatment (Fig. 6 D). They contain mutated sequences of either VSSVS, TVSVS, or ISSYS in the ω-5 to ω-2 region (Fig. 6 A). A mutant Yap3p containing SSSSS in the ω-5 to ω-1 region was slightly detected in the cell wall, and its amount was comparable with that of the wild type (Fig. 6 D, 05HA-M01).Figure 6Cell wall incorporation of mutated Yap3p proteins.

Yap3p, a well characterized GPI-anchored plasma membrane protein (43Ash J. Dominguez M. Bergerson J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Bourhonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20847-20854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 44Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7430-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), became localized in the cell wall when the ω-minus 5-1 sequence of Yap3p was mutated to sequences containing Val or Ile at the ω-4 or -5 site and Val or Tyr at the ω-2 site. In the previous study (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we showed some sequence similarity in the ω-minus regions of 15 GPI-dependent cell wall proteins where either Val or Ile occupies the ω-5 site and Tyr is predominant at the ω-2 site. This study demonstrated their importance for the cell wall incorporation. Although a single residue of Val, Ile, Tyr, or Asn at the ω-2 site has some tendency to direct fusion proteins into the cell wall, the combination of the Val, Ile, Tyr, or Asn at the ω-2 site with Val or Ile at the ω-5 site strongly directed the fusion protein into the cell wall. In fact, out of 15 GPI-dependent cell wall proteins identified, seven, two, and three proteins possess combinations of Ile and Tyr, Val and Tyr, and Val and Asn, respectively, at the ω-5 and ω-2 sites (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The fusion protein containing the wild type sequence of TSSKR as the ω-minus 5-1 sequence of Yap3p was not localized in the cell wall, while the fusion protein containing the mutated sequence of SSSSS was partially localized in the cell wall (Fig. 5 B). The sequence difference of KR in TSSKR and SS in SSSSS is important, because a changing of TSSKR to SSSKR led to no detectable change in the localization of the fusion protein (data not shown). It is possible that the Lys and Arg residues at the ω-2 and ω-1 sites may act negatively for the cell wall incorporation. Dibasic residues like this have been identified in the ω-minus region in some of putative GPI-anchored plasma membrane proteins (24Hamada K. Fukuchi S. Arisawa M. Baba M. Kitada K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Caro L.H.P. Tettelin H. Vossen J.H. Ram A.F.J. Van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 46Vossen J.H. Muller W.H. Lipke P.N. Klis F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2202-2209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These dibasic residues may be a motif acting as a negative signal. A protein containing the dibasic motif may not be processed for incorporation into the cell wall and will then remain on the plasma membrane with a GPI. If this is the case, the action of the ω-4/5 and ω-2 rule for the cell wall incorporation would be interpreted as removal of the negative signal by interrupting the dibasic motif. However, this interpretation would not be enough to explain the positional and additional effects by the ω-4/5 and ω-2 rule on the cell wall incorporation. Sequences meeting the rule clearly incorporated the fusion proteins into the cell wall more efficiently than that of the SSSSS sequence. Therefore, although the rule may not be indispensable for the cell wall incorporation, it would be required for efficient incorporation of GPI-attached proteins into the cell wall. The incorporation of GPI-associated proteins into the cell wall has been thought to occur in two steps: detachment of a GPI-moiety from a GPI-attached protein and binding of the GPI-detached protein to β-1,6-glucan of the cell wall (3De Nobel H. Lipke P.N. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 42-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This protein-bonded β-1,6-glucan is covalently associated with β-1,3-glucan as well as chitin and forms a large complex involving cell wall components (6Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Vink E. de la Cruz J. Llobell A. Douwes J.E. Shimoi H. Lipke P.N. Klis F.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 47Kollar R. Reinhold B.B. Petrakova E.

Since β-1,6-glucan assembly is assumed to be intracellularly initiated (49Brown J.L. Kossaczka Z. Jiang B. Bussey H. Genetics. 1993; 133: 837-849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the binding of a GPI-detached protein to β-1,6-glucan occurs somewhere in intracellular space during or after the β-1,6-glucan synthesis. However, the study using an anti- β-1,6-glucan antibody refuted this possibility. The antibody reacted with proteins collected from the cell wall, indicating association with β-1,6-glucan (4Montijn R.C. van Rinsum J. van Schagen F.A. Klis F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19338-19342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lu C.-F. Montijn R.C. Brown J.L. Klis F. Kurjan J. Bussey H. Lipke P.N. J.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 343-349Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), while it did not react with proteins intracellularly collected (5Lu C.-F. Montijn R.C. Brown J.L. Klis F. Kurjan J. Bussey H. Lipke P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the removal of the GPI moiety and the linking to β-1,6-glucan would occur in the extracellular space. This suggests that GPI-dependent cell wall proteins are transported to the plasma membrane as a form of GPI-attached proteins that are associated with membranes by the GPI moiety. As expected, the GPI-attached form of the cell wall proteins was extracted in the detergent phase of Triton X-114 and showed PI-PLC sensitivity. The cell wall incorporation reaction would require an enzymatic activity, and at least the first step of the incorporation reaction, detachment of a GPI moiety, would require proper binding of the enzyme to the GPI-attached protein. The ω-4/5 and ω-2 rule may be related to this binding. Mutations in the ω-minus 5-1 sequence that reduced the cell wall incorporation did not increase the amount of the fusion proteins secreted into the medium (data not shown). This suggests that the low cell wall incorporation observed in these mutants is probably due to reduction of the GPI detachment efficiency caused by insufficient binding between the enzyme and the GPI-attached protein. A structural analysis of GPI-dependent cell wall proteins has demonstrated that β-1,6-glucan is attached to the protein through a GPI remnant. Several lines of evidence indicate that the GPI remnant contains ethanolamine but does not contain glucosamine and phosphatidylinositol, suggesting that β-1,6-glucan is bound to one of the mannose residues of the GPI moiety (6Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Vink E. de la Cruz J. Llobell A. Douwes J.E. Shimoi H. Lipke P.N. Klis F.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 37Lu C.-F. Kurjan J. Lipke P.N.

FEMS Lett. 1996; 145: 401-407Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). From this structural information, it is possible that the GPI moiety may be removed by cleavage either among mannose residues or between the mannose and myo-inositol residues, and then the resulting end is directly bound to β-1,6-glucan. Alternatively, as shown in the Gce1p protein (38Muller G. Grob E. Wied S. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 442-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GPI moiety may be lipolytically cleaved by an enzyme like PI-PLC. In this case, trimming of myo-inositol and glucosamine residues may be required before the binding of it to β-1,6-glucan, because the enzyme is expected to cleave between phosphatidylinositol and lipid. Identification of a gene/enzyme responsible for the incorporation of GPI-attached proteins into the cell wall is needed for understanding the molecular mechanism for the incorporation, and our current efforts are focused on the identification of the gene/enzyme.

These class A β-lactamases nevertheless remain inefficient against carbapenems, the most effective antibiotics against clinically relevant pathogens. A new member of this enzyme class, NMC-A, was recently reported to hydrolyze at high rates, and hence destroy, all known β-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and cephamycins. The crystal structure of NMC-A was solved to 1.64-Å resolution, and reveals modifications in the topology of the substrate-binding site.

These unusual features in class A β-lactamases involve amino acids that participate in enzyme-substrate interactions, which suggested that these structural factors should be related to the very broad substrate specificity of this enzyme. The comparison of the NMC-A structure with those of other class A enzymes and enzyme-ligand complexes, indicated that the position of Asn-132 in NMC-A provides critical additional space in the region of the protein where the poorer substrates for class A β-lactamases, such as cephamycins and carbapenems, need to be accommodated.

The extensive use of β-lactam antibiotics has resulted in bacteria becoming resistant to these agents. The resistance is mainly mediated by the class A β-lactamases and is spread by plasmid exchanges encoding the TEM and SHV mutant enzymes (1Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). In nosocomial bacterial infections highly resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins, imipenem and other carbapenem antibiotics are often considered antibiotics of last resort. These compounds are active against almost all clinically important Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including β-lactamase producers (2Edwards, J. R. (1995) J. Antimicrob. Chemother.36, Suppl. A, 1–17Google Scholar), and were shown to be nearly ideal drugs in pediatrics (3Blumer J.L. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1995; 96: 38-44PubMed Google Scholar). Carbapenems differ from the classical β-lactam antibiotics because of the presence of a carbapenem ring fused to the 4-membered β-lactam ring and by the presence of the 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl substituent instead of the acylamido group found at 6β and 7β positions of penicillins and cephalosporins, respectively (Fig. 1). The antibacterial efficiency of carbapenems arises from several factors: (i) they are resistant to hydrolysis by nearly all class A β-lactamases, including the extended-spectrum mutant enzymes (4Labia, R., Morand, A., Tiwari, K., Sirot, D., and Chanal, C. (1989)J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 24, Suppl. A, 219–223Google Scholar); (ii) carbenicillinases, oxacillinases, and chromosomal cephalosporinases from different bacterial strains hydrolyze imipenem at very slow rates although the apparent binding constants are in the micromolar range (5Galleni M. Amicosante G. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Taibi P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7600-7605Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and (iii) carbapenems display a very high affinity for the penicillin-sensitive pharmacological target enzymes (PBPs) involved in the final steps of the peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis (7Yang Y. Bhachech N. Bush K. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1995; 35: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Until recently, the only enzymes known to display high hydrolytic activity against carbapenems (carbapenemases) were the class B metallo-β-lactamases (8Livermore D.M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 29: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Felici A. Amicosante G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 192-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the high resolution x-ray structures of two such enzymes were recently reported (10Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C.

Labia R. Nicolas M.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and IMI-1 (13Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Keeney D. Yang Y. Hare R. O'Gara C. Medeiros A.A.

Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 223-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which have so far been characterized by their specificity for penicillins. NMC-A, IMI-1, and Sme-1 hydrolyze at significant rates a wide range of β-lactam antibiotics, including those usually considered as resistant to the class A enzymes (13Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Keeney D.

A preliminary x-ray analysis of Sme-1 has been reported (18Sougakoff W. Jarlier V. Delettré J. Colloc'h N. L'Hermitte G. Nordmann P. Nass T. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here, we present the x-ray structure of NMC-A, solved to 1.64-Å resolution, and its comparison with those of the typical class A β-lactamases. The differences observed in the substrate-binding site, complemented with kinetic measurements, provide structural explanations for the broadened substrate profile of this enzyme. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Belgium). To overexpress the NMC-A gene, an 800-base pair DNA fragment was amplified by PCR1 using the VentTM DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), pPTN1 as template (12Nordmann P. Mariotte S. Naas T. Labia R. Nicolas M.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the following oligonucleotides as primers: 1) a 37-base sense primer: 5′-GAGGGTACCATATGTCACTTAATGTAAAGCAAAGTAG-3′ with Asp-718 and NdeI restriction sites at the 5′ end, and the 23 last bases encoding the N-terminal MSLNVKQS peptide of the preprotein; and 2) a 35-base antisense primer: 5′-GAGGGATCCTAGGTTTATTTAAGGTTATCAATTGC-3′ with a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end, and the last 21 bases complementary to the sequence encoding the C-terminal AIDNLK peptide and to the TAA stop codon. The 800-base pair purified PCR fragment and pUC20 (Boehringer Mannheim) were digested with Asp-718 and BamHI and ligated. The resulting plasmid was used to transform the Escherichia coli Top10F′ cells (Invitrogen) and for mutagenesis purposes. The correct PCR fragment digested withNdeI and BamHI was thereafter inserted into the pET22b(+) plasmid (Novagen) after modification of its ampicillin resistance by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cartridge (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting supercoiled overexpression plasmid was isolated from E. coli Top10F′ and used to transformE. coli BL21DE3. Cells were grown at 37 °C in an 18-liter Bio-Laffite fermentor containing 15 liters of Luria-Bertani broth added with 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. When the A 550reached 1.0, IPTG was added at a 0.5 mm final concentration, and the culture was continued for 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the periplasmic content was liberated by lysozyme treatment. The supernatant was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (4.6 × 30 cm2) equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–250 mm final concentration) over 1 liter. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and loaded onto the same column. The enzyme was eluted under isocratic conditions with the same buffer. Under these conditions, the production and purification yields were 100 mg/liter and 80%, respectively. Enzyme purity was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue and silver staining. The protein concentration was estimated on the basis of the A 280 value, and the molar extinction coefficient was from the number of tyrosine and tryptophan residues (19Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1980: 374-385Google Scholar). Crystals suitable for structure determination were obtained by the hanging drop method. The initial 6-μl drop, containing 2.0 mg/ml protein in 45 mm MES buffer at pH 5.25, 5% (w/v) PEG 1500, was equilibrated against 500 μl of 200 mm MES buffer containing 20% (w/v) PEG 1500 and 6% (v/v) n-propyl alcohol. After 4 days at 22 °C, parallelepipedic crystals and thin plates were formed. Equilibration was pursued for 15 days at 4 °C prior to crystal mounting. The crystals (60 × 100 × 850 μm3) belong to the orthorhombic system, space group P21212 with cell parameters a = 78.7 Å, b = 52.9 Å, c = 67.5 Å, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Diffracted synchrotron intensities of both native and derivative crystals were measured on beam line W32 at LURE (Orsay, France) on a large MAR Research imaging plate. The wavelength of the x-ray beam was 0.975 Å. Two crystals were used to collect the native x-ray intensities: one crystal for a 2.9-Å resolution data set and the other one for data to 1.64-Å resolution. The platinum derivative was obtained by soaking the native protein crystals in 3 mm K2PtCl4 for 65 h, and one crystal was used for collecting an anomalous data set to 2.9-Å resolution. All data were processed using MOSFLM (20Leslie A.G.W. Helliwell J.R. Machin P.A. Papiz M.Z. Computational Aspects of Protein Crystal Data Analysis, Proceedings of the Daresbury Study Weekend. SERC, Daresbury1987: 39-50Google Scholar). The structure was solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS), and the position of the single heavy atom was determined from the Harker sections of the difference Patterson function. Its coordinates and occupancy were refined using MLPHARE (21Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering, Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC, Daresbury1991: 80-86Google Scholar, 22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) on reflections between 31- and 2.9-Å resolution. The SIRAS phases were improved by solvent flattening, histogram matching, and skeletonization with the DM program (22Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 23Cowtan K.D. Bailey S. Wilson K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1994: 34-38Google Scholar). Refinement, applying a bulk solvent correction with a density of 0.34 e−Å−3, a solvent radius of 0.25 Å and temperature factors of 50 Å2, with X-PLOR (24Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) was carried out with no cutoff on diffraction data. In each refinement cycle, manual corrections using the software O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), were followed by 200 steps of Powell energy minimization of all atoms with harmonic restraints on Cα positions, simulated annealing from 3000 to 300 K (0.5-fs time step), Powell minimization until convergence, and individual B-factor refinement. Electrostatic energy terms were turned off. Water molecules were included so as to account for the positive peaks in the [F obs −F calc, Φcalc] difference Fourier map drawn at 4 S.D. above the mean value, provided they were at hydrogen bond geometry from protein or other solvent atoms. Hereafter, the simulated annealing was performed from 600 to 300 K with a time step of 1 fs. After inclusion of 115 water molecules, the slow cooling scheme was abandoned for conventional refinement that was run until convergence. Grouped occupancies were refined for alternative conformations of Ile-30 Cδ1 and the Asn-63 side chain. If not explicitly stated, positional differences given for single residues concern the r.m.s. deviation on all atoms of this residue, whereas differences given for a range of residues concern the r.m.s. deviation on the backbone atoms of these residues. Structure superimpositions were made with ProFit (SciTech Software). The completeness, high multiplicity, and low R merge values of the data sets proved to be valuable in the phasing procedure (Table I). The quality of the SIRAS phased electron density map computed to a resolution of 2.9 Å allowed an unambiguous main-chain tracing except for residues 100–103 in a loop region and for three residues at the N and C termini. One-third of the side chains were built at this stage. Inclusion of the high resolution data, followed by three rounds of refinement led to R and R free (26Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) values of 0.230 and 0.253, respectively, at 1.64-Å resolution before inclusion of water molecules. The refined structure of NMC-A includes 265 residues and 115 water molecules, and the final R and R free values for all reflections between 31 and 1.64 Å were 0.192 and 0.214, respectively (Table I). The average temperature factor was 13.3 Å2, very close to the value estimated (13.6 Å2) from the Wilson plot (27Wilson A.J.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1949; 2: 318-321Crossref Google Scholar). Coordinate errors were evaluated to be 0.18 Å from a Luzzati plot (28Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal amino acids and seven solvent-exposed side chains of other amino acids in the sequence showed poorly defined electron densities. Alternative conformations were observed for Ile-30 Cδ1 and the Asn-63 side chain.Table IDiffraction data, phasing, and refinement statisticsDiffraction data statisticsaData setResolutionNumber of observationsUnique reflectionsMultiplicityBijvoet pairsR mergeCompleteness〈I/ςI〉R isoR anomNative 131.0–2.922,40364953.40.029 (0.040)98.1 (82.7)47.9 (22.2)K2PtCl431.6–2.940,48464946.252250.038 (0.057)98.4 (88.9)52.8 (22.9)0.130.027 (0.041)Native 231.0–1.64111,48732,6283.40.036 (0.192)91.9 (68.0)32.7 (3.2)SIRAS phasing statisticsNo. of sitesOccupancyAnomalous occupancyR cullis(acentric/centric)Anomalous R cullisPhasing power (acentric/centric)Figure of merit (acentric/centric)10.450.460.52/0.430.812.4/2.00.50/0.51Refinement statisticsResolution rangeNo. of reflectionsNo. of protein atomsNo. of water moleculesR-factorR freeAverage B-factors Å2All atomsMain chainSide chainWater31.0–1.6432,62820241150.1920.21413.311.414.422.8Geometric parameters r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)Bond angles (°)Dihedral angles (°)Improper angles (°)0.0061.3023.381.126The numbers given in parentheses denote the respective values of the highest resolution shell.R merge = ΣΣ‖〈I〉 −I i‖/ΣΣ I i.R iso = Σ‖F PH −F P‖/Σ‖F P‖.R ano = Σ‖〈I +〉 − 〈I −〉‖/Σ(〈I +〉 + 〈I −〉).R = Σ∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/Σ‖F o‖.

The first one, hereafter denoted as the β-domain (residues 26–60 and 221–291), includes a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (strands S1-S5) and helices H1, H10, and H11. The second one, the helical domain (residues 69–212), is made of eight helices (H2-H9) connected by loop regions (Fig. 2). The overall fold of the protein is similar to that of other class A β-lactamases (29Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 701-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Knox J.R. Moews P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 435-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 31Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 32Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), but a number of structural differences were found, particularly in the substrate-binding site. In the following paragraphs, we address the possible functional significance of these differences with respect to the penicillinase, cephalosporinase, and carbapenemase activities of NMC-A. A specific feature of the class A NMC-A, IMI-1, and Sme-1 β-lactamases is the presence of cysteine residues at positions 69 and 238 (Fig. 3) (17Raquet X. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Bouillenne F. Frère J.M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Gent. 1997; 27: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the NMC-A structure, these cysteines form a left-handed disulfide bridge, with a Cβ-Sγ-Sγ-Cβ dihedral angle of −103.4° and a Cα-Cα distance of 5.0 Å. This covalent bond links the N terminus of helix H2 (containing the catalytic Ser-70 residue) to strand S3 (230–237), which defines one side of the substrate-binding site (Fig. 4). The disulfide bridge has several consequences. First, this bond and the set of interactions shown in Fig. 5, would be expected to greatly diminish structural flexibility in this region of the structure. Second, the distance between the main-chain nitrogen atoms of residues 70 and 237, which define the oxyanion hole, is 0.3 Å shorter than the average value (4.7 Å) in other class A β-lactamases (33Knox J.R. Moews P.C. Frère J.M. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 937-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This would result in somewhat stronger hydrogen bonding of the water molecule typically found in that position in the absence of substrate. Finally, residue 238 adopts a conformation in which its carbonyl group is flipped by 180° from the corresponding position seen in all other structures of class A β-lactamases. As a consequence, the S3 strand breaks from Ser-237, and the infrequent glycine residue inserted at position 239 moves away from the Ω loop region.Figure 4Stereo view of the NMC-A substrate-binding site. The color code used is: oxygen (red), carbon (yellow), nitrogen (blue), and sulfur (green). The water molecules are shown as red spheres.

Water molecules are indicated byspheres.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several polar side chains are oriented toward the substrate-binding site (Fig. 4). The uncommon histidine residues at positions 105 and 274 face each other at the entrance of the active site cavity. The side chain of His-274 is hydrogen bonded through one water molecule to the acidic group of Asp-276 and through a second water molecule to the main-chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms of residues 239 and 243, respectively (Fig. 5). At van der Waals distance from His-274, the guanidinium group of Arg-220 is engaged in a set of interactions that likely decrease its mobility and effective charge. It forms a salt-bridge interaction with Asp-276 and is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain oxygen atoms of residues 236 and 245, and to the hydroxyl group of Ser-237 (Fig. 5). The guanidinium group is located in an area similar to that of Arg-244 in the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase (32Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), in which it interacts with the carboxylate group of the substrate in the x-ray structures of acyl-enzyme complexes (31Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 34Maveyraud L. Massova I. Birck C. Miyashita K.

Biol. 1996; 3: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The disulfide bridge between cysteines 69 and 238 does not seem to affect the catalytic machinery of the protein (Table II). All atoms of the conserved catalytic residues (Ser-70, Lys-73, Ser-130, Glu-166, and Lys-234; 39 atoms) in NMC-A are found in the same positions as in typical class A enzymes. A least square fit of these atoms from the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 (29Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 701-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), Bacillus licheniformis 749/C (30Knox J.R. Moews P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 435-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and E. coli TEM-1 (32Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) enzymes gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å, and the same result is obtained when NMC-A is also included in the calculation. We applied the corresponding transformation matrices to all protein atoms to compare the environment of these catalytic residues and the substrate-binding sites in the superimposed protein structures (Fig. 6, A and B). We observed that the atomic positions of Asn-132, which were not taken into account to compute the superimposition matrices, were similar (r.m.s.d.= 0.2 Å) in the three enzymes devoid of carbapenemase activity but are shifted by 1.0 Å in NMC-A, when compared with their average positions in the typical class A enzymes. This difference does not arise from a local displacement of the H5 helix (residues 132–142), but seems to result from folding variations throughout the protein structure (Fig. 2). It was also apparent that the main-chain oxygen atom of Ser-237, which was shown to interact with the nitrogen atom of the 6β-acylamido substituent of penicillin substrates during catalysis (31Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), is displaced by 1.0 Å compared with the PC1 and TEM1 enzymes (Fig. 6, A and B). This movement likely results from the α-conformation adopted by residue 238 but seems unrelated to the insertion at position 239. Indeed, compared with the TEM-1 (32Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and B. licheniformis (30Knox J.R. Moews P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 435-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) class A enzymes, the position of the main-chain oxygen atom of residue 237, and the conformation of residue 238 are not affected in the PC1 β-lactamase (29Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 701-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) although this enzyme contains an isoleucine inserted at position 239. The 237–240 regions in NMC-A and PC1 differ significantly (r.m.s.d. = 1.5 Å) (Fig. 6 B), which suggests that the specific conformation of the C-terminal edge of the S3 strand in NMC-A may be attributed to the presence of the disulfide bridge. Cysteine 69 belongs to the polypeptide stretch connecting the α and β domains of the protein. Formation of the disulfide bridge may influence the relative orientation of these domains and contribute to the folding variations illustrated in Fig. 2.Table IIDistances in the active-site cleftIdentificationDistance (Å)NMC-ATEM-1Ser-70 OγLys-73 Nζ2.92.8Ser-130 Oγ3.13.5Wat-3082.52.8Wat-3322.72.6Lys-73 NζSer-130 Oγ3.14.0Asn-132 Oδ12.82.9Glu-166 Oε13.43.4Lys-234 Nζ5.65.6Ser-130 OγLys-234 Nζ3.02.8Asn-132 Nδ2Gly-236 Cα10.79.8Ser-237 N9.89.0Ser-237 O8.27.6Glu-166 Oε1Water 3322.62.7Glu-166 Oε2Asn-170 Nδ23.02.9Asn-170 Oδ1Water 3322.62.8Water 308Ser-70 N3.03.2Ser-237 N2.82.8Ser-237 O2.62.8Water 332Ser-70 N3.13.0Ser-70 NSer-237 N4.44.8Residue name as in NMC-A.Located in the oxyanion hole.The catalytic water molecule involved in deacylation.

NMC-A and the class A β-lactamases devoid of carbapenemase activity are similar with respect to their hydrolytic machinery. The positions of the essential catalytic residues are identical within a r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å, a value close to the estimated coordinate errors of 0.2 Å in structures refined below 2-Å resolution. This similarity, which preserves the molecular bases of the catalytic mechanism (36Zawadzke L.E. Chen C.C.H. Banerjee S. Li Z. Wäsch S. Kapadia G. Moult J. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16475-16482Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,37Maveyraud L. Pratt R.F. Samama J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2622-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is in line with the high penicillinase activity of NMC-A. On the contrary, we observed specific positional differences at residues 132 and 237–240. Several studies have emphasized the implication of the 238–240 region, at the edge of the substrate-binding site, with respect to the improved hydrolysis of third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams, by class A enzymes with extended-substrate specificity. An enhanced recognition of cephalosporins was displayed by engineered S. aureus PC1 enzymes (A238S and Ile-239 deleted; Ω-loop deletion), and the x-ray structures revealed an altered disposition of the C-terminal edge of the S3 strand (38Zawadzke L.E. Smith T.J. Herzberg O. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Banerjee S. Pieper U. Kapadia G. Pannell L.K. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Several investigations were reported on the TEM and SHV enzymes because mutations naturally occurring in that region have been found in proteins responsible for bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (40Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It was pointed out that the size correlation between the side chains of residues 69 and 238 in the parent enzymes breaks down in extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and it was suggested that the steric constraints would be accommodated by pushing the lower part of the S3 strand away from the active site, by 1–2 Å (41Hutlesky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NMC-A, although the disulfide bridge reduces the Cα-Cα distance between residues 69 and 238, the conformation adopted by Cys-238 induces the predicted distortion in this part of the strand. It increases the space available between residue 170 of the Ω loop region and the S3 strand, where the large 7β substituents of third-generation cephalosporins were reported to bind (39Banerjee S. Pieper U. Kapadia G. Pannell L.K. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3286-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41Hutlesky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Raquet X. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Fonzé E. Goussard S. Courvalin P. Frère J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The inserted glycine 239 (Φ = 78°, Ψ= 18°), with its large available conformational space, might help to satisfy the constraints associated to the formation of the adjacent disulfide bridge. In addition, the side chain of any other residue in that position would be oriented toward the binding site and would counteract the effect promoted by the conformation of residue 238. With respect to the hydrolytic properties of NMC-A with carbapenem and cephamycin substrates, the direct implications of the disulfide-linked Cys-238 cannot be foreseen from the x-ray structure. The residues in the 238–240 region do not provide direct binding interactions to the functionalities on the α face of the substrate, such as the 6α-hydroxyethyl group of carbapenem antibiotics. It is noteworthy that the expanded-substrate enzymes deriving from the TEM and SHV β-lactamases, which display mutations of these residues, have not been reported to hydrolyze carbapenems and cephamycins. The position of Asn-132, away from strand S3 but still at 2.8 Å from Lys-73 Nζ (Table II) (43Osuna J. Viadiu H. Fink A.L. Soberon X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 775-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), is unusual when compared with any other class A β-lactamase. Its new location might play a major role with respect to the carbapenemase activity because additional space is provided in a critical area for protein-substrate interactions, which would permit accommodating the 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl substituent of carbapenems. This proposal is supported by kinetic and structural data. Mobashery and co-workers (44Miyashita K. Massova I. Mobashery S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 319-322Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that the attenuation of the turnover rate of imipenem with the TEM-1 enzyme only arises, for steric reasons, from the 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl group and that this group imparts resistance to turnover by TEM-1 by 104-fold. These data were in line with the observations made from the crystal structure of the acyl-enzyme complex formed between TEM-1 and its inhibitor, 6α-hydroxymethylpenicillanic acid, solved at 2.0-Å resolution (34Maveyraud L. Massova I. Birck C. Miyashita K. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7435-7440Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure showed tight interactions between the inhibitor, Asn-132, and strand S3 and indicated that the larger 6α-1R-hydroxyethyl group of carbapenems would induce steric clashes with residue 132. The superimposition of the TEM-6α-hydroxymethyl penicillanic acid and NMC-A structures, based on the best fit of the atoms of their catalytic residues (Fig. 7), suggested that the 1.0-Å displacement of Asn-132 away from stand S3 in NMC-A (Table II), would allow the 6α-hydroxymethyl substituent to be easily accommodated and the hydroxyl group to orient differently in NMC-A. Indeed, kinetic experiments indicated ak cat/K m value of 105m−1 s−1 for this substrate (detailed kinetic studies will be presented elsewhere). In the TEM-1-penicillin G acyl-enzyme complex (31Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the 6β-acylamido group of the substrate were found at 2.6 Å from Asn-132 Nδ2 and at 2.9 Å from the main-chain oxygen of residue 237, respectively. The altered position of this atom, and its increased distance to Asn-132 Nδ2 in NMC-A (Table II), suggested that this hydrogen bond pattern may be altered in this enzyme with penicillin substrates. To evaluate this hypothesis, we determined thek cat/K m value for 6β-aminopenicillanic acid that, from its chemical structure, may only interact with the main-chain oxygen atom of residue 237. We found that the hydrolytic efficiency for this substrate by NMC-A was similar, within experimental errors, to that for penicillin G, suggesting that in this enzyme the interaction between the oxygen atom of the 6β-acylamido group of penicillin G and Asn-132 may be weakened. The most prominent features in the substrate-binding site of NMC-A are the altered conformations at the edge of the S3 strand and the unusual position of Asn-132. The former is reminiscent of several observations made to explain the extended-spectrum activity of typical class A mutant enzymes. The position of Asn-132 seems to be important for catalytic efficiency against β-lactam antibiotics bearing a 6α substituent (carbapenems), and both 7α and 7β substituents (cephamycins). From the clinical point of view, the gene encoding NMC-A is derived from a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, which is a common source of nosocomial infections for which carbapenems are often the β-lactams of last resort for use in patients in intensive care units. The broad substrate specificity of NMC-A, together with the poor effect of the inhibitors of class A enzymes currently in therapeutic use, should stimulate the design of new structure- and mechanism-based inhibitors, as was successfully done with the TEM-1 enzyme (34Maveyraud L.

https://openalex.org/W2012074391,"The cellular localization of protein kinase C (PKC) is intimately associated with the regulation of its biological activity. Previously we have demonstrated that the redistribution of PKC to the plasma membrane in response to physiological stimuli is followed by a rapid returning of PKC back to the cytoplasm (Feng, X., Zhang, J., Barak, L. S., Meyer, T., Caron, M. G., and Hannun, Y. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10755–10762). Although the process of PKC membrane targeting has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanism underlying the dissociation of membrane-bound PKC remains unclear. In the present study, by examining the dynamic distribution of wild-type PKC βII and its kinase-deficient mutant (K371R), we demonstrate that kinase activity is required for PKC membrane dissociation. Moreover, the inability of PKC βII(K371R) to dissociate from the plasma membrane in cells overexpressing wild-type PKC βII suggests that autophosphorylation activity of the kinase might be essential for its membrane dissociation. This was further supported by mutational analysis of twoin vivo autophosphorylation sites on PKC βII. The replacement of Ser660 or Thr641 by alanine (S660A or T641A) was found to synergistically reduce the reversal of PKC βII membrane translocation, whereas the replacement of the same amino acids by glutamic acid (S660E or T641E), an amino acid commonly used to mimic phosphate, results in mutants behaving similar to wild-type PKC βII. These findings point to an essential role for autophosphorylation in the dissociation of activated PKC from the plasma membrane and suggest that, like PKC membrane translocation, the returning of PKC to the cytoplasm after its activation is also delicately regulated.

Protein kinase Cs (PKCs)1 comprise a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that play critical roles in many cellular signaling events by catalyzing specific substrate phosphorylation (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 2Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PKC can be triggered by stimulating a wide variety of cell surface receptors including those for hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. These receptors transduce a diversity of extracellular signals to either phospholipase C or phospholipase D, which when activated results in the generation of membrane lipid mediator diacylglycerol (DAG) and/or mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC by DAG, Ca2+, and many other lipid mediators has been intimately associated with many important biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 2Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar). Previous biochemical and immunocytochemical studies have indicated that the biological activity of PKCs is closely regulated by their subcellular localization (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 4Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 5Mochly-Rosen D.

For instance, upon activation of cell surface receptors, PKCs were found to translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and subsequently activated (7Farrar W.L. Thomas T.P. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 8Farrar W.L. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It is believed that the changes in the cellular levels and intracellular localization of Ca2+ and DAG result in the redistribution of PKC to the plasma membrane, which is enriched with phosphatidylserine, a lipid cofactor for PKC. This process may also involve PKC binding proteins (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The regions on classic PKCs (i.e. PKC α, βI, βII, and γ) that bind various regulatory factors are located within the amino-terminal regulatory domain (Fig. 1), which contains an autoinhibitory sequence (i.e. the pseudosubstrate in V1 region) and two membrane-targeting protein modules, namely C1 and C2 regions. The C1 region contains the binding site for DAG, whereas the C2 region binds phospholipids whose binding is allosterically facilitated by the association of Ca2+ to the same region. The interaction of PKCs with DAG and phospholipids results in the removal of pseudosubstrate from the catalytic domain and the subsequent mobilization of PKCs to the plasma membrane (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Recently, with the development of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-conjugated PKCs, this PKC membrane trafficking process has been further studied in live cells through real time visualization (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was observed that shortly after their membrane targeting, PKCs dissociate from the plasma membrane and rapidly return to the cytoplasm (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this reversal of PKC translocation have remained unclear. The maturation of PKCs during their biosynthesis involves phosphorylation of the enzymes at multiple serine/threonine sites (11Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the case of PKC βII, three major in vivophosphorylation sites have recently been identified (13Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26807-26812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylation of PKC βII occurs initially at Thr500located within the activation loop at the entrance of PKC catalytic site (15Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is followed by sequential autophosphorylation of the enzyme at Thr641 and Ser660 (14Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The inability of PKC βII itself to cause phosphorylation at Thr500 has suggested that the phosphorylation of this residue involves a distinct protein kinase (15Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now widely believed that the phosphorylation of these serine/threonine sites on PKC is critical for the regulation of PKC enzymatic activity and subcellular localization (16Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Huang K.P. Chan K.F. Singh T.J. Nakabayashi H. Huang F.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently discovered that under the condition of oxidative stress, PKC βII is also modified by phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, and the tyrosine phosphorylation directly activates PKCs even in the absence of lipid metabolites and second messengers including DAG and Ca2+ (21Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Therefore, like DAG, Ca2+, and many other lipid mediators, in vivophosphorylation of PKCs provides an additional way for effectively regulating PKC functions but at the level of enzymes themselves. Although there are lines of evidence suggesting that the phosphorylation status of PKCs may contribute to their enzymatic activity and localization in cells, the exact role for phosphorylation in PKC dynamic trafficking between the plasma membrane and cytoplasm has not been established. In a previous study, we reported the development of a GFP-conjugated PKC βII (GFP-PKC βII) for studying PKC cellular distribution in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation and desensitization (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GFP-PKC βII is fully functional in terms of its phospholipid-dependent kinase activity and its ability to translocate from cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to phorbol ester stimulation. The visualization of GFP-PKC βII distribution has revealed a dynamic and reversible nature of PKC trafficking between the plasma membrane and cytoplasm in response to physiological stimuli (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the present study, using GFP-PKC βII and several of its mutants, we further examine the molecular events underlying the reversal of PKC membrane translocation. Our results reveal an essential role for PKC kinase activity in the reversible translocation of PKC βII in response to Gq-coupled angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR) activation. More specifically, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation activity of the enzyme is essential for its membrane dissociation. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for regulating PKC inactivation and indicate that, like PKC membrane targeting, the process of PKC dissociation from the plasma membrane is also exquisitely regulated.

Phosphatidylserine and sn-dioctanoyl-glycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. pBK-CMV-GFP-PKC βII was constructed as described previously (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The kinase-deficient mutant (K371R) was generated by polymerase chain reaction to mutate codon AAG (Lys371) in the coding sequence to CGG (Arg) according to a previous study on PKC α (22Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations of single autophosphorylation site (Thr641 or Ser660) were generated by polymerase chain reaction to mutate ACA (Thr641) to GCA (Ala) or GAA (Glu) and to mutate TAA (Ser660) to GCC (Ala) or GAA (Glu). The mutation of both autophosphorylation sites, designated GFP-DA, was generated by mutating both Thr641 and Ser660 to alanine simultaneously (Fig. 1). The sequences of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method with 1–15 μg of plasmids (23Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). For assaying PKC activity in cells transfected with wild-type or mutant GFP-PKC βII, the cell lysates (200 μg) were first immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of monoclonal GFP antibody. The immunoprecipitation was performed 48 h after transfection as described previously (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The PKC autophosphorylation activity and PKC kinase activity toward substrate histone IIIS were assessed using the vesicle assay for PKC as described previously (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Cell lysates from HEK 293 cells transfected with GFP-PKC βII or GFP-K371R or cell lysates from stable HEK 293 cell lines overexpressing PKC βII were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-PKC β antibody (1:200) or rabbit anti-PKC βII antibody (1:2000) and exposed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing wild-type PKC βII were seeded on glass coverslips placed in six-well dishes at a density of 5 × 105cells/well. The cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for another 10 min. After 1 h of incubation with rabbit anti-PKC βII antibody (1:100), the cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit lgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted onto the slides, and PKC βII immunofluorescence was observed with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope at 488-nm excitation. The differential interference contrast images were recorded at the same time. HEK 293 cells were transfected with GFP-PKC βII or one of its mutants together with AT1AR. 24 h after transfection, the cells were plated onto 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek) at a density of 4 × 105 and incubated for another 24 h to allow the cells to attach to glass. The cells expressing GFP-PKC βII or its mutants were observed with confocal microscopy, which was performed on a Zeiss LSM-410 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 40 × 1.2 NA water immersion lens. The cells were at room temperature in culture medium containing 20 mm HEPES. GFP fluorescent signals were collected sequentially using the Zeiss LSM software time series function with single line excitation (488 nm) with a time interval of 20 or 60 s between two scannings. Angiotensin II, staurosporine, and PMA were applied to the cells during the scannings. Quantitative analysis of relative fluorescence intensity was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. 2The NIH Image program was developed at the National Institutes of Health and is available on the Internet athttp://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. The relative change of plasma membrane fluorescence intensity was calculated according to a previously reported method (24Oancea E. Teruel M.N. Quest A.F. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, from a series of images recorded before and after angiotensin II stimulation, line intensity profiles across each cell were determined. The relative fluorescence intensity on the plasma membrane was calculated by the formula (I mb −I cyt)/I cyt.I mb represents the amplitude of fluorescence signal on plasma membrane, and I cyt is the average cytosolic fluorescent intensity. Sequential confocal images of a population of transfected cells before and after various treatments were recorded as described above. The numbers of cells in which GFP-PKC mobilizes to the plasma membrane within 40 s (C40) and in which GFP-PKC returns to the cytoplasm within 180 s (C180) were counted, respectively. The percentage of the reversal of PKC translocation is calculated as C180/C40 × 100. For each experiment, C40 was more than 50. The mean and S.E. are expressed for values obtained from the number of separate experiments indicated. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired two-tailed ttest. The visualization of GFP-PKC βII trafficking in live HEK 293 cells has demonstrated that membrane translocation of PKC βII in response to AT1AR activation is followed immediately by the returning of the enzyme back to the cytoplasm (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular events underlying the dynamic nature of PKC redistribution, initial experiments examined the role of phosphorylation in the reversal of PKC membrane translocation using a kinase-deficient GFP-PKC βII mutant K371R (Fig. 1). As a conserved lysine at the ATP-binding site of the enzyme was replaced by an arginine, GFP-K371R completely lost its ability to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate other substrates such as histone IIIS (Fig. 2 A). When tested in HEK 293 cells, GFP-K371R was observed to undergo a rapid translocation to the plasma membrane within 40 s in response to AT1AR activation, similar to that observed for wild-type GFP-PKC βII. However, although the membrane localization of GFP-PKC βII was transient and membrane-bound enzyme returned to the cytoplasm within 1 min after translocation, the redistributed GFP-K371R was observed to remain persistently localized on the plasma membrane even after 10 min of agonist stimulation (Fig. 2 B). When fluorescence intensity was quantitated, more than 90% membrane fluorescence of GFP-PKC βII returned to the cytoplasm within 100 s after angiotensin II stimulation, whereas over 90% GFP-K371R fluorescence remained on the plasma membrane even after 300 s of receptor activation (Fig. 2 C). The inability of kinase-deficient PKC βII to traffic back to the cytoplasm suggests a direct linkage between PKC kinase activity and its ability to dissociate from membrane. The requirement of kinase activity for PKC membrane dissociation was further supported by the diminution of reversal of wild-type GFP-PKC βII membrane translocation in the presence of staurosporine, a potent protein kinase inhibitor that inhibits PKC enzymatic activity by binding to a site of the catalytic domain (25Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 387-392PubMed Google Scholar). When HEK 293 cells co-transfected with GFP-PKC βII and AT1AR were stimulated by angiotensin II together with staurosporine, the percentage of cells in which GFP-PKC βII had the ability to undergo membrane dissociation was reduced markedly in a staurosporine concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). At a staurosporine concentration of 500 nm, GFP-PKC βII completely lost its ability to return to the cytoplasm in almost all transfected cells. However, staurosporine alone was not found to affect GFP-PKC βII distribution (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that PKC kinase activity is essential for its dissociation from the plasma membrane and returning to the cytoplasm following activation of cell surface receptors in HEK 293 cells. In live cells, PKCs have the ability to mediate intramolecular phosphorylation (autophosphorylation) and intermolecular phosphorylation (transphosphorylation) including phosphorylation of various protein substrates. Unless autophosphorylation is involved, the lack of membrane dissociation of the kinase-deficient PKC βII should be rescuable by expressing wild-type PKC βII in the same cells. For examining this possibility, stable cell lines were generated that overexpress PKC βII at a level of about 1 μg/mg whole cell protein as estimated using purified PKC βII as the control (Fig. 4 A). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy further confirmed that all cells of the stable cell lines evenly expressed PKC βII (Fig. 4 B). When GFP-K371R and AT1AR were co-transfected into such a PKC βII stable cell line, similar to what was observed in native HEK 293 cells, GFP-K371R distributed evenly in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells but underwent an irreversible membrane translocation in response to AT1AR activation (Fig. 4 C, top panel). The irreversibility of GFP-K371R redistribution was apparent because no additional increase of membrane fluorescence was observed when cells were exposed to a second pulse of phorbol ester PMA at 13 min after the initial stimulation by angiotensin II (Fig. 4 C, top panel). As an additional control, the distribution of wild-type GFP-PKC βII was also examined in the PKC βII stable cell line (Fig. 4 C, bottom panel). Similar to what was observed in native HEK 293 cells, GFP-PKC βII underwent a rapid reversible membrane translocation following activation of AT1A R, demonstrating that overexpression of PKC βII does not affect the ability of GFP-PKC βII to dissociate from the membrane (Fig. 4 C, bottom panel). Therefore, the inability of wild-type PKC βII to rescue the kinase deficiency of GFP-K371R suggests that autophosphorylation, rather than transphosphorylation, of the enzyme may be important for its membrane dissociation. Two major in vivo autophosphorylation sites, i.e.Ser660 and Thr641, have been identified at the carboxyl terminus of PKC βII by biochemical studies (13Tsutakawa S.E. Medzihradszky K.F. Flint A.J.

Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutational analysis of the two sites was performed to further study the role of autophosphorylation in PKC βII dynamic trafficking. In these experiments, GFP-PKC βII, GFP-K371R, and various GFP-PKC βII autophosphorylation mutants were transfected into HEK 293 cells together with the AT1AR, and the percentage of cells in which GFP-PKC molecules underwent reversible membrane translocation were quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Upon stimulation of the AT1AR, 96.4% of cells transfected with wild-type GFP-PKC βII exhibited reversible PKC membrane translocation, whereas PKC membrane dissociation was observed in only 9.5% of cells transfected with GFP-K371R (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the replacement of Ser660 or Thr641 by alanine (S660A or T641A) to eliminate autophosphorylation of these residues was found to reduce the reversal of PKC βII membrane translocation by as much as 37.5 and 22.2%, respectively, whereas double replacement of both Ser660 and Thr641 by alanine (S660A/T641A) further diminished PKC membrane dissociation by as much as 66.4%. In contrast, the replacement of Ser660 or Thr641by glutamic acid (S660E or T641E), an amino acid commonly used to mimic phosphate, had no detectable effect on the reversal of PKC βII membrane translocation. Both mutants behaved like wild-type PKC βII. These results provide strong evidence supporting an essential role of autophosphorylation in PKC membrane dissociation and indicate that the failure of membrane dissociation of PKC kinase-deficient mutant is the consequence of its lack of autophosphorylation. Our findings provide the first evidence for the involvement of PKC enzymatic activity in the dynamic trafficking of the enzyme in response to physiological stimuli and indicate that the kinase activity of PKC is essential for the returning of PKC to the cytoplasm following its membrane translocation. Moreover, the inability of wild-type PKC βII to rescue the lack of membrane dissociation of the kinase-deficient PKC βII mutant suggests that autophosphorylation, rather than transphosphorylation, of PKC βII is crucial for its membrane dissociation. This idea is further corroborated by the observation that the replacement of two major autophosphorylation sites on PKC βII with alanine, but not glutamic acid, markedly reduces the reversibility of PKC membrane translocation. The exact cellular mechanism by which activated PKC dissociates from the plasma membrane remains undetermined, but our results implicate autophosphorylation in PKC inactivation and therefore provide a start point from which to begin to dissect the processes regulating the association of PKC membrane targeting modules (i.e. C1 and C2 regions) with plasma membrane lipids and proteins. Associated with its biological activity, PKC cellular localization is regulated in various PKC-mediated signal transduction events (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 2Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mochly-Rosen D.

Although cellular distribution of PKC has been extensively studied biochemically and immunocytochemically, the present study represents the first investigation of mechanisms regulating PKC trafficking in live cells. The visualization of GFP-PKC fluorescence provides a direct and sensitive means for assessing real time PKC cellular localization and therefore is uniquely suited for following cellular events regulating the transient and reversible trafficking of PKCs in response to extracellular signals (9Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In particular, we have examined the dynamic redistribution of several GFP-conjugated PKC βII mutants either deficient in ATP binding and catalysis (K371R) or unable to be autophosphorylated (T641A and/or S660A) in response to activation of G protein-coupled AT1AR. Although these mutants underwent membrane translocation upon receptor activation with time profiles and extents similar to GFP-PKC βII, unlike their wild-type counterpart, which immediately returned to the cytoplasm, the mutants remained stably associated with the plasma membrane. These results provide direct visual evidence supporting a novel role of PKC βII kinase activity and autophosphorylation in the membrane dissociation of the enzyme. Previous biochemical studies have suggested that the phosphorylation status of PKCs is associated with their subcellular partition (3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Studies on the Dictyostelium homolog of classic PKC, myosin II heavy chain-specific protein kinase C (MHC-PKC), have revealed that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal autophosphorylation sites results in a mutant (MHC-PKCΔST) irresponsive to the chemoattractant cAMP and persistently localized on the plasma membrane (26Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 828-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Like mammalian PKC βII, MHC-PKC normally resides in the cytoplasm and undergoes reversible membrane translocation in response to cAMP stimulation. Thus, the membrane localization of MHC-PKC is consistent with our findings that PKC autophosphorylation is required for its membrane dissociation. Interestingly, unlike PKC βII whose autophosphorylation mutants are mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, MHC-PKCΔST was found predominantly on the plasma membrane under nonstimulated conditions (26Dembinsky A. Rubin H. Ravid S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 828-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Considering the diverse variety of different PKC activators, binding proteins as well as a large number of PKC isoenzymes, it is conceivable that the cellular distribution of PKCs in response to extracellular signals is not only a function of cellular environment (i.e. protein, lipid, ion composition, etc.) but also an intrinsic property governed by the biochemical structures of distinct PKC isoenzymes. Moreover, because in both PKC βII and MHC-PKC, autophosphorylation sites reside at the carboxyl termini and are not within the identified membrane targeting modules (i.e. C1 and C2 region), it is likely that autophosphorylation of PKCs confers conformational or electrostatic changes that modulate PKC association with membrane lipids and proteins via their regulatory domains (18Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18382-18390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,27Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of PKC has been known for years and has been associated with some changes in the kinetic behavior of the enzymein vitro (17Huang K.P. Chan K.F. Singh T.J. Nakabayashi H. Huang F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12134-12140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present study defines an important physiological function for PKC autophosphorylation by demonstrating its critical role in the reversible PKC βII membrane trafficking in response to cell surface receptor activation. Moreover, the requirement for kinase activity and autophosphorylation in PKC βII dissociation from the plasma membrane following translocation reveals a novel regulatory mechanism modulating PKC activity. Thus, membrane dissociation should no longer be considered as a default step following PKC translocation, but rather as a regulated step requiring kinase autophosphorylation. Failure of this regulation may result in “permanently” membrane-associated proteins with subsequent alterations in cellular signaling and functions. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an exquisite control of the subtle interaction of PKC with the plasma membrane, and have revealed the dynamic and regulated nature of this process. Furthermore, by implicating the involvement of autophosphorylation in turning off PKCs, these findings also suggest that autophosphorylation of PKCs may be important in preventing abnormal cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene expression."

In the course of the characterization of the human type IhHa2 hair keratin gene on a λ contig,2 we discovered a partial genomic sequence of the hHa5 gene lying approximately 8.0 kbp upstream of the hHa2 gene (16Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present study attempts a bidirectional expansion and analysis of thehHa2/hHa5 gene region by means of combined λ and P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) cloning in order to learn more about the organization of the human type I hair keratin gene cluster on chromosome 17q12-q21 and to possibly detect novel type I hair keratin genes. The characterization of thehHa2 gene, as well as the partial characterization of thehH5 gene on λ clones ghkI2.12 and ghkI2.17, respectively, has been described previously (16Rogers M.A. Winter H.

In order to obtain the 5′ region of hHa5, a 0.3-kbp PstI-XhoI (linker) fragment of the hHa5 cDNA (16Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest.

This library was derived from Sau3a-digested human genomic DNA cloned into the BamHI site of the PAC vector AD10SacBII (library and vector from Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO). PCR screening with the hHa3-II probe resulted in the isolation of two clones (termed PAC1 and PAC2) that appeared 80% identical as evaluated byNdeI-NotI (linker) restriction enzyme (RE) digestion of each PAC clone. The larger clone, PAC1 was further characterized. PCR screening with the hHa6 primer pair resulted in the isolation of one PAC clone, termed PAC3. PCR analysis was performed using the Boehringer Expand Long PCR System (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primer pairs and PCR conditions are listed in Table I and below.Table IOligonucleotide primer pairs and PCR conditions used in this studyPCR productOligonucleotide sequenceSizeAnnealing temperaturebp°ChHa3-II 3′cagaagtatagcagtaagacagcaagaggaaagtttattaggc30855hHa6 3′gacagcccacttggtcggctgaaaagcacagtta15856hHa3-Igagattttggactctgtcttcatttcttctcctcctggttgtggg128862hHa4cctgcttttccattacctgttcaagtaaatgaagtctcctcctg157862hHa6agctccttgctaagctgcaacgctatgccaggagaacacact168462ΨhHaAactgtgggcaaagcaggatcatcaggaggcaacagaagagag156962hHa7gctgcctccatgtgcctcttctgctaccggttgatttaggg135862hHa8ctcctggagcaagaaatgtctctgtccctggtatctcatagcc145762 Open table in a new tab Clones PAC1 and 3 were initially analyzed for the presence of human type I hair keratin genes by PCR-based analysis using specific primers derived from cDNA clones of hHa1 (12Fink P.

Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and hHa61 (see also, λ clone analysis), as well as from a genomic hHa3-I clone. 3The complete genomic sequence of the hHa3-I gene was a generous gift of Dr. A. P. Bertolino, Department of Dermatology, New York University, New York.PCR conditions were the same as used for PAC clone isolation. The PAC1 and PAC3 DNA was digested with NdeI and NotI (linker) and separated on 0.8% agarose long gels. The separated RE fragments were Southern blotted overnight onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes using 0.4 m NaOH, 0.6m NaCl as a transfer solution; 0.5 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for neutralization followed by UV cross-linking of the DNA (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The RE fragments containing conserved α-helical regions of human hair keratins were detected by low stringency hybridization of these blots with an α-helical PCR probe of the hHa1 cDNA (12Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using procedures described in the ECL random priming DNA labeling, hybridization, and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 60 °C overnight; post hybridization washes were carried out with 1–1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS and with 1–0.5× SSC plus 0.1% SDS for 20 min. at 62 °C each. This same procedure was also used for analysis of the isolated NdeI subclones described below. Multiple RE fragments of NdeI-NotI cut PAC1 and PAC3 DNA were separated on 0.8% agarose long gels. Individual bands or groups of bands were excised from the gel, purified from agarose (agarose gel extraction kit, Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), quantitated, and ligated into a dephosphorylated, NdeI-cut pGEM5Z sequencing vector. Insert-containing colonies were selected by blue/white screening. Miniprep DNA was prepared and RE digested with NdeI or withPstI and StyI in order to determine if more than one individual fragment was present in each ligation. Each unique subclone was then end-sequenced, and maxiprep DNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was prepared. This procedure resulted in the cloning of 80–90% of the RE fragments present on the PAC clones. 1) Generation of specific PAC subclone data bases: All NdeI subclones isolated were end-sequenced, and a data base of fragment end sequences was generated. Orientation of the fragments to each other was performed by generation of sequencing primers derived from the reverse and complement of each end sequence in order to sequence across the adjacent NdeI site via PAC DNA sequencing (termed crossover sequencing). Comparison of this crossover sequence by the FASTA program (Heidelberger Unix Sequence Analysis Resource, HUSAR) with the data base of end fragments allowed the discovery of the correct neighboring end fragment adjoining the end sequence analyzed. 2) Final contig closure: Initially, closure of the remaining open DNA fragments was attempted by PAC sequencing (primer walking) using the crossover sequences obtained from end fragments that had not found an adjacent partner. If no new NdeI site was found after sequencing 1 kbp of PAC DNA, then combinations of crossover oligos were used as primer pairs in long range PCR reactions using the Expand Long PCR System (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). The agarose gel separated PCR products were excised and end-sequenced by means of the crossover primers, used to generate the PCR product. A PCR product was considered genuine only when it exhibited the correct sequences from both sides compared with the initial PAC DNA sequence. These experiments were repeated twice. PCR primer pairs and sequencing primers were selected using the Oligo 5.0 software program (MedProbe, Oslo, Norway). Repetitive sequences were generally eliminated by comparison with the repetitive element data base REPBASE from HUSAR. Plasmid DNA, PAC DNA, and PCR products were sequenced using a 33P Chain Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.3 μg (plasmid), 3 μg (PAC), or 0.1–0.7 μg (PCR product) of DNA was used per sequencing with 10 pmol of the respective primer. Cycle sequencing conditions were 95 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 90 s; 45 cycles were performed. Sequencing reactions were separated on 5.7% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. At a later date, fluorescence dye terminator cycle sequencing was performed using either the Amplitaq FS- (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) or Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cycle sequencing kits. 1 μg (Plasmid), 5 μg (PAC), or 0.2–1.2 μg (PCR products) of DNA were used with 10 pmol of the respective primer. Cycle sequencing conditions were 96 °C for 15 s; 55 °C for 8 s, 60 °C for 240 s; 24 or 30 cycles were performed. The fluorescence-labeled sequencing reactions were analyzed on a ABI 310 capillary electrophoresis sequencing apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). In general, DNA sequence analysis was performed with several programs contained in the Wisconsin GCG package as provided by HUSAR. Contig generation and sequence correction was performed using the contig analysis software GELENTER or the STADEN program. Amino acid multialignments were performed using the software program CLUSTAL. Enhancer sequence recognition sites were determined using the TRANSFAC data base (24Wingender E. Kel A.E. Karas H. Heinemeyer T. Dietze P. Knuppel R. Romaschenko A.G. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 74-amino acid residues of the 2B α-helical subdomain of several human type I cytokeratins (K9–17, 19–20) and of all type I hair keratins presented here were used for multiple amino acid alignment using the software program CLUSTAL (HUSAR). Evolutionary tree construction was achieved using the CLUSTREE program (HUSAR). In order to further ensure the statistical significance of the produced data, distance matrices for each individual tree were generated using the program DISTANCES (HUSAR) and evaluated using the software program SPLITS (HUSAR). Total RNA was extracted from the bulbs of 10–20 freshly plucked human hair follicles using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany). PCR amplification of the generated cDNA was performed using the Expand Long PCR System (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) and the primer pair specific for each individual keratin (see Table I). PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, subsequently 94 °C for 10 s, X °C for 30 s, 68 °C. for 2 min for 10 cycles then an additional 20 cycles using the same conditions but with 20 s of added elongation time for each cycle. X = annealing temperature listed in Table I. The PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels. DNA purification and sequencing was performed as stated above. The combination of PAC and λ cloning allowed the isolation of a 190 kbp contiguous stretch of human genomic DNA harboring 10 human type I hair keratin genes (Fig. 1). The originally described λ contig (16Rogers M.A. Winter H. Langbein L. Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), together with the newly isolated λ clone, contain the entirehHa2, hHa5, and hHa6 genes and cover part of the PAC 3 clone, a 135-kbp genomic fragment obtained by PAC bank screening using specific PCR primers for the hHa6 gene (see Table I). PAC3 contains eight hair keratin genes (hHa6, hHa5, hHa2, hHa8, hHa7, ΨhHaA, hHa1, and hHa4) (Fig. 1). PAC1, which was isolated using specific PCR primers for the hHa3-II cDNA (see Table I) (15Rogers M.A. Schweizer J. Krieg T. Winter H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 20: 155-161Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), is a 125-kbp genomic fragment harboring six hair keratin genes (hHa7, ΨhHaA, hHa1, hHa4, hHa3-II, and hHa3-I). PAC3 and PAC1 have an overlap of ∼64 kbp, both clones exhibiting thehHa7, ΨhHaA, hHa1, and hHa4 genes in common (Fig. 1). The size of the hair keratin genes ranges from 4.2 to 7.5 kbp, and the genes are separated from each other by 5.5–18.4 kbp (Fig. 2). Type I hair keratin genes hHa6, hHa2, hHa8, hHa7, ΨhHaA, hHa1, hHa4, hHa3-II, and hHa3-I are each divided into 7 exons and 6 introns. This is in contrast to the exon/intron organization of type I cytokeratin genes, which exhibit an additional, positionally highly variable intron in the region coding for the tail domain (2Steinert P.M. Steven A.C. Roop D.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, both gene families show exceptions to these rules, in that cytokeratin geneK9 possesses an 8th (25Reis A. Hennies H.C. Langbein L. Digweed M. Mischke D. Drechsler M. Schrock E.

Krieg T. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), both being located in the 3′-noncoding region of the genes. Apart from the exon/intron boundaries of intron 7 of the hHa5 gene, all other exon/intron boundaries in type I hair keratin genes are positionally conserved, and all genes are transcribed in the same direction (Fig. 2; sequence accession numbers are presented in Table II).Figure 2Physical NdeI map of the 190-kbp region covered by clones PAC1 and PAC3.

Dermatol. 1996; 107: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to these hair keratin genes, we identified a 263-bp DNA sequence, located 12.2 kbp upstream of the hHa8 gene, which exhibited a 68% sequence homology with the region coding for the α-helical part of exon 1 in human type I hair keratin genes (Fig. 2). Amino acid translation showed that the transcriptional direction of the sequence was the same as that of all other hair keratin genes located on the contig. However, the resulting protein sequence displayed only low homology with the characteristic helix initiation motif of type I cyto- and hair keratins. Moreover, even under low stringency conditions, a hHa1 cDNA derived α-helical probe did not hybridize to the 10.5-kbp NdeI fragment immediately downstream of the critical sequence (Fig. 2), thus indicating that the region 3′ to the putative exon does not encode further α-helical sequences. Finally, sequencing of a further 2 kbp downstream of the 263 bp region revealed sequences completely unrelated to that coding for α-helical segments. It therefore appears that the critical 263 bp sequence represents an orphan exon, a phenomenon seen previously also in a cosmid clone harboring sheep type II wool keratin genes (26Powell B.C. Cam G.R. Fietz M.J. Rogers G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5048-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Multiple comparisons of the amino acid sequences derived from the 10 hair keratin genes led to a striking sorting of the keratin proteins into three groups, A and B being structurally highly related hair keratins, and a third group C, containing structurally more heterogeneous hair keratins. Group A encompassed hair keratins hHa1, hHa3-I, hHa3-II, 4While carrying out this sequencing project we noticed several sequencing errors in the previously published hHa1 (12Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (accession no. X86570) and hHa3-II (15Rogers M.A. Schweizer J.

Corrections to these cDNA sequences have been submitted to the GenBankTM/EBI data base under the same accession numbers. and the newly described hHa4 hair keratin which exhibited an overall amino acid identity of 89% (Fig. 3). Besides the rod domains, the homologous regions also comprised the entire head domains which are strictly conserved in size in this group, as well as 10 amino acid residues long carboxyl-terminal sequences adjacent to the end of the α-helical rod domains (Fig. 3). Hair keratin hHa1 has previously been found to be the ortholog of the murine mHa1 hair keratin (12Fink P. Rogers M.A. Korge B. Winter H. Schweizer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Bertolino A.P. Checkla D.M. Notterman R. Sklaver I. Schiff T.A. Freedberg I.M. DiDona G.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 541-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the new hair keratin hHa4 is orthologous with the murine mHa4 hair keratin (28Bertolino A.P. Checkla D.M. Heitner S. Freedberg I.M. Yu D.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 297-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human hair keratins hHa1 and hHa4 possess 417 and 395 amino acid residues, respectively, and have calculated molecular masses of 47236 and 44719 Da. Within the group A hair keratins, hHa3-I and hHa3-II exhibit the by far highest sequence identity with each other (93.3%). Both contain 405 amino acid residues and have calculated molecular masses of 45934 and 46213 Da. They are highly related to the partial sequence of the murine hHa3 hair keratin (29Winter H. Siry P. Tobiasch E. Schweizer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on a common sequence motif PIG(S/P)CVTNPC in their carboxyl-terminal domains (see Fig. 3), we speculate that hHa3-II may represents the ortholog of the murine mHa3 hair keratin (29Winter H. Siry P. Tobiasch E. Schweizer J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Group B contained hair keratins ΨhHaA, hHa7, and hHa8 (Fig. 4). These are novel hair keratins, which have not yet been described in other species. Their overall sequence homology is in the range of 81%; however, due to an almost completely identical head domain, comparison of hHa7 and hHa8 only, leads to a much higher homology value of 92.6%. Hair keratins hHa7 and hHa8 comprise 408 and 415 amino acid residues, respectively, wi"
https://openalex.org/W2064428064,"Trans-synaptic regulation of muscarinic, peptidergic, and purinergic responses after denervation has been reported previously in rat parotid acinar cells (McMillian, M. K., Soltoff, S. P., Cantley, L. C., Rudel, R., and Talamo, B. R. (1993) Br. J. Pharmacol. 108, 453–461). Characteristics of the ATP-mediated responses and the effects of parasympathetic denervation were further analyzed through assay of Ca2+ influx, using fluorescence ratio imaging methods, and by analysis of P2x receptor expression. ATP activates both a high affinity and a low affinity response with properties corresponding to the recently described P2x4 and the P2z (P2x7)-type purinoceptors, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis reveals mRNA for P2x4 as well as P2x7 subtypes but not P2x1, P2x2, P2x3, P2x5, or P2x6. P2x4 protein also is detected by Western blotting. Distribution of the two types of ATP receptor responses on individual cells was stochastic, with both high and low affinity responses on some cells, and only a single type of response on others. Sensitivity to P2x4-type activation also varied even among cells responsive to low concentrations of ATP. Parasympathetic denervation greatly enhanced responses, tripling the proportion of acinar cells with a P2x4-type response and increasing the fraction of highly sensitive cells by 7-fold. Moreover, P2x4 mRNA is significantly increased following parasympathetic denervation. These data indicate that sensitivity to ATP is modulated by neurotransmission at parasympathetic synapses, at least in part through increased expression of P2x4mRNA, and suggest that similar regulation may occur at other sites in the nervous system where P2x4 receptors are widely expressed. Trans-synaptic regulation of muscarinic, peptidergic, and purinergic responses after denervation has been reported previously in rat parotid acinar cells (McMillian, M. K., Soltoff, S.

Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the physiological regulation of P2x receptors. We have shown that removal of the autonomic innervation alters ATP responses in parotid acinar cells, which therefore provide a good model for investigating trans-synaptic regulation of receptor-mediated signaling. We previously described two ATP responses in rat parotid acinar cells, a P2z/x7 type and a high affinity ATP receptor with distinctly different P2x-like pharmacology (1McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. Rudel R. Talamo B.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Expression of the P2x-type proteins in heterologous systems shows that each can form functional, homomeric, ligand-gated ion channels with a significant permeability to Ca2+ ions as well as other inorganic cations, including Na+ and K+. Properties of P2x7 receptors differ substantially from the other subtypes of P2x receptors and are similar to the P2z receptor response that has been extensively described in macrophages and related cells. P2zreceptors not only function as cation-permeable channels but also are capable of mediating the flux of larger organic molecules of sizes ranging up to 900 Da without regard to the charge on the molecule (17Surprenant A.

Physiologically mediated changes in tonic patterns of nerve activity elicited by surgical denervation or by dietary manipulation alter the rat parotid gland, modifying acinar cell proliferation, cell size, and sensitivity of parotid secretion to neurotransmitters (26Ekström J.

Our previous denervation studies also established that trans-synaptic regulation of sensitivity to these neurotransmitters can be demonstrated in vitro in dissociated cell suspensions and showed for the first time that sensitivity to ATP is increased very dramatically (1McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. Rudel R. Talamo B.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31McMillian M.K. Talamo B.R. Peptides. 1989; 10: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This suggests that P2x purinoceptors are modulated by changes in synaptic activity and that ATP plays a role in the physiologically important regulation of food intake and metabolism. Here, we further characterize and identify the high and low affinity ATP receptors in parotid acinar cells and determine whether the receptors are co-expressed or independently distributed. P2x receptor types were classified in individual cells by pharmacology of the Ca2+iresponse to ATP, as analyzed by fluorescence ratio imaging of cells loaded with Fura-2. The properties of the responses are consistent with those observed for homomeric P2x4 receptors and P2x7 receptors in expression systems. RT-PCR1amplification provided evidence for expression of the cognate mRNAs. Imaging experiments established that 1) the high and low affinity responses are independently expressed across acinar cells and likely mediated by P2x4 and P2x7 receptors, respectively; 2) denervation produces an increase in sensitivity to ATP (decrease in threshold) in individual cells; and 3) denervation leads to an increase in the number (proportion) of cells with high affinity ATP responses. Both responses to denervation could be explained, at least in part, by quantitative RT-PCR data showing that P2x4 receptor mRNA increases following denervation. These data suggest that elevated P2x4 receptor protein contributes to the observed increases in the sensitivity and total magnitude of the glandular response. Dissociated parotid acinar cells were prepared by trypsin and collagenase treatment as described previously (32McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was suspended in oxygenated HEPES/Ringer buffer of the following composition (in mm) 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, 5 β-hydroxybutyrate, 10 glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. This preparation is composed of single cells and small clumps containing up to five cells; acinar cells comprise 85% or more of the dissociated cell preparation. Unilateral deafferentation of one parotid gland of Sprague-Dawley rats (50–100 g) was carried out surgically by avulsion of the right auriculotemporal nerve, which carries post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers. Tetracycline HCl (Polyotic, for veterinary use; 500 mg/liter drinking water; American Cyanamid, Wayne, NJ) was provided in drinking water ad libitum for 4 days following surgery. The contralateral gland served as control. Dissociated acinar cells were prepared 2–3 weeks after denervation. Ca2+i was assayed in single cells using the fluorescent calcium indicator dye Fura-2 (Molecular Probes). Cells were loaded with Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (1.5 μm) for 60 min at room temperature as described previously (32McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Washed cells were suspended in Mg2+-free HEPES/Ringer buffer, and 150 μl of Fura-2 loaded cells were plated on an acid-washed glass coverslip coated with concanavalin A (1 mg/ml) 5–10 min before mounting in the perfusion chamber for Ca2+i measurements. Ca2+i was estimated by the ratio method, using a K of 224 nm for Ca2+ binding to Fura-2 (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Maximum and minimum fluorescence values were obtained by the addition of ionomycin and EGTA, respectively, to the perfusion chamber at the end of experiments. In most cases, calcium responses are indicated as the ratio of the fluorescence values at 340 and 380 nm excitation. Rapid exchange of solutions was achieved by superfusion (4 ml/min) of cells in an open chamber. Cells were imaged using a Nikon Diaphot inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Xenon light source, Fura-2 barrier and emission filter sets, and a Cohu CCD camera. A computerized filter wheel (Sutter Instruments) equipped with an electronic shutter regulated excitation at 340 or 380 ± 10 nm. Data were collected on a 486 computer equipped with an Itex 100 frame-grabbing board. Software was developed to collect data simultaneously from as many as 50 cells, by placing circles of about 80 pixels in area over intracellular regions of fluorescent cells imaged on a 512 × 512 video monitor. Fluorescent cells were visualized using a Nikon fluor 40× oil immersion objective and excitation light at 380 nm. Cells with the morphology of polarized acinar cells were selected for analysis, including both fully dissociated individual cells as well as polarized cells organized in clusters of three to five cells around a lumen. Strings of duct cells were not analyzed. Ratio-pair data from all selected areas were usually collected every 5–7 s during the experiment. Data from a single frame were saved with no averaging. Background fluorescence was determined by placing a data collection circle in an area without cells; this value was subtracted for each data point before calculating the ratio of 340:380 measurements. Fluorescence images of cells with superimposed data collection circles as well as bright-field (Nomarski) images were saved and printed for each experimental run. Data were analyzed off-line. Reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Total RNA was prepared by a single step method using Ultraspec, a commercially available isolation system (Biotecx, Houston, TX). The parotid glands were denervated as described above, removed 2–3 weeks later, and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen. Control and denervated samples were crushed in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized in 4 ml of Ultraspec. Purified total RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and 10 μg was run on a formaldehyde gel to confirm the integrity of the RNA as indicated by the preservation of the 28 and 18 S rRNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg total RNA using Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with random hexamers as primers (Promega). Rat brain and rat dorsal root ganglia cDNAs were prepared from total RNA obtained in the same manner. Genomic DNA was prepared from rat liver by a standard procedure (34Moore D. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 2.1.1-2.1.9Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was excised, minced, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and crushed to a fine powder. The powdered tissue was suspended in digestion buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8.0, and then incubated with shaking at 50 °C for 18 h. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol was added, and the nucleic acids were extracted. The DNA was precipitated from the upper layer with 1.07m ammonium acetate and 57% ethanol and resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 8). The P2x-receptor and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs were amplified with specific primers using Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 50-μl reaction mixture contained 10 μl of DNA template, 1 × Taq buffer, 800 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm magnesium, 50 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. The products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel by ethidium bromide staining. The primer sequences and expected sizes of the products are shown in Table I. The identity of the products was confirmed by sequencing the amplified cDNA (Tufts DNA Sequencing Facility, Boston).Table IOligonucleotide primers used to detect P2x-receptor subtypes by RT-PCRForward primerReverse primerExpected size (bp)P2x1GGGTGGGTGTTTGTCTATGAAGCTGATGCTGTTTTTGATGAA447P2x2TGGGACTACGAGACGCCTAAGATGGTGGGAATGAGACTGAAT953P2x3TTTGTGGGGTGGGTTTTCTTGTAATGGTGGGGATGATGTTGA856P2x4(up/lo)AACATCCTCCCCAACATCACCCCATCTCTCCCCATCTTTCTG618P2x4(A/B)AACACCTCTCAGCTTGGATTCAGGTAGGACGTGGTGATGTTG418P2x4(A/Far)AACACCTCTCAGCTTGGATTCAAAGACCCTGCTCGTAGTC927P2x5AAGCCAATGTACTAGAAACAGTCATCCTGACGAACCCTCTCC613P2x6GCTGGGGGTTTCTGGATTACAGCTCTTGCCTCTTCATACTTG1081P2x7(Trunc)CTTTACAGAGGTGGCAGTTCATGGTGGAGAGAGAGGGAGAGC578P2x7(C-term)GTTTTGACATCCTGGTTTTTGCTGCGGTTCTCTGGTAGTTGA529P2x7(3′-UTR)GTTTTGACATCCTGGTTTTTGGGCGGCTTTTAGTGGTTTCTG1877GAPDHCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG595 Open table in a new tab The basis for competitive PCR is the inclusion of a known quantity of a synthetic internal standard that is amplified by the same primers as the cDNA of interest. Specific competitive templates were constructed to determine the amounts of GAPDH and P2x4-receptor cDNAs in the RT-DNA samples. For each experiment, a standard curve is obtained by adding known quantities of the internal standard to the PCR mixture containing the cDNA of interest. The level of amplification of each template depends upon its relative abundance in the mixture. The product from the internal standard is shorter than the product from the cDNA, and they can be separated by gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 7 a). The ratio of the intensities of the two bands is derived by densitometric measurements of the ethidium bromide-stained gel. Ratios from data of Fig. 7 a are plotted in Fig. 7 b. At a ratio of 1.0, the intensity of the two bands is the same, and the quantity of mRNA in the original sample may be read on the xaxis. The competitive template for P2x4 was constructed using a plasmid (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) containing the P2x4-receptor cDNA (courtesy of G. Buell, Glaxo (Ref.12Buell G. Lewis C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar)). Two HaeII restriction endonuclease sites within the sequence amplified by PCR with primer set P2x4 (up/lo) were employed to remove 200 bp from the cDNA. The fragments were then ligated back into the empty vector to create the template, P2x4-ΔHaeII. A similar template was generated from a plasmid containing the human GAPDH cDNA (pHcGAP; ATCC, Rockville, MD) by restriction digest with XbaI and BstXI to remove 95 bp. The resulting product was then blunted with T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and ligated to form GAPDH ΔX/B. The nucleotide sequence recognized by the primers is the same for both the human and rat GAPDH cDNA. Identical primers were used for competitive templates and the cDNA samples, and products differed only slightly in size, so both were amplified with the same efficiency. In some experiments, annealing between the heterologous strands of the competitor and cDNA products was observed. The third band generated in this manner was not included in the analysis because it contains equal quantities of both products and did not affect the quantification. Immunoblotting of P2x4-receptor protein was carried out using samples from rat parotid gland and, as a control, human embryonic kidney 293 cells (293 cells), which heterologously expressed the receptor. A plasmid containing the full-length cDNA sequence for the rat P2x4 receptor (p464) was transfected into the 293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Okayama and Chen, as modified by Pritchett et al. (35Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Gorman C.M. Kettenmann H. Seeburg P.H. Schofield P.R. Science. 1988; 242: 1306-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Protein samples from parotid glands were prepared by freezing and pulverizing the tissue in liquid nitrogen followed by direct transfer into SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmEDTA, pH 6.8. The sample was then homogenized for 30 s using a Brinkman polytron and boiled for 5 min. Extracts from 293 cells were prepared by scraping the cells from 100-mm tissue culture dishes in SDS sample buffer and homogenizing the sample as described above. Total protein was separated by 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the P2x4 receptor was detected by immunoblotting with an antibody (final concentration, 2 μg/ml; kindly donated by Gary Buell, Glaxo, Geneva) against the COOH-terminal of the rat protein. Crude antiserum and affinity-purified antibody were used in these experiments. Some blots were also reacted with antibody preabsorbed for 2 h at 20 °C with the antigenic peptide (20 μg/ml). Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie protein reagent assay (Pierce). P2x4-receptor-like immunoreactivity was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (Pierce). The basis for increased sensitivity of denervated parotid acinar cells to ATP was investigated by characterizing Ca2+i responses in individual cells and by molecular analysis. The properties of the Ca2+iresponses have been partially determined in previous studies and can be evaluated through Fura-2 analysis. Although muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and substance P receptors in parotid acinar cells elevate Ca2+i through G protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C and subsequent production of inositol 1,4,5, trisphosphate (32McMillian M.K.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14912-14916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our results show that the ATP responses do not seem to be of the metabotropic type. Both ATP responses required extracellular Ca2+. ATP is not effective in stimulating inositol phosphate formation in this preparation (however, see also Ref. 38Jorgensen T.D. Gromada J. Tritsaris K. Nauntofte B. Dissing S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and whole cell patch clamp recordings demonstrate that activation of whole cell currents by ATP does not involve a GDPβS-sensitive step (36McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Lechleiter J.D. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar). P2z responses in parotid cells resemble those in other cell types, requiring relatively high concentrations of ATP (100 μm or greater) to stimulate influx of both Na+ and Ca2+ (39Tenneti L. Talamo B.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP is the most potent and effective agonist, and the response is inhibited by high concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg2+, Brilliant Blue G, reactive blue 2, and H2DIDS (36,40). The second type of response to ATP is of higher affinity (EC50 less than 10 μm), insensitive to nucleotides UTP, GTP, adenosine, and α,β-methylene ATP and weakly responsive to 2-methylthio-ATP. Further, it is neither activated by 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP nor inhibited by high concentrations of divalent cations, Brilliant Blue G, reactive blue 2, and H2DIDS (1McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P.

An additional distinguishing feature of the two responses to ATP is that they are differentially modulated by protein kinase inhibitors (39Tenneti L. Talamo B.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ca2+i is elevated in parotid acinar cells by at least four different neurotransmitters, including agonists of the metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors and P2 purinergic receptors for extracellular ATP. To determine whether the muscarinic and P2 receptors are differentially distributed across acinar cells, Fura-2 loaded cells were perfused sequentially with maximally effective concentrations of the agonists carbachol (30 or 100 μm) and ATP (30 or 300 μm). Between agonist doses, cells were washed with buffer until Ca2+i values returned to basal levels. Almost all cells responded to maximal concentrations of carbachol, and cells that did not respond to carbachol rarely showed responses to ATP. Only the cells responding to carbachol were analyzed. Among the carbachol-responsive cells, 93% (75/81) also responded to 300 μm ATP (Fig. 1), a concentration that would activate both high and low affinity receptors. This indicated that the majority of cells had P2xreceptors. Addition of a maximal dose of carbachol rapidly elevated Ca2+i to a peak value that then declined to a slightly lower steady-state level followed by recovery to a basal value when agonist was washed out. Previous studies using cell suspensions demonstrated that the response to ATP is biphasic and that there are two pharmacologically distinct responses. However, under those assay conditions, the signal is a composite of responses from a large population of cells, and it is difficult to determine whether the two responses arise from subsets of cells with different receptors or whether the two receptors are homogeneously distributed across all responding cells. In the present studies, the distribution of the two distinct receptor types was characterized on individual cells. Cells were assayed in buffer without added Mg2+ to optimize the P2z response. Perfusion with both low and high concentrations of ATP identified some cells that displayed only the low affinity or only the high affinity response as defined below, but many cells showed both responses (Fig. 1). In 73% of the cells with responses to 300 μm ATP (164/225 cells), a small, rapid elevation in Ca2+i was detected at low concentrations of ATP (1–30 μm, high affinity response), and Ca2+i usually reversed to basal level when agonist was washed out (Fig. 1). At higher concentrations of ATP (300 μm), Ca2+i increased more slowly and reached higher levels (low affinity response). After exposure to 300 μm ATP, the elevated Ca2+i did not always reverse to basal level after washing out the ATP (Fig. 1). In parotid acinar cell suspensions, the large increase in Ca2+iin response to a high concentration of ATP (300 μm) is primarily mediated by P2z receptors. Thus, Mg2+ or high concentrations of Ca2+ would be expected to reverse or block this response in cells with low affinity receptors (see for example, Ref. 41Virginio C. Church D. North R.A. Surprenant A. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To test this, single cells were first"

Rheum. 1992; 31: 573-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Sharif M. Saxne T. Shepstone L. Kirwan J.R. Elson C.J. Heinegård D. Dieppe P.A. Br. J. Rheum. 1995; 34: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of the protein in chondrodysplasias and arthritis, cartilage is the major site of expression of COMP. In mouse limb bud cultures, COMP expression was shown to be a late marker of chondrogenesis, appearing slightly after type II procollagen and aggrecan (17Franzen A. Heinegård D. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1987; 36: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In human adult articular cartilage, COMP is expressed predominantly in the interterritorial matrix (18DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Carlson C.S. Pasumarti S. Paulsson M. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, strong immunostaining was found in the territorial matrix around the chondrocytes in human fetal cartilage growth plate (18DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Carlson C.S. Pasumarti S. Paulsson M. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have not detected COMP in non-cartilaginous tissues (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), COMP has also been purified from bovine tendon (19Hauser N. Paulsson M. Kale A.A. DiCesare P.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The tissue pathology of cartilage in patients with PSACH is striking. Electron microscopy has shown marked dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) in chondrocytes (20Maynard J.A. Cooper R.R. Ponseti I.V. Lab. Invest. 1972; 26: 40-44PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stanescu V. Maroteaux P. Stanescu R. Eur. J. Pediat. 1982; 138: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar but smaller RER inclusions are found in MED (22Stanescu R. Stanescu V. Muriel M.P. Maroteaux P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These inclusions have been postulated to result from the impaired secretion of structurally abnormal matrix proteins. Before COMP was identified as the mutant protein in these disorders, immunohistochemistry had been performed with antibodies against various extracellular matrix proteins. These experiments showed that inclusions stained strongly with antibodies against aggrecan, weakly with antibodies against link protein, but not with anti-type II collagen antibodies (21Stanescu V. Maroteaux P. Stanescu R. Eur. J. Pediat. 1982; 138: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Stanescu R. Stanescu V. Muriel M.P. Maroteaux P. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Very recently, immuno-electron microscopy of cartilage from a patient with PSACH has identified COMP and collagen IX in the inclusions (23Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MED patients with the COL9A2 mutation are phenotypically similar to patients with a COMP mutation but, in two families, no inclusions were found in the chondrocyte RER (24van Mourik, J. B. A., Buma, P., and Wilcox, W. R. (1998)Ultrastruc. Pathol., in pressGoogle Scholar). In an effort to understand the normal biosynthesis of COMP, as well as the pathophysiology of PSACH and MED, we have used cultured cells as a model to study the synthesis and secretion of normal and abnormal COMP. These studies have demonstrated that COMP pentamers are assembled intracellularly, suggesting that abnormal monomers are incorporated into COMP pentamers. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the presence of COMP within RER inclusions of patient cartilage. Cultured cells from patients also contained RER inclusions but did not show a net decrease in COMP secretion. These data support the hypothesis that the COMP disorders result from a combination of a qualitative defect due to the secretion of abnormal COMP in the extracellular matrix and a quantitative defect resulting from intracellular retention of structurally abnormal COMP. Cultures were derived from control and patient tissues referred to the International Skeletal Dysplasia Registry at the Cedars-Sinai Research Institute. Primary cell cultures were established from knee ligament, Achilles' tendon, and proximal and distal femoral cartilage from a 28-week-old control human male fetus (International Skeletal Dysplasia Registry reference number R96-373). Control chondrocytes were also obtained from the iliac crest of an adult (R93-084) who underwent surgery for a problem unrelated to a COMP disorder. Patient R91-213A has a radiographic diagnosis of mild pseudoachondroplasia (25Rimoin D.L. Rasmussen I.M. Briggs M.D. Roughley P.J. Gruber H.E. Warman M.L. Olsen B.R. Hsia Y.E. Yuen J. Reinker K. Garber A.P. Grover J. Lachman R.S. Cohn D.H. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this family, the disease has been linked to the COMP locus on chromosome 19 (26Briggs M.D. Rasmussen I.M. Weber J.L. Yuen J. Reinker K. Garber A.P. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the molecular defect is a single nucleotide change leading to the G427E substitution in the sixth calmodulin repeat. 2L. M. King and D. H. Cohn, unpublished data. Patients R95-204 and R85-160A have diagnoses of unclassified MED and severe PSACH, respectively. The mutations in both patients are duplication of one or two codons in the stretch of five aspartic acid codons (469–473), respectively, in the seventh calmodulin domain of COMP and will be described in detail elsewhere. 3E. Délot, L. M. King, M. D. Briggs, W. R. Wilcox, and D. H. Cohn, submitted for publication. In all three cases, chondrocytes or tendon cells were grown from the proximal femur, which was obtained at hip replacement surgery. Patient R68-29 has a diagnosis of PSACH and a point mutation leading to a single amino acid change (D446N) in the sixth calmodulin domain, identical to that of the patient described by Maddox et al. (23Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two unrelated patients, R94-291A and R92-58, have typical PSACH and a missense mutation (G309R) in the second calmodulin domain.2 Cells were plated at near-confluence in a 25-cm2 flask and incubated overnight. They were then starved for 4 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high-glucose medium before labeling with 40 μCi of [35S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) in 400 μl of fresh serum-free medium. After 48 h, the medium was collected. After rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cell layer was harvested in 400 μl of prechilled lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 g/liter Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Purified human transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was, when indicated, added at the same time as [35S]cysteine, at a final concentration of 4 ng/ml, which was determined in preliminary experiments to yield maximum induction of COMP (not shown). Ascorbic acid was used at 50 μg/ml. To identify COMP in our cell samples, we partially purified COMP protein from human fetal cartilage according to published procedures (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6DiCesare P.E.

Res. 1995; 13: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) by salt-EDTA extraction and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Cartilage and cell extracts, and cell supernatants, were separated by electrophoresis through 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, each with a 5% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Kaleidoscope molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. COMP was further identified by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, using polyclonal antibodies against purified bovine COMP, a gift from Dr. D. Heinegård (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred from the gel to a Hybond-C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) membrane by overnight electric transfer. COMP was detected by chemiluminescence with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation, 1 μl of anti-COMP antibody was typically used for 100–200 μl of sample. After a 1.5-h incubation on ice, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 30 μl of a 50:50 slurry in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) was added, and the sample was gently mixed in the cold room for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with the same buffer before addition of sample buffer for electrophoresis. Electron microscopy was performed according to a modification of described techniques that will be published in detail elsewhere (27Brodie, S. G., Lachman, R. S., Crandall, B. F., Fox, M. A., Rimoin, D. L., Cohn, D. H., and Wilcox, W. R. (1998) Am. J. Med. Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar). Briefly, fresh chondro-osseous tissue or cultured cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde, post-fixed with 3% osmium tetraoxide, and dehydrated with an acetone gradient. After dehydration, the tissue was infiltrated with acetone/Spurr resin with several changes of resin. The resin was polymerized and sectioned (500–600 Å). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss 902 transmission electron microscope. For immunohistochemistry, frozen sections (6 μm) of cartilage were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using Endo/Blocker (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Proteoglycans were partially digested with Auto/Zyme solution (Biomeda). The sections were blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% non-fat dry milk, and 2% serum, then incubated with the primary antibody. After incubation with the biotinylated secondary antibody (at a concentration of 7.5 mg/liter) and ABC solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), sections were developed with a peroxidase substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidene solution (Biomeda) and mounted. Anti-type IX collagen (Development Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), anti-type II collagen (a gift from Dr. Robin Poole, Montreal, Canada), and anti-aggrecan (a gift from Dr. D. Heinegård, Lund, Sweden) polyclonal antibodies were used at the dilutions of 1:1000, 1:1500, and 1:1000, respectively. RNA from cultured cells was purified with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed with a COMP-specific primer (5′-TTTGTCCTCTCTGAGCCCTTC-3′) complementary to a portion of the 3′-untranslated region of the message, using the Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was amplified using gene-specific primers surrounding the mutation, and sequence was determined by cycle sequencing with ThermoSequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COMP biosynthesis was examined in cultured cells derived from cartilage and tendon, tissues known to contain COMP. Since joint laxity is a major aspect of the phenotype of PSACH, we also examined cultured ligament cells. All three cell types were grown in monolayer and subjected to steady-state labeling with [35S]cysteine. The supernatants and cell layers were collected separately and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. In the supernatants of the cultured ligament cells, we identified a protein that co-migrated with partially purified COMP from fetal cartilage (Fig. 1, lane 1) and that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-COMP antibodies (Fig. 1,lane 2). Reduction of the immunoprecipitated material yielded a protein that co-migrated with monomeric COMP (Fig. 1,lane 5). In the absence of antibody (Fig. 1, lane 6), this protein was not observed. Comparable results were also obtained with cultured tendon cells and chondrocytes (data not shown). In the immunoprecipitation experiments, a second protein, with a molecular mass of 130–140 kDa after reduction, was also apparent (Fig. 1, lane 5). It is possible that this molecule is monomeric thrombospondin-4, the closest member to COMP in the thrombospondin family of proteins, but we did not test this hypothesis. This protein was not detected in purified cartilage extracts. We tested the effect of transforming growth factor-β1, a growth factor known to affect bone and cartilage growth and/or differentiation and that stimulates COMP synthesis by cultured synovial cells (28Recklies A.D. Baillargeon L. White C. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) on COMP biosynthesis by the cell lines. Treatment with soluble purified TGF-β1 strongly stimulated COMP secretion in cultured ligament (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8), tendon (Fig. 1, lanes 10 and 11), and chondrocytes (Fig. 1, lanes 15 and 16). The general metabolism of the cells was enhanced by this treatment, but a few proteins, including COMP, were remarkably more stimulated than others (e.g. Fig. 1,lanes 15 and 16). Ascorbic acid, which is known to enhance collagen secretion (29Murad S. Grove D. Lindberg K.A. Reynolds G. Sivarajah A. Pinnell S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2879-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), did not affect COMP synthesis (data not shown). For the cultured ligament cells, only the pentameric form of COMP could be detected in the supernatant and the cell layer samples, suggesting that the pentamer is assembled intracellularly (Fig. 2, a and b). Identical results were also obtained with cultured chondrocytes (Fig. 2 c) and tendon cells (data not shown). We examined COMP biosynthesis by cultured cells from PSACH and MED patients. The three patients studied had distinct mutations in one of the calmodulin-like domains of COMP. In addition, for all three patients, direct sequence analysis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products containing the mutations demonstrated approximately equal levels of expression of the normal and mutant alleles (e.g. Fig. 3). This apparent stability of the transcript derived from the mutant allele suggests that normal and abnormal monomers are approximately equally translated in the patient cells and are available for incorporation into pentamers. At equal levels of expression of monomers derived from the normal and abnormal alleles, by random association, only 1 out of 32 pentameric molecules should consist of five normal monomers, and more than 97% of the pentamers should contain at least one abnormal monomer. Therefore, under the hypothesis that structurally abnormal pentamers are retained in the RER, only about 3% of the normal amount of COMP would be expected to be secreted into the supernatant by patient cells. To test this hypothesis, primary cultures of chondrocytes (mild PSACH patient R91-213A, typical PSACH patient R85-160, and MED patient R95-204) or tendon cells (R95-204) were labeled with [35S]cysteine, in parallel with control adult chondrocyte or fetal tendon cell cultures. The COMP protein synthesized by the patient cells was indistinguishable, both quantitatively and qualitatively, from that synthesized by control cells. After a 48-h labeling, there was neither a dramatic decrease in secretion (Fig. 1,lanes 12, 13, and 14) nor an increased amount of COMP in the cell layer (Fig. 2 c) of patient cells as compared with controls. As in the control cell cultures, COMP was found as a pentamer both within the cells and in the secreted compartment, and no free monomer was detected (Fig. 2 c). Cartilage from all three patients showed inclusions in the RER of chondrocytes. The inclusions were freckled in the case of the patient with mild PSACH (R91-213) (25Rimoin D.L. Rasmussen I.M. Briggs M.D. Roughley P.J. Gruber H.E. Warman M.L. Olsen B.R. Hsia Y.E. Yuen J. Reinker K. Garber A.P. Grover J. Lachman R.S. Cohn D.H. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), lamellar or freckled in the patient with typical PSACH (R85-160), and granular in the MED patient (R95-204) (Fig. 4, A–D). To determine whether the cultured cell model replicated the phenotype observed in vivo, we performed electron microscopy on cultured chondrocytes. After 4 days in culture in monolayer, neither chondrocytes nor tendon cells exhibited inclusions (not shown). However, longer term chondrocyte cultures of 4–5 weeks at confluence, without passage, showed dilated RER in cells from all three patients (Fig. 4, E–H). The inclusions were all granular in aspect. Control adult chondrocytes cultured and analyzed in parallel did not show RER inclusions (not shown). In control fetal cartilage, polyclonal antibodies against COMP, used at a 1/100 dilution, revealed a pericellular expression of COMP, as has been described (Refs. 1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M.

Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; data not shown). Under these conditions, staining of the articular cartilage from a patient with PSACH (R68-29) showed intense intracellular staining of the cells, suggesting that COMP protein is contained in the RER inclusions (not shown). However, at this high antiserum concentration, we and others (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg Å. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Carlson C.S. Pasumarti S. Paulsson M. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) observed background intracellular staining in control cells. We therefore repeated the experiment at a lower concentration of antiserum (1/1000). Under these conditions too, strong intracellular staining was detected inside patient chondrocytes, but not controls, indicating that the RER inclusions contain COMP (Fig. 5). A similar result was obtained with cartilage from two other PSACH patients (R68-29 and R92-58) (not shown). Immunostaining with antibodies against other extracellular matrix proteins showed strong intracellular staining of patient cartilage with anti-type IX collagen antibodies, but anti-aggrecan or anti-type II collagen antibodies did not stain above control levels (Fig. 5). COMP is a pentameric glycoprotein of the cartilage extracellular matrix responsible, when abnormal, for two autosomal dominant human skeletal dysplasias, PSACH and MED. COMP expression is limited to few, poorly accessible, tissues. To get insight in the function of COMP and to understand the cellular pathology of PSACH and MED, we have established an in vitro cell culture model to study the metabolism of the normal and mutant proteins. Chondrocytes isolated from adult or fetal cartilage, grown in monolayer, synthesized and secreted pentameric COMP. Since chondrocytes are known to dedifferentiate quickly when grown in monolayer, results obtained in such cell cultures need to be cautiously interpreted. We therefore examined two other cell types, tendon and ligament cells, which are fibroblast-type cells. Both cell types expressed COMP, confirming, in humans, tendon as a source of this protein (19Hauser N. Paulsson M. Kale A.A. DiCesare P.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Smith R.K.W. Zunino L. Webbon P.M. Heinegård D. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Expression of COMP by ligament cells may be relevant to the joint laxity observed in PSACH patients. Synthesis of COMP was dramatically increased by treatment of the cells with a growth factor known to affect bone and cartilage growth, TGF-β1 (28Recklies A.D. Baillargeon L. White C. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In all three cell types, the pentameric form of COMP was detected in the supernatant as well as inside the cells. The much greater affinity of the available antibody for the pentamer than for the monomer doesn't allow us to rule out the presence of low levels of free monomer. However, the intracellular presence of pentamer suggests that pentamerization of COMP is an intracellular process. This result is similar to what has been observed for another protein of the thrombospondin family, thrombospondin-1, which co-translationally assembles into trimers within the lumen of the RER (32Prabakaran D. Kim P.S. Dixit V.M. Arvan P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 134-141PubMed Google Scholar). In patients with PSACH and MED, all COMP mutations are found in the calmodulin-like or the C-terminal domain. One can therefore predict that, if patients express abnormal monomers, these may be incorporated into pentamers before the mutant region is translated and before the molecule could be detected as abnormal by the cell. This further implies that a secretion defect in patients would operate at the level of the pentamer. We subsequently tested patient cells of similar tissue origin with the goal of studying how the mutations affect the metabolism and function of COMP. Since MED and PSACH are inherited in an autosomal dominant mode, the pathologies could be caused by either haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative effect. Because both the normal and mutant alleles were expressed at similar levels in the patient cell cultures, we expect that the mutant RNA is stably expressed and likely to be translated. This suggests that the cells are not functionally haploinsufficient for COMP and that the mutations are pathologic, at least in part, through a dominant negative effect, due to incorporation of one or more abnormal monomers into COMP pentamers. In addition, we observed no dramatic quantitative secretion defect of COMP in cultured cells from patients with COMP mutations. This suggests that the cells in culture are able to secrete abnormal pentamers, supporting the hypothesis that COMP mutations in PSACH and MED exert their phenotypic effect through a dominant negative mechanism. If this also proves true in vivo, it implies that abnormal COMP is present in the matrix, but is not able to perform its normal function. The biochemical data supporting a dominant negative model are also compatible with the molecular genetic data. A priori, haploinsufficiency is an unlikely mechanism, since it would be difficult to understand how different point mutations in the COMP gene could cause two distinct phenotypes (9Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M.G. King L.M. Olsen A.S. Mohrenweiser H. Leroy J.G. Mortier G.R. Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Gaines E.S. Cekleniak J.A. Knowlton R.G. Cohn D.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Also, truly genetically haploinsufficient patients have never been described. In a panel of PSACH patients in which all mutations have been identified, none had either nonsense mutations predicted to lead to a truncated protein or genomic deletion of COMP. 4D. H. Cohn, M. D. Briggs, and L. M. King, manuscript in preparation. It is entirely plausible that the different mutations could affect different aspects of the function or structure of COMP, for instance altering COMP-matrix interactions or COMP-chondrocyte binding, and produce different phenotypic consequences. We observed that cultured patient cells show RER inclusions, similar to those observed in vivo, after several weeks in culture. These data suggest that, in addition to the dominant negative effects of COMP mutations, there is also impaired secretion of the abnormal pentamers and therefore a reduction of the amount of COMP in the extracellular matrix. Staining of the retained material with antibodies against COMP and type IX collagen has been demonstrated in one recently reported PSACH patient (23Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and in three PSACH patients with COMP mutations described here. Thus intracellular retention of both COMP and type IX collagen is a general characteristic of PSACH, and reduced amounts of these two proteins in the matrix may contribute to the disease. Absence of inclusion staining with anti-aggrecan and anti-type II procollagen antibodies in our patients suggests that retention is specific and that COMP retention does not lead to a general deficit in protein secretion by chondrocytes. Although our data, both in vitro and in vivo, identify RER inclusions in chondrocytes, there also appears to be some anti-COMP antibody staining of the cartilage matrix of patients. This suggests that the abnormal COMP allele contributes to the matrixin vivo. While this finding may be in contrast to data suggesting absence of COMP in the cartilage matrix of one PSACH patient (23Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), differences in antibodies and techniques may provide an explanation for the discrepancy. Another interesting finding of the paper by Maddox et al. (23Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bächinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) is the fact that, in contrast to chondrocytes, patient tendon cells seem to be able to secrete COMP into the extracellular matrix. It will be critical, when more tendon tissue from patients becomes available, to determine by electron microscopy whether tendon shows RER inclusions similar to those in cartilage. In conclusion, our current model for the pathology of the COMP disorders is the combined effects of abnormal COMP in the matrix and poor secretion of abnormal pentamers by chondrocytes and other cell types that express COMP. At least in vitro, and possiblyin vivo, inclusions in the RER appear to develop slowly over time. We hypothesize that retention of structurally abnormal COMP leads to secondary retention of other matrix proteins, including type IX collagen, perhaps because they normally interact with COMP. This possibility was also suggested by the observation that MED can also result from mutations in COL9A2 (11Muragaki Y. Mariman E.C. van Beersum S.E. Perala M. van Mourik J.B. Warman M.L. Olsen B.E.

Determining the relative importance of the qualitative and quantitative defects in COMP biosynthesis on disease pathology will require a better understanding of the role of COMP in the matrix and how its specific functions are disrupted by mutations. The availability of cultured cells as anin vitro model can now be used to explore the various functions of COMP, including calcium binding, interaction with chondrocytes, and binding to other extracellular matrix components, as well as the effect of mutations on these properties.

https://openalex.org/W1979560481,"The two gene-duplicated cAMP binding domains in the regulatory subunits of cAMP dependent protein kinase are each comprised of an A helix, an eight-stranded β-barrel, and a B and C helix (1Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The A domain is required for high affinity binding to C, while the B domain regulates access to the A domain. Using a combination of a yeast two-hybrid screen coupled with deletion analysis, cAMP binding domain A of RI was dissected into two structurally and functionally distinct subsites, one that binds cAMP and another that binds the C subunit. The minimum stable subdomain required for binding to C in the 1–3 micromolar range is composed of residues 94–169, while residues 236–244, mapped to the C helix of cAMP binding domain A, were defined as a second surface necessary for high affinity (5–10 nanomolar) binding to C. This portion of the C helix, due to its position directly between the two subsites, serves as a molecular switch for either a cAMP-bound conformation or a C-bound conformation and can thus modulate interactions of cAMP binding domain A with cAMP, with C, and with cAMP binding domain B. The two gene-duplicated cAMP binding domains in the regulatory subunits of cAMP dependent protein kinase are each comprised of an A helix, an eight-stranded β-barrel, and a B and C helix (1Su Y.

Of fundamental importance for understanding how signal transduction pathways are regulated is to define in molecular terms how various protein kinases interact with inhibitor proteins. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA),1 probably the best understood protein kinase biochemically, has two known classes of endogenous physiological inhibitors: the regulatory (R) subunits and the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) (2Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Both bind the catalytic (C) subunit with high affinity (<1 nm) in a mutually exclusive manner. The R subunits bind in the absence of cAMP forming an inactive tetrameric holoenzyme (R2C2). Cooperative binding of cAMP to the R subunit dissociates the complex, thereby unleashing the catalytically active C subunits. PKI binds to free C in a cAMP-independent manner (3Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar). Both the R subunits and PKIs share a common mechanism for inhibiting C. Each contains an inhibitory consensus site sequence, Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser/Thr/Ala-Yaa, where Xaa is any amino acid and Yaa is a hydrophobic residue (4Zetterqvist Ö. Z. Ragnarsson U. Engstrom L. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 171-187Google Scholar). This pentapeptide resembles a substrate or inhibitor and binds to the active site cleft of the C subunit (3Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar, 5Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar,6Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3491-3497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKI and R are thus competitive inhibitors. In addition to serving as inhibitors of C, however, PKI and the R subunits share other common features. Both are modular proteins, and both play roles in subcellular localization; neither is solely an inhibitor of C. PKI, for example, in addition to its inhibitor site at the N terminus (3Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar), has near its C terminus a nuclear export signal that is capable of actively shuttling the C·PKI complex out of the nucleus (7Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The R subunits are also modular proteins composed of several distinct, well defined, and stable domains (Fig. 1). At the N terminus is a dimerization/docking domain that not only maintains the R subunits as a stable dimer but also provides a surface that docks to a variety of A kinase anchoring proteins, thereby localizing the enzyme to specific subsites within the cell (8Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The “hinge” region that follows the dimerization/docking domain contains the consensus site sequence that binds to the active site cleft of C in the absence of cAMP. At the C terminus are two tandem gene-duplicated cAMP binding domains. Although each has a functional cAMP binding site, the two domains serve distinct roles. cAMP binding domain A interacts directly with the C subunit and is essential for high affinity binding to C, whereas cAMP binding domain B is not (9Saraswat L.D. Ringheim G.E. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18241-18246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, its role is to modulate access of cAMP to domain A and to contribute cooperativity to the activation process. In the holoenzyme, only domain B is accessible (10Øgreid D. Døskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Øgreid D. Døskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). cAMP thus binds first to domain B, which induces a conformational change. The subsequent binding of cAMP to domain A causes dissociation of C and activation of the holoenzyme (47Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To achieve high affinity binding to C, both PKI and the R subunits utilize a bipartite mechanism. Occupancy of the active site cleft by the small consensus site peptide is not sufficient to convey high affinity binding; additional interaction sites are required. Two additional but different surfaces on the large lobe of the C subunit, peripheral recognition sites 1 and 2 (PRS1 and PRS2), were shown to be essential for high affinity binding of PKI and R, respectively (13Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16343-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PRS1 lies N-terminal to the region where the consensus site peptide docks (5Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 14Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Mueller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), while PRS2, essential for the high affinity binding of the R subunits, lies on a surface that follows the consensus site pocket. For PKI, the recognition sequence is linear; residues 5–24, where residues 18–21 constitute the consensus site, are sufficient to achieve nearly full binding affinity (16Reed J. de Ropp J.S. Trewhella J. Glass D.B. Liddle W.K. Bradbury E.M. Kinzel V. Walsh D.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An amphipathic helix lies N-terminal to the consensus site, and this helix docks to the mostly hydrophobic PRS1 surface (3Walsh D.A. Angelos K.L. Van Patten S.M. Glass D.B. Garetto L.P. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 43-84Google Scholar, 5Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

In contrast to PKI, the consensus site plus the immediate flanking sequences are not sufficient to convey high affinity binding for the R subunits. 3L. J. Huang and S. S. Taylor, unpublished results.3L. J. Huang and S. S. Taylor, unpublished results. The binding of R is, therefore, not as simple as PKI and involves regions that are not contiguous to the consensus site. Binding of R to C is also coupled with the release of cAMP. Limited proteolysis combined with genetic engineering of deletion mutants established previously that the region extending from the consensus site through cAMP binding domain A is sufficient for high affinity binding to C (2Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 18Ringheim G.E. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Point mutations also have identified a number of specific residues in addition to and not contiguous with the inhibitor site that are important for R binding to C (13Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y.

By using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the C subunit as bait and then engineering additional deletion mutants, we have been able to further dissect cAMP binding domain A into two distinct subsites: one that recognizes C and complements the PRS2 site and the other that binds cAMP. A critical helix is also identified as a switch that bridges the two subsites and modulates interactions of this domain with cAMP, with C, and with cAMP binding domain B. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: ATP, benzamidine, cAMP, EDTA, MOPS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, and GST-agarose resin, from Sigma; nickel-NTA resin from Qiagen; urea, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside and enzymes used for DNA manipulations from Life Technologies, Inc.; and a DNA sequencing kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp. The peptide substrate LRRASLG was synthesized at the peptide and oligonucleotide facility at the University of California, San Diego. The oligonucleotides were synthesized with a 380B DNA synthesizer from Applied Biosystems Inc. A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to Vojtek et al. (22Vojtek A.B. Hollenburg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Plasmids and the yeast strain L40 for the two-hybrid system were obtained from Dr. Stan Hollenburg (Vollum Institute). The LexA-C fusion protein was constructed as the bait and was transcriptionally inactive but able to bind LexA operators. To make LexA-C, the full-length cDNA of C was cloned into the pEG202 vector to obtain the proper restriction sites and then subcloned into the bait plasmid, pBTM116, usingEcoRI and SalI. This bait was used to screen a mouse embryonic library, which was fused to the VP16 activation domain and introduced into the yeast strain L40. Transformants (2 × 105) were screened by first growing on selective medium (Ura−, Trp−, Leu−, His−), and positive colonies were then streaked onto Ura− Trp−Leu−/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside plates for determination of β-galactosidase activity. The prey plasmids of the positive clones were rescued by electroporating competent KC8 cells with crude yeast cell lysates and selecting on Leu− plates. The specificity of these positive clones was then determined by cotransformation of these rescued plasmids with different LexA fusion baits. In this study, LexA-vMos and LexA-laminin were used for specificity analysis. Twenty-two positive clones that interacted specifically with the LexA-C bait were subject to [35S]dideoxy-ATP DNA sequence analysis and then analyzed in the DNA data base (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52503) Google Scholar). Twenty of these clones coded for a protein fragment corresponding to residues 94–235 of RIα, and the other two coded for a protein fragment corresponding to residues 18–169 of RIα. To determine whether the two truncation fragments of RIα isolated from the two-hybrid screen bind C in vitro, plasmids containing these fragments were engineered, and the resulting proteins were purified as GST fusion proteins. To make GST-RI-(94–235) and GST-RI-(18–169), a linker containing a NotI site was first ligated into pGEX-KG vector using NdeI and HindIII to generate pGEX-KG-NotI. The cDNAs of RI-(94–235) and RI-(18–169) were then excised from the rescued prey plasmids of the two-hybrid system and then subcloned into the NotI site of pGEX-KG-NotI. RI-(94–235) was also expressed as a polyhistidine-tagged protein, His6RI-(94–235). To make His6RI-(94–235), cDNA of RI-(94–235) was excised from pGEX-KG-RI-(94–235) and subcloned into pRSETb. A truncation fragment RI-(94–169), corresponding to the overlapping region of the two positive clones was engineered and expressed as a polyhistidine-tagged protein. To make His6RI-(94–169), a NheI site was created at residue 93 and three stop codons were introduced at residue 169 in pRSETb-RI using site-directed mutagenesis to generate the deletion mutant (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). The DNA corresponding to the N-terminal 93 residues was then excised by digestion withNheI. His6RI-(94–260) and His6RI-(94–244) were constructed by creating aNheI site at residue 93 and three stop codons at position 261 and 245, respectively, in pRSETb-RI using site-directed mutagenesis. The DNA corresponding to the N-terminal 93 residues was then excised by digestion with NheI. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52503) Google Scholar). All fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The BL21(DE3) cell strain was a gift from Bill Studier (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). Recombinant wild type RI was expressed in E. coli 222 and purified by DEAE-52 chromatography as described previously (25Saraswat L.D. Filutowics M. Taylor S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GST-RI-(18–169) and GST-RI-(94–235) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified first on a glutathione-agarose column in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. GST-RI-(18–169) was further purified on a gel filtration column using Superdex 200. All polyhistidine-tagged proteins were purified on a nickel-NTA column in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer as described by Huanget al. (26Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Untagged RI-(94–235) was expressed first as a GST fusion protein, and then the GST was cleaved off of the fusion protein by thrombin. Untagged RI-(94–235) was then purified further on a gel filtration Superdex 75 column. The C-subunit was purified by phospocellulose chromatography and then resolved into discrete isoelectric variants on a MonoS HR10/10 column using fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by Herberg et al. (27Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Isozymes I and II were used for all experiments. To obtain cAMP-free RI subunit, purified recombinant wild type RI was unfolded in 8 murea as described by Buechler et al. (28Ji-Buechler Y. Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16495-16503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removing the cAMP by passing the solution over a prepacked Sephadex G-25 column (NAP10 column), proteins were then refolded by dialyzing overnight in 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at pH 7. cAMP-free polyhistidine fusion proteins were obtained by purification with nickel-NTA resin under 8m urea denaturing conditions. In summary, cells expressing the fusion proteins were lysed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 8 m urea and centrifuged, and the supernatant was then passed through a nickel-NTA column. Polyhistidine fusion R subunits were then eluted from the column with sodium phosphate buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and dialyzed extensively against sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for refolding. All activity assays were performed using the spectrophotometric method described by Cooket al. (29Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) in an assay mix containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. Briefly, 20–50 nmof C was incubated in a 1-ml assay volume containing 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 100 μm NADH, 6 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 units of pyruvate kinase. Kemptide (60–200 μm) was then added to initiate the reaction. The progress of the reaction was monitored continuously by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH in a Hewlett Packard 1587 diode array spectrophotometer. Reaction velocity was constant over 60 s. Values for K m and V max were determined using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. To determine apparent inhibitory constants, C (20–50 nm) was incubated with different concentrations of R mutants for 1 min at room temperature. The reactions were initiated by the addition of Kemptide. The percentage of inhibition for each reaction was plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration, and the apparent inhibition constant, Ki (app), was determined by fitting of the data to the equation,fb=[I]/([I]+ki(app))(Eq. 1) where f b is the fraction of inhibitor bound, [I] is the inhibitor concentration, and K i (app) is the apparent dissociation constant for the inhibitor. Since in these studies, various RI subunits acted as competitive inhibitors of C when Kemptide was used as a substrate, the inhibition constant,K i, can be further calculated from Ki(app) using the Morrison equation,Ki=ki(app)/(1+[S]/Km)(Eq. 2) where [S] is the substrate Kemptide concentration, and K m is the Michaelis constant of Kemptide. In these studies, the K m for Kemptide was determined to be 16 μm. Since His6RI-(94–244) and His6RI-(94–260) inhibited C readily with affinities in the range of the enzyme concentration used in the assay, their inhibitory constants were determined by fitting the inhibition curves to the equation, v/v0=1−(E+I+Ki(app))−((E+I+ki(app))2−4E[I]0.5)(Eq. 3) where v and v 0 are the measured kinetic rates of C in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively; E and I are the total enzyme and inhibitor concentrations, respectively. The true K i can then be calculated from the K i (app) using the Morrison equation. In all inhibition studies, each data point represented triplicate measurements. Apparent activation constants (K a) were measured for holoenzymes formed by C with either wild type RI or the various deletion mutants, His6RI-(94–244) or His6RI-(94–235). Holoenzyme for wild type C and RI was formed by two methods. In method 1, C and RI were dialyzed for 24 h at room temperature against 20 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 100 μmATP, and 1 mm MgCl2 at pH 6.5. In method 2, 40 nm C and 35 nm cAMP-free RI were incubated for 30 min in assay mix at room temperature. These two methods were also used to obtain holoenzyme for His6RI-(94–244) except that the dialysis was carried out at 4 °C instead of at room temperature. Holoenzyme for His6RI-(94–235) was obtained by method 2 with 40 nm C and 0.2 μm cAMP-free His6RI-(94–235). In all cases, the reaction was initiated by the addition of Kemptide followed by activation with varying concentrations of cAMP. The activity of the free C subunit was then monitored spectrophotometrically. Each data point was measured in triplicate, and the mean was used for calculation. A yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify proteins that associate with the C subunit of PKA. Using LexA-C as the bait, 22 out of 2 × 105 transformants interacted specifically with the C subunit bait in screening a mouse embryonic library. All 22 positive clones coded for fragments of the RIα-subunit. Twenty coded for residues 94–235, while the other two coded for residues 18–169. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of RIα with these two fragments indicated. Both fragments include the inhibitor consensus site (Arg94-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile98). No other R subunit isoforms were isolated, nor were any PKIs isolated from the screen. To determine whether these fragments interact with C in vitro, both fragments were expressed as GST fusion proteins or polyhistidine fusion proteins. GST-RI-(94–235) and His6RI-(94–235) were expressed in quantities about 10-fold higher than GST-RI-(18–169) and were near homogeneity after affinity purification on either glutathione-agarose or nickel-NTA resin. GST-RI-(18–169) was purified further by gel filtration to near homogeneity. In a spectrophotometric assay, a fixed amount of wild-type C subunit was incubated with increasing amounts of GST-RI-(18–169), GST-RI-(94–235), or His6RI-(94–235) for 1 min at 22 °C in the presence of MgATP. Kemptide was then added to initiate the kinase reaction. The activity of the C subunit was inhibited by both fusion proteins. To further characterize this inhibition, theK m and V max for Kemptide were measured with increasing concentrations of inhibitor His6RI-(94–235). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the fusion protein, His6RI-(94–235), was a competitive inhibitor for C with respect to Kemptide. The calculated K iwas 0.3 μm. Based on the fact that all of the constructs had the consensus sequence, we assumed that the other subsequent constructs would behave also as competitive inhibitors to C. By this criterion, all apparent inhibitory constants (K i (app) values) were calculated by hyperbolic fitting of the binding curves (Fig. 2 B). To demonstrate that tagging the fragment with GST or polyhistidines does not seriously affect the K i values, different forms of RI-(94–235) were expressed and characterized. TheK i values of GST fusion, polyhistidine fusion, and untagged RI-(94–235) were 0.3, 0.2, and 0.13 μm, respectively, indicating that the inhibitory ability was not drastically altered by the presence of the fused protein. These apparent inhibitory constants in the presence of MgATP are summarized in Table I.Table IInhibitory constants for different forms of RI-(18–169) and RI-(94–235) in the presence of MgATPProteinsKiμmGST-RI-(18–169)0.25 ± 0.01GST-RI-(94–2350.3 ± 0.03His6RI-(94–235)0.2 ± 0.01RI-(94–235)0.13 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab To determine the minimum required sequence for inhibiting C, the overlap piece of the two fragments identified in the two-hybrid screen was constructed as a polyhistidine fusion protein and characterized for its ability to inhibit C. This overlap piece contained residues 94–169 of RI, which includes the consensus site and part of cAMP binding domain A. His6RI-(94–169) inhibited the C subunit with a K i of 2 μm. This inhibitory constant was still 100-fold lower than that of an inhibitor peptide where the Ser residue of Kemptide (LRRASLG) is replaced with Ala (30Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to residues 89–111 of RIwas not able to compete with Kemptide in the assay (data not shown). Therefore, residues 94–169 of RI were defined as the minimum required sequence for RI to inhibit C in the low micromolar (1–3 μm) range. All apparentK i values with respect to the different deletion constructs are summarized in Fig. 3. As described by Herberg et al. (19Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and by other proteolysis experiments (9Saraswat L.D. Ringheim G.E. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18241-18246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ringheim G.E. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4800-4808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the N-terminal 91 residues do not contribute to high affinity binding of RI to the C subunit; (Δ1–91)RI is as potent an inhibitor as the wild type RI. Both GST-RI-(94–235) and GST-RI-(18–169), however, showed a dramatic decrease in affinity for C, compared with the 0.2 nm K i obtained for cAMP-free full-length RI(19Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To map the regions on RI responsible for this 1000-fold decrease in affinity, His6RI-(94–260) was constructed, expressed, and purified on a nickel-NTA affinity column. This mutant, which contains the entire cAMP binding domain A, is monomeric because it lacks the N-terminal dimerization domain. In the spectrophotometric assay, His6RI-(94–260) inhibited C rapidly and efficiently with an inhibitory constant of 5–10 nm. Therefore, by comparison with GST-RI-(94–235), residues 236–260 must contribute significantly to the high affinity binding between RI and C. This segment corresponds to the C helix of cAMP binding domain A. Here we chose not to compare the inhibitory constants of these mutants in their cAMP-free form, since the process of stripping off cAMP may cause some degree of structural damage in these mutants. To more specifically map the region on the C helix responsible for the 2-order of magnitude increase in affinity for binding to C, theK i of His6RI-(94–244), which lacks the latter part of the C helix and the connecting loop, was measured. The K i of this mutant was also 5–10 nm, similar to the K i of His6RI-(94–260). The region between Ser236 and Tyr244 on the C helix is thus sufficient to increase the affinity for C by 2–3 orders of magnitude. TheK a (app) for cAMP for the type I holoenzyme was 144 nm, while the half-maximum activation for holoenzyme formed with His6RI-(94–235) had an apparent K a of 225 nm (Fig. 4). Half-maximal activation of holoenzyme formed with His6RI-(94–244) occurred at 763 nm cAMP, similar to the K a of RI-(93–259) at 1.1 μm (17Wen W. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8423-8430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to wild type RI, activation with both mutants showed no cooperativity, typical of other monomeric forms of R. Since holoenzymes formed with His6RI-(94–235) had aK a 3-fold lower than holoenzymes formed with His6RI-(94–244), residues 236–244 in the C helix of cAMP binding domain A are important for modulating access of cAMP to site A. This could be due to steric interference or to changes in the equilibrium that favor association with C over binding to cAMP. Holoenzyme formed with His6RI-(94–169) cannot be activated by cAMP (data not shown). As summarized in Table II, the modular domains of the regulatory subunit all interact with multiple protein partners, whether it is another domain or a separate molecule. For example, the dimerization/docking domain at the amino terminus not only interacts with the other R protomer in the dimer; the dimeric domain also serves as a docking surface for A kinase anchoring proteins (31Dell'Acqua M.L.

In some cases, such as cAMP binding site A (the cA:A domain), the partners also differ depending on the activatio"

To explore the regulation of fascin-actin interaction, we have examined the effects of culture cell caldesmon and tropomyosin (TM) on actin binding activity of human fascin. Caldesmon alone or TM alone has little or no effect on the actin binding of fascin. However, caldesmon together with TM completely inhibits actin binding of human fascin. When calmodulin is added, the inhibition of fascin-actin interaction by caldesmon and TM becomes Ca2+ dependent because Ca2+/calmodulin blocks actin binding of caldesmon. Furthermore, as phosphorylation of caldesmon by cdc2 kinase inhibits actin binding of caldesmon, phosphorylation can also control actin binding of fascin in the presence of TM. As expected by the inhibition of fascin-actin binding, caldesmon coupled with TM also inhibits actin bundling activity of fascin. Whereas smooth muscle caldesmon alone or TM alone shows no effect, caldesmon together with TM completely inhibits actin bundling activity of fascin. This inhibition is again Ca2+ dependent when calmodulin is added to the system. These results suggest important roles for caldesmon and TM in the regulation of the function of human fascin.

Cell. 1979; 17: 285-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Some of these structures such as filopodia and microspikes are known to be dynamic structures responding to various biological signals. For example, the fertilization of sea urchin eggs induces the formation of fascin-containing microvilli on their surfaces (7Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Filopodia contain fascin-actin bundles and are actively extending and retracting during cell movement of fibroblasts. Fascin should thus be involved in the assembly and disassembly of actin bundles in such structures. However, the mechanisms for the regulation of actin binding of fascin are not well understood. One way to regulate fascin-actin interaction is phosphorylation. We have shown that human fascin is phosphorylated at Ser-39 in vivo in human neuroblastoma cells upon treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbal-13-acetate, a tumor promoter (16Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12632-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The same site is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, which results in the inhibition of actin binding of fascin (16Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12632-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Ono S. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsudaira P.T. Gnarra J.R. Obinata T. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2527-2533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the stoichiometry of fascin phosphorylation by protein kinase C is low, suggesting that kinases other than protein kinase C may be involved. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of in vivo phosphorylation is also low in the absence of TPA, which suggests the presence of other mechanisms to control fascin-actin interactions under normal conditions. Another possibility for the control mechanism of fascin-actin interaction is that other actin binding proteins modulate actin-fascin association. Our previous study indeed showed that skeletal muscle tropomyosin (TM1) inhibits actin-fascin binding (18Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4655-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that TM isolated from cultured rat cells has only a slight effect on actin binding of human fascin (18Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4655-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, human fascin inhibits actin binding of cultured rat cell TMs, depending on TM isoforms. Rat cultured cells contain at least six isoforms (19Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Franza B.R.

Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which are divided into two groups based on the molecular weights and the strength of their actin binding. The isoforms with high M r (highM r TMs) bind to actin more strongly than the isoforms with low M r (lowM r TMs) (21Matsumura F. Yamashiro M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13851-13859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fascin completely inhibits actin binding of low M r TMs but shows little effect on high M r TMs. These observations suggest that TM could control the fascin-actin interactions if actin binding of TM is high enough. It is thus possible that a protein that can increase actin affinities of TMs may be able to modulate fascin-actin interactions. Caldesmon is a candidate as caldesmon and TM increase each other's actin binding affinities (24Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol.

Sellers J.R. Liu L.F. Lin J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Caldesmon is an actin- and calmodulin binding protein (28Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the actin binding of which is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin. Caldesmon is also reported to bind to other proteins including myosin and TM. In in vitroreconstituted system, caldesmon is known to inhibit actomyosin ATPase. We showed that caldesmon together with TM inhibits actin-severing activity of gelsolin (30Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest the regulatory roles of caldesmon in actomyosin-based motility and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. We have thus examined whether caldesmon has any effects on the interactions between human fascin and TMs. We have found that caldesmon, when coupled with TMs, not only blocks the binding of human fascin to actin but also dissociates fascin from actin. Our results suggest that caldesmon coupled with TM controls the formation of fascin-actin bundles. SV40-transformed rat embryo cells (REF-WT4A) and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and 10% calf serum, respectively, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. For large scale culture of HeLa cells or SV40-transformed rat embryo cells (REF-WT4A), cells were grown in large plates (245 × 245 × 20 mm, Nunc), and serum concentration was reduced to 6%. Cultured cell TMs were purified from REF-WT4A cells and separated into two types, high M r TMs (a mixture of TM 1 and TM 2) and low M r TMs (a mixture of TM 4 and TM 5) as previously reported (21Matsumura F. Yamashiro M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13851-13859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat nonmuscle caldesmon was purified from REF-WT4A cells as described in Ref. 15Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., Ishikawa, R., and Matsumura, F. (1988)Protoplasma 2, (suppl.) 9–21Google Scholar. Smooth muscle caldesmon and TM (a mixture of alpha and beta forms) were from chicken gizzard (31Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human fascin was from HeLa cells (9Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5087-5097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant human fascin was purified as described (17Ono S. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsudaira P.T. Gnarra J.R. Obinata T. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2527-2533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), actin was from rabbit striated muscle (19Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a cyclin-cdc2 kinase complex was from HeLa mitotic cells as described previously (32Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Calmodulin was purchased from Sigma. Actin binding of cultured cell TMs, caldesmon, and human fascin was assayed in the following four conditions. (i) F-actin (final concentration, 12 μm) was first incubated for 1 h with varying concentrations of human fascin (0–3.6 μm) in 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), and then a constant concentration of highM r TMs (2.1 μm) or lowM r TMs (5.2 μm) was added in a final volume of 60 μl. In some experiments, nonmuscle caldesmon (3.3 μm) was also added. (ii) F-actin (final concentration, 12 μm) was first incubated for 1 h with a constant concentration of human fascin (3.6 μm) in the same buffer as described above, and then varying concentrations of nonmuscle caldesmon (0–3.3 μm) and a constant concentration of high M r TMs (2.1 μm) or lowM r TMs (5.2 μm) were added. (iii) F-actin (final concentration, 12 μm) was first incubated for 1 h at room temperature with human fascin (2.2 μm) in the same imidazole buffer except that either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA was included. Nonmuscle caldesmon (3.3 μm) and calmodulin (24 μm) with either low M r TMs (5.2 μm) or high M r TMs (2.1 μm) were then added. (iv) F-actin (final concentration, 12 μm) was first incubated for 1 h at room temperature with human fascin (2.2 μm) in the same imidazole buffer. Caldesmon, which had been phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase as described previously (32Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was then added together with either low M r TMs (5.2 μm) or highM r TMs (2.1 μm). As a control, caldesmon without phosphorylation was added instead of phosphorylated caldesmon. In all actin binding experiments described above, the samples were further incubated for 1 h and centrifuged at 140,000 × g (Beckman Airfuge, 28 p.s.i.) for 20 min. Both supernatants and pellets were dissolved in an equivalent volume of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and scanned with a Joyce Loebl Chromoscan 3 densitometer (Vickers Instrument Inc., Malden, MA) to quantitate the amounts of actin, human fascin, caldesmon, and TMs. Actin bundling activity was measured by low speed cetrifugation assay and fluorescence microscopy. In low speed centrifugation assay, recombinant human fascin (0–0.89 μm) was mixed with gizzard TM (2.3 μm), gizzard caldesmon (1.7 μm), calmodulin (12 μm), and F-actin (7.1 μm) in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmimidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) either in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the mixtures were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min. Both supernatants and pellets were dissolved in an equivalent volume of SDS sample buffer, and the amount of actin was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electorphoresis followed by densitometry. In fluorescence microscopy, F-actin filaments (7.1 μm) containing 10% rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin (33Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Ishikawa R. Takano-Ohmuro H. Kohama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were mixed with 0.89 μm recombinant fascin, 2.3 μm gizzard TM, 1.7 μm gizzard caldesmon, and 12 μmcalmodulin in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) either in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the mixture was sandwiched between a coverslip and slide glass, sealed with petroleum jelly, and observed with a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 100× oil lens (Plan-NEOFLUAR; Zeiss). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Blatter et al. (34Blatter D.P. Garner F. Van Slyke K. Bradley A. J. Chromatogr. 1972; 64: 147-155Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using 12.5% polyacrylamide except that the buffer system of Laemmli et al. (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was used. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (36Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). We have first examined whether caldesmon and/or TMs have any effects on fascin-actin interactions. F-actin was first incubated with varying concentrations of human fascin to form fascin-actin complexes, and then a constant concentration of TMs (2.1 μm high M r TMs or 5.2 μm low M r TMs), caldesmon (3.3 μm), or both caldesmon and TMs were added. We have chosen these concentrations of TMs and caldesmon because they saturate F-actin (12 μm) at these concentrations (21Matsumura F. Yamashiro M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13851-13859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our preparation of low M r TMs contains higher amounts of TM-4 than TM-5 (21Matsumura F. Yamashiro M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13851-13859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which explains the low actin binding ability of our lowM r TM preparation; Helfman's group has revealed, using recombinant TM isoforms, that TM-4 shows much weaker actin binding than TM-5 (37Temm-Grove C.J. Guo W. Helfman D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As Fig. 1 shows, caldesmon alone (open squares) or TM alone (open circles, highM r TMs; open triangles, lowM r TMs) has little or no effect on actin-fascin binding (compare with a control, ×). On the contrary, when both caldesmon and TMs (closed circles, highM r TMs; closed triangles, lowM r TMs) were added, fascin-actin binding was greatly abolished. Although 2.2 μm human fascin shows saturated binding to actin in the absence of either TMs or caldesmon, the addition of both TMs and caldesmon causes the dissociation of more than 90% of fascin from actin. It should be noted that caldesmon and TMs were added after the formation of fascin-actin complexes, indicating that caldesmon together with TMs can cause the dissociation of fascin from actin. In the same experimental conditions as described above, we have determined how actin binding of high M r or lowM r TMs is affected by fascin. Fig. 2 A shows actin binding of highM r TMs in the presence of varying amounts of fascin. In the absence of caldesmon, human fascin slightly inhibits actin binding of high M r TMs by about 20% (open circles), which is consistent with our previous result (18Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4655-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of caldesmon, fascin does not inhibit actin binding of high M r TMs at a concentration below 2 μm fascin (closed circles). However, above 2 μm fascin, actin binding of highM r TMs is decreased to a similar extent as observed in the absence of caldesmon. Fig. 2 B shows the effects of fascin on actin binding of low M rTMs. In the absence of caldesmon, human fascin greatly inhibits actin binding of low M r TMs. Actin binding is decreased from 100 to 40% at 5.2 μm lowM r TMs (open squares) and is decreased from 28 to less than 5% at 2.1 μm lowM r TMs (open triangles), which is consistent with our previous result (18Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4655-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of caldesmon, however, the inhibition of TM-actin binding by fascin is greatly reduced; at 2.4 μm low M r TMs (closed triangles), actin binding of lowM r TMs is inhibited by about 30%, and at 5.2 μm low M r TMs (closed squares), virtually no inhibition is observed. We have then examined dependence on caldesmon concentrations of the dissociation of fascin-actin complexes (Fig. 3). F-actin was first saturated with 3.6 μm human fascin, and then varying concentrations of caldesmon with a constant, but saturating amount of TMs (open squares, 2.1 μm high M r TMs;open triangles, 5.2 μm lowM r TMs) were added. As Fig. 3 shows, the dissociation of fascin from actin depends on the concentrations of caldesmon added. As the caldesmon concentration is increased from 0 to 3.3 μm, the dissociation increases linearly from 0 to 80–90%. It should be noted that high M r TMs are more effective than low M r TMs, reflecting the fact that high M r TMs bind actin more strongly than low M r TMs. As a control, we examined effects of caldesmon alone on fascin-actin binding and found that caldesmon inhibits actin binding of fascin by less than 20% (open circles). These results suggest that an increase in actin-TM interactions by caldesmon allows TMs to compete with fascin in actin binding. We have also examined whether fascin affects the actin binding of caldesmon in the same conditions described for Fig. 3. As Fig. 4 shows, in the absence of TM, fascin reduces caldesmon-actin binding to a 50% level (open circles), indicating that fascin and caldesmon compete in actin binding and that actin binding of fascin is stronger than actin binding of caldesmon. In the presence of either high (open squares) or low M r TMs (open triangles), however, fascin has little effect on the actin binding of caldesmon (compare with the control, closed circles). The binding of caldesmon is regulated by calmodulin in a calcium-dependent way. In the absence of Ca2+, calmodulin does not bind to caldesmon, and caldesmon binds to actin. On the other hand, in the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin binds to caldesmon, and a Ca2+·calmodulin·caldesmon complex does not bind to actin (28Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have thus examined whether actin binding of fascin can be regulated in a calcium-dependent way by controlling actin binding of caldesmon with Ca2+/calmodulin. As Fig. 5 A shows, when calcium is absent, calmodulin has no effect on actin binding of caldesmon, and thus, caldesmon coupled with high M r TMs inhibits actin-fascin binding almost completely. In the presence of calcium, caldesmon binding to actin is inhibited by calmodulin; the molar ratio of caldesmon to actin is decreased from 0.19 to 0.07. At the same time, the molar ratio of fascin to actin is increased from 0.007 to 0.07. Fascin does not bind to calmodulin, and actin binding of fascin is not regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin (data not shown). Thus, the regulation of fascin-actin binding is through the regulation of caldesmon-actin binding. Similar calcium-dependent regulation of fascin-actin binding is observed when low M r TMs were used instead of high M r TMs (Fig. 5 B). The molar ratio of fascin to actin is increased from 0.04 to 0.12 when calcium is added. Phosphorylation of caldesmon by cdc2 kinase causes the dissociation of caldesmon from actin (32Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We have thus examined effects of caldesmon phosphorylation on actin binding of fascin and found that phosphorylation of caldesmon by cdc2 kinase also controls fascin-actin binding. As Fig. 6 shows, most (more than 80%) of phosphorylated caldesmon does not bind to F-actin even in the presence of high M r TMs (lane 3, precipitate; lane 4, supernatant) or lowM r TMs (lane 7, precipitate;lane 8, supernatant). As a result, fascin-actin binding is not inhibited; about 60% of fascin are bound to F-actin in this condition (lanes 3 and 7). On the other hand, unphosphorylated caldesmon together with high M rTMs (lane 1, precipitate; lane 2, supernatant) or low M r TMs (lane 5, precipitate;lane 6, supernatant) greatly inhibits actin binding of fascin; only 20–30% of fascin binds to F-actin (lanes 1and 5). The inhibition of fascin-actin binding by caldesmon coupled with TM indicates that actin bundling activity of fascin is also blocked by caldesmon together with TM. We have confirmed this by two independent assays, i.e. low speed centrifugation, in which only bundles of actin filaments are precipitated, and fluorescent microscopy to directly observe actin bundles. Instead of cultured cell caldesmon and TM, we used smooth muscle caldesmon and TM for this purpose because the properties of smooth muscle caldesmon and those of TM are very similar to those of nonmuscle caldesmon and TM. Fig. 7 A and Table I show the effect of TM and caldesmon on actin bundling activity of fascin examined by the low speed centrifugation assay. When 7.1 μm actin is incubated with 0.86 μm fascin, about 75% of actin is precipitated (lanes 3 and 4). The addition of either caldesmon alone (lanes 5 and 6) or TM alone (lanes 7 and 8) to the fascin-actin mixture does not alter the amount of actin pelleted by low speed centrifugation. On the other hand, when both caldesmon and TM are added (lanes 9 and 10), the amount of pelletable actin is reduced to 20%, a level of which is similar to that found in the control without fascin (lanes 1 and 2). Fig. 7 B shows the actin bundling activity of fascin with or without addition of caldesmon and TM when fascin concentrations are changed. In the presence of both caldesmon and TM, fascin cannot precipitate F-actin in low speed centrifugation even at high fascin concentrations (closed circles). In the absence of caldesmon and TM (control, open circles), on the other hand, about 75% of F-actin is precipitated by 0.86 μm fascin. These results indicate that the bundling activity of fascin is almost completely blocked by the addition of both caldesmon and TM just as actin binding activity of fascin is inhibited by caldesmon coupled with TM.Table IRegulation of fascin-actin bundles by caldesmon and TMProteinsPrecipitated actinS.D.

Open table in a new tab Protein concentrations were as follows: actin, 7.1 μm; fascin, 0.89 μm; tropomyosin, 2.3 μm; caldesmon, 1.7 μm; calmodulin, 12 μm; in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 mm imidazole-Cl (pH 7.0). Solutions were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. To further confirm the inhibition, we have directly observed the fluorescently labeled actin-fascin bundles (Fig. 8). In the absence of fascin, no actin bundles are observed (Fig. 8 A). When fascin is mixed with actin filaments, very thick F-actin bundles are formed (Fig. 8 C). Similar bundles are observed when caldesmon alone (Fig. 8 D) or TM alone (Fig. 8 E) is added to fascin-actin mixtures. On the contrary, when fascin is mixed with F-actin in the presence of both caldesmon and TM, no such bundles but very thin filaments are observed (Fig. 8 F). These thin filaments seem to represent bundles consisting of a few actin filaments. These observations are consistent with the results obtained by the low speed centrifugation assay described above. The fluorescent microscopy method has allowed us to examine how quickly caldesmon coupled with TM can disassemble preformed fascin-actin bundles. The disassembly of fascin-actin bundles occurs rather quickly. Within 3 min, roughly 80% of thick fascin-actin bundles disappear; in 20 min, no such bundles are observed. Ca2+/calmodulin can regulate the actin binding activity of fascin when both TM and caldesmon are present. It is thus expected that Ca2+/calmodulin also controls the actin bundling activity of fascin in the presence of caldesmon and TM. As Fig. 9 A and Table I show, fascin precipitates only 16% of actin filaments when caldesmon, TM, and calmodulin are present in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (lanes 1 and 2). This level of actin precipitation is comparable with that in the absence of fascin, indicating that caldesmon coupled with TM and calmodulin inhibits the actin bundling activity in the absence of Ca2+. Again, very thin filaments were observed by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 9 B), which is similar to those shown in the absence of calmodulin (see Fig. 8 F). When EGTA is replaced with CaCl2, the amount of precipitated actin increases to 54% (lanes 3 and 4). Fluorescent microscopy has revealed the appearance of thick actin bundles (Fig. 9 C). These results confirm that calmodulin together with caldesmon and TM can confer Ca2+ sensitivity to the actin bundling activity of fascin. We have revealed that caldesmon coupled with cultured cell TM inhibits actin binding and bundling activities of fascin. Our results suggest a possible mechanism that caldesmon together with TM regulates the assembly and disassembly of actin bundles present in filopodia, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers. In fact, all three proteins are, at least to some extent, colocalized in cultured cells. Caldesmon is known to be present in stress fibers, as well as membrane ruffles (26Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,39Koji-Owada M. Hakura A. Iida K. Yahara I. Sobue K. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fascin is localized in filopodia, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers (1Edwards R.A. Bryan J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Biol.

Hayashi K. Shirao T. Ishikawa R. Kohama K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although high M r TMs are found only in stress fibers, low M r TMs are reported to be localized in the membrane periphery including membrane ruffles (37Temm-Grove C.J. Guo W. Helfman D.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 33: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Lin J.J. Hegmann T.E. Lin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is worthy of note that the disassembly of fascin-actin bundles by caldesmon and TM occurs very rapidly, within 3 min. Because actin bundling by fascin is also a rapid reaction, these results suggest that caldesmon together with TM could control the formation of filopodia, which is known to be a very dynamic structure. We have also shown that calmodulin together with caldesmon and TM confers Ca2+sensitivity to the inhibition of fascin's actin bundling activity. This regulation may work in some of Ca2+-mediated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. For example, sea urchin eggs show the elongation of fascin-containing microvilli on the surface upon fertilization (7Otto J.J. Kane R.E. Bryan J. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Steinhardt R. Zucker R. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 1977; 58: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Because fertilization is accompanied by an increase in Ca2+ concentration, it is possible that a calmodulin-caldesmon-TM system is involved in the formation of fascin-actin bundles of microvilli, although caldesmon has not yet been identified in sea urchin eggs. Our results indicate that fascin competes with TM and caldesmon for actin binding and that the binding affinity of each protein for actin seems to be a major factor to determine which protein is dissociated from actin. For example, fascin (K a = 5–7 × 106m−1, Ref. 16Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12632-12638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) greatly inhibits actin binding of low M r TMs (K a = 3–4 × 105m−1, Ref. 15Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., Ishikawa, R., and Matsumura, F. (1988)Protoplasma 2, (suppl.) 9–21Google Scholar) but decreases actin binding of high M r TMs (K a = 5–7 × 106m−1, Ref. 15Yamashiro-Matsumura, S., Ishikawa, R., and Matsumura, F. (1988)Protoplasma 2, (suppl.) 9–21Google Scholar) by only 20%. These TM isoforms cannot dissociate fascin from actin. On the other hand, we have previously shown that skeletal muscle TM (K a = 0.5–1 × 107m−1, see Ref. 43Urbancikova M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24310-24315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can dissociate fascin from actin, whereas fascin cannot dissociate skeletal muscle TM from actin (18Matsumura F. Yamashiro-Matsumura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4655-4659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results correlate well with the fact that lowM r TMs show the lowest affinity, whereas skeletal muscle TM has the highest among these TM isoforms. Furthermore, the result that caldesmon coupled with TM can dissociate fascin-actin complexes is explained by the fact that caldesmon and TM increases each other's actin binding. The apparent binding constants become one order higher (24Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9602-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Novy R.E. Sellers J.R. Liu L.F. Lin J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recent structural study by Lehman et al. (44Lehman W. Vibert P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the binding site of caldesmon is shared with many actin binding proteins. Indeed, two of the major binding sites of gelsolin are shared with the binding sites of caldesmon and TM, which explains our previous results that caldesmon together with TM inhibits severing action of gelsolin (30Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16764-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps, fascin also shares the binding sites on actin with caldesmon and TM. However, it is worthy of note that high M r TMs or caldesmon can still bind to actin, which is almost saturated with fascin, suggesting that the binding site of fascin on actin is not entirely the same as those of caldesmon and TM. The partial overlap of actin binding sites may explain why the dissociation of fascin-actin bundles is rapid. If the actin binding sites of these proteins completely overlap, then the binding of the second protein to actin will only occur after the dissociation of the first protein from actin. It is also possible that the simultaneous binding of TM and caldesmon may shift the binding sites of TM and caldesmon in such a way that TM and caldesmon can compete better with fascin for actin binding. Indeed, the three-dimensional reconstruction study (44Lehman W. Vibert P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has suggested that caldesmon seems to induce movement of TM. The functions of fascin seem to contrast with those of caldesmon. There is an increasing body of evidence showing that caldesmon stabilizes microfilaments in nonmuscle cells (28Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), probably by increasing actin binding of TM (24Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 116-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Velaz L. Hemric M.E. Benson C.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol.

Sellers J.R. Liu L.F. Lin J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In vitro, caldesmon and TM combined inhibit both the actin-severing and actin-capping activities of gelsolin, even in the presence of Ca2+ (30Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16764-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of caldesmon in vivo leads to the stabilization of microfilaments (46Warren K.S. Lin J.L. Wamboldt D.D. Lin J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 47Warren K.S. Shutt D.C. McDermott J.P. Lin J.L. Soll D.R. Lin J.J. Cell Motil.

Conversely, inhibition of caldesmon via microinjection of specific caldesmon antibody results in the disruption of microfilaments (49Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Mezgueldi M. Labbe J.P. Kassab R. Fattoum A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 36-44PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, fascin inhibits actin binding of cultured cell TM, when caldesmon is absent. Fascin also inhibits actin binding of caldesmon when TM is absent. Thus, fascin is likely to contribute to destabilization of microfilaments by counteracting the actions of caldesmon and TM. It should be noted that the expression of caldesmon is down-regulated in cell transformation (39Koji-Owada M. Hakura A. Iida K. Yahara I. Sobue K. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1994; 68: 7320-7328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the levels of highM r TMs are decreased in many transformed cells (54Hendricks M. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 55Leonardi C.L. Warren R.H. Rubin R.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1985; 5: 972-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These changes may contribute to microfilament reorganization upon cell transformation. For example, more fascin coupled with less caldesmon and less TM would result in less binding of TM to actin, thereby causing the destabilization of microfilaments. More fascin expression is also likely to induce more bundling of actin filaments, leading to uncoordinated formation of filopodia and membrane ruffles. In fact, we have recently shown that overexpression of fascin induces membrane protrusions including microspikes and lammelipodia (52Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many transformed cells show increased levels of calmodulin (59Veigl M.L. Vanaman T.C. Sedwick W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 738: 21-48PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible that an increased level of calmodulin could decrease the binding of caldesmon, again resulting in the decreased stability of microfilaments and increased formation of actin bundles in filopodia and membrane ruffles.

https://openalex.org/W1979295466,"After our recent findings that the amino-terminal portion of rat cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cGB-PDE) differs from those of bovine and human cGB-PDEs, we found two forms of canine cGB-PDE cDNAs (CFPDE5A1 and CFPDE5A2) in canine lung. Each contained a distinct amino-terminal sequence, CFPDE5A1, possessing an amino-terminal portion with sequence similar to those of bovine and human, and CFPDE5A2, having one similar to that of rat. Other portions coding for the cGMP binding domains and the catalytic domain were conserved. Both CFPDE5A1 and CFPDE5A2 transcripts were detected in the cerebellum, hippocampus, retina, lung, heart, spleen, and thoracic artery.

Many kinds of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs)1 have been reported as regulators of intracellular cAMP and cGMP concentrations, and based on amino acid sequence analysis and biochemical properties seven PDE families have been recognized in mammalian tissues (5Beavo A.J.

One of the PDE families, cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific PDE (cGB-PDE), is highly specific for cGMP and is involved in modulation of intracellular cGMP. cGB-PDE activity was found in lung, vascular and tracheal smooth muscle cells, spleen, and platelets (7Lincoln T.M.

Our studies showed that high levels of rat cGB-PDE transcripts were observed in cerebellum and intestine besides tissues containing vascular smooth muscle cells. Although the cGMP/cGB-PDE pathway would be expected to play important roles in various tissues, the physiological roles and regulations of cGB-PDE are not well understood. cGB-PDE has been purified from rat and bovine lung, and its characterization has been reported in earlier studies (14Francis S.H.

Chem. 1980; 255: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases has been identified in cGB-PDE (17Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine cGB-PDE cDNA isolated from a lung library was revealed to consist of two kinds of domains and the phosphorylation site described above (18McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A.

Rat and human cGB-PDEs have also a potential phosphorylation site (12Kotera J. Yanaka N. Fujishige K. Imai Y. Akatsuka H. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. Omori K. Eur. J.

In each PDE family, gene products derived from the subfamily genes and alternative splice variants have been reported (6Beavo A.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). PDE4, which is the largest of the PDE families, consists of four genes and a large number of alternative splice variants. In many cases different gene products and alternative splice variants in each PDE family show different expression patterns in tissues and different subcellular localization (6Beavo A.J. Physiol.

PDEs encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs were reported to differ in their regulation by kinases and associated proteins (27Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol.

Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Some of PDE families are composed of splice variants having distinct amino-terminal domains, which are associated with some cofactors such as kinases, and by which their tissue expression patterns and subcellular localization are specified (28O'Connell J.C.

In contrast to these PDE families, splice variants of cGB-PDE have not been reported yet. In our previous studies, the amino-terminal portion of rat cGB-PDE was shown to be different from those of bovine and human cGB-PDEs, although two cGMP binding domains and one catalytic domain were highly conserved among bovine, human, and rat cGB-PDEs (12Kotera J. Yanaka N. Fujishige K. Imai Y. Akatsuka H. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Yanaka N. Kotera J. Ohtsuka A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cGB-PDE possessing the rat type of amino-terminal sequence had not been isolated previously from bovine and human lung cDNA libraries (13Yanaka N. Kotera J. Ohtsuka A. Akatsuka H. Imai Y. Michibata H. Fujishige K. Kawai E. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,18McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K.

Furthermore, cGB-PDE containing the sequence of the bovine type of cGB-PDE was not isolated from a rat lung cDNA library (12Kotera J. Yanaka N. Fujishige K. Imai Y. Akatsuka H. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In general, amino-terminal sequences of proteins, especially in cases where they are included in signal sequences, are less conserved among various species (31Yanaka N. Kotera J. Taguchi I. Sugiura M. Kawashima K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, bovine cGB-PDE has no signal sequence (18McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is expected that the amino-terminal differences among bovine, rat, and human cGB-PDEs result from alternative splicing. In this work, we report the initial cloning of the cDNA encoding canine cGB-PDEs and the existence of amino-terminal variants of canine cGB-PDE cDNAs, which are thought to be derived from alternative splicing of the cGB-PDE gene. We also report the tissue-specific expression patterns of their mRNA transcripts and characterization of their enzymatic activities. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). [α-32P]dCTP, [3H]cAMP, and Hybond-N+ nylon membrane were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]cGMP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and [32P]cGMP was from ICN. The plasmid pBluescript II SK(+) was a product of Stratagene. The Time Saver cDNA synthesis kit and the pSVL plasmid were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. cGMP, cAMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, Dowex 1X8–400 column, and Crotalus atrox snake venom were purchased from Sigma. IBMX was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Male beagle dogs were purchased from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). Zaprinast was synthesized in the Discovery Research Laboratory, Tanabe Seiyaku Co. Ltd., Japan. To obtain DNA probes for isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding cGB-PDE, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was first applied using canine lung mRNA prepared by acid guanidium-phenol-chloroform extraction (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and a CLONTECH mRNA separator kit. The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using random hexamers at 42 °C for 60 min according to the manufacturer's instructions for the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit (Perkin-Elmer). Sense and antisense primers were designed based on the sequences of bovine and rat cGB-PDE cDNAs (12Kotera J. Yanaka N. Fujishige K. Imai Y. Akatsuka H. Ishizuka T. Kawashima K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L. Thomas M.K. Walsh K.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22863-22873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of cDNA fragments was produced using the 5′-primer 5′-AGGAATTCGAGTGGAACAAAGGCATCGTGGGAC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-AGGAAATCGATGGTACCACAGCAGCCGCTAAGG-3′ (nucleotides 738–1717 of bovine cGB-PDE cDNA) for the first amplification and the 5′-primer 5′-AGGAATTCGAGTGGAACAAAGGCATCGTGGGAC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TTGAATTCTTTGCTTGGCCATGGCTCTCTCCAC-3′ (nucleotides 738–1626 of bovine cGB-PDE cDNA) for the second amplification. The other cDNA fragment was obtained using the 5′-primer 5′-CCGTCGACCC(ATC)AT(ATC)AA(AG)AA(CT)GG(ATCG)AA(AG)AA(AG)AA(CT)AA-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-GGGAGCTCGA(ACG)AGATCACA(AG)GC(TAG)GTCAT(ACG)AGCAT-3′ (nucleotides 1431–2365 of bovine cGB-PDE cDNA and nucleotides 1711–2645 of rat cGB-PDE cDNA) for the first amplification and the 5′-primer 5′-CAAGAGCTCAATACAGC(ATCG)CA(AG)TG(CT)ATGTT-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-GGGAGCTCGA(ACG)AGATCACA(AG)GC(TAG)GTCAT(ACG)AGCAT-3′ (nucleotides 1926–2365 of bovine cGB-PDE cDNA and nucleotides 2205–2645 of rat cGB-PDE cDNA) for the second. PCR was carried out through 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. Two amplified fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI orSacI site of pBluescript II SK(+) and sequenced by dideoxy chain termination methods, using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated Sequencer and a dye primer cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer). To isolate the complete cDNA of canine cGB-PDE, library screening was performed using standard methods. A canine lung cDNA library was constructed from canine lung mRNA using a Time Saver cDNA synthesis kit, λgt10, and a Gigapack Packaging Extract kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A32P random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo) was used to radiolabel the two DNA fragments mentioned above. Plaques of the canine cDNA phage library plated onto 20 plates at 1.5 × 105 plaque-forming units/plate were lifted using Hybond-N+ membrane and then screened by hybridization with the32P-labeled probes in 6 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's is 0.02% each of bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and Ficoll 400), and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C for 16 h. The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 10 min followed by a 30-min wash in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C. The filters were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for 1 day. Plaques that hybridized to the probe were purified by two rounds of replating and rescreening. Inserted DNAs were subcloned into theEcoRI site of pBluescript II SK(+) and used for sequencing. Male canines at 56 weeks of age were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital before various tissues were excised and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Total RNAs (20 μg/lane) isolated from frozen tissues by acid guanidium-phenol-chloroform extraction (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose and 0.66 m formaldehyde gels. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The RNA fractions were transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane and fixed by ultraviolet irradiation using a UV cross-linker (Stratalinker, Stratagene). A 32P-labeled DNA probe was prepared using cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of canine cGB-PDE (amino acid residues 610–756 of CFPDE5A1) obtained by RT-PCR as described above. Hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and the probe at 42 °C for 16 h. All blots were washed finally in 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 1 h. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for 10 days. To detect CFPDE5A1 and CFPDE5A2 mRNAs specifically in various canine tissues, RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of total RNAs prepared for Northern blot analysis as described above. A reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using random hexamers at 42 °C for 60 min according to the manufacturer's instruction for the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit (Perkin-Elmer). After the reverse transcriptase reaction, a cDNA fragment encoding CFPDE5A1 (amino acid residues 25–249) was amplified using the 5′-primer 5′-ATGATCACCGGGACTTCACCTTCTC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TAATTTGGTCAACTTCTGCATTGAA-3′. The CFPDE5A2 cDNA fragment (amino acid residues 1–216 in addition to a 5′-untranslated region of 21 bp) was produced using the 5′-primer 5′-CCCCAACGTTCTGTGCTCGCTATGTTGCCC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TAATTTGGTCAACTTCTGCATTGAA-3′. PCR was carried out through 30 and 40 cycles for CFPDE5A1 and CFPDE5A2 cDNA, respectively, under conditions that each PCR amplification did not reach saturation. The reaction cycle was at 94 °C for 1 min, at 52 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the fractions were transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane and fixed by ultraviolet irradiation. To detect both PCR products by Southern blot analysis, a probe cDNA encoding a part of canine cGB-PDE (amino acid residues 42–150 of CFPDE5A1), which does not contain the primer sequences for RT-PCR mentioned above, was obtained by PCR using the 5′-primer 5′-AAAAACTCGAGAGAAATGGTCAATGCCTGGTTCGC-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-CTCGAGCACTGGTCCCCTTCATCA-3′, with pBcPDE5-1 as a template. Hybridization was performed in 6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and the32P-labeled probe at 65 °C for 16 h. All blots were washed finally in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for 20 min (CFPDE5A1 cDNA) or 4 h (CFPDE5A2 cDNA). Thus, signals of CFPDE5A2 transcripts were amplified strongly compared with those of CFPDE5A1 (see Fig. 4). Each analysis included canine β-actin mRNA as a control for the RNA quality and quantity among different tissue samples. β-Actin cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the 5′- primer 5′-TTAAGCTTGTAACCAACTGGGACGATATGG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-AGAAGCTTGATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCTAGG-3′. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against the poly-l-lysine-based multiple antigen peptide complex containing a 20-amino acid-long synthetic peptide of the sequence (NSPGNQILSGLSIEEYKTTL; amino acid residues 684–703 of CFPDE5A1), which was derived from a portion in common with two types of canine cGB-PDEs. The multiple antigen peptide (MAP) complex was synthesized by the peptide synthesizer PSSM-8 (Shimadzu, Japan) using MAP resin TAKO8-WTGS (Shimadzu, Japan), and then mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco) for the first immunization and with Freund's incomplete adjuvant when boosted. After immunizing two Japanese White rabbits (Kitayama Laboratories, Japan) four times, antiserum was collected, and anti-cGB-PDE antibody IgG fraction was purified from the antiserum by affinity chromatography on a protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antibody was eluted with 0.1 mglycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.7. The eluate was neutralized immediately with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and stored at −20 °C until use. The 2905-bpSacI (blunt-ended)-XbaI cDNA fragment of pBcPDE5-1 was subcloned into XhoI (blunt-ended)-XbaI sites of pSVL expression plasmid, resulting in pSVL-CB. The 4228-bp XhoI-XbaI cDNA fragment of pRcPDE5-10 was ligated into theXhoI-XbaI sites of pSVL, resulting in pSVL-CR. To generate the amino-terminal truncated form of the canine cGB-PDE, PCR was performed using the 5′-primer 5′-AAAAACTCGAGAGAAATGGTCAATGCCTGGTTCGC-3′, the 3′-primer 5′-TAATTTGGTCAACTTCTGCATTGAA-3′ (corresponding to amino acid residues 10–216 of CFPDE5A2), and pSVL-CR as a template. The amplified cDNA fragment was digested with XhoI, and then the 300-bpXhoI cDNA fragment was subcloned into theXhoI site of the pBluescript II (SK+), and used for sequencing. After the XhoI cDNA fragment encoding the amino-terminal segment (amino acid residues 1–109 of CFPDE5A2) was deleted from pSVL-R, the 300-bp XhoI fragment obtained from the PCR product described above was inserted into the XhoI site of the deleted pSVL-CR, generating pSVL-CT. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 10% CO2, and were serially passaged before reaching confluence. The pSVL-CB, pSVL-CR, and pSVL-CT expression plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells by the LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in an ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm leupeptin, 1.3 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNaN3). Freeze-thaw lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain cytosolic and particulate fractions. There was barely detectable latent lactate dehydrogenase activity (<5% of total activity) present in the particulate fraction, indicating that disruption of the cells was complete. cGMP hydrolytic activity in the lysate of mock transfected COS-7 cells was barely detectable, compared with those of pSVL-CB- and pSVL-CR-transfected cells. 5–15 μl of cytosolic or particulate fraction prepared from transfected COS-7 cells was subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 4% Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products, Tokyo, Japan) overnight, the blots were incubated with anti-cGB-PDE polyclonal antibody IgG fraction, biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and then avidin-biotin peroxidase. Visualization of bands was performed by the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PDE assay was performed by the radiolabeled nucleotide method (33Thompson W.J. Terasaki W. Epstein P.M. Sarada S.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 69-92PubMed Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 1 μm unlabeled cGMP or cAMP, and 22 nm [3H]cGMP or [3H]cAMP. The reaction was started by mixing 0.1–10 μl of enzyme solution into 500 μl of assay buffer, and tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After boiling for 1.5 min, the mixtures were added to 100 μl of 1 mg/ml C. atrox snake venom and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of methanol, and the resultant solutions were applied to a Dowex 1X8–400 column. Aqueous scintillation mixtures were added to each elute and the radioactivity measured. The protein concentration of the cytosolic fractions of transfected COS-7 cells was determined by a Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. RelativeV max values were determined according to the methods of McPhee et al. (22McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Relative concentrations of cGB-PDE proteins expressed in COS-7 cells were calculated by immunoblotting as described above. The membranes were incubated with ECL reagents at room temperature for 1 min and then exposed to x-ray film for 10–30 s, under conditions that each exposure to x-ray film did not reach saturation. The resultant films were scanned by the ScanJet 4c (Hewlett Packard) and DeskScan II program and quantitated using the NIH Image program. The optical densities versusamount of pSVL-CR-encoded protein were plotted to measure the relative concentrations of cGB-PDE proteins. RelativeV max values were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots (34Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8032) Google Scholar) using proteins that provided relatively equal enzymatic activity. The cGMP binding assay was performed in a total volume of 20 μl by a modified version of the method described previously (35Hamet P. Tremblay J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 710-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30671-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 10 μl of the cytosolic extract of transfected COS-7 cells was mixed with 10 μl of an assay buffer to a final concentration of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm 8-bromo-cGMP, 10 μm cAMP, and 66 nm [32P]cGMP (4,000,000 cpm/assay) in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm IBMX, followed by incubation at 0 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 1 mm EDTA) and then applied to Millipore HAWP filters (pore size 0.45 μm). The filters were washed three times with 3 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and then counted on a scintillation counter. In all experiments, nonspecific binding was measured by incubation in the presence of 50 μm unlabeled cGMP. To investigate whether the cGB-PDE family has different gene products and alternative splice variants, we constructed a canine lung cDNA phage library and isolated canine cGB-PDE cDNAs from the library. To obtain two probes for the isolation of the full-length canine cGB-PDE cDNA, we performed RT-PCR using several oligonucleotide primers derived from bovine and rat cGB-PDE cDNA sequences and canine lung mRNA as a template. Specifically amplified 800-bp and 440-bp DNA fragments encoding parts of canine cGB-PDE were used to screen a canine lung cDNA phage library. Because we expected that variant forms of cGB-PDE possessing unique amino-terminal sequences existed in the canine lung library, many more phage clones were screened than those used in standard methods. Inserted cDNAs from six distinct positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+). Sequence analysis of their subclones revealed that all inserts possessed an open reading frame, and that two types of cGB-PDEs were taken from one canine lung cDNA library. Five of six clones carried a unique amino-terminal sequence similar to those of bovine and human cGB-PDEs, and the other possessed one similar to that of rat cGB-PDE. The bovine type of canine cGB-PDE cDNA encoded by pBcPDE5-1 was found to be 2905 bp in length and had an open reading frame of 2595 bp. The rat type cGB-PDE carried by pRcPDE5-10 was 4228 bp in length and possessed an open reading frame of 2499 bp. The pBcPDE5-1 encoded a protein of 865 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 98,292 Da, which is designated as CFPDE5A1 using accepted nomenclature (6Beavo A.J. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar), and pRcPDE5-10 encoded a protein, CFPDE5A2, of 833 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of"
https://openalex.org/W1998163769,"Nucleoside transport systems and their regulation in human B-lymphocytes have been characterized using the cell lines Raji and Bare lymphoma syndrome-1 (BLS-1) as experimental models. These cells express at least three different nucleoside transport systems as follows: a nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive equilibrative transport system of the es-type, which appears to be associated with hENT1 expression, and two Na+-dependent transport systems that may correspond to N1 and to the recently characterized N5-type, which is nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive and guanosine-preferring. B cell activators such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) up-regulate both concentrative transport systems but down-regulate the equilibrativees-type transporter, which correlates with lower hENT1 mRNA levels. These effects are dependent on protein kinase C activity. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and LPS also induce an increase in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF–α) mRNA levels, which suggest that this cytokine may mediate some of the effects triggered by these agents, since addition of TNF-α alone can increase N1 and N5 transport activities by a mechanism that also depends on protein kinase C activation. Interestingly, TNF-α down-regulates esactivity, but this effect cannot be abolished by inhibiting protein kinase C. This study reveals differential regulation of nucleoside transport systems following activation of human B-lymphocyte cell lines by agents of physiological relevance such as TNF-α and LPS. Moreover, it indicates that the recently characterized N5 transport system can also be regulated following B cell activation, which may be relevant to lymphocyte physiology and to the treatment of lymphocyte malignancies. Nucleoside transport systems and their regulation in human B-lymphocytes have been characterized using the cell lines Raji and Bare lymphoma syndrome-1 (BLS-1) as experimental models. These cells express at least three different nucleoside transport systems as follows: a nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive equilibrative transport system of the es-type, which appears to be associated with hENT1 expression, and two Na+-dependent transport systems that may correspond to N1 and to the recently characterized N5-type, which is nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive and guanosine-preferring. B cell activators such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) up-regulate both concentrative transport systems but down-regulate the equilibrativees-type transporter, which correlates with lower hENT1 mRNA levels. These effects are dependent on protein kinase C activity. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and LPS also induce an increase in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF–α) mRNA levels, which suggest that this cytokine may mediate some of the effects triggered by these agents, since addition of TNF-α alone can increase N1 and N5 transport activities by a mechanism that also depends on protein kinase C activation.

Nucleosides and some of their metabolites trigger a variety of regulatory effects in biological systems. Indeed, guanosine derivatives exert immunostimulatory responses (1Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and may trigger mitogenic effects in mature B-lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, in immature B cells (2Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar). These actions are independent of cGMP, a second messenger in B cell activation (3Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7604-7608Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, nucleosides can mimic, both in vitro (4Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2580-2585PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (5Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3452-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a T cell-like signal for B cells that enables them to elicit antigen-specific responses to T cell-dependent antigens in the absence of T cells (6Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2042-2045PubMed Google Scholar). These regulatory properties of nucleosides may be dependent on their uptake into the cell (1Goodman M.G. Weigle W.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the characterization of nucleoside transport systems and their regulation in these cell types may contribute to a better understanding of the role of nucleosides in lymphocyte physiology. Moreover, evidence that most antiviral and antiproliferative drugs used in lymphocyte malignancies can be substrates of these transport systems (7Pastor-Anglada, M., Felipe, A., and Casado, F. J. (1998)Trends Pharmacol. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar) provides additional stimulus in the attempt to identify the major routes for nucleoside uptake into lymphocytes and how these transport systems are regulated during B cell activation. Several nucleoside transport systems have been described in mammalian cells (8Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Two of them, es and ei, are equilibrative, show broad substrate specificity, and differ in their sensitivity to NBTI1inhibition. The former is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the analog, whereas the latter is barely inhibited at micromolar concentrations of NBTI. Two cDNAs, ENT1 and ENT2, have recently been isolated from rat and human tissues, and they appear to encodees- and ei-related proteins, respectively (9Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M.

J. 1997; 328: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Up to five concentrative Na+-dependent transport systems have been characterized kinetically in mammalian cells and classified from N1 to N5. N1, N2, and N3 correspond to well known transport agencies involved in purine-preferring, pyrimidine-preferring, and broad substrate specificity transport activities, respectively (8Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The kinetic identity of N4 is somewhat controversial, whereas N5 is associated with a Na+-dependent NBTI-sensitive nucleoside transport activity that has been partially characterized in human leukemia cells and appears to be guanosine-preferring (8Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 13Flanagan S.A. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol.

So far, only the human and rat counterparts of N1 and N2 related cDNAs have been cloned, named CNT2 (sodium purine nucleoside transporter) and CNT1, respectively (14Huang Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.

CNT1 and CNT2 are coexpressed in absorptive epithelia, liver, and, probably, brain (14Huang Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Coexpression of two isoforms in a single cell type may also involve isoform-specific regulation, as recently shown in liver parenchymal cells for the CNT1- and CNT2-related carrier proteins (19Felipe A. Valdés R. del Santo B. Lloberas J. Casado J. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulatory properties of nucleoside transport in human lymphocytes and immune system cell types. Moreover, previous reports of changes in Na+-dependent nucleoside transport associated with differentiation of HL-60 cells lacked a detailed kinetic analysis of the N-type transporters involved in such a response (20Lee C.W. Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Handschumacher R.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Lee C.W. Sokoloski J.A. Sartorelli A.C. Handschumacher R.E. In Vivo. 1994; 8: 795-802PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lee C.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with the detailed kinetic analysis reported in murine leukemia cells, showing that they express at least three transport systems for nucleosides, the two equilibrativees- and ei-types and a Na+-dependent system that appears to be of the N1-type (purine-preferring) (23Crawford C.R. Ng C.Y.C. Noel L.D. Belt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9732-9736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dagnino L. Bennet Jr., L.L. Paterson A.R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6308-6311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, species-specific expression of carrier proteins is also likely on the basis of previous reports showing marked differences in nucleoside concentrative transport activity between human and mouse macrophages (25Plagemann P.G.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, the contribution of the recently characterized N5 transport system may have been overlooked in previous studies involving lymphocytes and related cell types. Here we have identified the nucleoside transport systems expressed in human B cells, and we have determined how PMA, LPS, and TNF-α can modulate these transport activities. PMA and LPS promote activation, differentiation, and proliferation in a variety of leukemic B cells (26Falzarano G. Krenger W. Snyder K.M. Delmonte Jr., J. Karankikar M. Ferrara J.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tangye S.G. Weston K.M. Raison R.L. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Mond J.J. Witherspoon K., Yu, R.K. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar). Despite some controversial data, TNF-α may also be involved in B cell proliferation, by a probable autocrine loop which results in its release induced by LPS itself and by other activating agents (28Mond J.J. Witherspoon K., Yu, R.K. Perera P.Y. Vogel S.N. Circ. Shock. 1994; 44: 57-62PubMed Google Scholar, 29Boussiotis V.A. Nadler L.M. Strominger J.L. Goldfeld A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence shows differential regulation of nucleoside transport by these agents in lymphocytes. Moreover, the N5-like activity found in these cell types is also modulated by LPS, TNF-α, and PMA, which is the first report of regulation of the recently characterized N5 transport system. Human B-lymphocyte cell lines Raji and BLS-1 were used in this study. Raji is a lymphoblast-like cell line derived from Burkitt lymphoma which is cultured in suspension. This cell line has been routinely used as a model of human B-lymphocytes. BLS-1 is a parental B-lymphocyte cell line derived from a patient showing Bare lymphoma syndrome, and it may be grown attached to plates. Cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. BLS-1 cells were cultured in 35-mm diameter collagen-coated dishes for transport studies and in flasks for total RNA extraction. Raji cells were seeded in flasks for all the experiments. The specific conditions for uridine uptake in cultured BLS-1 cells were as described previously (31Gomez-Angelats M. Del Santo B. Mercader J. Ferrer-Martı́nez A. Felipe A. Casado J. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).3H-Labeled uridine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a tracer for uptake experiments. In the inhibition studies transport was measured either in the absence or in the presence of several nucleosides at a final concentration of 100 μm (1 μm for NBTI). For Na+-independent transport, NaCl in the uptake buffer was replaced by choline chloride. When the incubation time had elapsed the medium was removed and the plates were washed in an ice-cold medium (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4). Dishes were drained, and 0.5 ml of Triton X-100 (0.5%) was added. The extract was used for both radioactivity measurement and protein determination (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211821) Google Scholar). Since Raji cells grow in suspension, the uptake assay differed from that in BLS-1. Essentially, the rapid filtration method previously characterized in our laboratory was used (33Martı́nez-Mas J.V. Casado J. Felipe A. Marı́n J.J.G. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Gómez-Angelats M. Ruiz-Montasell B. Felipe A. Marı́n J.J.G. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E368-E374PubMed Google Scholar). Basically, uptake measurements were started by mixing the cell suspension with the same volume of transport medium, with or without inhibitors, and radionucleosides. To stop the uptake measurements, aliquots of the transport mixture were added to ice-cold Eppendorf tubes containing an upper buffer phase, an intermediate oil layer (dibutylphthalate/bis-(3,5-trimethylhexyl) phthalate (3:2, v/v)) and a lower layer of HClO4/glycerol (1:9, v/v). The tube was immediately centrifuged (14,000 × g for 60 s); the supernatants were aspirated, and the radioactivity of the acid extract was measured. The advantages of this technique are described elsewhere (35McGivan J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 346-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). d-[1-14C]Mannitol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was included in the incubation medium to correct for the extracellular medium trapped in the acid layer. Protein was measured in the transport mixture as described above. Total RNA was extracted from BLS-1 and Raji human B-lymphocyte cell lines and human placenta by the CsCl method, as described previously (36Felipe A. Snyders D.J. Deal K.K. Tamkun M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1230-C1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from placental total RNA using the Poly(A) tract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Then, cDNA was synthesized using the PCR-related reverse transcription system (Promega), and the cDNA/mRNA hybrid was treated with RNase H. Finally, the whole reaction was cleaned up by using the Wizard DNA clean-up system (Promega). The final cDNA solution from placenta was used as template in the PCR reactions. To generate the PCR-generated hENT1 cDNA, 5 μl of the above cDNA reaction was used. The hENT1 oligos hENT5 (5′-GGCCAGGGCCTAGCAGGCTTCTTT-3′, base pairs 713 to 736) and hENT3 (5′-GAGGCTGGCGAGGTAGCCGTTGGA-3′, base pairs 1417 to 1394) derived from the published cDNA sequence (9Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) were used. The PCR reaction was set up by mixing (final concentration) the following: 1×Taq polymerase buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm each dNTP, 0.4 μm each F1/R1 oligo, the cDNA and water to 50 μl of final volume. 50 μl of mineral oil was added onto the reaction. The reaction mix was heated to 94 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 80 °C. Then, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase was added. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1 min, 94 °C; 2 min, 60 °C; 3 min, 72 °C for 40 cycles. Finally, the PCR was heated to 72 °C for 10 min and cooled to 4 °C until the samples were run in a 1% agarose gel (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0). The fragment was blunted with Klenow fragment and ligated into the EcoRV site from BlueScript KS. The hENT1 cDNA sequence was confirmed using the Auto Read sequencing kit and the A.L.F. DNA Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Up to 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose, 3% formaldehyde gel in 20 mm MOPS and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Application of equal amounts of RNA to each lane was confirmed by the addition of ethidium bromide to the samples before electrophoresis. The gel was treated as described previously (37Felipe A. Knittle T.J. Doyle K.L. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30125-30131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was transferred overnight to an Immobilon filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action in 20× SSC (SSC, 3 m NaCl, 300 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). RNA was cross-linked to the filter by irradiation with UV light. The filter was prehybridized and hybridized at high stringency following (37Felipe A. Knittle T.J. Doyle K.L. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30125-30131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 106cpm/ml of an [α-32P]CTP random primer-labeled hENT1 cDNA was used to hybridize the filters. Filters were washed once for 30 min at 65 °C in 3× SSC and 1% lauryl sulfate, once in 1× SSC and 1% lauryl sulfate, and once with 0.2× SSC and 1% lauryl sulfate before autoradiography. Blots were also hybridized at high stringency, as described above, with a 1-kilobase pair fragment of hTNF-α cDNA and 175 base pairs of a cDNA probe to the rat 18 S ribosomal RNA, used as loading and transfer control. Nucleoside transport in human B cells was characterized in two cell lines, Raji and BLS-1. Fig. 1 shows the relative contribution of the various transport systems involved in uridine uptake (1 μm) in both cell lines. BLS-1 and Raji cells showed the same components of transport although their relative activities were markedly different. Raji cells showed higher concentrative uptake than BLS-1 cells. This Na+-dependent transport activity can be separated into two components, an NBTI-sensitive (cs) and an NBTI-insensitive (ci) component. Inhibition using 100 nm NBTI instead of 1 μm(Fig. 1) gave similar results. Although the concentrative component of nucleoside transport was lower in BLS-1 cells (∼25%), the evidence that ci transport was negligible in this cell line (less than 4%) prompted us to use BLS-1 cells to examine this Na+-dependent NBTI-sensitive transport system (see below). The NBTI-resistant fraction of uridine (1 μm) uptake may be related to an N1-type transport system, since it was inhibited by 100 μm formycin B (data not shown). Equilibrative uptake was a major component of nucleoside uptake in BLS-1 cells (about 70% of the total and about 20% of the total in Raji cells) (Fig. 1). Most of this transport activity was NBTI-sensitive, whereas the residual uptake was resistant to uridine and adenosine inhibition at a concentration 100 times higher than that of the substrate. In summary, these data suggest that human B cells show a concentrative, NBTI-sensitive (N5-like or cs) transport activity, a concentrative, formycin B-sensitive transport system (N1-like or cif), and an equilibrative NBTI-sensitive (es) transport activity. As indicated above, BLS-1 cells were used to characterize this N5-like transport activity. Na+-dependent uridine uptake was linear throughout the 10-min incubation, and thus a 3-min time point was routinely used for kinetic analysis (Fig. 2). Concentration dependence of uridine uptake either in the presence or in the absence of sodium revealed a concentrative component (Fig. 3) with an apparent K m of 11 ± 3 μm and aV max of 28 ± 4 pmol uridine/mg protein/3 min. The possible substrate specificity of this concentrative nucleoside transport system was assessed by cis-inhibiting 1 μm Na+-dependent uridine uptake in the presence of a variety of nucleosides at 100 μm(Fig. 4). Uridine, adenosine, guanosine, and NBTI (1 μm) completely inhibited the Na+-dependent fraction of uridine uptake, but cytidine, thymidine, and formycin B did not. These data are consistent with the expression of N5-like activity, as recently described elsewhere (13Flanagan S.A. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18026-18032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To clarify whether NBTI-sensitive equilibrative transport activity was related to the expression of the recently cloned hENT1 transporter, a Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 5). hENT1 mRNA was detected in Raji and BLS-1 cell lines and in human placenta, the origin of the first hENT1 cDNA clone.Figure 3Concentration dependence of uridine uptake into BLS-1 cells.

These compounds were added at the same time as the substrate. Measurements were performed either in a NaCl or choline chloride medium.

The equilibrativees component was not significantly affected by changes in cell density. PMA (Calbiochem) and LPS (Sigma) induced a rapid, concentration-dependent effect on N1, N5, and es transport activities in Raji cells (Figs. 7 and 8). The concentrative transport systems were up-regulated and the equilibrative component decreased. These effects appeared to be significant soon after the addition of PMA and LPS, respectively (Figs. 7 a and 8 a). As shown in Fig. 7 b and Fig. 8 b, the action of these agents was also concentration-dependent.Figure 8Effects of LPS on nucleoside transport systems in human B-lymphocytes.

Both PMA and LPS slightly but significantly decreased hENT1 mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner, consistent with the observed changes in transport activity (Fig. 9). After 24 h of incubation with LPS there was a decrease of ∼25% in hENT1 mRNA abundance. This change in the expression was concentration-dependent and of a similar magnitude to that found in nucleoside uptake rates (Fig. 10).Figure 10Effects of different doses of LPS on ENT1 and TNF-α mRNA expression in human B cells.

To assess whether these effects of PMA and LPS could be mediated by a putative effect of TNF-α on nucleoside uptake, Raji cells were directly incubated in the presence of the cytokine itself. Human recombinant TNF-α (BASH-Knoll, specific activity 8.1 × 106units/mg protein) induced a decrease in ENT1 mRNA abundance similar to that observed in the presence of PMA or LPS (Fig. 11). Furthermore, TNF-α decreasedes and increased N1 and N5 transport activities in a manner similar to that observed for PMA and LPS (Fig. 12).Figure 12Specific inhibition of PKC by BSDM on the PMA, LPS, and TNF-α regulation of nucleoside transport systems in human B-lymphocytes.

The inherent ability of RNA polymerase II to transcribe (CTG)17–255 tracts corresponding to DNA from normal, unstable, and affected individuals, and the normal (CGG)54 fragile X repeat tract, was analyzed using a synchronized in vitro transcription system. Core RNA polymerase II transcribed all repeat units irrespective of repeat length or orientation. However, approximately 50% of polymerases transiently halted transcription (with a half-life of approximately 10 ± 1 s) within the first and second CTG repeat unit and a more transient barrier to elongation was observed roughly centered within repeats 6–9. Transcription within the remainder of the CTG tracts and within the CCG, CGG, and CAG tracts appeared uniform with average transcription rates of 170, 250, 300, and 410 nucleotides/min, respectively. These differences correlated with changes in the sequence-specific transient pausing pattern within the CNG repeat tracts; individual incorporation rates were slower after incorporation of pyrimidine residues. Unexpectedly, approximately 4% of the run-off transcripts were, depending on the repeat sequence, either 15 or 18 nucleotides longer than expected.

A variety of human diseases and several chromosomal fragile sites have been associated with the expansion of CTG, CAG, CGG, and CCG triplet repeat tracts within the respective genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Ashley C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 703-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In most CAG triplet repeat-associated diseases, the repeat tracts are located within the translated region of the gene and encode a polyglutamine tract, which upon expansion presumably alters protein function (see Ref. 1Ashley C.T. Warren S.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 703-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar for review). In fragile X syndrome (2Fu Y.H. Kuhl D.P. Pizzuti A. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Richards S.

Genomics. 1995; 28: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that equal levels of pre-mRNA encoding up to the 3′-UTR (CTG)n repeat region were produced from the wild type and affected alleles from a spectrum of skeletal muscle and cell lines derived from heterozygous DM patients. Moreover, processed mRNA levels from the affected alleles were reduced in inverse proportion to the expansion size relative to the wild type allele. It has also been reported that the chromatin structure within the expanded triplet repeat and adjacent downstream region (which includes the polyadenylation site) was maintained in a more condensed chromatin configuration within affected DMPK alleles of three unrelated individuals (11Otten A.D. Tapscott S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that CTG expansion may decrease the efficiency of transcription by RNA polymerase II and/or moderate a downstream mRNA processing step(s). In addition, the expanded repeats may also influence the nuclear retention of properly processed DMPK mRNA (12Davis B.M. McCurrach M.E. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7388-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 13Hamshere M.G. Newman E.E. Alwazzan M. Athwal B.S. Brook J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7394-7399Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).By using a synchronized in vitro transcription system, we show that CTG expansion does not alter the inherent transcriptional properties of RNA polymerase II. However, RNA polymerase transiently adopts an elongation-incompetent configuration at the entrance to the repeat tract and transcribes (CTG)n sequences significantly slower than either random sequence or the other triplet repeat bearing templates. These and other salient features of transcription through the triplet repeat templates will be discussed in terms of the biochemical properties of the elongating RNA polymerase II ternary complex. We also consider the biological relevance of an intrinsic pause site within the 3′-UTR of the DMPK locus as it might relate to triplet repeat expansion and the disease state.RESULTSA synchronized in vitro transcription system (18Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was used to examine the effects of various triplet repeat tracts on transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II. Synchrony was established by purification of promoter-initiated ternary complexes stalled early in elongation prior to the triplet repeat tract (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purification step removes Mg2+ and NTPs required for initiation and presumably any elongation factors that may be bound to the ternary complex. The purified “core” ternary complexes transcribe mixed sequence DNA at approximately 330 nt/min at 37 °C and achieve a physiological elongation rate (1200 nt/min) when supplied elongation factor TFIIF (19Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accurate rate measurements are possible because the complexes resume elongation fairly synchronously after addition of Mg2+ and NTPs. Since the radiolabeled NTP is removed during the final purification of stalled complexes, and subsequent elongation utilizes non-radiolabeled NTPs, the distribution and intensity of the elongation products directly correlates with the distribution of transcriptionally engaged polymerases along the template. The DNA templates are diagrammed in Fig. 1, with the beginning of the repeat tract indicated relative to the start of transcription. Templates pML(CTG)n and pML(CGG)54 contain triplet repeats and flanking human sequences from the DMPK orFMR1 loci, respectively, in the transcriptional orientation found in vivo.Characteristics of Transcription on CTG-containing Templates Derived from the Human Myotonic Dystrophy LocusThe plasmids pML(CTG)17, pML(CTG)62, and pML(CTG)262 ± 5 contain human DNA-derived repeat lengths found in normal individuals or from individuals with mild or severe myotonic dystrophy, respectively. The purifiedHindIII-linearized templates containing RNA polymerase stalled primarily after UMP incorporation at template position +20 (U20 complex) also contain a minor population of complexes bearing 19-, 21-, 22-, and 24-nt transcripts (Fig. 2,A–C, lanes 1). Transcription was resumed after a 3-min equilibration at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm NTPs by the addition of Mg2+ ions, and the distribution of RNA polymerase was determined by analyzing the transcription products at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 min (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 2–6). The only apparent expansion-dependent difference was the production of discrete, approximately 210- and 266-nt shorter-than-expected transcripts in the pML(CTG)62 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6) and pML(CTG)262 ± 5 (Fig. 2 C, lane 6) reactions, respectively. Based on their approximate lengths and relative abundance, these products were probably run-off transcripts derived from templates that had undergone partial repeat tract deletion during plasmid propagation (data not shown, see “Experimental Procedures”). These data indicate that lengthening the CTG tract did not alter the transcriptional properties of RNA polymerase II. However, four distinctive features inherent to transcription of the pML(CTG) templates are worth noting.First, >50% of RNA polymerases encounter a transient barrier to elongation within the first two repeat units of the triplet repeat tract, irrespective of repeat length (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 2–5). Escape from the pause site within the first triplet repeat occurred with pseudo first-order kinetics with a half-life of 10 ± 1 s. Escape from the second site appears to occur with similar kinetics; however, the half-life was not determined because escape by polymerases from the first site complicates the analysis. Polymerase also encountered a series of more transient barriers roughly centered within tracts 6–9 (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 2–4). The pause sites were mapped by comparing the transcription products generated at 10-s intervals under saturating substrate concentrations (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3–5) to pooled time course “sequencing” reactions performed under limiting GTP (Fig. 2 D, lane 1) or limiting CTP (Fig. 2 D, lane 2) concentrations. Under limiting CTP, the additional transcripts within the repeat tract result from ternary complexes that stall after GMP insertion prior to CMP incorporation sites. The first two pause sites mapped to position +U-73 and +U-76. Base hydrolysis ladders were used to confirm these assignments and were used to precisely map pML(CTG)17- and pML(CAG)17-derived transcripts through to the end of the triplet repeat tract (data not shown). DNA markers were included as approximate length references. The transient pausing patterns within the triplet repeat tracts are summarized in Fig. 7.The second salient feature of transcription by RNA polymerase was the simple repetitive transient pausing pattern after UMP incorporation (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 2 and 3) throughout the triplet repeat tract (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 3and 4). Thus, within each repeat tract, GMP insertion was slow relative to CMP and UMP additions. Note that in contrast to the transient barriers observed at tract numbers 1, 2, and 6–9, much shorter half-lives were observed on the pML(CTG)17 template within repeats 3, 4, and 17 (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Pausing was more uniform within tracts 11–16 and within the body of the expanded tracts within pML(CTG)62 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4) and pML(CTG)262 (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 4, and additional data not shown). In contrast, mixed sequence templates produce complex sequence-specific transient pausing patterns (18Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) evident in the distribution and intensities of RNAs generated during transcription prior to the entrance to the triplet repeat tract (Fig. 2, A–C, lanes 2; see also Fig. 3,A–C, lanes 2). A third feature of the transcription reaction was the approximately 170-nt/min rate of transcription through the bulk of the (CTG)262 ± 5 repeat tract (Fig. 2 C and additional data not shown). This rate is significantly less than the 330-nt/min observed through the mixed sequence pML20 template (19Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13647-13655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth, and particularly unusual, feature of the RNA distribution at the pML(CTG)17 template end was that 3–4% of the total transcripts were approximately 15 nt longer than expected (see below).Figure 3Transcription on the pML(CAG)ntemplates. A–C, transcription products fromEcoRI-linearized pML(CAG)17 (A); pML(CAG)50 (B); or pML(CAG)255(C) are shown.

As with the pML(CTG)ntemplates, increasing lengths of the (CAG) triplet repeat tract did not alter the ability of RNA polymerase to transcribe this trinucleotide sequence. The transient barrier to elongation at the entrance to the CAG repeat tract was much less pronounced than that observed at the entrance to the CTG tract. However, a transient barrier with an efficiency and half-life comparable to the barrier at the CTG junction was observed at position +51 (underlined) within the pUC19 polylinker sequence 5′-GCAUGC. Transcription within the CAG repeat tract also generated a repetitive transient pausing pattern, with pausing occurring after CMP incorporation (high resolution mapping data not shown, but summarized in Fig. 7 A). In addition, the rate of transcription through (CAG)255 ± 5 was estimated at 400 nt/min (Fig. 3 C and additional data not shown), slightly faster than the rate observed for mixed sequence DNA, and 2.5 times the rate observed through the CTG repeats. The approximately 288-nt product in Fig. 3 C (lanes 5 and 6) was probably synthesized from the pML(CAG)44 deletion product within the pML(CAG)255 preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”). As observed with pML(CTG)17, a small percentage of longer than expected transcripts were generated on the pML(CAG)17 template (higher resolution gel shown below).Characteristics of Transcription through the (CGG)54and (CCG)54 Repeats from the Human Fragile X LocusRNA polymerase II also efficiently transcribed both (CGG)54 (Fig. 4 A) and (CCG)54 (Fig. 4 B) repeat tracts at average rates of 300 and 250 nt/min, respectively. The transient pausing patterns within these triplet repeats were more complex than those observed on the CTG or CAG repeat-containing templates (summarized in Fig. 7 B). RNA polymerase II transiently paused after incorporation of CMP and the following GMP within (CGG)54and both CMPs on the (CCG)54 template. Based on a comparison of transcript intensities at these pause sites within the first 15–16 repeat tracts (high resolution mapping not shown) ternary complex dwell times on either template were longest after CMP incorporation prior to GMP insertion. The CCG repeat tract ((CCG)11TCG(CCG)22CCT(CCG)7TCG(CCG)CCT(CCG)9) contains TCG and CCT interruptions. Consistent with the notion that transient pause sites are influenced by underlying DNA template sequence, the pausing pattern was also altered at the TCG and CCT interruptions within the CCG tract (see for instance the TCG interruption; Fig. 4 B; lane 3 at 97 nt) and within the AGG interruption within the GGC tract (high resolution data not shown, but summarized in Fig. 7 B). Transcription into theFMR1 repeat tract from either direction did not significantly alter the transcription properties of the polymerase. However, a moderate transient barrier to elongation occurred within the pML(CGG)54 template after UMP incorporation at position +94; underlined within the flanking human sequence 5′-CGCUGC (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–4). As expected, a transient barrier was also observed at position +51 within pML(CCG)54 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–5) since the initial transcribed regions through position +54 are identical within the pML(CCG)54 and pML(CAG)ntemplates (see Fig. 3).Figure 4Transcription within the pML(CGG)54 and pML(CCG) 54 templates.Transcription reactions from HindIII-linearized pML(CGG)54 (A) or EcoRI-linearized pML(CCG)54 (B) templates are shown.

These run-off products are more clearly resolved in the autoradiograph shown in Fig. 5(lanes 1 and 4, respectively). Based on previous studies, RNA polymerase was expected to efficiently transcribe to within 1–2 bp of the template strand end on linear templates bearing 5′-overhangs (20Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This population of transcripts is designated as “Run-off.” Consistent with this assignment (and also as previously reported (20Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), addition of Sarkosyl to the elongation reaction caused the ternary complexes to halt transcription 3–7 nt prior to the template end (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5). Note that the low levels of run-off transcript in these reactions were due to ternary complex disruption during preincubation with the detergent at 37 °C prior to resumption of elongation (i.e. the majority of stalled U20 complexes failed to resume transcription, data not shown). In addition, both templates generated slightly shorter than expected products (roughly −12 and −20 nt on pML(CTG)17and −8 nt on pML(CAG)17, relative to full-length) whose accumulation was suppressed in reactions supplemented with elongation factor SII (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). Lengths were extrapolated based on a DNA marker-derived standard curve and the expected run-off length as reference. These data are consistent with previous work demonstrating that polymerase may adopt a transcriptionally inactive (arrested) configuration at certain template sequences or as it approaches the ends of linear templates (see Ref. 20Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholarand references therein) and that the conversion back to a transcriptionally competent state is facilitated by elongation factor SII (14Izban M.G.

The addition of Sarkosyl to 0.3% (lanes 2 and 5) or 4 μg/ml human recombinant elongation factor SII (lanes 3 and 6) was made prior to equilibrating the reaction mixture to 37 °C. Transcripts were purified and then concentrated by ethanol precipitation. One-third of each reaction was resolved on an 8% (acrylamide/bisacrylamide (19:1)) sequencing gel run until the xylene cyanol had reached 37 cm. DNA markers were run in lane M. Expected run-off products are indicated at left and right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An unexpected feature of the reaction was that 4% of the total run-off transcripts generated on either template were approximately 15 or 18 nt longer than expected (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 4). These RNAs were absent in reactions containing the elongation factor SII. SII had essentially no effect on the distribution of the much longer “nonspecific” transcripts, most likely produced by transcription from undigested templates and/or by non-promoter initiation events (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). It is conceivable that the production of the 15 or 18 nt longer than expected products was the result of transcriptional arrest by the “nonspecific” ternary complexes. However, we consider this explanation unlikely since transcripts of these same lengths were not generated during transcription on circular templates (data not shown) or on similarly digested parental (20Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or longer repeat tract-containing templates (see Figs. 2 and 3, B and C). Moreover, run-off products generated on pML(CTG)62 also contained a 15-nt longer than expected product that was absent in reactions containing SII (data not shown).Since no oversized products longer than 2–4 nt were detected in previous work on a variety of template ends (20Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the 15- and 18-nt extensions occurred during transcription of the triplet repeat sequences. Several experiments were performed to determine if the pML(CTG)17-derived longer than expected transcripts were produced by transcriptional slippage within the triplet repeats. First, we explored whether increasing RNA/DNA hybrid strength during transcription of a triplet repeat sequence would alleviate production of the longer than expected product. A time course transcription study is shown where 5-Br-UTP (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4–9) was substituted for UTP (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). In particular, 5-Br-UMP incorporation would increase the strength of the RNA/DNA transcript terminal base pair within transiently paused complexes. Unexpectedly, incorporation of 5-Br-UMP greatly enhanced the inherent relative dwell times of RNA polymerase within the repeat tract sequence. Even after 10 min, most ternary complexes contained 5-Br-UMP terminal RNAs and were located within triplet repeat numbers 1, 2, and 6–9 (Fig. 6 A, lane 9). A similar time course performed on the mixed sequence pML20 template (14Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Gene Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 5-Br-UTP could be incorporated into long RNAs (Fig. 6 A, lanes 10-15). Using dC-tail-initiated RNA polymerase II and an unrelated mixed sequence DNA template, it has previously been demonstrated that 5-Br-UTP substitution reduces the average elongation rate more than 2-fold (24Dedrick R.L. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9098-9108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement, a similar fold decrease was observed on the pML20 template. The average transcript length after 2 min (Fig. 6 A, lane 13) was approximately 250 nt, whereas the average NTP incorporation rate was approximately 300 nt/min (data not shown). The transcription rate was also reduced on the pML(CTG)17 template (Fig. 6 A, comparelanes 1 and 4). Note also that the transient pausing pattern within the region of mixed sequence template upstream of the triplet repeat tract (compare Fig. 2 C, lane 2 and Fig. 6 A, lanes 4–6) and within the pML20 template (1 mm NTP time course not shown) was altered in 5-Br-UTP substitution reactions. Essentially superimposed over the expected transient pausing pattern upstream of the CTG tract were four additional long-lived complexes at template location +35, 49, 58, and 70 (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4–6). However, these complexes were not stalled prior to UMP incorporation sites, which might have been expected if 5-Br-UTP was inefficiently utilized as a substrate. Rather, enhanced pausing was observed at a subset of UMP incorporation sites (U-35, U-58, and U-70) and at position A-49 prior to a GMP incorporation site. Thus, there is no simple explanation for the observed decrease in average elongation rates in the 5-Br-UTP substitution experiment. Moreover, the greatly increased dwell times of complexes within the first 9–10 repeat units precluded determining the effects of 5-Br-UMP incorporation on the production of the 15 nt longer than expected transcript.Figure 6Longer than expected transcription products on the pML(CTG)17 templates were not generated by repeat tract slippage events. A, transcription reactions were performed on HindIII-linearized pML(CTG)17(lanes 1–9) and pML20 (lanes 10–15) templates. Transcription reaction time courses containing 1 mm NTPs (lanes 1–3) or 1 mm (ATP, CTP, and GTP) and 2 mm 5 Br-UTP (lanes 4–15) were stopped at the indicated times, and the RNAs were fractionated as in Fig. 2 A. B, purified uniformly labeled pML(CTG)17 run-off (lane 1–3) and longer than expected (lane 4–6) transcripts were partially digested with 1 (lanes 3 and 6) or 2 (lanes 2and 5) units of RNase U2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RNAs were immediately fractionated as described in Fig. 2 A.

The purine-specific ribonuclease U2 cleaves ApN linkages at a faster rate than GpN linkages (25Donis-Keller H. Maxam A.M. Gilbert W.

Thus, higher relative concentrations of a 59-nt A-free fragment (boldface within the sequence 5′-AAUG(CUG) 17 GGGGGAU) should be generated under appropriate digestion conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2087220242,"The mitochondrial import receptor translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (Tom20) consists of five segments, an N-terminal membrane-anchor segment, a linker segment rich in charged amino acids, a tetratricopeptide repeat motif, a glutamine-rich segment, and a C-terminal segment. To assess the role of each segment, four C-terminally truncated mutants of the human receptor (hTom20) were constructed, and the effect of their overexpression in COS-7 cells was analyzed. Expression of a mutant lacking the tetratricopeptide repeat motif inhibited preornithine transcarbamylase (pOTC) import to the same extent as the wild-type receptor. Thus, overexpression of the membrane-anchor and the linker segments is sufficient for the inhibition of import. Expression of either the wild-type receptor or a mutant lacking the C-terminal end of 20 amino acid residues stimulated import of pOTC-green fluorescent protein (GFP), a fusion protein in which the presequene of pOTC was fused to green fluorescent protein. On the other hand, expression of mutants lacking either the glutamine-rich segment or larger deletions inhibited pOTC-GFP import. In vitro import of pOTC was inhibited by the wild-type hTom20 and the mutant lacking the C-terminal end, but much less strongly by the mutant lacking the glutamine-rich segment. On the other hand, import of pOTC-GFP was little affected by any of the forms of hTom20. In binding assays, pOTC binding to hTom20 was only moderately decreased by the deletion of the glutamine-rich segment, whereas pOTC-GFP binding was completely lost by this deletion. Binding of pOTCN-GFP a construct that contains an additional 58 N-terminal residues of mature OTC, resembled that of pOTC. All of these results indicate that the region 106–125 containing the glutamine-rich segment of hTom20 is essential for binding and import stimulation in vivo of pOTC-GFP and for inhibition of in vitroimport of pOTC. The results also indicate that this region is important for mitochondrial aggregation. The different behaviors of pOTC and the pOTC-GFP chimera toward hTom20 mutants is explicable on the basis of the conformation of the precursor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2130122647,"The role of the mevalonate cascade in the control of cell cycle progression in astrocytes has been investigated. Serum stimulation of rat astrocytes in primary culture induces the expression of cyclin E followed by the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) during G1/S transition. The expression of p27, cyclin D1, and the activities of Cdk4 and Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), composed of Cdk7 and cyclin H, were not affected. Serum did, however, stimulate the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA at mid-G1 phase. Moreover, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, pravastatin, reduced cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation and caused G1 arrest in the astrocytes. In contrast, mevalonate and its metabolite, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) but not farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), reversed the inhibitory effects of pravastatin on cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation and allowed G1/S transition. Rho small GTPase(s) were geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes in the presence of GGPP during G1/S transition. The effect of GGPP on cyclin E expression was abolished by botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates Rho.

The central nervous system is a complicated organ that consists of interacting neuronal and glial cells. Examination of the control of cell proliferation in neural tissue during development and maturation is particularly challenging because of the complex and multifactorial nature of the interactions between these cells. Although much is known about the molecular basis by cell cycle progression, little is known about cell cycle regulation in neural tissue during maturation. Since proliferation of glial cells is critical in brain development and in the repair of the damaged brain after injury (1Dobbing J. Sands J. Arch. Dis.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Isoprenoid lipids produced by HMG-CoA reductase appear to control this activation process in neural tissue and glial cells. Thus, developing brain demonstrates extremely active synthesis of isoprenoid lipids, with this synthetic capacity confined to glial cells (14Jones J.P. Nicholas H.J. Ramsey R.B. J.

Moreover, a class of geranylgeranylated small GTP-binding proteins, termed Rho small GTPases, are proposed to be involved in the transition from G1 to S phase in mouse fibroblasts and rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol.

The present experiments were designed to obtain further insight into the relationship between the control of cell cycle regulators and the requirement of isoprenoids for cell cycle progression in glial cells and neural tissue. We used primary cultures of rodent astrocytes to define a system for investigation of the following questions. 1) Which cell cycle regulator(s) of the G1 phase are under control of the isoprenoids in glial cells? 2) Is protein isoprenylation involved in the control of cell cycle regulator(s) that govern the G1/S transition of glial cells? [3H]Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate ([3H]GGPP) and [3H]farnesyl-pyrophosphate ([3H]FPP) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin H, Cdk7, cyclin E, Cdk2, p27, Rho A, Rho B were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Ras (NCC-RAS-004) antibody was kindly provided from Dr. S. Hirohashi (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan) (29Kanai T. Hirohashi S. Noguchi M. Shimoyama Y. Shimosato Y. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Abe O. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1987; 78: 1314-1318PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin goat antibody, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent, random primer DNA labeling kit, [α-32P]dCTP, and [3H]thymidine were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Buckinghamshire, UK). To make liposomes containing each, an aliquot of a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (5 μmol) and GGPP or FPP (200 μg) was added to a pear-shaped flask, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and a vacuum pump. The dried lipid film was then dispersed in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Warming the flask to 50 °C facilitates smooth dispersion. The liposomes were sonicated and stored at 4 °C. Glial primary cultures were prepared as described previously (25Tatsuno I. Gottschall P.E. Koves K. Arimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Brains were removed from 1-day-old SD rats obtained from timed pregnant females (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). The brain cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic in 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes (Corning, Houston, TX) coated with 10 μg/ml of poly-l-lysine. On the 6th day, cultured cells were split and transferred to new 100-mm diameter culture dishes. In another 6 days, the population of astrocytes was more than 95% of the total cells as determined by staining with an antibody against glial fibrillary acid protein, a highly specific marker for glial cells of the astrocytic lineage (26Kimelberg H.K. Norenberg M.D. Sci. Am. 1989; 260: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Miller R.H. Abney E.R. David S. Ffrench C.C. Lindsay R. Patel R. Stone J. Raff M.C. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 22-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified astrocytes were then cultured with serum-depleted medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium(−) for 48 h before use in individual experiments. These cells were referred to as quiescent astrocytes. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined as previously reported (28Yamamoto K. Hirai A. Ban T. Saito J. Tahara K. Terano T. Tamura Y. Saito Y. Kitagawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2036-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pravastatin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Kurakata (Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan). Pravastatin was used in order to starve cells of mevalonate and its metabolites in astrocytes; mevalonate is the common precursor of isoprenoid compounds. Botulinum C3 exoenzyme was used to inactivate Rho small GTPase(s). Cell cycle phases were monitored by flow cytometry (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T.

Briefly, serum-stimulated astrocytes were collected 24 h after incubation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stained with propidium iodide using the Cycle TEST PLUS DNA reagent kit (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For whole cell lysates, the cells were collected and resuspended in cold lysis buffer as follows: 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 250 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmNa2VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 2.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.25 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mg/ml antipain. The cells were allowed to lyse on ice for 60 min. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. For subcellular fractionation, cells were disrupted by sonication in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing the protease inhibitor mixture and separated into membrane- and cytosol-containing fractions by centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 30 min). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D.

RNA samples (10 μg) were electrophoretically separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, blot-transferred onto nitrocellulose paper, and then hybridized with 32P-labeled cyclin E, p27, Cdk2, and HMG-CoA reductase probes. Human HMG-CoA reductase cDNA probe were kindly provided by Dr. S. Kurakata (Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The human cyclin E and Cdk2 cDNA probes were prepared as described previously (30Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Takanashi I.-S. Hanks S.K. Segawa K. Taya Y. Nishimura S. Okuyama A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar), and the full-length mouse p27 cDNA was obtained using polymerase chain reaction from the mouse liver cDNA library as reported by us (22Hirai A.

The whole cell lysate (300 μg/500 μl) was precleared by the incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50%, v/v) for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Assay of Cdk2 kinase activities was performed by the phosphorylation of H1 histone using the immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-Cdk2 antibody. Assay of Cdk4 kinase activities was performed by the phosphorylation of purified retinoblastoma protein, using the immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-Cdk4 antibodies as reported previously (30Kitagawa M.

Assay of CAK activity was performed by the phosphorylation of purified Cdk2-cyclin E complex, using the immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-CAK antibody as reported previously (31Higashi H.

The growth-stimulated astrocytes treated with pravastatin were incubated with liposomes containing [3H]GGPP (18.5 Mbq/μmol). The membrane fraction was recovered at 24 h and solubilized. Rho A was then recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-Rho A antibody. After gel electrophoresis, 3H incorporated into Rho A was measured by fluorography as described previously (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol.

The expression of G1cyclins and related molecules, both as protein and mRNA levels in serum-stimulated astrocytes, is shown as a function of time after serum addition in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. Cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin H, and Cdk7 were detected in quiescent astrocytes, and their protein levels were not altered by the growth stimulation (Fig. 1 A). Two cyclin E isoforms (large: cyclin E-l, 52 kDa; small: cyclin E-s, 50 kDa) appeared at mid-G1 phase in the serum-stimulated astrocytes (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the expression of both cyclin E-l and cyclin E-s was increased by serum stimulation, with cyclin E-l being the dominant form. Cdk2 protein was detected as a single 34-kDa band in quiescent astrocytes. After serum stimulation, the expression of phosphorylated Cdk2 protein, which migrates as a single major 33-kDa band, was detected at 12 h in mid-G1, reached a maximum at 24 h, and then decreased (Fig. 1 A). The H1 histone kinase activity associated with Cdk2 was also detected at 12 h and reached a peak at 24 h (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the Cdk4 and CAK activities did not change after serum stimulation. p27 was detected in quiescent astrocytes, and serum stimulation did not influence the expression of p27 (Fig. 1 A). Northern blot analysis revealed that serum stimulation increased the expression of both cyclin E and Cdk2 transcripts at 12 h; their levels peaked at 24 h (Fig. 1 B). The level of p27 mRNA did not, in contrast, change during the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (Fig. 1 B). The time course of thymidine incorporation and the induction of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in serum-stimulated astrocytes are shown in Fig. 2. DNA synthesis began to increase 12 h after serum stimulation, reached a peak at 24 h, and gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 2). The mRNA level of HMG-CoA reductase increased at 12 h, reached a peak at 18 h after stimulation, and gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the mevalonate cascade is activated during G1/S transition in proliferating rat astrocytes. Pravastatin caused a dose-dependent suppression of DNA synthesis at 24 h in serum-stimulated astrocytes. More than 90% inhibition was observed at 1800 μm (Fig. 3 A). The dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis by pravastatin in rat astrocytes was very similar to that observed in both human peripheral lymphocytes and rat FRTL-5 cells (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 241: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of pravastatin during the first 8 h of culture did not affect DNA synthesis in serum-stimulated astrocytes; however, the continued presence of pravastatin beyond 8 h inhibited DNA synthesis (data not shown). This inhibition was reversed by the addition of mevalonate also in a dose-dependent manner and was fully reversed at 0.03 mg/ml (Fig. 3 B). Mevalonate fully reversed the pravastatin-induced inhibition only when it was added during 8–16 h in serum-stimulated astrocytes (data not shown). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that pravastatin induced G1arrest in serum-stimulated astrocytes and that pravastatin-induced G1 arrest was reversed by the addition of mevalonate (Table I). These data clearly indicate that a mevalonate cascade is activated at G1/S transition and that mevalonate itself and/or its metabolite(s) play critical roles in regulating the proliferation of serum-stimulated astrocytes.Table IRequirement of GGPP, not FPP, for thymidine incorporation into DNA and G1/S transition in rat cultured astrocytesThymidine incorporation into DNAG1/S transitiondpm% S phaseControl1592.1 ± 339.73.4 ± 0.510% serum13,371.2 ± 691.814.5 ± 2.810% serum + pravastatin (SP)1956.7 ± 346.33.5 ± 0.6SP + mevalonate12,901.8 ± 597.613.9 ± 1.2SP + GGPP10,931.4 ± 609.4212.4 ± 1.8SP + FPP3745.5 ± 429.84.1 ± 0.9Quiescent astrocytes were stimulated by serum for 24 h in the presence of pravastatin (1800 μm) and with mevalonate (0.03 mg/ml), GGPP in liposomes (4 μm), FPP in liposomes (4 μm).

[3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA and the analysis of cell cycle progression were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. The inhibition by pravastatin on DNA synthesis was reversed by the addition of liposomes containing GGPP in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). In contrast, liposomes containing FPP or liposomes containing vehicle did not affect the pravastatin-induced inhibition (Table I). The addition of GGPP (4 μm), but not FPP and vehicle, also reversed the pravastatin-induced G1 arrest (Table I). The inability of FPP to overcome pravastatin blockage did not reflect impaired entry into the cells from the liposomes, since incorporation of [3H]FPP into astrocytes was almost equal to that of [3H]GGPP (data not shown). Since GGPP is biosynthetically derived from the single condensation of FPP and isopentenyl-pyrophosphate, FPP could not be converted to GGPP in pravastatin-treated cells. These results, therefore, indicate that GGPP can reverse the pravastatin-induced G1 arrest in the absence of upstream intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis. Pravastatin at the concentration of 1800 μm, which caused G1arrest, suppressed the expressions of cyclin E in serum-stimulated astrocytes (Fig. 4 A), whereas the expression of cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin H, Cdk7, and p27 was not affected. The expression of the phosphorylated form of Cdk2 and the kinase activity associated with Cdk2 was also inhibited by pravastatin as shown in Fig. 4 A. Activities of Cdk4 and CAK were not affected by pravastatin. Pravastatin-inhibited expression of cyclin E was restored by the addition of mevalonate and GGPP, not by FPP, whereas the expression of cyclin D1, Cdk4, cyclin H, Cdk7, and p27 was not affected. Mevalonate and GGPP reversed the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the expression of the phosphorylated form of Cdk2 and the kinase activity associated with Cdk2 (Fig. 3 A). In Northern blotting, pravastatin inhibited the transcription of both cyclin E and Cdk2 mRNA but did not influence the mRNA level of p27 in serum-stimulated astrocytes (Fig. 4 B). The suppression of both cyclin E and Cdk2 mRNA was also reversed by the addition of mevalonate and GGPP (Fig. 4 B). Immunoblot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions revealed that pravastatin blocked the translocation of Rho A and Rho B from the cytoplasm to membranes during the transition from G1 to S phase (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, both mevalonate and GGPP reversed the pravastatin-induced blockage of their translocation (Fig. 5 A). Ras small GTPase in membranes, which has been reported to be isoprenylated by FPP, was not affected by treatment with pravastatin. Although the effect was not as striking as for Rho A and Rho B, Ras small GTPase in cytosol was increased by pravastatin (Fig. 5 A). [3H]GGPP labeled a cluster of proteins between 23 and 26 kDa in membrane fraction of astrocytes in the presence of pravastatin (data not shown). High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the lipids associated with these proteins showed that these proteins were geranylgeranylated but not farnesylated (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation analysis of Rho A in the membranes from growth-stimulated astrocytes with supplementation of [3H]GGPP demonstrated that one of the proteins labeled with [3H]GGPP was Rho A small GTPase (Fig. 5 B). Botulinum C3 exoenzyme inactivates Rho small GTPase(s) (56Nemoto Y. Namba T. Kozaki S. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19312-19319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C3 exoenzyme abolished the ability of GGPP to reverse pravastatin-inhibited DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal effect of C3 exoenzyme was observed at 50 μg/ml (Fig. 6). C3 exoenzyme also blocked the ability of GGPP to reverse the inhibition of cyclin E and Cdk2 expression in pravastatin-treated astrocytes (Fig. 7, A and B). The activation of Cdk2 by GGPP in pravastatin-treated cells was also diminished by C3 exoenzyme (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7Effect of botulinum C3 exoenzyme on geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate-dependent cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation. Quiescent astrocytes were stimulated by serum for 24 h in the presence of pravastatin (1800 μm) and GGPP in liposomes (4 μm) and with or without C3 exoenzyme (50 μg/ml). A, cell lysates (10 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against cyclin E, Cdk2, and p27. Cdk2 activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blot analysis using specific probes for Cdk2, cyclin E, and p27 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have characterized the time-dependent expression of cell cycle regulators that govern G1/S transition in primary cultured rodent glial astrocytes. D-type cyclins have been shown to be induced earlier in G1 phase than cyclin E and to form complexes with Cdk4 and Cdk6 (35Bates S. Bonetta L. MacAllan D. Parry D. Holder A. Dickson C. Peters G.

In the present study, the expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 in rat astrocytes was not altered by the growth stimulation. The reason for this is not known at present. Two cyclin E isoforms (cyclin E-l and cyclin E-s) were detected in our system (Fig. 1 A). They differ at their amino acid termini and are derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs (39Ohtubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Only cyclin E-l was detected in quiescent astrocytes. In contrast to D-type cyclins, the expression of both cyclin E-l and cyclin E-s was increased by serum stimulation, with cyclin E-l being the dominant form. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of cyclin E mRNA was increased by serum stimulation (Fig. 1 B). This was in agreement with the reports that the expression of cyclin E in mitotically proliferating cells is maximal at the G1 to S phase transition and that cyclin E-l and cyclin E-s were expressed in similar patterns during the cell cycle progression (40Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 41Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1217-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). After serum stimulated the increased expression of cyclin E, Cdk2 was activated. Moreover, the expression of phosphorylated Cdk2 protein, which migrates as a single major 33-kDa band, was coincidentally increased by serum stimulation. The H1 histone kinase activity associated with Cdk2 was also increased. Among regulators of Cdk2 activity, the activity of CAK and the expression of p27 did not change after serum stimulation. We previously demonstrated that in growth-stimulated rat FRTL-5 cells, p27 was eliminated via accelerated degradation pathway as the cells enter the cell cycle (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y.

In the present study, the possibility cannot be excluded that an undetectable decrement of p27 in immunoblotting might be enough to decrease its activity for G1/S transition in serum-stimulated astrocytes, since the number of astrocytes to enter the S phase was not large in our system. However, Soos et al. (44Soos T.J. Kiyokawa H. Yan J.S. Rubin M.S. Giordano A. Deblasio A. Bottega S. Wong B.M. Mendelsohn J. Koff A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 135-146PubMed Google Scholar) and Poonset al. (43Poon R.Y. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) reported that the amount of p27 was constant during the cell cycle in MANCA hematopoietic B-cells and in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, respectively. Thus, p27 may serve as a buffer for cyclin-Cdk complexes in G1 phase, and cyclin-Cdks are not active until their levels exceed that of p27 in rat astrocytes. Pravastatin induced the inhibition of DNA synthesis and G1arrest in serum-stimulated rat astrocytes; inhibition was, however, fully reversed by the addition of mevalonate. The kinetic analysis of the inhibition of DNA synthesis by pravastatin and its reversal by mevalonate demonstrated that mevalonate and/or its metabolite(s) played important roles at G1/S transition. Further investigation was performed to identify a set of cell cycle proteins under the control of mevalonate-dependent regulatory pathways. Pravastatin suppressed the expression of cyclin E and the subsequent activation of Cdk2; other G1 cyclins and related molecules were not affected. The expression of mRNAs of cyclin E and Cdk2 was also reduced by pravastatin. These data indicate that the mevalonate cascade regulates both the transcriptional and the translational levels of cyclin E and Cdk2, although it is also possible that mevalonate cascade plays a role to stabilize both mRNAs. Cyclin E-Cdk2 activity was shown to depend on the earlier formation of cyclin D1·Cdk4 complexes in other systems (45Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 46Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of Cdk4, but not Cdk2, in epithelial cells could abrogate the ability of transforming growth factor-β to arrest cell cycle progression and lead to reactivation of cyclin E-Cdk2 histone H1 kinase activity (45Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In the present study, the expression of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 was not impaired by pravastatin. Activation of individual Cdks was dictated in part by stage-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (47Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the expression of Cdk7 and cyclin H, which are reported to comprise CAK (48Drapkin R. Le R.G. Cho H. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6488-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), as well as the activity of CAK, was not affected by pravastatin. It seems, therefore, likely that pravastatin suppressed cyclin E-Cdk2 activation through neither the inhibition of cyclin D1·Cdk4 complex nor the inhibition of CAK in rat astrocytes. The assembly of catalytically active cyclin E·Cdk2 complexes was directly related to the abundance of the cyclin E protein in exponentially proliferating cells (40Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 49Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). From these data, and the data described above, impaired Cdk2 activation in pravastatin-treated astrocytes is most likely due to reduced induction of cyclin E expression, and the expression of cyclin E in rat astrocytes is under the control of mevalonate-dependent regulatory pathways. The expression of p27 in the serum-stimulated astrocytes was not affected by the treatment with pravastatin. These findings were different from those of this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor observed in other mammalian cells, in which the accumulation of p27 has been implicated in G1 arrest induced by an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (50Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when we examined rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells, a normal rat thyroid cell line, to observe the role of the mevalonate cascade in the cell cycle progression, we did not observe that pravastatin also caused the accumulation of p27 to induce G1 arrest (22Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This effect was reversed by the addition of mevalonate or GGPP, but the expression of p27 mRNA was not influenced. In addition, the expression of both protein and mRNA for cyclin E was not inhibited by pravastatin, quite different from the findings in cultured rat astrocytes. Recently Vogt et al.(51Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27224-27229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported that p53-independent p21 accumulation might be essential for the inhibition of proliferation without any effect of cyclin E expression in tumor cells treated with geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitors. Taken together, these results indicate that the role of the mevalonate cascade, especially GGPP, in the regulation of cyclins and its inhibitors may vary according to cell type and experimental condition. In any case, the importance of GGPP should be universal at G1/S transition for the proliferation in mammalian cells. A class of geranylgeranylated small GTP-binding proteins, termed Rho small GTPase(s), were reported to be involved in the transition from G1 to S phase (24Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 52Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1449-1455PubMed Google Scholar). The geranylgeranylation of Rho proteins is essential for their activation since it has been reported that the activity of Rho proteins requires their attachment to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Moreover, Rho proteins were shown to be translocated to the membrane and activated after isoprenylation with GGPP, which were derived from mevalonate (53Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1984; 310: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In the present study, pravastatin clearly inhibited the translocation of Rho small GTPase(s) from cytosol to membrane, whereas the amounts of Ras small GTPase in membrane fraction was not affected. Mevalonate and GGPP, not FPP, fully reversed the pravastatin-induced inhibition of the translocation of Rho to the membrane. The immunoprecipitation of Rho A in the membrane fraction demonstrated that the protein was labeled by the supplementation with [3H]GGPP in liposomes (Fig. 5 B). High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the lipids associated with the protein showed that the protein was geranylgeranylated, but not farnesylated (data not shown). These results indicate that Rho small GTPase(s) are geranylgeranylated and translocated to the membrane during G1/S transition in rat astrocytes. Therefore, pravastatin may inhibit DNA synthesis, cyclin E expression, and Cdk2 activation by inactivation of Rho small GTPase(s), since they are not translocated to the membrane in the presence of pravastatin. GGPP, not FPP, reverses the pravastatin blockade. In the present study, we examined the effect of botulinum C3 exoenzyme to clarify the roles of Rho small GTPase(s) in serum-stimulated astrocytes. Botulinum C3 exoenzyme was reported to inactivate Rho small GTPase(s) by ADP-ribosylating a specific asparagine residue in their putative effector domain and thereby interfering with their biological actions, presumably affecting their interaction with putative target protein(s) (55Kikuchi A. Yamamoto K. Fujita T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16303-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Nemoto Y. Namba T. Kozaki S. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19312-19319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C3 exoenzyme abolished the effect of GGPP on pravastatin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the effects of GGPP on cyclin E expression and Cdk2 activation in pravastatin-treated astrocytes were also completely blocked by the C3 exoenzyme. These results indicate that geranylgeranylated Rho small GTPase(s) are essential for cyclin E expression in serum-stimulated astrocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the Rho small GTPase(s), which are geranylgeranylated during G1/S transition, are one of the essential factors to regulate the expression of cyclin E and the activation of Cdk2 which are necessary to facilitate the G1/S transition during the proliferation of serum-stimulated rat cultured astrocytes. The present study might provide a new insight into the regulation of cyclin E and Cdk2 in proliferating neural cells, an involvement of the Rho-mediated pathway. We thank Drs. T. Terano and M.

In the case of N-glycans, branching UDP-GlcNAc:α-d-mannoside β1→6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase was reported to correlate closely with metastasis (21Dennis J.W. Laferte S. Waghorne C. Breitman M.L. Kerbel R.S. Science. 1987; 236: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In addition, the synthesis of some O-glycans is also regulated at a branching step by UDP-GlcNAc:Galβ1→3GalNAc (GlcNAc to GalNAc) β1→6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 2 GlcNAc-transferase; C2GnT) in T cell activation and Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome (22Bierhuizen M.F.

In this context, it would be of great interest to know whether cell surface sLex structure expression could be regulated at some branching steps but not at the terminal and elongation steps during cell differentiation. Human pre-B lymphocytic leukemia cell lines differentiate to a more mature stage upon treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (24Sakagami H. Ozer H. Minowada J. Takeda K. Bloch A. Leuk. Res. 1984; 8: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). KM3 is one of these pre-B lymphoid cell lines with such differentiation capability. In the present study, we have investigated down-regulation mechanism of cell surface sLex expression using the differentiation system of the KM3 cells. We present here the direct correlation of a branching upstream GlcNAc-transferase, C2GnT, with expression of cell surface sLex antigen determinants recognized by KM93 monoclonal antibody (mAb) during differentiation. Furthermore, we report that overexpression of C2GnT cDNA overcomes the effect of phorbolester on the synthesis of sLex without changing other phenotypes of the transfected cells.

Guanidinium thiocyanate was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and CsCl was from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Fluorescence labeling reagent 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetomethylester (BCECF-AM) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. Human pre-B leukemia cell line KM3 was kindly supplied by Dr. Jun Minowada (Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Research Institute, Fujisaki, Japan). KM3 cells, the human Burkitt lymphoma cell line Raji, and human myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Differentiation of KM3 cells was carried out by incubating the cells with 8 nm TPA at an initial concentration of 2–5 × 105 cells/ml (24Sakagami H. Ozer H. Minowada J. Takeda K. Bloch A. Leuk. Res. 1984; 8: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of glycolipid sugar chains was inhibited by culturing the cells in the presence of 20 μM PDMP for 3 days. For inhibition of O-linked sugar chain biosynthesis on glycoprotein, the cells were cultured with 4 mm benzyl-α-GalNAc (Bz-α-GalNAc; Sigma) for 3 days. Inhibition of N-linked sugar chain processing was conducted by culturing the cells with 10 μg/ml swainsonine (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) for 3 days. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Indirect immunofluorescence analyses of cell surface differentiation antigen expression were carried out by FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) as described previously (17Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Used monoclonal antibodies were OKBcALLa (CD10; Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Tokyo, Japan), KM93 (CD15s; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan), CSLEX-1 (CD15s; ATCC HB8580), 2H5 (CD15s; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), B9E9 (CD20; Sigma), 4KB128 (CD22; Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan), SG/73 (VLA-4α; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan), B-B15 (LFA1α; T Cell Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA), DF5 (integrin β1; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), MHL1 (L-selectin; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan), and A3D8 (CD44; Sigma). The second antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat F(ab′)2anti-mouse IgG plus IgM (Tago, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Mouse anti-rabbit IgG mAb (IgM) was obtained from Sigma and used as a control first antibody. Immunoblot analyses were performed using anti-sLex KM93 mAb or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human β1→4GalT mAb 8628. Protein was solubilized from cells by a 30-s sonication in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1% Triton X-100, heated at 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to 5% or 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) containing 0.1% SDS. The protein was transferred to Immobilon-PSQ polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The antigens were stained and detected by a chemiluminescence reagent kit, Renaissance (DuPont) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a second antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM was used for the detection of KM93-reactive glycoprotein. For calculation of molecular size, prestained and calibrated Kaleidoscope molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were used. The total membranous fractions were prepared, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use (18Nakamura M. Kirito K. Yamanoi J. Wainai T. Nojiri H. Saito M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1940-1945PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. α1→3FucT activities were assayed essentially by the method described for the nLcOse4 β1→3GlcNAc-transferase assay (17Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modification. GDP-[fucose-U-14C]Fuc (5.4 μL) was added in a microtube and then dried. In the microtube, 1.68 nmol of cold GDP-Fuc, 20 nmol of NeuAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc-PA, sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8, 3.75 μmol), MnCl2 (0.63 μmol), Triton CF-54 (75 μg), and the enzyme preparation (100–300 μg of protein) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1–3 h in a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction was stopped by heating at 100 °C for 2 min. The samples were then passed through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter, and an aliquot of each filtrate was applied to a TSK gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm, TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) and separated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fraction collector. Elution was performed at 50 °C with a 0.1m acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.15%n-butanol at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Transfer of the radioactive Fuc to the acceptor was determined. α2→3ST activities were determined as follows. CMP-[sialic-4,5,6,7,8,9-14C]NeuAc (2.5 μl) was added in a microtube and then dried. Cold CMP-NeuAc (4.8 nmol), 20 nmol of Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc-PA, sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5, 3.75 μmol), Triton CF-54 (75 μg), and the enzyme preparation (100–300 μg of protein) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1–3 h in a total volume of 25 μL. The reaction products were processed and measured as α1→3FucT assays. β1→4GalT activities were assayed as follows. Cold UDP-Gal (7.5 nmol), 20 nmol of GlcNAc-Galβ1→4Glc-PA, sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.8, 3.75 μmol), sodium deoxycholate (2.5 μg), MnCl2 (0.25 μmol), and the enzyme preparation (100–200 μg of protein) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1–3 h in a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction products were processed to HPLC analyses, and the eluates were subjected to quantitation by fluorescence intensity using Gal-PA as a standard. Elongation β1→3GnT activities were measured as described earlier (17Nakamura M. Tsunoda A. Sakoe K. Gu J. Nishikawa A. Taniguchi N. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23507-23514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C2GnT activities were determined essentially as described (22Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, UDP-[glucosamine-1-14C]GlcNAc (0.4 nmol), cold UDP-GlcNAc (24.6 nmol), Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→PNP (25 nmol), and GlcNAc (2.5 μmol) were added in a microtube and then dried. MES buffer (pH 7.0, 3.75 μmol), sodium EDTA (0.25 μmol), Triton X-100 (25 μg), and the enzyme preparation (100–300 μg) were mixed and incubated in a total volume of 25 μl at 37 °C for 1–3 h. The reaction products were purified by C18 Sep-Pak (Waters, Milford, MA) column chromatography and analyzed by HPLC on a column (0.46 × 25 cm) of PALPACK (type N, TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan). The column was developed isocratically with acetonitrile/water (83:17, v/v). The reaction product was separated and determined as above. UDP-GlcNAc:GalNAc β1→3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 3 GnT, C3GnT) and UDP-GlcNAc:GlcNAcβ1→3GalNAc (GlcNAc to GalNAc) β1→6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core 4 GnT, C4GnT) activities were determined as described for C2GnT except for the acceptor substrate using GalNAcα1→PNP and GlcNAcβ1→3GalNAcα1→PNP, respectively. Retention time of GlcNAcβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)GalNAcα1→PNP was determined as a product of the reaction using porcine colonic mucosal tissue as an enzyme source (27Brockhausen I. Matta K.L. Orr J. Schachter H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). UDP-Gal:GalNAc β1→3-galactosyltransferase (core 1 GalT, C1GalT) activities were determined as described for C3GnT except for the donor substrate, UDP-[galactose-U-14C]Gal and UDP-Gal. The reaction product was analyzed as above. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium CsCl method. Semiquantitative reverse transcribed PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was performed as follows. One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT) primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). One-twentieth volume of the reaction mixture was subjected to PCR (total of 50 μl). The reactions were performed using 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0 for FucT-VII and β1→4GalT, pH 10.0, for ST3GalIII, ST3GalIV, and C2GnT and pH 8.5 for glutalaldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)), MgCl2(1.5 mm for β1→4GalT, ST3GalIII, and GAPDH; 2.0 mm for FucT-VII, ST3GalIV, and C2GnT), 15 mm(NH4)2SO4, 250 μmeach of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP in the presence of oligonucleotide primers (10 μM each) specific to the respective cDNAs. The primers used were as follows: FucT-VII (7Sasaki K. Kurata K. Funayama K. Nagata M. Watanabe E. Ohta S. Hanai N. Nishi T. J. Biol.

The results were quantitated with a BAStation Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). By extensive control experiments, the PCR cycle numbers were determined for the respective primer pairs so that the amplification efficiency remained constant and the amplified PCR product was directly proportional to the quantity of the used RNA. The selected cycle numbers were 27 for FucT-VII and ST3GalIV, 26 for ST3GalIII and C2GnT, 25 for β1→4GalT, and 20 for GAPDH. The reasons why we took this procedure instead of conventional RNA blot methods or competitive RT-PCR analyses were as follows. (i) The transcript level of glycosyltransferase was very low, and we could hardly observe in detail their changes during TPA treatment by Northern analyses. (ii) It is easy to detect the time-dependent precise changes of the relative amount of each transcript by the semiquantitative RT-PCR method. Full-length human C2GnT cDNA was prepared by PCR cloning. Total RNA from HL-60 cells was reverse-transcribed as above. The cDNA was amplified by 32 cycles of PCR in 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 1.5 mm of MgCl2, 15 mm(NH4)2SO4, 250 μmeach of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP. Primers used were 5′-TTA TTG TTT GAA ATG CTG AGG ACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAA TGG TCA GTG TTT TAA TGT CT-3′ (reverse). The amplified C2GnT cDNA was directly subcloned to pCR3 mammalian expression vector and a sense-oriented clone was chosen and designated as pCR3-C2GnT. Sequences of the insert were analyzed by the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar), and the deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed to be identical to that of human C2GnT (22Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). pCR3-C2GnT plasmid was transfected into KM3 cells by electroporation method as described (19Tsunoda A. Nakamura M. Kirito K. Hara K. Saito M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9356-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Over 10 monoclonal transfectants were selected and established by G418 resistance and by limiting dilution. Among them, a clone that expressed a maximum level of exogenous C2GnT transcript was chosen and designated as KM3c1e2. The transfected cell line with pCR3 vector alone was also established and designated as KM3m1e3. Expression of exogenous C2GnT was confirmed by PCR analyses using a reverse primer specific to pCR3 vector and a forward primer common to both endogenous and exogenous C2GnT (see Fig. 5 A; pCR3 vector-specific primer (V) and common forward primer (C)). Sequences of the common forward primer for C2GnT were the same as that described above. Differential detection of the endogenous C2GnT expression from the exogenous one was conducted by PCR analysis using the common sense primer C and a specific reverse primer for the 3′-untranslated region of C2GnT that were not included by exogenous plasmid sequence (see Fig. 5 A; reverse primer specific to endogenous transcript (EN)). The neomycin resistance selection marker (neoR) expressed in the transfectants was detected by PCR analyses. Primer sequences were as follows: exogenous C2GnT (pCR3), 5′-GTG ATG GAT ATC TGC AGA ATT C-3′ (reverse); endogenous C2GnT (22Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PCR conditions, pH, MgCl2 concentration, and PCR cycle numbers were as follows: pH 8.5, 2.5 mm, 26 cycles for exogenous C2GnT; pH 10.0, 1.5 mm, 27 cycles for endogenous C2GnT; and pH 8.5, 2.0 mm, 22 cycles for neoRcDNA, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with recombinant IL-1β at 10 units/ml concentration for 4 h, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed as described above. The full-length human E-selectin cDNA was prepared by 32 cycles of PCR amplification in 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), 1.5 mm of MgCl2, 15 mm(NH4)2SO4, 250 μmeach of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP. Used primers were 5′-AAG TCA TGA TTG CTT CAC AGT TT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAC TTA AAG GAT GTA AGA AGG C-3′ (reverse) (31Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA was directly subcloned to pCR3 expression vector, and a sense-oriented clone was chosen and designated as pCR3-E-selectin. The plasmid was transfected into COS-1 cells by the electroporation method as described (19Tsunoda A. Nakamura M. Kirito K. Hara K. Saito M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9356-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the monoclonal transfectant was selected as above and designated as COS1E5 cells. E-selectin expression was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and RNA blot methods (data not shown). The COS1 derivative cell line transfected with the vector alone, pCR3, was also prepared and designated as COS1m cells. After treatment with 4 mm Bz-α-GalNAc for 3 days or 8 nm TPA for 4 days, KM3 cells were harvested, washed with PBS three times, labeled with BCECF-AM at 37 °C for 15 min (32De Clerck L.S. Bridts C.H.

We have analyzed the requirement for conserved amino acid residues in the binding of Rab1A and the function of GDI in transport of cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Using a new approach to monitor GDI-Rab interactions based on the change in fluorescence associated with the release of methylanthraniloyl guanosine di(tri)phosphate-GDP (mGDP) from Rab, we show that residues previously implicated in the binding of the synapse-specific Rab3A, including Gln-236, Arg-240, and Thr-248, are essential for the binding of Rab1A. Mutation of each of these residues has potent effects on the ability of GDI to remove Rab1A from membranes and inhibit ER to Golgi transport in vitro. Given the sequence divergence between Rab1A and 3A (35% identity), these residues are proposed to play a general role in GDI function in the cell. In contrast, several other residues found within or flanking the Rab-binding region were found to have differential effects in the recognition and recycling of Rab1A and 3A, and therefore direct selective interaction of GDI with individual Rab proteins. Intriguingly, mutation of one residue, Arg-70, led to a reduction of Rab1A binding, failed to extract Rab1A from membranes in vitro, yet bound membranes tightly and potently inhibited ER to Golgi transport. These results provide evidence that novel membrane-associated factor(s) mediate Rab-independent GDI interaction with membranes.

To date, 3 isoforms (α, β, γ; 85% identity) of GDI have been characterized biochemically with a potential fourth isoform detected on Northern blots. While the β isoform is ubiquitously expressed, the α isoform is largely limited in distribution to brain tissue (5Nishimura N. Nakamura H. Takai Y. Sano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14191-14198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ isoform has been reported to have a unique membrane localization in adipocytes compared with the cytosolic distribution of β-GDI (6Shisheva A. Buxton J. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only a single GDI protein (50% identity) which is essential for growth (9Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrating the conserved and essential role of GDI-Rab interactions during evolution of membrane trafficking pathways. GDI family members appear to bind all Rab proteins examined to date (10Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Hubert L. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31891-31899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that the various GDI species can have overlapping functions to form heterodimeric complexes with GDP-bound forms of Rab. However, the residues responsible for interaction with divergent Rabs remain to be determined. Moreover, it remains possible that tissue-specific isoforms may be specialized for subclasses of Rab proteins found in developmentally divergent cell lineages. In support of this possibility, we have recently shown in collaboration with Toniola and colleagues that the brain-specific α isoform of GDI is responsible for X-linked mental retardation and therefore important for the normal neural function in the brain (12D'Adamo P. Menegon A. Lo Nigro C. Grasso M. Gulisano M. Tamanini F. Bienvenu T. Gedeon A.K. Oostra B. Wu S.-K. Tandon A. Valtorta F. Balch W.E. Chelly J. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The Rab GTPase cycle is intimately linked to GDI function. While the events that direct the recruitment of the cytosolic GDI·Rab(GDP) complex to the membrane are presently unknown, delivery to a specific subcellular compartment requires residues present in the hypervariable carboxyl terminus of each Rab protein (13Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Membrane localization of Rab has been proposed to involve at least two accessory factors, a GDI displacement factor to dissociate GDI from Rab and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to promote stable binding of the activated (GTP-bound) form of Rab to the membrane (14Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B.D. Pfeffer S.R.

Following GTP hydrolysis, presumably promoted by Rab-specific GTPase activating proteins, the membrane-bound form of Rab(GDP) is returned to the cytosolic reservoir through extraction by GDI. The role of GDI in the recycling of GDP-bound forms of Rab is supported by numerous in vitrostudies in which GDI has been shown to extract different Rab proteins from a variety of membranes (10Ullrich O.

GDI and a closely related family of proteins involved in Rab prenylation (referred to as Rab escort proteins or REP) together form a GDI superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 2Wu S.K. Zeng K. Wilson I.

REP delivers newly synthesized Rab to the catalytic subunits of the geranylgeranyl transferase II (GGTase II) complex for addition of two geranylgeranyl groups to cysteine residues found at the carboxyl terminus. These are essential for Rab function. Subsequently, REP delivers prenylated Rab to membranes in a manner indistinguishable from GDI (22Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C.

REP1 is identical to the choroideremia gene product involved in late onset X-linked retinal degeneration. Consistent with the proposal that different isoforms in the GDI family have unique function, loss of REP1/choroideremia1 results in the defective prenylation of one Rab protein, Rab27. As a consequence of loss of Rab27 function, the choroidal epithelial layer in the eye undergoes degeneration leading to loss of vision (24Anders D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A.

The essential and ubiquitous roles of members of the GDI superfamily in regulation of membrane transport emphasizes the need for identifying and characterizing the role of specific residues that interact with Rab and those that function to deliver and/or extract Rab from membranes. To address this question, we have solved the structure of α-GDI at 1.81-Å resolution using x-ray crystallography (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that α-GDI is constructed of two main structural units, a large complex multisheet domain I and a smaller α-helical domain II. Domain I includes sequence-conserved regions (SCRs) located in the NH2-terminal and central portions of the molecule common to members of both the GDI/REP families. These contain tri- and tetrapeptide motifs which are invariant from yeast to man (29Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. Boguski M.S. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 193-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, highly conserved residues are clustered on only one face of the molecule suggesting that this face is involved in most, if not all, important features of GDI/choroideremia function (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The two most conserved SCRs, 1 and 3B, form a compact structure at the apex of GDI. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have previously shown that surface residues with their polar side chains directed away from the α-carbon background in SCRs 1B and 3B are important for the binding of Rab3A and for the ability of α-GDI to extract the GDP-bound form of Rab3A from rat brain synaptosomes (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Based on these studies we have speculated that this region recognizes Rab3A in vivo and is critical for function. To date there has been no correlation between the role of residues involved in binding of Rab in vitro (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the activity of GDI in vesicular transport. We now provide functional evidence that select conserved residues required for the binding of Rab3A in the synapse also regulate the activity of the Rab1A GTPase involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport. Like other Rab proteins, Rab1A forms a cytosolic complex with GDI and this pool is essential for transport in vivo (30Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and in vitro (20Peter F. Nuoffer C. Pind S.N. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1393-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given the evolutionary divergence between these two Rab species (35% identity), we propose that residues which mediate the binding of both Rab1A and Rab3A participate in general Rab function in vivo. Intriguingly, we have also identified residues that appear to discriminate not only between the role of GDI in the recognition of different Rabs, but in interacting with membranes, providing evidence for specialized receptor(s) directing Rab recycling. Trans35S-label (> 1,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals. Inc. (Irvine, CA). Rat liver cytosol used in transport assays was prepared as described previously (31Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H (endo H) was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Antibody specific for Rab1 (p68) was prepared as described (32Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J.R. Schwaninger R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). His6-tagged Rab1 and Rab3A expressed from Escherichia coli were prepared as described 33). Prenylated His6-tagged Rab3a was purified as described (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and purification of E. coliexpressed mutants and wild type GDI were performed as described (28Schalk I.

Methylanthraniloyl guanosine di(tri)phosphate-GDP (mGDP) was prepared as described (34Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Rab·mGDP complexes were prepared by incubating mGDP and Rab protein at a 100 to 1 molar ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm mGDP at 32 °C for 45 min. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was adjusted to 20 mmMg2+ (to trap mGDP in Rab) and kept on ice for 1 h before use. The measurement of GDI-Rab interactions were performed in buffer A composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.3 mm GDP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA. Typically, 100 nm Rab mGDP was incubated with increasing concentrations of GDI in 300 μl of buffer A. The dissociation of mGDP from Rab was measured as a decrease in fluorescence using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Fluorescence Spectrometer set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 440 nm, respectively. Dissociation constants (K d) for Rab binding to GDI wild-type and mutants were determined by the inhibition of mGDP dissociation from Rab protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of GDI. The calculation of dissociation constant (K d) was based on the reaction (Scheme 1) where k -2 is negligible.Rab·GDP ⇌k1k−1 Rab+GDP + GDI Kd⥮Rab·GDP·GDI ⇌k2k−2 Rab·GDI+GDPSCHEME 1The observed dissociation rate constants (k obs) were obtained by fitting the data to single exponentials. The K d can be obtained by fitting k obs and the GDI concentration to Equation 1.kobs=k−11+[GDI]/Kd(Eq. 1) Semi-intact cells used for the analysis of ER to Golgi transport were prepared from NRK cells infected with the tsO45 strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) using the swelling method and transport from the ER to Golgi measured as described (31Davidson H.W.

Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, NRK cells were infected with the tsO45 strain of VSV at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) for 4 h to accumulate the VSV-G in the ER. The cells were then pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of Trans35S-label and perforated by swelling and scraping. The assays were performed in a final volume of 40 μl in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 75 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm N-acetylglucosamine, an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase, final concentration), 2–6 μl of rat liver cytosol (15–30 mg/ml protein in 25 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 125 mm KOAc), and 5 μl of semi-intact cells (25–50 mg of protein in 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 90 mm KOAc). Recombinant wild-type and GDI were added to the mixture as indicated under “Results” and incubated for 32 °C for 1 h. After termination of the reaction by transfer to ice, membranes were collected by centrifugation, solubilized, digested with endo H, and processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described (31Davidson H.W. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4216-4226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Extraction of Rab proteins from membranes by purified recombinant GDI was performed as described (20Peter F. Nuoffer C. Pind S.N. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1393-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μg of perforated cell membranes were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 75 mm KOAc, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgOAc, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Subsequently, 5 μg of His6-GDI were added and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the samples were transferred to ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 ×g to pellet membranes. The supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using GDI-specific and Rab1A-specific antibodies (20Peter F. Nuoffer C. Pind S.N. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1393-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,32Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J.R. Schwaninger R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The blots were developed using an ECLTM kit and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer calibrated using purified proteins. Measurement of the binding of mutant R70E and wild-type recombinant GDI to semi-intact cells was carried out as described above using unlabeled NRK cells. Briefly, purified mutant and wild-type GDI were added at the indicated concentration (see “Results”) to a standard 40 μl in vitro transport mixture and incubated for 30 min at 32 °C. Samples were transferred to ice to terminate the reaction. Membranes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to assure the complete removal of unbound GDI. The amount of membrane-bound GDI recovered in the pellet was detected by immunoblotting using GDI-specific antibody. The blots were developed using an ECLTM kit and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer calibrated using purified proteins. The dissociation constants (K d) for the interaction of wild-type and mutant α-GDIs with Rab3A, a GTPase required for vesicle fusion in the synapse, were previously determined by measuring the differential elution of free Rab3A or the GDI·Rab3A complex from Q-Sepharose in response to increasing salt (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This approach was not possible with Rab1A (∼35% identity to Rab3A) involved in ER to Golgi transport given that both the free and GDI complexed form of Rab1A elute from Q-Sepharose at similar concentrations of salt. 2S. K. Wu and W. E. Balch, unpublished data. Therefore, we developed an indirect measure for binding. We used the well established property of GDI to prevent the intrinsic dissociation of GDP from Rab (4Sasaki T. Kikuchi A. Araki S. Hata Y. Isomura M. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Hubert L. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in combination with methylanthraniloyl guanosine di(tri)phosphate-GDP (mGDP) to monitor binding of guanine nucleotides to GTPases using fluorescence spectroscopy (36Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 37Nouffer C. Wu S.-K. Dascher C. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1305-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The dissociation of mGDP was determined by measuring the decrease in relative fluorescence (λexcitation, 360 nm; λemission, 440 nm) that accompanies the release of mGDP from Rab, providing a measure of the strength of Rab and GDI interactions (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of increasing concentrations of α-GDI prepared from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells to Rab3A-mGDP led to a decrease in the loss of intrinsic fluorescence through formation of a GDI·Rab·mGDP ternary complex, demonstrating that α-GDI prevents GDP dissociation from Rab3A in this assay. To relate the new approach to the Q-Sepharose assay (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Shapiro A.D. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11085-11090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of mutant GDI to bind Rab3A. Because all mutant GDIs are produced as recombinant protein in E. coli, we first compared the ability of wild-type GDI produced in insect cells to that produced in bacteria. Both significantly reduced the intrinsic dissociation rate of mGDP pre-bound to prenylated Rab3A (Fig. 2 A). The stronger interaction of Sf9 GDI is consistent with its higher specific biological activity in vitro, 3S. K. Wu and W. E. Balch, unpublished observations. possibly reflecting post-translational modifications not carried out by E. coli (39Steele-Mortimer O. Gruenberg J. Clague M.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the binding of the R240A mutant to Rab3A. Residue Arg-240, found in helix I on the front edge of the Rab-binding platform (Fig. 3), is essential for recognition of Rab3A by GDI. When mutated (R240A), the binding of GDI to Rab3A based on the Q-Sepharose assay is lost. This decrease in binding corresponds quantitatively to an ∼60-fold reduction in K d (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the R240A GDI mutant in the fluorescence assay completely lost its ability to inhibit the intrinsic rate of dissociation of mGDP from Rab3A (Fig. 2 A). This loss in binding to Rab3A corresponds quantitatively to an ∼6-fold decrease based on kinetic analysis of the fluorescence data (see “Experimental Procedures”).Figure 3Location of mutated residues in α-GDI.The structure of α-GDI illustrating the location of selected residues which were mutated as described under “Results.” The Rab binding platform containing SCRs 1 and 3B is highlighted in dark gray; the insert region is highlighted in light gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Rab prenylation was necessary for Rab recognition, the binding of wild-type GDI and the R240A mutant to Rab3A generated in bacteria (and therefore lacking prenyl groups) was examined. While binding of wild-type GDI to unprenylated Rab3A was weaker than that observed for the prenylated form, significant interaction was detected judging from the decrease in the intrinsic dissociation of mGDP from Rab3A (Fig. 2 B). As expected, the R240A mutant reduced binding to unprenylated Rab3A to background levels (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that while the prenyl group facilitates the interaction between GDI and Rab, other residues in Rab are required to stabilize formation of the ternary complex. In general, the change in binding of wild-type and various mutant GDIs to Rab3A obtained using the fluorescence assay directly mirrored the change in K d as determined by the Q-Sepharose assay (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).3 Although the fluorescence assay has a more limited dynamic range (∼6-fold compared with the ∼60-fold dynamic range observed for the Q-Sepharose assay (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)), it is applicable to the entire spectrum of Rab GTPases. It, therefore, provides a more useful approach to assess the relative ability of GDI to recognize different Rab proteins. Given the ease of producing protein using bacteria, all further studies utilized recombinant GDI and unprenylated Rab purified to homogeneity following overexpression in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). To define the role of conserved residues in α-GDI in the regulation of Rab1A function in ER to Golgi transport, we first examined the ability of a range of GDI mutants to bind to Rab1A in vitro using the mGDP dissociation assay. Residues Gln-236 and Arg-240 in SCR 3B are found on adjacent turns of helix I defining the front edge of the Rab binding platform (Fig. 3). Mutation of both of these residues eliminated the ability of GDI to inhibit the intrinsic dissociation rate of mGDP from Rab1A (Fig. 4, lanes m and n). Mutation of T248 (SCR3B), a residue found in β-strand a3 of sheet A which defines the upper edge of the Rab binding platform (Fig. 3) (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), resulted in a similar loss of GDI binding to Rab1A (Fig. 4, lane o). Because these results are identical to the complete loss of binding of GDI to Rab3A observed previously (28Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we suggest that the Gln-236, Arg-240, and Thr-248 residues play critical roles in the general function of the Rab binding platform. They may potentially contribute polar side chains which recognize conserved residues in divergent Rab species. Interestingly, Tyr-39, a conserved residue located in SCR1A found in the center of the Rab binding platform (Fig. 3), and Glu-233 (a residue that is proximal to Arg-240 in helix I) (Fig. 3) are absolutely critical for recognition of Rab3A by GDI (28Schalk I.

FLAG-BiP.ent oligomerizes into multiple species that interconvert with each other in a slow, concentration- and temperature-dependent equilibrium. Binding of ATP or AMP-PNP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate), but not ADP, or of a peptidic substrate induces depolymerization of FLAG-BiP.ent and stabilization of monomeric species. Enterokinase cleavage of monomeric, nucleotide-free BiP.ent results in the physical dissociation of the 44-kDa N-terminal ATPase fragment (N44.ent) from the 30-kDa C-terminal substrate binding domain (C30.ent). Upon dissociation, the freed C-terminal substrate binding domain readily undergoes self-association while N44.ent remains monomeric. Enterokinase cleavage performed in the presence of a synthetic peptide prevents oligomerization of the freed C30.ent domain. Addition of ATP during enterokinase cleavage has no effect on C30.ent oligomerization. Our data clearly indicate that binding of a specific peptide onto the C-terminal domain, or ATP onto the N-terminal domain, induces internal conformational change(s) within the C30 domain that result(s) in BiP depolymerization.

The size and nature of peptidic substrates required to fully stimulate the ATPase activity of HSP70 proteins have been determined to be 7-residue-long peptides, rich in aliphatic amino acids (14Flynn G.C.

Detailed enzymological studies on monomeric, recombinant bovine Hsc70 revealed that binding of peptides increases the rate of ADP and inorganic phosphate release leading to an increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis (17Takeda S.

It was recently demonstrated that ATP-bound HSP70 proteins have high on/off rates of binding/release of substrates, whereas ADP-bound chaperones exhibit higher affinity for peptidic substrates through slower off rates (reviewed in Ref. 21Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Many HSP70 proteins are also regulated by accessory proteins. A well studied system is the E. coliDnaK chaperone, which is regulated by the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE, which increases the rate of ADP/ATP exchange (22Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D.

A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In addition to the different conformations HSP70 proteins adopt in the presence of substrates, they also self-associate into multiple oligomeric species that interconvert with each other (24Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 25Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schroder H. Bukau B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the bacterial system, addition of the dimeric cofactor GrpE to heterogeneous multimeric DnaK results in a slow conversion of oligomers into monomers and stabilization of (GrpE)2·DnaK complexes (25Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schroder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mammalian Hsp70 oligomers of high molecular weights do not behave like the dimers and trimers in that they do not dissociate upon ATP addition and are less thermostable (27Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As the expression of most HSP70 proteins is increased upon heat shock treatment, the effect of temperature on self-association of HSP70 proteins has also been investigated. It was observed that an increase in temperature in the 40–47 °C range leads to self-association/aggregation of Hsp73 and Hsc70 (27Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data emphasize the complexity of the HSP70 cycle and how unfolded peptidic substrates, adenine nucleotides, accessory proteins and oligomerization affect the conformation of the proteins. The mechanisms by which self-association and depolymerization might affect the functions and activities of the molecular chaperones in normal and stress conditions are poorly understood. GRP78/BiP is one of the two members of the HSP70 family involved in polypeptide translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotic cells (29Panzner S. Dreier L. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 30Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J.

GRP78/BiP plays a role in the folding and assembly of secreted or membrane proteins as well as in their transport (32Gething M.J. Blond-Elguindi S. Mori K. Sambrook J.F. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A.

Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Like the other members of the HSP70 family, BiP is a peptide-stimulated ATPase (12Flynn G.C. Chappel T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 13Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol.

Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), although broad enough to allow binding to all nascent chains translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, is also highly specific; BiP does not bind to fully folded and assembled proteins, except to co-chaperones like the DnaJ yeast homologues Scj1 and Sec63 (30Schlenstedt G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). BiP has a specificity distinct from that of other HSP70 proteins (39Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not functionally interchangeable with other HSP70 proteins (40Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmerman M. Zimmerman R. Jakob U.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe a system that enables us to investigate the role of each domain in the self-association equilibrium of recombinant murine BiP. By using an engineered protein that contains an enterokinase site at the junction between the N-terminal ATPase domain and the C-terminal peptide binding domain (FLAG-BiP.ent), we show that BiP is a flexible and malleable molecule that interchanges between different oligomeric conformations and degrees of polymerization in a slow, concentration- and temperature-dependent, process. Binding of ATP, or of a synthetic peptide, induces depolymerization of BiP oligomers into monomeric species at different rates. Upon enterokinase cleavage of monomeric FLAG-BiP.ent, the two domains dissociate and the C-terminal domain self-associates into multiple oligomeric species. When enterokinase cleavage is performed in the presence of a synthetic peptide, the C-terminal domain can be isolated as a mostly monomeric fragment. Addition of ATP during enterokinase treatment does not prevent self-association of the C-terminal fragment. Our data indicate that peptide-induced depolymerization of BiP is controlled by the peptide binding C-terminal domain, and that a signal is being transmitted to the ATPase domain upon BiP monomerization that results in an increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. This study emphasizes the role of interdomain interactions in the regulation of BiP activity and degree of oligomerization. The vector pSecB115, described previously (13Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was digested with SalI and religated with a double-stranded SalI linker encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), in frame with the N-terminal OmpT signal sequence that precedes the full-length murine GRP78/BiP gene in pSecB115. The two oligonucleotides used for the SalI linker were designed as follows: 5′-TCGACG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG-3′ and 5′-TCGA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC CG-3′ (the SalI cohesive ends are underlined). The resulting plasmid, pFLAG-BiP was then cut with BamHI, and the 2-kilobase pair fragment containing murine BiP/GRP78 cDNA (44Kozutsumi Y. Normington K. Press E. Slaughter C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1989; 11: 115-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned in dephosphorylated double-stranded M13mp18 bacteriophage. Single-stranded DNA was purified, and loop-in mutagenesis was carried out with a non-coding mutagenic nucleotide, 5′-G TAC CAG ATC ACC TGT ATC CTT ATCGTCATC ATCACCAGAGAGGACACC-3′, which annealed with the 3′ end of the BiP ATPase domain, and the 5′ end of the C-terminal domain, and contains an internal extra sequence that encodes for an enterokinase site (underlined) to be inserted between the translated residues Asp-390 and Asp-392 in the murine GRP78/BiP sequence. Bacteriophage plaques were screened with the 5′-CCTTATCGTCATCATCACC-3′ probe, and the mutant BamHI cassette was subcloned in the pSecB115 vector to yield pFLAG-BiP.ent. The entire coding sequence was sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with the following nucleotides as primers: pET12a (5′-GCC AGT CAC TAT GGC GTG-3′), P2 (5′-TCC AGG CCA TAT GCA ATA GC-3′), P3 (5′-GAA ATT TCT TCT GGG GC-3′), P4 (5′-CTT TTC TAC CTC ACG CCG-3′), P5 (CCT CAT CGG GGT TTA TG-3′), P6 (5′-GGA ATT CCA GTC AGA TC-3′), P7 (CCC AGC TTT TCT TTA TC-3′), and P8 (5′- GCT CTA GCA GAT CAG TG-3′). No additional mutations were identified. All experiments were carried out as described (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). BiP.ent cDNA was amplified from pFLAG-BiP.ent with the 5′ primer XhoI-5, 5′-CCGCTCGAG GAG GAG GAC AAG AAG GAG-3′, which introduces an XhoI site at the 5′ extremity of the BiP.ent sequence (underlined), and the reverse primer HindIII-3′, 5′-CCC AAGCTT TAA TGC AGT TTA TC-3′, which anneals at the 3′ end of the DNA, after the elements of transcription termination of the pET12a vector at the level of a uniqueHindIII site (underlined). The PCR product was cleaved withXhoI and HindIII and ligated into pET19b to yield pHis-BiP.ent. The same XhoI-5′ and HindIII-3′ primers were used to amplify the BiP sequence from the plasmid pSecBB115 (13Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the XhoI-HindIII fragment was subcloned in pET19b to yield the plasmid pHis-BiP. The FLAG epitope allows purification on anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (IBI, Inc.), thus minimizing the extent of contamination of BiP by bound adenine nucleotides. E. coliBL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pFLAG-BiP.ent. Cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. T7 RNA polymerase expression was induced at A 600 nm ∼ 0.8 by addition of 0.4 mm (final concentration) of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 1-h induction period, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C, resuspended in Buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 175 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2), and broken in a French pressure cell (10,000 p.s.i. at 4 °C). Total cell extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 45 min at 45,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded at a flow rate of 2 ml/min on a column packed with 23 ml of anion exchanger Source 15Q medium (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in Buffer A, and connected to an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The elution was performed with a 175–325 mm KCl linear gradient. Fractions containing FLAG-BiP.ent (230–270 mmKCl) were pooled and loaded onto an M2 column equilibrated in Buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl). After removal of the unbound proteins by extensive washes with Buffer B, FLAG-BiP.ent was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.5, and immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. To remove bound nucleotides, 4 mm EDTA was added to the sample and proteins were precipitated by ammonium sulfate (75% of saturation) as described for Hsc70 (24Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). When necessary, FLAG-BiP.ent was further purified on HR10/30 Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sample was then dialyzed against Binding Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) or Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) for enterokinase cleavage. His-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (46Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), and purified by affinity chromatography on His.Bind resin N.D. as described by the manufacturer (Novagen, Inc.). When needed, further purification was performed on Superose 12 HR 10/30 as indicated in the text. Bound nucleotides were removed as described (24Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). All purified proteins were exhaustively dialyzed against Binding Buffer. Peptide pep2 (LSVKFLT) was identified as a BiP substrate by affinity panning of a library of Trp-less, Met-less peptides displayed on bacteriophages 2S. Y. Blond and M.-J. Gething, unpublished results. using procedures very similar to those previously described for the identification of a large series of other BiP-binding peptides (37Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E.

The synthesis of pep2 was performed on a 431 peptide synthesizer from Applied Biosystems Inc (University of Illinois at Chicago Resource Center). The coupling agents were 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (47Knorr R. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Gillessen D. Tetrahed. Lett. 1989; 30: 1927-1930Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Pep2 was purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a semi-preparative C8 column and analyzed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry (Protein Research Laboratory, University of Illionois at Chicago). Concentrations of the peptide stock solutions were determined as follows: Pep2 was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl and then derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate using the Millipore-Water Pico-Tag work station, and analyzed by HPLC using the ABI 130A HPLC separation system with an ABI C-18 Brownlee column (2.1 × 220 mm) at 37 °C. The amino acid standards used to calculate the peptide concentration were purchased from Pierce (catalog no. 27300). We engineered plasmid pFLAG-BiP.ent that allows BiP expression in E. coli and has the following features: an N-terminal OmpT signal sequence to target the protein into the periplasmic space (46Studier W.F. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), followed by a FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK), recognized by the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (IBI), and which also specifies a recognition site for enterokinase (DDDDK), and finally the full-length murine BiP (44Kozutsumi Y.

A second enterokinase site was inserted by loop-in mutagenesis between the N-terminal ATPase domain and the C-terminal domain C30, at position D390, as described under “Materials and Methods.” FLAG-BiP.ent was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells upon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, immobilized onto an anti-FLAG M2 affinity Gel (IBI), and eluted from the column through reversible denaturation in acidic buffer as described under “Materials and Methods.” FLAG-BiP.ent migrates on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel as an 80-kDa species, in agreement with its expected molecular weight. Circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis shows a significant amount of secondary structure: 35–40% α-helix, 40–45% β-sheet, 5% β-turn, and 8–12% random-coil as determined with SELCON software (48Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). These results are similar to those reported for Hsc70 (49Sadis S. Raghavendra K. Hightower L.E.

To address whether the N-terminal FLAG extension and the presence of an enterokinase site at the junction between the catalytic domain and the peptide binding domain would affect the catalytic properties of BiP, we engineered the plasmids pHis-BiP.ent and pHis-BiP and characterized the catalytic properties of purified recombinant His- BiP.ent and His-BiP proteins. Michaelis and catalytic constants were determined in steady state conditions for FLAG-BiP.ent, His-BiP.ent and His-BiP, in the absence and presence of a synthetic peptide (pep2: LSVKFLT), and found to be in the same range of values reported for unmodified murine BiP and other HSP70 proteins (Table I). Our data indicate that the addition of an N-terminal FLAG epitope or histidine tag, as well as the insertion of an enterokinase site at the junction between the two domains do not profoundly alter the overall secondary structure of BiP, nor its ability to bind ATP or peptides with reasonable affinities. However, the basal ATPase activity of both FLAG-BiP.ent and His-BiP.ent are about 2-fold higher than the activity exhibited by His-BiP and untagged recombinant murine BiP. After addition of pep2, both FLAG-BiP.ent and His-BiP reach the same k cat. This indicates that insertion of an enterokinase site between the N- and C-terminal domains increases the basal ATPase activity of BiP but does not have a profound effect on its structure or affinity for nucleotidic and peptidic substrates.Table IMichaelis and catalytic constants determined in steady state conditions for members of the HSP70 familyProteinK M(ATP)k catk catstimulated by pep2K M(pep2)Ref.μmminminμmFLAG-BiP.ent3 ± 10.57 ± 0.121 ± 0.5 (× 1.5–2.2)40This studyHis-BiP.ent4.0 ± 0.50.440.68 (× 1.5)200This studyHis-BiP1.9 ± 0.30.30 ± 0.150.9 ± 0.4 (× 2.6–3.4)100–120This studyRecombinant murine BiP0.40.14 ± 0.03NDND(13Blond-Elguindi S.

We investigated the degree of oligomerization of nucleotide-free FLAG-BiP.ent by size-exclusion chromatography at various protein concentrations (Fig. 1). FLAG-BiP.ent elutes in three major peaks. Peak A corresponds to aggregates that elute in the void volume. Peak O contains mostly trimeric and dimeric species. Peak M shoulders peak O and corresponds to monomeric species. The proportion of A, O, and M was found to vary slightly as a function of the concentration of FLAG-BiP.ent. At concentrations below 25 μm, the monomeric species are preponderant. By contrast, the amount of oligomers increases at higher concentration. The amount of aggregates remains constant over the range of concentrations investigated.

This strategy allowed for selective expression of the wild type and/or mutant form of MYOA by the choice of growth medium. Proper septation and hyphal branching were found to be dependent on the interaction of the IQ motifs with calmodulin, as well as, the presence of its proline-rich domain. Additionally, a single proline-rich motif was sufficient for nearly wild type MYOA function. Most surprisingly, the SH3 domain was not essential for MYOA function. These studies expand our previous knowledge of the function of MYOA to include roles in hyphal morphogenesis, septal wall formation, and cell polarity, laying the groundwork for more detailed investigations on the function of the various tail domains in MYOA.

Class I myosins appear to be involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell motility, contractile vacuole function, receptor-mediated endocytosis, protein secretion, maintenance of cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular organelle movement (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition to the highly conserved myosin motor domain, class I myosins possess variable tail regions. In general, the tail of class I myosins consist of the IQ light chain-binding domain, and the tail homology (TH)1 1, 2, and 3 domains. The TH-1 domain is rich in basic amino acids, binds to acidic phospholipids, and has an ATP insensitive actin-binding sight. The TH-2 domain is rich in amino acids glycine, proline, and alanine or glycine, proline, and glutamine. The TH-3 domain is an SH3 domain (Src homology 3) (3Meyer B.J. Eck M.J. Curr.

Class I myosins have been identified in many lower eukaryotes including Dictyostelium discoideum(4Novak K.D. Peterson M.D. Reedy M.C. Titus M.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although class I myosins have been studied in a variety of systems, the elucidation of their function has been complicated by the presence of multiple class I myosins with apparently overlapping function, such that loss of any single myosin I and in some cases deletion of multiple myosins I is not lethal. The discovery of myoA as an essential class I myosin in A. nidulans (9McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) allows us to address many aspects of MYOA function, including regulation by phosphorylation, protein interactions, and the functions of the specific domains present in the carboxyl terminus (COOH terminus). The amino-terminal motor domain contains an ATP-sensitive F-actin-binding site and provides the force required for movement along actin filaments. The COOH-terminal tail region of MYOA is composed of an IQ domain with two IQ motifs, a TH-1-like domain, an SH3 domain, and a proline/alanine-rich domain with 2 proline/alanine motifs (Fig. 1). The TH-1-like domain can be further subdivided into 2 subdomains. The first subdomain is rich in basic amino acids and the second subdomain is slightly proline-rich. We previously showed that MYOA plays a role in secretion and polarized growth by the creation of a conditionally null myoA strain, CL3, in which the inducible alcohol dehydrogenase (alcA) promoter drives the expression of myoA (9McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that MYOA functions in endocytosis by mutating the phosphorylation site serine 371 to glutamic acid and activating endocytosis (10Yamashita R.A. May G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14644-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the structural requirements of the tail region of MYOA that are necessary for its function. Transformation of the CL3 strain with mutant forms of myoAunder the control of its own promoter allows us to selectively maintain an otherwise lethal transformant for further study. The use of an inducible promoter to produce wild type MYOA and the endogenousmyoA promoter to produce mutant MYOA allows for differential expression of either the wild type or mutant MYOA or both depending on the growth medium. This paper addresses the in vivo significance of the four domains present in the COOH-terminal region of MYOA. We have chosen to mutate the tail domains of myoA because it is this portion of the polypeptide that leads to specific cellular localization and function. We have transformed six different mutant tail constructs corresponding to frameshift and deletion mutations and tested them for their ability to complement the conditional null phenotype of CL3. Additionally, we have characterized the phenotypes of the viablemyoA frameshift and deletion mutants by examining the consequences of these changes on cell growth, cell morphology, protein secretion, and endocytosis. Construction of the CL3 strain was described previously (9McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The yeast strain Y190 (MATa gal4Δ, gal80Δ, his3Δ200, trp1-901, ade2-101, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, URA3::GAL→lacZ, LYS2::GAL(UAS)→HIS3, cyh r) was used for two-hybrid screens (11Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar).

Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). MMV-glycerol contains MM-glycerol with vitamin mixture (12Pontecorvo G. Roper J.A. Hemmons C.M. MacDonald K.D. Bufton A.W.J. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). A pGEM plasmid, pGEMmyoA, which contains an 8.7-kb XbaI to SacI genomic fragment of the myoA gene with its native promoter and termination sequence, was used to create the tail mutants (Table I). Frameshift mutations were made by cutting pGEMmyoA with KpnI, XhoI, orBamHI enzyme. pGEMmyoAKpnI was made blunt with T4 polymerase and pGEMmyoAXhoI and pGEMmyoABamHI were made blunt with Klenow enzyme and religated according to the protocols of the supplier (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). These frameshifts truncated MYOA at amino acid positions 744 (KpnI), 1126 (XhoI), and 1155 (BamHI). The changes these mutations make to the sequence are shown in Fig. 1 B. pyroA, a selective marker for transformation, was cloned as anSphI-SpeI fragment into theSphI-XbaI site of each of the myoAmutant constructs. These constructs were renamed FSKpnI, FSXhoI, and FSBamHI, respectively (Table I). FSKpnI causes a frameshift in the middle of the IQ domain, essentially producing MYOA without a tail. FSXhoI results in a frameshift after the SH3 domain producing MYOA without a proline-rich region (amino acids 1138–1147). FSBamHI causes a frameshift after the first of two proline-rich motifs found in MYOA, producing a protein that lacks the last proline-rich motif.Table IPlasmids used in these studiesStrainVectorMarkerInsertpGEMmyoAKpnIpGEMmyoAMYOA 1–744pGEMmyoAXhoIpGEMmyoAMYOA 1–1126pGEMmyoABamHIpGEMmyoAMYOA 1–1155FSKpnIpGEMmyoApyroAMYOA 1–744FSXhoIpGEMmyoApyroAMYOA 1–1126FSBamHIpGEMmyoApyroAMYOA 1–1155pBKSΔIQpBluescriptKSMYOA1–730, 793–1160pBKSΔTH-1-likepBluescriptKSMYOA1–792, 1081–1160pBKSΔSH3pBluescriptKSMYOA1–1080, 1131–1160pGEMmyoAΔIQpGEMmyoAMYOA1–730, 793–1160pGEMmyoAΔTH-1-likepGEMmyoAMYOA1–792, 1081–1160pGEMmyoAΔSH3pGEMmyoAMYOA1–1080, 1131–1160ΔIQpGEMmyoApyroAMYOA1–730, 793–1160ΔTH-1-likepGEMmyoApyroAMYOA1–792, 1081–1160ΔSH3pGEMmyoApyroAMYOA1–1080, 1131–1160pmyoA9pUC19MYOA 731–1249pmyoA10PAS2TRP1MYOA 731–1249pmyoA11pUC19MYOA 793–1249pmyoA12pUC19MYOA 1081–1249pmyoA13PAS2TRP1MYOA 793–1249pmyoA14PAS2TRP1MYOA 1081–1249pmyoA18PRSETAMYOA 731–1249pmyoA19PRSETAMYOA 793–1249pmyoA20PRSETAMYOA 1081–1249 Open table in a new tab The IQ, TH-1-like, and SH3 deletion mutations were created using a PCR based mutagenesis method (13Ho S.N.

The oligonucleotide sequences and the primer pairs for each template used are given in Tables II and III, respectively. Plasmid pBKSSpeI-BamHI (pBluescript KS, Stratagene) which contains a SpeI-BamHI fragment of myoAwas used as the template.

Plasmids containing the different frameshift or deletion mutations were transformed into CL3. Primary transformants were purified three times to single spores on selective MM-glycerol medium. Southern analysis was used to identify transformants containing a single integration at themyoAΔ locus in CL3 upstream of the myoA driven by the alcA promoter. Cultures of all transformants were grown in MM-glycerol liquid to allow for growth by permitting expression of the alcA wild type myoA gene. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (14Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The genomic DNAs were digested with XhoI and probed sequentially with the 0.9-kbHindIII-XhoI 3′ half of pyroA, the 1-kbXhoI-EcoRI 5′ half of pyroA, and theEcoRI pyr-4 fragment, radiolabeled using the random primer method (15Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions were those described previously (16May G.S. Gambino J. Weatherbee J.A. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cultures of all transformants were grown in either liquid YAG or MM-glycerol, harvested, and pressed dry between paper towels. The cell mass was pulverized in a Dounce homogenizer and suspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the pellet was washed twice in acetone with 20 mm HCl and once in acetone. The cell mass was suspended in 8 m urea made in SDS sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min. The extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm to remove the insoluble cell debris and 20 μg of total cellular proteins were separated on a 6% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) by electroblotting. MYOA proteins were detected using an affinity purified polyclonal MYOA antibody raised against the COOH-terminal portion of MYOA expressed in Escherichia coli using the PRSET expression system (9McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent detection of the proteins by ECL (Amersham Corp.) was used to verify the presence of the various MYOA mutant proteins. Induction or repression of thealcA promoter was demonstrated by plating the transformants on various carbon sources (9McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Growth in YAG represses thealcA driven myoA and allows the endogenousmyoA promoter to transcribe the mutated MYOA product, such that if the portion of the tail deleted is an essential region for myosin I function, a lethal phenotype would be expected. Growth on MM-glycerol medium induces the alcA driven myoA, such that wild type MYOA is produced and all strains will be viable and wild type for growth. Hyphal growth studies were performed by plating 104-106 spores/ml onto sterile coverslips in YAG. At various time points a coverslip was removed randomly selected samples were chosen and recorded. The lengths of the germlings were measured in microns. Recorded images were also analyzed for germination and branching morphology. Radial growth assays were performed by plating 2–3 colony forming units per plate on solid YAG as described previously (16May G.S. Gambino J. Weatherbee J.A. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Spores were germinated in YAG for differential interference contrast microscopy. Germ tube development observed using a Nikon microscope and digital images were collected at 1-h intervals using a Hamamatsu Model C2400 camera using a SCSI adapter and twain driver into Adobe Photoshop 3.0. To make the bait plasmids anNdeI site was introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the myoA cDNA (9McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) introducing an in-frame methionine at amino acid positions 724, 792, or 1079 of the MYOA protein corresponding to the IQ, TH-1-like, and SH3 domains. The PCR fragments were then cloned into the NdeI and XbaI sites in pUC19 before being cloned into pAS2 asNdeI-SalI fragments. The A. nidulansactivation domain library was constructed in pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and was kindly provided by Dr. Osmani of the Geisinger Clinic, Weis Center for Research, Danville, PA. The two-hybrid screen was conducted as described (11Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The same cDNA fragments in pUC19 used to make the bait plasmids were cloned into PRSETA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) vector that had NdeI and HindIII sites. These plasmids were used in a linked in vitro transcription/translation reaction (PROTEINscript, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and the translated product was used in a direct binding assay to CaM-Sepharose (P4385, Sigma) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl with 1 mm CaCl or with 1 mm EGTA. The CaM-Sepharose slurry was incubated with the different translation products in the two buffers for 30 min at 4° C with gentle mixing. The CaM-Sepharose beads were washed three times with buffer and examined on 10% SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with starting material as a control for amount of protein present. Following electrophoresis the proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C. Methods for the growth and genetic manipulation of A. nidulans have been described in detail elsewhere (12Pontecorvo G. Roper J.A. Hemmons C.M. MacDonald K.D. Bufton A.W.J. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 18Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene. 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, those methods used in the manipulation of plasmids and molecular cloning have been described elsewhere (18Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene. 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is the tail region of class I myosins that is thought to provide them with their specific cellular location and function. For this reason we began our mutational studies of class I myosin function in A. nidulans by creating frameshift and deletion mutants that would alter specific domains of the polypeptide. Our emphasis in these studies was on the highly conserved IQ, calmodulin binding motif, the SH3 domain, and the proline-rich region of the polypeptide. Genomic Southern analysis was performed on 15 purified transformants for each of the transforming plasmids. Genomic DNA digested with XhoI was probed with 3 different probes to identify integration into themyoAΔ locus (Figs. 2 and 3). Approximately 70% of transformants had integrated a single copy of the mutant allele into thealcA activated full-length myoA locus, and these were discarded because of the probability of interallelic recombination between the mutant and wild type tail domains. Only 20% of the transformants had integrated a single copy of the mutant allele into the shorter myoAΔ locus (Figs. 2 and 3). These were selected for further study. Surprisingly, the TH-1-like mutant integrated only into the alcA-myoA gene, so these transformants were mapped to verify that recombination had not occurred between wild type and mutant alleles and selected for further study (Fig. 3, lane 7). The phenotypes of the frameshift and deletion mutations were confirmed for at least three independent isolates.Figure 3Southern blot of CL3, CL3-WT, and tail mutant strains. Genomic DNA was digested with XhoI and sequentially probed with (A) the 0.9-kb pyroAfragment (B) 1.1-kb pyroA fragment, and (C) pyr-4. Arrows indicate expected bands corresponding to a single homologous integration into themyoAΔ site of the CL3 strain. The 1.5-kb band is from the endogenous pyroA gene. The pyr-4 probe also weakly hybridizes to a 4-kb XhoI fragment downstream of the 8-kb fragment that contains a short pyr-4 sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutant strains were grown on MM-glycerol medium so that both the wild type MYOA protein, whose synthesis was driven by thealcA promoter and the mutant MYOA protein made from themyoA promoter were expressed. In addition, viable mutant strains were grown on rich YAG medium to repress expression of the wild type protein. The CL3 and CL3-WT transformant control strains (Fig. 4) demonstrate that under repressing growth conditions (Fig. 4, lanes labeled Y) CL3 expresses barely detectable levels of wild type MYOA. The results indicate that the mutant proteins are expressed for the FSBamHI, ΔIQ, ΔTH-1-like, and ΔSH3 strains (lanes labeled Y show the mutant MYOA and the G lanes show both the wild type and mutant MYOA). Distinguishing between the presence of the FSXhoI mutant protein and the wild type MYOA protein in MM-glycerol was difficult because the antibody reacts only weakly with the mutant protein due to deletion of a portion of the tail recognized by the antibody. However, the FSXhoI MYOA mutant protein was clearly identified when the strain was grown in YAG. The FSKpnI mutant protein could not be detected because it lacks the portion of the tail domain recognized by our antibody. Protein loaded on each lane was approximately equal as demonstrated by a nonspecific lower molecular weight band (labeled NS) present in every lane. We examined the growth of control and mutant strains on solid and liquid media to assess the phenotypes of the variousmyoA mutations used in this study. Growth was assessed on liquid as well as solid media because we previously have seen defects in submerged culture not seen on solid media (10Yamashita R.A. May G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14644-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Growth of the mutant strains, a wild type myoA control transformant, and the parental CL3 strain was tested on solid YAG and MMV-glycerol plates to determine the effect of the mutations on their ability to form a colony (Fig. 5). As expected for recessive mutations, all the strains exhibited wild type growth on MMV-glycerol medium because as shown by Western blotting, both the mutant and wild type MYOA proteins are made when the fungus is grown on this medium (Fig. 5, A and B). On YAG medium the FSBamHI and ΔSH3 strains appeared to grow as well as the wild type control and in quantitative growth studies, we found the FSBamHI and ΔSH3 strains produced colonies that were 96 and 86%, respectively, of the CL3-WT strain in diameter. In contrast, the ΔIQ and FSXhoI mutants formed very small colonies on YAG (Fig. 5, c and d), while the FSKpnI and ΔTH-1-like mutants did not grow at all. The differential growth effect for the mutants on YAG is because thealcA promoter is repressed, thus allowing only the mutant form of MYOA to be expressed. We next examined the growth of the control and mutant strains in submerged culture. The processes of spore germination, germ tube emergence, hyphal branching, and septation are precisely controlled events in A. nidulans (19Wolkow D.T. Harris S.D. Hamer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2179-2188PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fiddy C. Trinci A.P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1976; 97: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For wild type strains the first visible sign of spore germination is spore swelling at about 2 h of growth, followed by germ tube emergence at 5–7 h (Table IV and Fig. 6). There is then a period of rapid hyphal growth by apical extension. Between 8 and 10 h of growth a second germ tube emerges from the swollen spore on the side opposite of where the first germ tube emerged. After 11 to 12 h of growth, hyphal branches begin to appear from the subapical compartments of the growing mycelium. With these observations as our baseline, we assessed each of the mutants for defects in these processes (Table IV, Fig. 6). The FSBamHI and ΔSH3 mutant strains begin to germinate at 6–7 h with only a slight delay in reaching the maximum compared with the wild type control and hyphal elongation was at a rate similar to that of the control strain (Fig. 6). In contrast, the ΔIQ and FSXhoI mutants germinate much later, only after 10 or more hours in culture and their rate of hyphal growth is greatly reduced (Fig. 6). During the first 8 h of growth the ΔIQ and FSXhoI mutants display only isotropic growth like that seen for the parental CL3 strain (Fig. 7). In contrast, the control, ΔSH3, and FSBamHI mutant strains all germinated (80–90% of the spores, Table IV) and extended germ tubes that produced normal hyphae (Fig. 7). The viable mutants all displayed reduced hyphal growth rates compared with controls in submerged cultures. The ΔIQ mutant displayed the slowest rate of hyphal elongation at 16% of the wild type rate. The FSXhoI had a hyphal growth rate that was 36% of wild type. The FSBamHI and ΔSH3 mutants had hyphal growth rates that were 64 and 54% that of the wild type rate, respectively. Thus, while these two mutants display only slightly reduced rates of radial growth on plates they grew significantly slower in submerged culture, like we previously saw for other myoA mutations (10Yamashita R.A. May G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14644-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Table IVGermination and growth phenotype of the mutants and a control showing slight delays (FSBamHI and ΔSH3) and long delays (FSXhoIand ΔIQ) in germinationSporeSingle germ tubeMultiple germ tubesBranched mycelium 5 hWT98200FSXhoI99100FSBamHI97300ΔIQ100000ΔSH399100 6 hWT772300FSXhoI99100FSBamHI841500ΔIQ100000ΔSH392800 7 hWT257000FSXhoI98200FSBamHI207730ΔIQ100000ΔSH3564310 8 hWT68950FSXhoI99160FSBamHI187660ΔIQ99100ΔSH3187750 9 hWT09370FSXhoI98200FSBamHI39070ΔIQ90370ΔSH31945010 hWT09451FSXhoI98200FSBamHI183160ΔIQ405550ΔSH308515011 hWT09172FSXhoI385660FSBamHI09091ΔIQ112780ΔSH3186130Parental strain CL3 and transformed strains FSKpnI and ΔTH-1-like did not germinate during the time course of the experiment.

Data are based on examination of 100 cells. We examined the growth of the ΔIQ and the FSXhoI mutant strains in greater detail because of their dramatic growth defects (Fig. 8). The ΔIQ mutant strain began germination after 9–10 h, approximately 3–4 h later than the CL3-WT strain. In 5–10% of the population, ΔIQ more than one germ tube emerged and in some cases up to 5 germ tubes appeared simultaneously from the swollen spore. Furthermore, in 90% of the germlings a second germ tube appeared at an odd angle, instead of emerging on the side opposite the first germtube as in the wild type control. The ΔIQ mutant strain produced hyphae that were contorted and kinked with visibly thickened cell walls. The average diameter of the hyphae was approximately twice that of the control strain (Table V). Multiple hyphal branches from a single subapical compartment were frequently observed and the branches were perpendicular rather than the acute angle seen in the wild type. Septa were also irregularly spaced and were often formed at odd angles (Fig. 8). Septa were placed every 16 ± 7 μm compared with the 39 ± 5 μm in the wild type control hyphae (Table V).Table VSeptal spacing and size of the sub apical hyphal compartments for the various mutants and the control, CL3-WTStrainWidthLengthCL3-WT1.8 ± 039 ± 5FSBamHI1.8 ± 039 ± 6ΔSH31.8 ± 039 ± 5ΔIQ3.9 ± 1.116 ± 7FSXhoI2.1 ± 0.513.5 ± 7The values are"

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear phagocytes are both derived from bone marrow cells and follow a joined differentiation pathway separating rather late into independent cell lineages. The bifurcation and the final bipotent cell are ill defined, particularly so, since properties of both cell types are still mutually expressed beyond this point (1Metcalf D. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 569-572PubMed Google Scholar). We previously isolated two calcium-binding proteins (MRP81 and MRP14), members of the S-100 protein family, expressed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes continuously and by a subset of blood monocytes, intruding acute inflammatory sites at a very early stage (2Odink K.

In blood monocytes, MRP8 and MRP14 are found in the cytoplasm and rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton when intracellular calcium levels are raised (7Burwinkel F. Roth J.

Although the surface expression of the heterodimer correlates well with increased secretion of TNFα and IL1β (14Bhardwaj R.S. Zotz C. Zwadlo-Klarwasser G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M.

MRPs are involved in cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, cytoskeleton-membrane interaction, and phosphorylation events. Furthermore, antifungal, antibacterial, and chemotactic functions have been described (for a review see Refs. 15Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 16Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res.

Consequently, the proteins are found to be elevated in patients with acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and rheumatoid arthritis (19Lügering N. Stoll R.

Nature. 1989; 342: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). MRP8 and MRP14 have been suggested as new sensitive markers for the different stages of HIV disease (21Lügering N. Stoll R. Kucharzik T. Burmeister G. Sorg C. Domschke W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 101: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Besides the functional importance, the regulation of the MRP promoter is of particular interest for a variety of reasons as follows. Using the MRP promotors, new insights into mechanisms of gene expression in myeloid/monocytic are acquired, since the expression in noninflammatory tissue is absolutely restricted to these cells. The MRP promotors are highly effective in these cells; MRPs are highly expressed, up to 1% of the total proteins of monocytes and up to 45% of the total protein content of granulocytes (18Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). MRP8 and MRP14 are expressed by the same cells in acute inflammation but by different cells in chronic inflammation (22Goebeler M. Roth J. Burwinkel F. Vollmer E. Böcker W. Sorg C. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Delabie J. De Wolf-Peeters van den Oord J.J. Desmet V.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1990; 81: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which enables us to find regulatory proteins. Finally, a relatively small portion of the MRP8 promoter (1 kilobase pair) is sufficient for lineage-specific expression as demonstrated in transgenic mice (24Lagasse E. Weissman I.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, the MRP promoters are specific for monocytes and granulocytes and also responsible for a high transcription rate. Furthermore, the regulatory elements important for lineage-specific expression are located within 1 kilobase pair of the promoter, opening the possibility of designing short constructs useful for cell-specific expression. The promoter of MRP14 contains several putative protein binding sites, as derived from a computerized search using the “Transfec Matrix Table” (41Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knüppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Some of them are reported to predominate in the myeloid lineage (Fig. 1). However, whether or not these transcription factors play a major role in regulating the expression of MRP14 needs to be determined experimentally. We present evidence that part of the first intron of the MRP14 gene contains an enhancer element, which increases the transcriptional efficiency up to 37-fold when cloned to a heterologous promoter. This enhancing element is located between positions 153 and 192 of the gene as demonstrated in combination with the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter. Additionally, we demonstrate that DNA-binding proteins interact specifically with the enhancer, and we could purify four proteins forming a complex with the enhancer. The sequence of this fragment shows high homology to elements at corresponding positions in the first intron of other MRPs (6Lagasse E. Weissman I.L. Blood. 1992; 79: 1907-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar,26Nacken W. Manitz M.P. Sorg C.

Nacken, unpublished observations. but no homology was found to binding sites of commonly known transcription factors. A human genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened by plaque hybridization using a32P-labeled DNA fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction. This fragment was amplified using human genomic DNA as template and the primers 5′-GGGGTTAGAAGGGTTCTCAG (position −520 of the MRP14 gene) and 5′-ATCACTGTGGAGTAGGGG (position −1000 of the MRP14 gene; Ref. 25Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). From 6 × 105 independent clones, three positive plaques were identified and purified. One clone containing approximately 7 kilobase pairs of the promoter was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pSP72 cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and further analyzed by restriction analysis and sequencing. The pCAT3-Basic vector (Promega) was used to test the MRP14 exon/intron I in combination with the homologous promoter. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned into the pSP72 cloning vector (Promega). To investigate the enhancing activity of the first exon/intron of the human MRP14 gene, the first exon and the first intron of the MRP14 gene were cloned adjacent to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (27McKnight S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5949-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). An overview of the used constructs is shown in Fig. 4: 1) the TK-promoter in the 5′-position of the MRP14 exon/intron (pTK14C), 2) the TK promoter in the 3′-position of the MRP14 exon/intron (p14TKC), 3) the TK promoter 5′ to the MRP14 exon/intron with a deletion of the HindIII–HindIII fragment covering positions 153–369 within the 1st intron (pTK14CΔH), and 4) resubstitution of the HindIII fragment with a fragment of exactly the same size generated by polymerase chain reaction using pSP72 as template (pTK14Cart). To compare the different constructs, a reference plasmid was designed that expresses CAT only under TK promoter control (pTKC). Additionally, the region 153–192 of the MRP14 gene was cloned 5′ to the TK promoter in pTKC (pE14TKC). To confirm the specificity of the DNA element, a mutated DNA fragment containing a NOT1 restriction site (GCGGCCGC) instead of the sequence ACTTTCT was cloned 5′ to the TK promoter in pTKC (pNot1TKC). HL-60 cells (ATTC CCL240) and L132 (ATTC CCL5) were cultured using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. L132 cells are embryonic lung fibroblasts that have been demonstrated to express neither MRP8 nor MRP14 (25Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were treated with 1.25% Me2SO for 3 days to differentiate into granulocytic cells (28Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently electroporated. Mono Mac 6 cells (DSM ACC 124) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvic acid, and 9 μg/ml bovine insulin (27McKnight S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5949-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed as described previously (30Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 7 × 106 cells were electroporated with 30 μg of DNA, 960 microfarads at 290 V for HL-60 and 960 microfarads at 250 V for Mono Mac 6 cells and L132 fibroblasts using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were incubated in the appropriate medium for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. To analyze the transcriptional activity of the constructs, the activity of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase was determined by using [3H]coenzyme A as substrate in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8 (31Sambrock J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were extracted by a modification of the method of Chomzynski and Sacchi (32Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 162: 156-159Crossref Google Scholar) using guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform extraction to provide total RNA samples. Aliquots of the RNA (20 μg) were separated on a denaturing 1.5% agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane, and probed with32P-labeled human MRP14 according to standard methods (31Sambrock J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Finally, the membrane was washed twice with 0.1% SSC at 65 °C and exposed to an x-ray film for 2 days. Nuclear protein extracts were obtained by using a micropreparation technique (33Andrew N.A. Faller V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) and were allowed to swell for 10 min on ice. After brief centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9) and incubated for 20 min on ice for high salt extraction. The nuclear proteins were further purified by centrifugation and subsequently snap-frozen in N2 and stored at −70 °C. DNA fragments of interest were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase or with [α-32P]CTP using Klenow fragment. The assay was performed as described with minor adaptations (34Knight G.B. Gudas J.M. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 84: 8350-8354Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear protein were incubated with 1 ng of radiolabeled DNA in 15 μl of binding buffer (0.56 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in 12 mm HEPES, 12% glycerol, 4 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After electrophoresis using 6 or 8% polyacrylamide gels, the shifted DNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography. Using 32P-labeled bromine/uridine-modified oligonucleotides (positions 153–177), DNA-protein UV cross-linking was performed. After incubation of the DNA with nuclear protein under the same conditions as for EMSA analysis, the reactions were subjected to UV cross-linking (3000 microwatts/cm2, Crosslinker 1800; Stratagene) for 15 min at 4 °C. This reaction was analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent autoradiography. Southwestern analysis was performed as described by Chen et al. (35Chen X. Sadlock J.K.

Nuclear protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 15% acrylamide under standard conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher and Schüll, Dassel, Germany) and subsequently renatured in buffer A (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Ficoll 400, and 0.02% polyvinylpyrolidone). Prehybridization was performed in buffer A supplemented with 5% milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. For hybridization, 5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and the32P-labeled probe described above in a concentration of 104- 105 cpm/ml were added to the prehybridization mixture. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in buffer A at room temperature and subsequently autoradiographed at −70 °C for visualization of the DNA-protein interaction. Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) and bound to streptavidin magnetic beads (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear protein extract from Mono Mac 6 cells and the oligonucleotide-coupled magnetic beads were incubated in EMSA-binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the beads were washed with 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, supplemented with increasing concentrations of NaCl as indicated in Fig. 10. The obtained proteins were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (31Sambrock J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from Mono Mac 6 cells and analyzed by Northern blot analysis using human MRP14 cDNA as probe (Fig. 2). Unstimulated HL-60 cells and Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells were analyzed on the same blot. No MRP14 mRNA could be detected in unstimulated HL-60 cells, whereas Me2SO-stimulated HL-60 cells expressed MRP14 mRNA. Nonstimulated Mono Mac 6 cells expressed MRP14 mRNA to a slightly lesser extent than Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 2). The MRP14 promoter from position −1000 was cloned with or without the first exon/intron positioned 5′ to the CAT gene (Fig. 3). These constructs (pHM1.0TC3 with first exon/intron and pHM1.0EC3 lacking first exon/intron) were used to transfect HL-60 cells stimulated with 1.25% Me2SO and unstimulated Mono Mac 6 cells (Fig. 3). In both cell lines, doubling of CAT activity was observed when the exon/intron 1 was present (Fig. 3). To distinguish whether the enhancing activity is dependent on the promoter or on the position of the enhancing elements with respect to the promoter, pTKCAT constructs were used to transfect Mono Mac 6 cells and human L132 embryonic fibroblasts. To compare the transcriptional activity resulting from 12–16 independent electroporations, all data are presented in relation to the CAT activity of the basic plasmid, pTKC, which contains the TK promoter and the CAT encoding sequence. The exon/intron I fragment of the MRP14 gene cloned in the 3′-position of the TK promoter (pTK14C) enhances the transcriptional rate 9.8-fold in Mono Mac 6 cells and 37-fold in L132 cells (Fig. 4). Electroporation of Mono Mac 6 and L132 cells with a construct in which the position of the MRP14 exon/intron 1 lies 5′ to the TK promoter (p14TKC) reveals that the transcriptional rate is increased 10.2- and 21.6-fold, respectively. The deletion of theHindIII–HindIII fragment at positions 153–361 (pTK14CΔH) of the MRP14 intron 1 abolished the enhancing properties of the exon/intron 1 fragment. Also, the substitution with a DNA fragment of the same size and location as theHindIII–HindIII fragment (pTK14CHart) does not lead to an increase in CAT activity. The first 39 base pairs of the HindIII fragment of the MRP14 first intron (positions 153–193, pE14TKC) are able to increase the transcription in both Mono Mac 6 cells and L132 cells (Fig. 5) 17- and 27-fold, respectively. Substitution of the sequence ACTTTTCT within the 39-base fragment with a NOT1 restriction site (pNot1TKC) diminished the enhancing activity. The binding of nuclear factors to the MRP14 intron I (positions 153–192) fragment is demonstrated in Fig. 6. Nuclear protein extracts of Mono Mac 6 cells, Me2SO-stimulated HL-60 cells, unstimulated HL-60 cells, L132 cells, and granulocytes contain several proteins capable of interacting with the DNA (Fig. 6), while proteins from E. coli as negative control are not capable of inducing a gel shift. A total of five band shifts can be distinguished using electrophoresis mobility assay. These bands are seen in all cells investigated, although the absolute concentration of the different proteins appears to vary. EMSA analysis with the mutated 39 base fragment used in the transfection experiments (Fig. 5) revealed that the mutated fragment was unable to bind proteins in L132 or Mono Mac 6 cells (NotI, Fig. 7).Figure 7The protein binding to the intron of the MRP14 gene is DNA-specific. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by using MRP14 DNA (positions 153–192, EL1), or a mutated fragment (NotI) as probe. Nuclear protein extracts of Mono Mac 6 cells and L132 cells were subjected to EMSA analysis. The observed shifts are indicated by arrows. While the shifts are visible using the MRP14 probe, no band shift can be observed when the mutated DNA fragment is used. Therefore, binding of nuclear proteins to the MRP14 DNA (gene positions 153–192) is DNA-specific to the sequence ACTTTTCT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the binding protein, the Southwestern technique was employed. The blotted nuclear protein cells (Mono Mac 6, HL-60, HL-60 Me2SO, and L132 fibroblasts) were incubated with the labeled 39-base fragment (positions 153–192 of the MRP14 gene). As presented in Fig. 8, several proteins that bind under these conditions to the DNA can be distinguished; two proteins predominate that migrate corresponding to a size of 38 kDa. These proteins are visible in all tested cells, although the expression is comparably low in L132 fibroblasts. One protein is present in higher quantities in all nuclear protein extracts corresponding to a molecular mass of 65 kDa. Another protein of 50 kDa can be detected in faint amounts. Proteins of E. coli do not bind at all to the DNA used in these experiments. Using UV DNA cross-linking, two interacting proteins are visible in all cells under investigation. These proteins migrate at 35 and 38 kDa (Fig. 9). A further band is observable at 45 kDa in Mono Mac 6 monocytes and L132 fibroblasts. As indicated in Fig. 9, affinity purification of Mono Mac 6 monocytes using the DNA fragment from 153 to 192 of the MRP14 gene results in four proteins that elute at 250 mm NaCl. These proteins remain bound to the DNA at NaCl concentrations of 220 mm,at which nonspecifically binding proteins are rapidly eluted. Higher NaCl concentrations (500 mm) elute no further proteins from the DNA. In this report, we investigated the expression of MRP14 in myeloid/monocytic cells using promoter constructs containing or lacking the first intron of the MRP14 gene. Our experiments revealed a strong enhancer element within the first intron, which is localized between positions 153 and 192 of the MRP14 gene. Furthermore, we found four proteins that specifically bind the enhancer element. Together, these proteins in combination with the enhancer element contribute to the high expression of MRP in monocytes and granulocytes (18Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), while the cell type-specific elements need to be determined. Functional analysis of the regulation of MRP14 expression in myeloid/monocytic cells made it necessary to select cell lines reflecting the pattern of MRP14 expression in granulocytes and monocytes. The expression of MRP8 and MRP14 in Me2SO-stimulated HL-60 cells, which represent granulocytes (28Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been demonstrated previously (36Roth J. Goebeler M. van den Bos C. Sorg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that Mono Mac 6 cells also express MRP14 in sufficient amounts to perform transfection experiments (Fig. 2). Therefore, Mono Mac 6 cells were chosen as a useful model to study MRP14 gene regulation, particularly in terms of its monocytic characteristics (29Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Thiel E. Fütterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Riethmüller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The MRP14 gene contains three exons, and the translation start site is localized at position 430 in exon 2 (Fig. 1 (25Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)). We present evidence that cells transfected with constructs containing the entire first intron showed significantly higher CAT activity compared with those cells that are transfected with constructs containing only the 5′-regulatory region of the MRP 14 gene (Fig. 3). We conclude that there must be an enhancing element in the first intron. According to the definitions (37Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1987; 245: 371-378Crossref Scopus (2195) Google Scholar), the DNA element found here is an enhancer; it works well in a heterogeneous promoter (pTK14C; Fig. 4), and it functions independently of the position (p14TKC; Fig. 4). In addition to the deletion and the substitution experiment (pTK14CΔH, pTK14Cart) a short 39-base fragment was cloned adjacent to the thymidine kinase promoter (pE14TKC). The strong enhancing effect was observable in both the Mono Mac 6 monocytes and the L132 fibroblasts (Fig. 5). Therefore, the enhancer is localized in the region between positions 153 and 192 of the MRP14 gene. Substitution of the MRP element (EL1) with a mutant DNA fragment (NotI) demonstrates the sequence of the enhancer EL1 (ACTTTTCT). The mutated DNA was neither able to induce a gel shift (Fig. 7) nor able to enhance the TK promoter (Fig. 5). The location of enhancers within introns has been reported for various genes (38Lefebvre V. Mukhopadhyay K. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Smith C. Eberspaecher H. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 785: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest that genes expressed in blood cells i.e. immunoglobulin μ, mts-1, interleukin-4, interferon-γ, or eosinophil-derived neurotoxin genes are frequently reported to contain intron enhancers (39Rao E. Dang W. Tian G. Sen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6722-6732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Tulchinsky E. Prokhortchouk E. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol.

Some of these enhancers are cell-specific like the enhancers in the interferon-γ (53Ciccarone V.C. Chrivia J. Hardy K.J. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 725-730PubMed Google Scholar) or the interleukin-4 gene (52Henkel G. Weiss D.L. McCoy R. Deloughery T. Tara D. Brown M.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3239-3246PubMed Google Scholar). Other enhancers like the κ-B site in the mts-1 gene exhibit their enhancing activity even in cells where the gene is not expressed, as has been demonstrated here. It might be useful to investigate whether blood cell-specific genes use intron-located enhancers to regulate gene expression. The enhancer described here is obviously more potent in combination with the TK promoter than in combination with the MRP14 promoter (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). This is probably due to the basal activity of the promoters; while the TK promoter is known to be moderately efficient, the MRP14 promoter in myeloid cells is as strong as the cytomegalovirus promoter. Therefore, using the MRP14 promoter, the transcription machinery of the cell is maximal active, whereas there is more potential for increase of the transcription rate with the TK promoter. On the basis of EMSA, Southwestern blot, DNA cross-linking, and affinity purification experiments, we were able to show that the enhancer binds several proteins, which are expressed in Mono Mac 6, in L132 fibroblasts, and in HL-60 cells with and without Me2SO stimulation (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10). The fact that we found the same patterns of proteins, as shown by the molecular weights, by a variety of different techniques demonstrates that our findings are sound. Furthermore, the abundance of these proteins correlates well with the activity of the enhancer in cell lines tested here (Mono Mac 6, L132, and HL-60 Me2SO; see Fig. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5(data for HL-60 without stimulation not shown)). Therefore, the proposed enhancer is not limited to specific cell lines but is potent in all tested cells. Homology analysis of the first intron of both human and mouse MRP8 and MRP14 allows us to define the binding element as a DNA sequence with considerable homology in the different MRP genes (Fig. 11). The core sequence of 8 nucleotides is found in all MRP genes at nearly identical positions at the beginning of intron 1, and this sequence is part of the 39 bases that are substantial enough to enhance the transcriptional rate. Further investigations will prove whether this element is involved in the regulation of the gene expression of all MRPs. Data bank analysis using the DNA sequence of this element reveals that it can be found in at least two other genes. The murine BOX DNA contains this sequence 5′ to the transcription start site (43Kihara-Negishi F. Tsujita R. Negishi Y. Ariga H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7747-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the BOX is responsible for enhanced gene expression in embryonic cells. The enhancing activity is decreased upon further differentiation (43Kihara-Negishi F. Tsujita R. Negishi Y. Ariga H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7747-7756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a feature that has been reported for the MRP expression in monocytes (5Roth J. Goebeler M. Wrocklage V. van den Bos C. Sorg C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Roth J. Goebeler M. van den Bos C. Sorg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Warner-Bartnicki A.L. Murao S. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Additionally, this proposed enhancer can be found in the intron B of the glucophorin E gene (45Kudo S. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22969-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is mainly expressed in an erythroid-specific manner. To date, the available information is insufficient to decide whether or not the element described plays an important role in the expression of these genes. Nonetheless, this element is obviously present in genes that are expressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic cells. It is tempting to speculate that it is predominantly involved in undifferentiated blood cells like early monocytes. The enhancer element described here could be used to increase the transcriptional activity of weak but otherwise very cell-specific promoters. The shortness of the element enhances the opportunity to express desired proteins under the control of cell-specific promotors at high levels. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm or disprove the theory that the cell specificity of any promoter is not affected by the element described. We thank B. Scheibel for excellent secretarial help, Dr. F. Schönlau for critical reading of the manuscript, and D. Wiesmann for superior technical assistance."

Circadian rhythms are synchronized or entrained by external stimuli, particularly environmental light. In birds and reptiles, the isolated pineal gland is directly photosensitive and synthesizes melatonin rhythmically under the regulation of an endogenous circadian oscillator (2Binkely S.

In contrast, the mammalian pineal gland does not directly respond to light (9Axelrod J. Science. 1974; 184: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Light exerts two distinct effects on avian pineal melatonin synthesis. First, light acutely suppresses the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme, arylalkylamineN-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT)1 without limiting the synthesis of its mRNA (10Bernard M. Iuvone P.M. Cassone B.M. Roseboom H. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Second, light entrains the phase of the circadian oscillator (reviewed in Ref. 8Takahashi J.S. Murakami N. Nikaido S.S. Pratt B.L. Robertson L.M. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1989; 45: 279-352PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn regulates the transcription of AA-NAT (10Bernard M. Iuvone P.M. Cassone B.M. Roseboom H. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. J.

The phototransduction pathway that leads to these two effects has not yet been elucidated, and the relationship between the acute and phase-shift responses is uncertain. Acute photo-suppression of chick pineal melatonin synthesis and photo-entrainment of the circadian clock respond to a spectrally broad range of wavelengths with equivalent sensitivity between 450 and 500 nm (12Deguchi T.

A rhodopsin-like photopigment was postulated to mediate pineal phototransduction based on several observations: sensitivity to light in the visible region; an action spectrum consistent with vitamin A-based pigments (12Deguchi T.

Using molecular cloning, a chicken pinealocyte-specific cDNA was recently identified that encodes a protein with strong similarity to the visual opsins (1Max M. McKinnon P.J. Seidenman K.J.

Max, submitted for publication.2L. Ruiz-Avila, R. F. Margolskee, and M. Max, submitted for publication. suggesting that P-opsin might mediate pineal phototransduction. A consideration of P-opsin's amino acid sequence suggests that it binds 11-cis-retinal and activates transducin. To characterize the spectral and biochemical properties of P-opsin, an epitope-tagged P-opsin was expressed in embryonic chick pineal cells (CP3 cells; Ref.22Sheshbaradaran H. Takahashi J.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). P-opsin was regenerated with 11-cis-retinal and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography to obtain absorption spectra. In addition, we characterized the ability of expressed P-opsin to catalyze light-dependent guanyl nucleotide exchange on bovine rod transducin. To create the epitope-tagged P-opsin cDNA (23Mackenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J. Molday R. Biochem. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), anEcoRI-ApaI fragment of the P-opsin gene was cloned into pMT4 (24Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

The resulting cDNA was subcloned as anEcoRI-NotI fragment into pBK-RSV (with the prokaryotic promoter removed; Stratagene) and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. CP3, a clonal, immortal, transformed cell line derived from chick pinealocytes (E10) following exposure to MH2 chicken retrovirus, have been described elsewhere (22Sheshbaradaran H. Takahashi J.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CP3 cells, grown in suspension culture, were freshly dispersed on poly-l-ornithine-treated plates (106cells/15-cm plate) and treated with calcium phosphate-precipitatedStuI-linearized plasmid (25Graham F.L. van der EB A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6485) Google Scholar). Stable lines were selected in media containing G418 (120 μg/ml). After 3 weeks, floating clonal clumps of CP3 cells were propagated separately. Fifty lines were grown, and of these, 20 were tested for P-opsin protein expression by RNase protection assay (1Max M.

P-opsin-positive CP3 cells were grown in flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium and 10% fetal bovine serum containing G418 (60 μg/ml), 0.4 mm retinal acetate and penicillin-streptomycin. Half of the growth media and cells were harvested every other day and replaced by fresh media. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed once with 1× buffer Y1 (1× = 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.6, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2), resuspended in a small volume of 1× buffer Y1. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cells were pooled to obtain ∼6 × 108 cells, centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 20 ml of 0.1× buffer Y1 containing 50 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell slurry was disrupted by passage through progressively narrower syringe needles and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 30 min to pellet nuclei. Membranes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 9 ml of 1× buffer Y2 (= buffer Y1 containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and supplemented with 50 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All subsequent steps were performed under dim red light (Kodak no. 2) at 4 °C. Membranes and 11-cis-retinal (final concentration, 5 μm) were incubated overnight, solubilized by the addition of 10% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside (DM) to a final concentration of 1% DM, and incubated for 2 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The P-opsin protein was purified on 1D4-Sepharose by immunoaffinity chromatography (26Oprian D. Molday R. Kaufman R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 27Starace D. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin from bovine retina was purified in parallel with P-opsin. Lipid was added to the samples from a sonicated stock of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC, Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.2% egg PC (w/v) and 0.2% DM (w/v) in 1× buffer Y2. Following incubation in dark on ice for at least 1 h, the P-opsin lipid-detergent mixture was diluted for subsequent experiments. UV-visible absorption spectra of pigments were performed at 20 °C in buffer Y2 containing 0.1% DM. Spectra were recorded with a Beckman DU 640 single beam spectrophotometer equipped with a water-jacketed cuvette holder. The pigment concentrations were determined spectroscopically from the absorbance maxima, using the extinction coefficient of rhodopsin. Pigment was treated in the dark with 50 mm hydroxylamine (pH 6.7), and absorbance was monitored at various times following addition. The half time for the reaction was determined by fitting the absorbance at 462 nm versus time to a single exponential decay function (SigmaPlot software). Bovine transducin purification and [35S]GTPγS exchange assays have been described elsewhere (28Bubis J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12995-12999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Purified transducin bound 0.9–1.0 mol of [35S]GTPγS/mol of protein in the presence of excess, light-activated rhodopsin. The concentration of active transducin in each assay was determined independently by the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound in response to an excess of light-activated rhodopsin. Reactions were carried out at 22 °C in 0.01% DM, 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μm [35S]GTPγS (1400–4000 cpm/pmol) with transducin and initiated by exposing the samples to light from a 300-watt projector (Eastman Kodak) at a distance of 50–60 cm using a high-pass colored glass cut-off filter (>515 nm, Edmund Scientific Inc., Barrington, NJ). All data were corrected for [35S]GTPγS binding to transducin in the absence of pigment (typically 5–8% of the maximum). The lifetime of the active species was determined by illuminating (λmax> 515) a solution of P-opsin or rhodopsin (in buffers as indicated in the figure legends) at 22 °C. At the times indicated, an aliquot of the pigment solution was added to reaction buffer containing transducin and [35S]GTPγS and the reaction proceeded for 1 h before filtering through nitrocellulose. Data were fit using SigmaPlot (Jandel). The small size of the chicken pineal gland prohibits ready purification of P-opsin or other phototransduction components for functional assays. Therefore, P-opsin was expressed in transfected cells. To enable purification (26Oprian D. Molday R. Kaufman R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) of the expressed protein, an 8-amino acid epitope derived from bovine rhodopsin (amino acids 341–348) was added to the carboxyl terminus of P-opsin. This minor carboxyl addition is not expected to significantly change the properties of P-opsin based on results from proteolytic cleavage of bovine rhodopsin or spectral characterization and transducin activation by similarly tagged pigments (27Starace D.

All experiments reported below were performed with the epitope-tagged P-opsin. Previous workers have used a monkey kidney cell line (COS1; Refs. 31Oprian D.D. Asenjo A.B. Lee N. Pelletier S.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11367-11372Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholarand 34Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

Genet. 1992; 26: 403-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to express functional visual proteins. Western blot analysis showed levels of P-opsin protein expressed in COS1 cells comparable to protein levels obtained for bovine rhodopsin (∼4 μg/107 COS1 cells; data not shown). However, there was barely detectable pigment formed upon incubation of cells with 11-cis-retinal (6 ng of pigment/107 COS1 cells or ∼0.15% pigment formation). This extremely low level of P-opsin pigment formation was similar to that observed previously using HEK293 cells (21Okano T. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. Nature. 1994; 270: 94-97Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A chicken embryonic pineal cell line (CP3; Ref. 22Sheshbaradaran H. Takahashi J.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1994; 5: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which does not express P-opsin (Fig. 1), was chosen as an alternative expression system. CP3 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding P-opsin under the control of the Rous sarcome virus promoter. Individual G418-resistant clones varied by more than 10-fold in the level of mRNA for P-opsin (Fig. 1 A), reaching levels comparable to that in pineal gland in lines 4 and 9. Line 9 had the strongest immunofluorescence signal (Fig. 1 B) and thus was chosen to produce the P-opsin for in vitroexperiments. Immunostaining of epitope-tagged P-opsin was most prominent around the cell periphery, indicating that P-opsin was targeted to the cell membrane (Fig. 1 B). The parental cell line did not show any reactivity to the 1D4 antibody. CP3 cell-expressed P-opsin was only found in the membrane fraction (data not shown), and Western blots of the membranes showed two broad bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼40 and ∼43 kDa (Fig. 1 C). The presence of two labeled bands suggests that P-opsin is heterogeneously glycosylated. This was confirmed by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F, which transformed both original bands to the same higher mobility band (data not shown). From the deduced amino acid sequence, there are two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (1Max M. McKinnon P.J. Seidenman K.J. Barrett R.K. Applebury M.L. Takahashi J.S. Margolskee R.F. Science. 1995; 267: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The sizes of the bands in P-opsin expressing CP3 membranes suggest that both sites are utilized. To determine if P-opsin can form a photopigment, membranes were incubated with 11-cis-retinal in the dark. The purified P-opsin exhibited a peak absorption at 462 ± 2 nm (Fig. 2 A) with a profile similar in shape to that of rhodopsin (Fig. 2 A, inset), with some distortion in the blue region, due to protein absorption (280 nm). An important property of 11-cis-retinal (A1)-based pigments is an increase in bandwidth with decreasing λmax (36Ebrey T.G. Honig B. Vision Res. 1977; 17: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Using the long wavelength side of the P-opsin peak to estimate bandwidth, we found a half-bandwidth of 4590 cm−1 for P-opsin and 4230 cm−1 for rhodopsin (λmax = 500 nm). The observed value for the P-opsin pigment agrees with the value (4600 cm−1) predicted from the visual pigment nomogram (36Ebrey T.G. Honig B. Vision Res. 1977; 17: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A dark-light difference spectrum in the presence of hydroxylamine (Fig. 2 B) shows that the 462 nm absorbance disappears with a corresponding increase in absorbance at 363 nm, consistent with the formation of retinaloxime. Purified P-opsin, regenerated with 11-cis-retinal, was denatured in the dark at pH 1.8. This treatment stably traps protonated Schiff base linkages (440 nm) and otherwise eliminates interactions of retinal with the apoprotein (37Kito Y. Suzuki T. Azuma M. Sekoguti Y. Nature. 1968; 218: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Acid-trapped P-opsin exhibited a shift in peak absorbance from 462 nm to 440 nm, with a slight increase in bandwidth (Fig. 2 C), consistent with results from rhodopsin (37Kito Y. Suzuki T. Azuma M. Sekoguti Y. Nature. 1968; 218: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ratio of the acidic to the control peak heights indicates that the extinction coefficient for P-opsin is similar to that of rhodopsin (∼40,000m−1 cm−1), although a more precise estimate of the extinction coefficient was not possible due to the significant increase in absorbance at short wavelengths following acid denaturation. The absorption spectrum of P-opsin had a higher than expected ratio of 280 nm to 462 nm peaks (∼5), when compared with rhodopsin (280/500 nm ratio of ∼1.6; Ref. 38Ridge K.D. Lu A. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Biochem. 1995; 34: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) due to proteins in the preparation that do not absorb at 462 nm: either misfolded P-opsin or other co-purifying proteins. A silver-stained gel of purified P-opsin showed two prominent P-opsin bands (Fig. 3 B, bands 2 and 3) that were reactive with the 1D4 antibody in a corresponding Western blot (Fig. 3 A). One distinct band and several minor ones appeared in the silver-stained gel that did not label with 1D4 (Fig. 3 B). The unlabeled protein(s) did not appear in 1D4-Sepharose immunopurified material from parental CP3 cell membranes (data not shown); thus, the presence of non-P-opsin proteins in the immunopurified preparation results from an interaction with P-opsin. The high ratio of A 280/A 462 is primarily due to the presence of non-opsin protein. However, there may also be a small amount of misfolded or non-functional P-opsin in the preparation. In darkness cone pigments bleach rapidly in the presence of hydroxylamine, but typical rhodopsins are stable (39Yoshizawa T. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 40Starace D. Knox B.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Kawamura S. Yokoyama S. Vis.

Tonosaki A. Tokunaga F. Photochem Photobiol. 1997; 66: 792-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Bleaching of the pigment in the presence of hydroxylamine in darkness indicates that the chromophore is accessible to the aqueous environment. We added hydroxylamine to purified P-opsin pigment in the dark and observed the effect on the absorption spectrum over time (Fig. 4). P-opsin bleached in the presence of hydroxylamine. However, the reaction occurred slowly, with a half time of decay of approximately 2 h; absorbance at 462 nm persisted even after 5 h. Visual pigments interact in a light-dependent fashion with transducins and stimulate the exchange of bound guanyl nucleotide. Sequence homology with visual opsins suggests that P-opsin may interact with a transducin. In fact, transducin immunoreactivity has been observed in chicken pineal (18Van Veen T. Ostholm T. Gierschik P. Spiegel A. Somers R. Korf H.W. Klein D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and rod, but not cone, transducin α subunit mRNA has been detected in chicken pineal gland.2 These results and others (44Okano T. Takanaka Y. Nakamura A. Hirunagi K. Adachi A. Ebihara S. Fukada Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 50: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggest that P-opsin and rod transducin proteins are present in the same cells (pinealocytes) and may provide a phototransduction pathway. We investigated the interaction of P-opsin with exogenously added bovine transducin, since bovine and chick α transducins are nearly identical (45Okano T. Yamazaki K. Kasahara T. Fukada Y. J Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 91-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine transducin is readily available. Nucleotide exchange assays were performed using purified components under conditions that produce high activity of similarly prepared bovine rhodopsin (46Franke R. Sakmar T. Graham R. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and violet cone opsin (27Starace D. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transducin activation by P-opsin was strictly light-dependent (i.e. in the dark, nucleotide exchange was the same as transducin alone), and addition of phospholipid did not alter the rate of transducin activation (Fig. 5 A). Under these conditions, the reaction was complete by 10 min and was not limited by the available transducin (Fig. 5 A; see below). Varying concentrations of purified P-opsin were exposed to light and nucleotide exchange reactions were allowed to go to completion. The total number of activated transducins increased with increasing P-opsin concentration, eventually reaching saturation (Fig. 5 B, closed symbols). Approximately 50% of the transducin that could be activated by excess rhodopsin was activated by P-opsin, indicating that the cessation of activity was not caused by depletion of unactivated transducin. Moreover, the concentration of P-opsin required to produce 50% of the maximum turnovers was similar for both transducin concentrations (6 nm P-opsin for 3 μm transducin compared with 3 nm P-opsin for 1 μm transducin), and substantially below the concentration of transducin throughout the reaction. At concentrations below 1 μm transducin, the fraction of transducin activated dropped significantly (Fig. 5 B). Thus, it appears that P-opsin exhibits an interaction-dependent inactivation; in contrast, bovine rhodopsin is able to activate >95% of the available transducin. In the linear portion of the P-opsin concentration range, P-opsin catalyzed the exchange of GTPγS on a large number of transducin molecules (162 GTPγS bound/P-opsin and 80 GTPγS bound/P-opsin at 3 μm and 1 μmtransducin respectively). Exogenously added lipid did not have a significant effect on the total number of transducins activated (Fig. 5 B, open symbols). The initial rates of GTPγS exchange at different transducin concentrations were measured using light-activated P-opsin and bovine rhodopsin. Comparing the slopes of the linear portions of the curves (Fig. 6), the initial rate of nucleotide exchange catalyzed by rhodopsin was 2–3 times faster than that achieved with P-opsin. These results indicate that the efficiency of P-opsin interaction with rod transducin (the binding affinity, catalytic turnover rate, or both) is lower than that of rhodopsin. The addition of phospholipid decreased the initial rate of activation by 1.5–2-fold. In contrast, rhodopsin exhibited a significant, 4-fold increase in activity in the presence of lipid. Compared with P-opsin in lipid micelles, rhodopsin had a 15–20-fold faster initial rate. Visual pigments respond to light by going through a series of photo-intermediates leading to a metastable state (metarhodopsin II) that stimulates transducin (47Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The metarhodopsin II state decays to the apoprotein plus all-trans-retinal, and the time course of the decay plays an important role in phototransduction. To determine the stability of its active state, P-opsin was exposed to light for various times prior to addition to the nucleotide exchange reaction. At low detergent concentrations (0.01%), P-opsin exhibited a slow decay in active conformation, with a half-time of about 60 min (Fig. 7). Under the same conditions, rhodopsin had a slightly faster decay, with a half-time of about 30 min. Surprisingly, P-opsin did not decay at higher detergent concentrations. When phospholipid was added, P-opsin's decay was dramatically accelerated, with a half-time of about 4 min. The increase in decay of metarhodopsin II in phospholipid compared with detergent has been previously described (reviewed in Ref. 48Brown M.F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 73: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Thus, P-opsin produces a meta-stable active state when exposed to light, with properties that parallel metarhodopsin II. In comparison to other opsins, P-opsin remains active 5 times longer than violet cone opsin (27Starace D. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1095-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and its active state decays more slowly than that of green cone opsin (as estimated by spectroscopic measurements; Refs. 49Imai H. Imamoto Y. Yoshizawa T. Shichida Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10525-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and 50Shichida Y. Imai H. Imamoto Y. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9040-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have investigated several properties of P-opsin and made comparisons to the visual pigments. First, CP3-expressed P-opsin bound 11-cis-retinal with a maximum absorbance at 462 nm, in good agreement with the dark-light difference spectrum (λmax∼470 nm) obtained from a membrane preparation of P-opsin-expressing HEK 293 cells (21Okano T.

RAR- but not RXR-selective retinoids were found in many previous studies to suppress the growth of various cells, implicating RXR-RAR in these effects. Using a co-expression vector for identifying cells that expressed retinoid receptors transiently and 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation for labeling DNA-synthesizing cells, we found that RXR-selective retinoids inhibited DNA synthesis in squamous carcinoma 1483 cells transfected with RXRα but not with RARs.

Studies with RXRα deletion mutants indicated that the DNA binding and the ligand binding domains are essential for mediating growth inhibition. A point mutation in the ligand binding domain (L430F) that decreased RXRα homodimerization compromised its growth inhibitory function. Further, RXRα mutant (F313A), which functions as a constitutively active receptor, inhibited DNA synthesis in the absence of ligand.

Retinoic acid receptors (RARs)1 and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are nuclear retinoid receptors, which belong to the superfamily of steroid hormone receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn H.M. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar, 2Pfahl M. Semin.

Like other members of this superfamily, retinoid receptors have a conserved structure of domains A to F from the N terminus to the C terminus of the molecule, respectively. These domains have distinct functions and can act independently (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn H.M. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar, 2Pfahl M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the receptors (domains A and B) contains an autonomously functioning region called activation function 1 (AF-1), which is involved in ligand-independent transcriptional transactivation and is not well conserved among receptors. Domain C, a DNA binding domain composed of two class II zinc-binding motifs, is highly conserved. Domain D (hinge) is involved in ligand-induced functional changes and in the binding of receptors to co-repressors. Domains E/F, which are moderately conserved among the receptors, are thought to be involved in ligand-binding, ligand-dependent transactivation function 2 (AF-2) and dimerization (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). RARs bind both natural retinoids all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), whereas the RXRs bind only 9-cis-RA (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn H.M.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). Some synthetic retinoids can bind selectively to either RARs or RXRs or their α, β, or γ subtypes (4Lehmann J.M. Dawson M.I. Hobbs P.D. Husmann M. Pfahl M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4804-4809PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M.

Retinoid receptors modulate the expression of their target genes by interacting as either homodimers or heterodimers with specific DNA response elements (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn H.M. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar, 2Pfahl M. Semin.

The affinity of RARs for their target sequence is increased on heterodimerization with RXRs. RXRs dimerize with and enhance the transcriptional activity of not only RARs but also thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and several orphan receptors (3Chambon P.

RXR can also form homotetramers and homodimers, and, in the presence of 9-cis-RA, RXR-RXR dimers can activate gene transcription (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn H.M. Roberts A.B.

Retinoic acid and retinoid X response elements (RARE and RXRE, respectively) are commonly composed of two half sites, each of which provides a binding site for one of the receptor molecules in a dimer. Each of the half sites is a conserved hexanucleotide DNA sequence, 5′-PuG(G/T)TCA-3′, and the two form direct repeats (DR) separated by one to five nucleotides (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn H.M. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar, 2Pfahl M. Semin.

Both the relative orientation and spacing of the half sites is important for receptor recognition and for the subsequent activation or repression of the expression of target genes (12Naar A.M.

For example, in the presence of ligand, RXR-RAR heterodimers bind to and activate transcription on response elements consisting of two direct repeats separated by five nucleotides (DR-5), whereas RXR-RAR heterodimers bind direct repeats spaced by one nucleotide (DR-1) to elicit constitutive repression of gene transcription. In the presence of 9-cis-RA the RXR-RXR homodimer can activate gene transcription from the DR-1 response element (8Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The function of retinoid receptors is also regulated by co-activators and co-repressors that distinguish among different conformations of dimer-DNA complexes induced by ligand binding and dimerization and consequently modulate positively or negatively the expression of target genes by retinoid receptors (3Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar, 16Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

Retinoids were found to be effective inhibitors of cancer development in animal models of carcinogenesis and to suppress premalignant lesions and the development of second primary cancers (19Lotan R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It is thought that some of these activities are the result of the ability of retinoids to inhibit the growth, induce apoptosis, and enhance the differentiation of various tumor cell types (20Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn H.M. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar, 21Lotan R. Degos L. Parkinson D.R. Retinoids in Oncology.

The potential of retinoids in cancer chemoprevention and treatment has spurred efforts to design novel retinoids with improved efficacy. One of the strategies in this effort was to synthesize retinoids that bind selectively individual retinoid receptor types. Among these novel retinoids, some RAR-selective analogues were found to be very effective in suppressing the growth of various tumor cells, whereas most of the RXR-selective analogues were reported to be ineffective in the same cell types (6Sun S-Y.

Dermatol. 1994; 102: 676-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in some cells, RXR-selective analogs were found to enhance the effects of RAR-selective retinoids, a result that suggests that the RXR-RAR but not the RXR-RXR dimer mediates growth inhibition (26Lotan R. Dawson M.I. Zou C.C. Jong L. Lotan D. Zou C-P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 232-236PubMed Google Scholar, 27Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, RXR-selective analogues seem to be less promising as single agents in chemoprevention and treatment of cancer. The expression of certain RARs (e.g. RARβ) is decreased in various tumor cell lines, and retinoid responsiveness could be restored by stably transfecting receptor expression vectors (28Houle B. Rochette-Egly C. Bradley W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Li X.S. Shao Z.M. Sheikh M.S. Eiseman J.L. Sentz D. Jetten A.M. Chen J.C.

Klaus M. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1138-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, the isolation of stable transfectants expressing genes whose products exert growth-inhibitory effects may be difficult and, even if successful, may yield cells that were already partially or completely resistant to the inhibitory effect of this gene product. This problem can perhaps be solved by an inducible promoter or by transient expression of the gene. Whereas the transient transfection approach can provide results much faster than the stable transfection approach, its use is counterindicated when the efficiency of transfection is low. This limitation can be overcome by a method that allows the identification of the cells that express the transfected gene. A single cell proliferation assay has been developed to study the growth-inhibitory function of a candidate gene in a transient expression assay (31Frangioni J.V. Moghal N. Stuart-Tilley A. Neel B.G. Alper S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 827-838PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is based on the pMark vector engineered to co-express a nuclear retinoid receptor and a cell surface antigen (e.g., CD7), which permits identification of transfected cells bearing the antigen using a fluorescently labeled anti-CD7 antibody (31Frangioni J.V. Moghal N. Stuart-Tilley A. Neel B.G. Alper S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 827-838PubMed Google Scholar). Growth inhibition is then determined by labeling DNA-synthesizing nuclei with 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by staining with anti-BrdU antibodies labeled with a different fluorophore (31Frangioni J.V. Moghal N. Stuart-Tilley A. Neel B.G. Alper S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 827-838PubMed Google Scholar). We used the pMark vector to express four nuclear retinoid receptors, RARα1, RARβ2, RARγ1, and RXRα, in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) 1483 cells and then determined the effects of the receptor expression on DNA synthesis in the cells grown in the absence or presence of different receptor-selective retinoids. After we found RXRα to be the most effective among these receptors in suppressing DNA synthesis, we focused on characterizing the effect of RXRα expression and the role of the different receptor domains on the growth and retinoid responsiveness of HNSCC 1483 cells. HNSCC 1483 cell line (32Sacks P.G. Parnes S.M. Gallick G.E. Mansouri Z. Lichtner R. Satya-Prakash K.L. Pathak S. Parsons D.F.

Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2:95% air. Cells were detached by repeated pipetting after a brief incubation with 2 mm EDTA and 0.25% trypsin in a calcium-free and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The retinoids used in this study included RAR-selective (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8,-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNPB), the pan-agonist 9-cis-RA (obtained from Dr. Werner Bollag, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Basel, Switzerland), the RXR-selective 4-[2-methyl-1-[5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)propenyl]benzoic acid (SR11217), 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1,3-dithiane (SR11203), 4-[2-(5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1,3-dithiolan-2-yl]benzoic acid (SR11234), and 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8,-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)cyclopropyl]benzoic acid (SR11246).

Stock solutions were diluted to the appropriate final concentrations in growth medium. Control cultures received the same amount of Me2SO alone. The preparation of nuclear extracts and gel shift assays was performed as described by Rochette-Egly et al. (33Rochette-Egly C. Gaub M.P. Lutz Y. Ali S. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached after trypsinization and collected by centrifugation after two washes with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in five times its volume of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm monothioglycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). The pellet was suspended in 2 volumes of buffer A and homogenized at 4 °C with a Dounce homogenizer (100 pestle strokes). The nuclei were collected by centrifugation (6000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C), solubilized in 3 volumes of buffer B (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 600 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmmonothioglycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 60 min, followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm monothioglycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 6 h. The synthetic oligonucleotides indicated below, which represent the DR-5 RARE and flanking sequences present in the RARβ2 gene (35de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A.

Nuclear extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated with labeled DNA (approximately 10,000 cpm) for 15 min at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol. For supershift analysis, receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies Ab9α (RARα), Ab8β (RARβ), and Ab4γ and Ab9γ (both against RARγ), 4RX (RXRs), and polyclonal antibody RPβ (RARβ) obtained from Dr. Pierre Chambon (IGBM, Illkirch, Strasbourg, France) (33Rochette-Egly C.

The reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 192 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA. All of the above antibodies were capable of supershifting the respective receptors using nuclear extracts from at least one cell type in our laboratory (data not shown). Plasmids containing human cDNAs for RARα1, RARβ2, RARγ1, and RXRα were obtained from Dr. Magnus Pfahl (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, San Diego, CA). The cDNAs were released from pBluescript vectors by digesting withBamHI and HindIII or NotI and HindIII restriction enzymes and blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and then inserted into the SmaI site of the plasmid pMarkCD7Δ5 (Ref. 31Frangioni J.V.

The orientation of the inserted cDNAs was identified by restriction enzyme digestion. The resulting expression vectors were named pMarkRARα, pMarkRARβ, pMarkRARγ, and pMarkRXRα, respectively. RXRα deletion mutants (shown schematically in Fig. 4 A) were prepared in the plasmid pBSRXRα, and the modified RXRα cDNAs were released and inserted into pMarkCD7Δ5. For example, the mutant RXRαΔA was prepared by deleting part of the 5′ end of wild-type RXRα cDNA with HindIII and SmaI, and then the vector was blunted by T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligated. Mutant RXRαΔD was prepared by deleting the fragment between the first and the third NcoI sites (nucleotides 29–197) in wild-type RXRα cDNA. Mutant RXRαΔF was prepared by deleting the 3′ end of RXRα from the first StuI site (nucleotide 402). RXRα point mutants are shown schematically in Fig. 5. pMarkRXRα F313A, a homologue of mouse RXRα F318A (36Vivat V. Zechel C. Wurtz J-M. Bourguet W. Kagechika H. Umemiya H. Shudo K. Moras D.

The released fragments were blunted by Klenow and then ligated into theSmaI site of pMarkCD7Δ5. The success of obtaining the desired deletions and point mutations was assessed by sequence analysis.Figure 5Comparison of activation of retinoid response elements and suppression of DNA synthesis by point mutants and wild-type (WT) RXRα.

HNSCC 1483 cells were seeded at a concentration of 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After 18–24 h, cells were transfected with various pMark vectors using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Each well received 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE. After 6 h, the transfection solution was removed by aspiration, and the cells were refed with medium containing 10% delipidized serum and the indicated concentration of retinoids or Me2SO control. After 36 h, the cells were incubated for 8.5 h with a labeling reagent containing 10 μm BrdU and 1 μm5′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to incorporate BrdU into DNA in cells engaged in DNA synthesis. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed by the gentle addition of absolute methanol (prechilled to −20 °C) for 10 min. Cells were then rehydrated with PBS and washed once in water. Chromosomal DNA was depurinated by treatment with 2 m HCl for 15 min at room temperature. The acid was neutralized by one wash with 0.1m Na2B4O7, pH 8.5, followed by a 2-min incubation in the same solution. Cells were then washed twice with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (IgG1, Becton Dickinson) and anti-CD7 monoclonal antibody (IgG2b clone no. 3A1E-12H7, Sera-Lab, Sussex, United Kingdom), both diluted 1:6 in 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Nonidet P-40/PBS. The cells were washed five times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40/PBS and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) diluted 1:200 in 0.1% Nonidet P-40/PBS. Cells were then washed four times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40/PBS and twice with PBS and observed using an immunofluorescence microscope with filters for the red fluorescence of Texas Red in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface and the green fluorescence of fluorescein isothiocyanate in the cell nuclei. Cells that have taken up the plasmid and synthesized DNA stained both red and green (RG). Cells that have taken up the plasmid but failed to synthesize DNA stained only red (R). The BrdU labeling index (percentage of cells synthesizing DNA among the cells that have taken up the plasmid) was determined from the formula [(RG/(R + RG)]100. Usually, a total population of over 500 cells was analyzed in several arbitrarily chosen microscopic fields. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After overnight culture, cells in each well were transfected with 2 μg of DNA including 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pCH110, and 0.4 μg of pMark or pMark-derived expression vectors using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's procedure. The reporter plasmids included the (RARE)3-tk-LUC, which contains three direct repeats of DR-5 RARE from the P2 promoter region of the human RARβ2 gene (from −59 to −33 base pairs) (35de The H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A.

This gene is a single copy gene, 14 kilobase pair in length and consists of 22 exons. ITIH3shares highly conserved exon size and intron-exon borders with other ITI heavy chain genes. We determined that the human ITIH1, ITIH3, and ITIH4 genes are closely linked within a 45-kilobase pair. They are arranged in the order of H1-H3-H4, with the ITIH4 gene transcribed in the opposite direction. A model for the evolution of the ITI heavy chain gene family is presented that involves multiple rounds of gene duplication plus inversion events. The minimum promoter region (−135 to +75) is identified in HepG2 cells. The transient transfection study in various cell lines indicates that the activity of theITIH3 promoter is not liver-specific. DNase I footprinting, mobility shift assays, and cotransfection experiments reveal a functional CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein site (C/EBP, −1344 to −1305) which interacts with C/EBPα and C/EBPβ factors.

DNase I footprinting, mobility shift assays, and cotransfection experiments reveal a functional CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein site (C/EBP, −1344 to −1305) which interacts with C/EBPα and C/EBPβ factors. The latter factors control the transcription of the ITIH3 gene positively. Human inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 gene.

The inter-α-trypsin inhibitors are a family of structurally related plasma serine protease inhibitors (1Hochstrasser K. Bretzel G. Feuth H. Hilla W. Lempart K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix is a critical event in normal processes such as tissue morphogenesis, differentiation, and wound healing; inter-α-trypsin inhibitors are believed to participate in these events. These glycoproteins are also involved in pathological conditions such as tumor invasion (6Kobayashi H. Gotoh J. Hirashima Y. Fujie M. Sugino D. Terao T. J. Biol.

This family is composed of multiple proteins made up of a given combination of polypeptide chains after complex post-translational maturation (9Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Daveau M. Martin J.P. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Odum L. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Héron A.

Members of the inter-α-trypsin inhibitors family can be divided into two subclasses depending on their composition with or without bikunin (a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor). When bikunin is present, mature heavy chains named HC1, HC2, HC3 are covalently linked to bikunin by an unusual cross-link named protein glycosaminoglycan protein (13Jessen T. Faarvang K.L. Plong M.

It is a glycoprotein of M r 125,000 composed of one heavy chain of M r 90,000, called HC3, and one light chain of M r 16,000, bikunin carrying the glycosaminoglycan (14Enghild J.J. Salvesen G.

The level of pre-α-trypsin inhibitor, an acute-phase protein, rises in response to trauma and inflammation (16Daveau M. Rouet P. Scotte M. Faye L. Hiron M. Lebreton J.P. Salier J.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the pathological synovial fluid from human arthritis patients, HC3 is covalently bound to hyaluronan (17Zhao M. Yoneda M.

Nagasawa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is a member of the bikunin uncompelled subclass (also known as inter-α-trypsin inhibitors heavy chain-related protein) (19Choi-Miura N.-H.

It is a single chain glycoprotein of 120 kDa, cleaved into 85- and 35-kDa fragments when plasma is incubated at 37 °C. PK120 is highly sensitive to plasma kallikrein, and its mRNA is strongly induced in pig's liver after a cardiogenic shock (20Gonzalez-Ramon N. Alava M.A. Sarsa J.A. Pinerio M. Escartin A.

The structures of the different polypeptide forms of the ITI1 family have been determined by molecular cloning of their respective cDNAs (21Kaumeyer J.F. Polazzi J.O. Kotick M.P.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 14977: 207-211Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The five chains of human ITI are encoded in the liver by five distinct genes located on three chromosomes (26Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Matteı̈ M.G. Passage E. Salier J.P. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Tobe T. Saguchi K. Hashimoto K. Miuria N.H. Tomita M. Li F. Wang Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 71: 296-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the human light chain (ITI L) gene has been established (28Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Salier J.P. Léveillard T. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was mapped by in situ hybridization to 9q 32–33. Separate exons of the ITI L precursor code for two proteins, α1-microglobulin and bikunin, which have no typical functional feature (21Kaumeyer J.F. Polazzi J.O. Kotick M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7839-7850Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 28Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Salier J.P. Léveillard T. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The exon-intron organization suggests that the regions coding for α1-microglobulin and other members of the lipocalin superfamily evolved from a common ancestral gene that is different from the gene coding for bikunin, whereas bikunin belongs to the superfamily of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors. These data suggest that two distinct ancestral genes fused during evolution (28Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Salier J.P. Léveillard T. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A functional analysis of the ITI L gene promoter showed the presence of a potent and liver-specific enhancer that drives a weak promoter of ubiquitous activity (29Rouet P. Ragenez G. Tronche F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ITI heavy chain (H) gene family consists of at least four highly homologous genes designated ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3 (26Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Matteı̈ M.G. Passage E. Salier J.P. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and ITIHL1 (27Tobe T. Saguchi K. Hashimoto K. Miuria N.H. Tomita M. Li F. Wang Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 71: 296-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also named ITIH4. TheITIH2 gene has been mapped to 10p 14–15, whereas theITIH1, ITIH3, and ITIH4 genes map to 3p211-p212 (for review, see Ref. 31Bost F. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The ITIH1 gene spans 14 kb and is composed of 22 exons (32Bost F. Bourguignon J. Martin J.P. Sesboüé R. Thiberville L. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ITIH4 gene also spans 14 kb and is composed of 24 exons (33Saguchi K.I. Tobe T. Hashimoto K. Nagasaki Y. Oda E. Nakano Y. Miuta N.H. Tomita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The ITIH1 and ITIH3 genes are tandemly organized and separated by 2.7 kb (34Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sarafan N. Bost F. Sesboüé R. Muschio-Bonnet F. Martin J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These genes are the acute-phase genes that are transcriptionally regulated in a different manner under the influence of interleukin-6 (35Sarafan N. Martin J.P. Bourguignon J. Borghi H. Callé A. Sesboüé R. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms regulating the ITIH3 expression and the relationship between the ITIH3 gene and the family of other ITI heavy chain genes, we undertook a structural and functional analysis of the human ITIH3 gene and its promoter region. We determined the exact number of exons and provided a detailed map of the 5′-flanking and 3′-flanking genomic regions showing that the three genes of the heavy chains are closely linked in a small region on chromosome 3. 106plaques of a human genomic (leukocyte) library (CLONTECH) constructed in EMBL3 were screened by plaque hybridization with full-length ITI heavy chain cDNA probes labeled with 32P by the random primer method. Hybridization was carried out as described by Maniatis et al. (36Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 2.108-2.125Google Scholar). A fragment that overlaps the human ITIH3 and ITIH4 genes was obtained by PCR with primers from the extreme 3′-flanking sequence of the ITIH4 gene (33Saguchi K.I. Tobe T. Hashimoto K. Nagasaki Y. Oda E. Nakano Y. Miuta N.H. Tomita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (5′-GAGAGCGCAGGCTGGATT-3′) and exon 22 of ITIH3(5′-CACAACAACGGAGAAGGG-3′) using human genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was cloned into pUC18. Ten positive clones were analyzed by Southern blotting (37Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21473) Google Scholar). Genomic clones were completely digested with a set of restriction enzymes and were electrophoretically separated on 1% agarose gel and transferred to Biotrace HP nylon membrane (Gelman Sciences, Inc.). Hybridization was performed with three different probes corresponding to the 5′, central, and 3′ regions of the ITI heavy chain H3 and H4 cDNAs, labeled as described above. DNA inserts were characterized by partial restriction site mapping and then subcloned in the pGEM 5 Z(+) (Promega), M13mp18, or pUC18 vector. DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain termination method (38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). The sequences were aligned and decoded with the MicroGenie sequence analysis (39Queen C. Korn L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The sequences were compared with the GenEMBL library and expressed sequence tags data bases in GenBankTM, using FASTA and BLAST Network services (40Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). S1 nuclease mapping was performed as described previously (28Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sesboüé R. Salier J.P. Léveillard T. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Bost F. Bourguignon J. Martin J.P. Sesboüé R. Thiberville L. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 3-kbNcoI-NcoI fragment, which covers exon 1 and the 5′-flanking region of the ITIH3 gene, was subcloned in bacteriophage M13mp18. 2 μg of this recombinant clone were mixed with an oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides +77 to +101 (5′-CCCAAGCAGCCGAAAGGGGCTTCTC-3′) in exon 1 of the ITIH3gene. A single-stranded labeled probe was prepared by the following primer extension/restriction enzyme digestion method. This labeled probe (4–8 106 cpm) was hybridized with human liver poly(A)-rich RNAs (10 μg) and treated with 10 units of S1 nuclease (Sigma). The S1 nuclease-digested samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The same oligonucleotide, used in S1 nuclease mapping analysis, corresponding to nucleotides +77 to +101 (5′-CCCAAGCAGCCGAAAGGGGCTTCTC-3′) in exon 1 of the ITIH3gene, was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2 × 106 cpm of the probe was annealed to 10 μg of human liver poly(A)-rich RNAs for 16 h at 50 °C in 15 μl of a hybridization buffer containing 400 mm NaCl, 40 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 80% formamide. The annealed RNA/primer mixture was precipitated and resuspended in 20 μl of a buffer containing the following: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg of actinomycin D/ml, and 0.5 mm deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate and extended with 100 units of superscript Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. The cDNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The precipitated extension products were resuspended in a sample buffer and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using buffer gradient gels along with the appropriate dideoxy sequencing reactions as size markers. PGL2-Basic (Promega) is a promoterless luciferase expression vector used for constructions in this study. A series of DNA fragments containing differentITIH3 promoter regions was generated by digestion withClaI + AvaI (−2928/+75), NcoI +AvaI (−1045/+75), and AvaII + AvaI (−135/+75) of the clone containing the last exon of ITIH1and the first exon of ITIH3 named HGHI/H3 (34Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sarafan N. Bost F. Sesboüé R. Muschio-Bonnet F. Martin J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These fragments were subcloned into the SmaI site of the PGL2-Basic vector. The other plasmids were generated by amplification from human genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The DNA fragments were digested with AvaI and cloned into theSmaI site of the PGL2-Basic vector. For PCR the following upper oligonucleotides (Genset) were used: oligonucleotide 1, 5′-GAGCGTGGGCCAGGCCTGAGT-3′; oligonucleotide 2, 5′-CCACCCCCGCTGCAGGTCACTGACC-3′; oligonucleotide 3, 5′-CTTTGGGGGCCATAGAAGGGTAGT-3′; oligonucleotide 4, 5′-ACCGCCCAGCCAGACACCAAGCACA-3′; and oligonucleotide 5, 5′- TGAATGCGCACAGGCCTCCACCCAC-3′; the same lower strand primer (5′-CCCAAGCAGCCGAAAGGGGCTTCTC-3) was used. Oligonucleotide 1 generated a −20/+75 fragment; oligonucleotide 2 generated a −78/+75 fragment; oligonucleotide 3 generated a −501/+75 fragment; oligonucleotide 4 generated a −1578/+75 fragment; oligonucleotide 5 generated a −2356/+75 fragment. Constructs pBLCAT2 H3 RE antisense and sense were prepared by digesting pBLCAT2 with HindIII, treating with Klenow fragment, and recircularizing it in the presence of an excess of oligonucleotide H3 RE (5′-tcgaAGTGCCTGGCTGATTTGGCAACTCTCCATCATTGCTCT-3′). The modification introduced into all the final constructions was checked by sequencing. The human liver hepatoma (HepG2), murine macrophage (p388D1), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and African green monkey kidney SV40 transformed (COS 7) cell lines were purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. HepG2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640. p388D1 and COS 7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. CHO cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. All the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. HepG2, CHO, and COS 7 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. Fresh culture medium was added every 2nd day until cell subconfluency was reached. The cells were then trypsinized with 1 ml of trypsin solution in 10 mm Na2EDTA and transferred into 6-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at an initial concentration of 1.5 × 106 cells/dish. The cells were cultured at 50% confluency and were transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of plasmids and 1 μg of pSV-β-Gal. The transfected cells were further cultured for 48 h and harvested for luciferase activity according to the Promega instructions. P388D1 cells were plated 24 h before transfection into 6-cm dishes at the subconfluent density. Transient transfection was performed by the LipofectAMINE method as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10 μg of each plasmid and 1 μg of pSV-β-Gal. The transfection medium was changed after 6 h of incubation and replaced with fresh medium. The luciferase assay was also performed according to Promega. The protein was quantified with the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) to normalize the luciferase activities. The luciferase activity was corrected for efficiency of transfection by measuring the β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was repeated at least three times. Cotransfection experiments were carried out with 3 μg of reporter plasmids, 1 μg of pSV-β-Gal, and 6 μg of expression vectors (3 μg of each) or 6 μg of carrier DNA for the control cells. The expression vectors MSV/EBP-α and MSV/EBP-β were of a kind obtained from Z. Cao and S. McKnight (Tularik Inc., San Francisco, CA). The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay was carried out as described by standard protocols (42Raymondjean M. Pichard A.-L. Gregori C. Ginot F. Khan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6145-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The CAT activity was also normalized by β-galactosidase activity and protein quantification. The nuclear extract from HepG2 cells was prepared according to Dignam et al.(43Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). For DNase footprinting, the HG H1/H3 clone described in Ref. 34Diarra-Mehrpour M. Bourguignon J. Sarafan N. Bost F. Sesboüé R. Muschio-Bonnet F. Martin J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholarwas digested with SalI, filled in with Klenow enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim), in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdATP, 1 mm dTTP, 10 mm dGTP (Boehringer Mannheim), and 10 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min; then the DNA was precipitated. The resulting plasmid was digested with PstI. The PstI-SalI fragment was separated by nondenaturing electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The end-labeled DNA probe was cut out, electroeluted, and purified on NUNC columns (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reactions for the DNase footprinting assay were carried out with 4,000 cpm of end-labeled DNA probe in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 7% glycerol, and 60 μg of nuclear protein. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, 20 ng of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) was added for 1 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 100 μl of stop solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 5 μg of tRNA. The labeled DNAs were phenol/chloroform-extracted and separated on a 6% sequencing gel. Maxam Gilbert sequencing reactions were used as size markers. For EMSA, duplex oligonucleotide (5′-tcgaAGTGCCTGGCTGATTTGGCAACTCTCCATCATTGCTCT-3′) used as probe was end-labeled by filling overhanging 5′ ends with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Klenow fragment. 50 ng of radiolabeled probes were incubated with 6 μg of nuclear protein in a buffer containing 12% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 0.06 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min, and the nucleoprotein complexes were separated by nondenaturing electrophoresis in a 4 or 6% polyacrylamide gel for 3 h at 20 mA in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm orthoboric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. In competition experiments, excess unlabeled duplex oligonucleotide competitors were incubated with the nuclear extract simultaneously with the labeled probe. For supershift experiments we used C/EBPα and C/EBPβ antisera given by Steven McKnight (Tularik Inc., San Francisco, CA). These antisera were mixed directly with nuclear protein for 90 min at 4 °C before adding binding buffer and a radiolabeled probe. During the initial screening of a human genomic library in EMBL-3 for the ITI heavy chain gene, 10 positive phage clones were identified with heavy chain cDNAs. The radiolabeled cDNAs corresponding to the 5′, central, and 3′ regions of heavy chain H3 and appropriate oligonucleotides were used as probes to cross-hybridize these clones. Three clones were selected and further analyzed by restriction mapping and subcloning. The results of this mapping and Southern blot hybridization with the probes described above are summarized in Fig. 1. They showed that the insert of clone λG3 contained the 3′ region of the ITIH1 and the 5′ region of ITIH3 but lacked the central and 3′ region of theITIH3 gene, whereas two clones λG21 and λG22 were overlapping and contained the 3′ region coding sequence of ITIH3 (Fig. 1), plus additional genomic DNA extending 7 kb downstream from the exonic boundaries of the gene. The lacked central region of the ITIH3 gene was obtained by several polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using human genomic DNA and a series of gene-specific primers. A complete set of subclones was used to determine the sequence of the human ITIH3 gene. Comparison of the complete genomic sequence with that of the cDNA (24Bourguignon J. Diarra-Mehrpour M. Thiberville L. Bost F. Sesboüé R. Martin J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) established the organization of the human ITIH3 gene. This gene spans 14 kb and is composed of 22 exons (Fig. 1). This analysis reveals that the overall coding capacity for this gene is about 20%. Comparison of the exon-intron organization with the protein structure revealed that HC3 begins at exon 2 and ends at the beginning of exon 18 (Fig. 2). The exons and introns range in size from 9 to 248 bp and from 91 to 1000 bp, respectively. The exon/intron boundaries conform to the GT/AG rule for splice site junctions (Fig. 2) as described by Breathnach and Chambon (44Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 743-745Crossref Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). The gene sequence revealed several differences from our previously published cDNA sequence (24Bourguignon J. Diarra-Mehrpour M.

To understand the cause of these differences, we utilized a blast search for the exon sequences of the ITIH3 gene and our previously published cDNA sequence with the non-redundant GenBankTM EST data base. This comparison showed that the difference observed in exons 7 and 12 could be due to intraspecies polymorphism or a cloning artifact of cDNA or of genomic DNA, respectively. The discrepancies observed in exons 9, 19, and 22 were due to the mistake in the published cDNA sequence.Figure 2Complete nucleotide sequence of the ITI heavy chain H3 gene.

Two of them (λG21 and λG22) simultaneously hybridized with the 3′ portion of ITIH4 and the 3′ region of ITIH3. These clones were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and subcloning.

A., Sinden, R. R., and Izban, M. G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 26998–27008). We demonstrate that template terminal complexes produce these RNAs and that transcript extension is a general and salt-sensitive (250 mm) feature of run-off transcription. On 5′-overhung templates the extended run-off transcripts appear to be retained within an RNA-DNA-enzyme ternary complex, and SII facilitates resumption of transcript elongation via a dinucleotide truncation intermediate. Moreover, on one of the 5-overhung templates, the initially extended complexes spontaneously resumed transcript extension and were uniquely resistant to salt (250 mm) challenge. However, SII did not facilitate this long distance extension on all template ends. Run-off transcripts on a blunt-ended template were initially extended by 2–11 nt (roughly in 2-nt increments); SII addition either before or after extension resulted in the accumulation of a 4–5-nt extension product. Based on these findings, we propose that the initial and continuously extended RNAs reflect intermediates and successful completion of template end-to-end transposition (template switching) by RNA polymerase II, respectively.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar and 48Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar for a recent review). In accordance with the early revisions of Chamberlin (33Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1994; 88: 1-21Google Scholar), new models postulate that the overall stability of the ternary complex is influenced both by binding of the nascent RNA to a product-binding site(s) within the enzyme and by bilateral template interactions between the active center of polymerase and the template DNA from +2 to −18 (relative to the site of polymerization) and a DNA “clamp” and double-stranded template 7–10 bp downstream of the polymerization site. More recent studies indicate that the ternary complex contains an invariant approximate 8-nt RNA/DNA “hybrid” within the catalytic center located just upstream of the site of catalysis. Although the heteroduplex is not a major contributor in overall complex stability, the relative strengths of the downstream DNA contact and the RNA/DNA hybrid thermodynamically influence the lateral stability of the ternary complex (44Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). According to this model, transcriptional arrest by RNA polymerase II is viewed as a thermodynamic minimum where the coupled instability of the transcript 3′-end heteroduplex and downstream template contact result in an upstream shift of the entire enzyme thereby backtracking the transcription bubble to accommodate a more energetically favorable heteroduplex. This simple model is also consistent with the apparent ability of RNA polymerase II ternary complexes to oscillate between transcriptionally competent and incompetent configurations. Arrested complexes have a limited capacity to spontaneously resume transcription (49Rudd M.D. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21549-21558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and stalled complexes containing 3, 4, or 5 consecutive 3′-terminal UMPs (a common feature of attested complexes) remove nascent transcript in progressively larger cleavage increments and yet retain complete or partial elongation competency (19Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, current models, based on the biochemical properties of static complexes, cannot account for all of the experimentally determined biochemical properties of RNA polymerase and probably underestimate the kinetic intermediates of a dynamically transcribing polymerase molecule (see Refs. 1Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar and 48Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) for extensive discussion of this point). Indeed, using certain SII and yeast polymerase subunit mutants, it has been demonstrated that SII-facilitated cleavage and subsequent readthrough activities at the well characterized human histone H3.3 gene TIa intrinsic arrest site can be uncoupled (18Awrey D.E.

In an effort to establish additional in vitro assays to access elongation factor-dependent and -independent properties of RNA polymerase II, we recently investigated the effects of (CNG) triplet repeat tract sequences on the transcriptional properties of RNA polymerase II. During the course of this work, we uncovered a novel property of run-off transcription on linear templates, namely the production of discrete 15–16-nt longer than expected products whose synthesis was abrogated by elongation factor SII (61Parsons M.A Sinden R.R. Izban M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26998-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we show that production of longer than expected products is a general feature of run-off transcription, and we present evidence that these RNAs represent run-off transcript extension products formed by template terminal complexes. Based on the effects of salts and elongation factor SII on oversized product formation and “stability,” we speculate that at some template ends, terminal RNA polymerase II complexes may retain their run-off transcript and continue transcript elongation after switching to another linear template end. The 15–16-nt extension reaction appears to represent a transitional stage in this process. All fast protein liquid chromatography-grade non-radioactive nucleotides were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, whereas restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. In vitro transcription reactions were performed using previously described templates and procedures (61Parsons M.A Sinden R.R. Izban M.G. J. Biol.

This procedure (51Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which incorporates transient Sarkosyl exposure and subsequent gel filtration, changes the reaction buffer to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 62.5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and removes detergent-labile nonspecific DNA-binding proteins and presumably any elongation factors that may be retained within the stalled complex. Typically, elongation time course reactions were performed in sufficient initial volumes such that 30-μl aliquots could be withdrawn at each time point. Prior to resuming transcription, the reaction mix was supplied 1 mm NTPs and equilibrated to 37 °C for 3 min before the addition of MgCl2 to 7.8 mm. The 30-μl reactions were stopped at specific time points by addition of 70 μl of Stop Mix (20 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K). In reactions containing recombinant human elongation factor SII, 4 μg/ml recombinant protein was added either prior to equilibration at 37 °C or shortly after transcription was resumed. Recombinant SII was purified as described previously (22Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Gene Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To maintain buffer and substrate parity when testing the effect of KCl and SII on run-off transcription product formation (Figs.

The RNA markers (base hydrolysis ladders) were prepared by resuspending purified and precipitated transcripts derived from 200-μl run-off transcription reactions in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.1, 2.0 mm EDTA followed by a 15-min incubation at 90 °C. The ladders were ethanol-precipitated after the addition of 80 μl of TE and 50 μl of 7.5 m ammonium acetate. Typically 13of the reaction mixture was loaded per gel lane. Gels were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) and exposed to Kodak X-AR film overnight with an intensifying screen (Corning, Lightning Plus). The percentage of a particular set of run-off transcripts were calculated as described previously (61Parsons M.A Sinden R.R. Izban M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26998-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A synchronized in vitro transcription system was used to monitor the production of run-off transcription products. Promoter-initiated RNA polymerase II ternary complexes stalled after insertion of UMP at template position +20 (U20 complex) are purified, following transient exposure to the detergent Sarkosyl, by gel filtration chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref.52Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12864-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These “core” complexes, which are apparently devoid of the known elongation factors, resume transcript elongation when supplied NTPs and Mg2+. Using this approach it was previously demonstrated that run-off transcription on mixed DNA sequence templates generates three classes of transcription products (53Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first class were formed by RNA polymerase that halts polymerization 6–12 nt upstream of the template end. These complexes survive purification by gel filtration. Subsequent addition of elongation factor SII facilitates transcript truncation 7–14 nt upstream from the transcript 3′-end. The second class of transcripts is produced by polymerase that transcribes to within 4 nt of the template strand end. These gel-filtered complexes are principally unresponsive to SII. Thus, template terminal complexes apparently terminate transcription. All template ends generated a third class of transcripts at low but detectable levels. These RNAs were 2–4 nt longer than expected relative to the end of the template strand end. In the accompanying paper (61Parsons M.A Sinden R.R. Izban M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26998-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) we demonstrated, as expected, that run-off transcription on the 5′-overhung pML(CTG)17 and pML(CAG)17 templates generated predominantly “full-length” run-off transcripts (see Fig. 1, A and B,respectively). In addition both templates generated low levels of transcripts roughly 12 and 20 (pML(CTG)17) and 8 (pML(CAG)17) nt shorter than expected. Unexpectedly, ∼4% of the run-off transcripts were approximately 15 or 18 nt longer than expected (the exact lengths are determined below). Since no oversized products longer than 2–4 nt were detected in previous work on a variety of template ends, we initially considered the possibility that transcript extension occurred during transcription of the triplet repeat tracts. However, the pML(CTG)17-derived longer than expected products were promoter-initiated transcripts containing the expected length of triplet repeat tract sequence (61Parsons M.A Sinden R.R. Izban M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26998-27008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the course of investigating whether the oversized products were the result of slippage during transcription of the triplet repeat tract, we found that the percentage of 15–18 nt longer than expected transcripts varied depending on transcription reaction time and reaction salt concentration. These points are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. Time course transcription studies demonstrated that the production of oversized transcripts was delayed relative to the time required for the majority of complexes to reach the pML(CTG)17 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3) and pML(CAG)17 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–6) template ends. One-minute reactions (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, and Fig. 1 B, lane 3) were essentially devoid of the 15–16-nt longer than expected products even though the majority of transcripts were elongated to within 20 nt of the template end. Continued incubation through 2 min on pML(CTG)17 (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) or 5 min on pML(CAG)17 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6) resulted in the accumulation of oversized products. On the pML(CAG)17 template, the accumulation of full-length transcription products was essentially unchanged after 1.5, 2, and 5 min, whereas the percentage of 15–18-nt longer than expected products increased from 5 to 11%. These data indicate that transcript extension occurred after polymerase reached the end of the linear template. In our previous examination of the biochemical properties of run-off transcription complexes generated on mixed DNA sequence linear templates, short elongation times (1–2 min) and subsequent gel filtration were used to purify “run-off” ternary complexes (53Izban M.G. Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using the previously characterized FspI-linearized pML20 template, we reexamined the effect of extended elongation times on the production of longer than expected transcripts (Fig. 2 A). As expected, after a 1- or 2-min transcription reaction (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) the majority of ternary complexes either transcribed to the template end (indicated as run-off) or halted transcription 6–9 nt upstream. Also as reported, 0.3% Sarkosyl selectively inhibited continued transcription by complexes that would normally transcribe to the template end (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). However, extending the reaction time resulted in a concurrent reduction in transcripts at or near the template end and an accumulation of predominantly 5- and 7-nt longer than expected products (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6). After 15 min (Fig. 2 A, lane 6) approximately 40% of the total run-off transcripts were 5 and 7 nt longer than expected. Similar results were observed on another previously characterized 3′-recessed template strand end template (BglI-digested pML20) which produced primarily a 16-nt longer than expected product (data not shown). Thus, longer than expected transcript formation appears to be a general feature of run-off transcription. All transcript length assignments were determined by high resolution mapping analyses. Typically, run-"
