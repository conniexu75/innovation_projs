https://openalex.org/W1978888457,"p53 limits the proliferation of primary diploid fibroblasts by inducing a state of growth arrest named replicative senescence — a process which protects against oncogenic transformation and requires integrity of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway1,2,3. However, little is known about the downstream target genes of p53 in this growth-limiting response. Here, we report that suppression of the p53 target gene encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by RNA interference (RNAi) leads to escape from replicative senescence both in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and primary human BJ fibroblasts. PAI-1 knockdown results in sustained activation of the PI(3)K–PKB–GSK3β pathway and nuclear retention of cyclin D1, consistent with a role for PAI-1 in regulating growth factor signalling. In agreement with this, we find that the PI(3)K–PKB–GSK3β–cyclin D1 pathway is also causally involved in cellular senescence. Conversely, ectopic expression of PAI-1 in proliferating p53-deficient murine or human fibroblasts induces a phenotype displaying all the hallmarks of replicative senescence. Our data indicate that PAI-1 is not merely a marker of senescence, but is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of replicative senescence downstream of p53."

https://openalex.org/W2053702542,"Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that leads to debilitating cognitive deficits. Although little is known about the early functional or ultrastructural changes associated with AD, it has been proposed that a stage of synaptic dysfunction might precede neurodegeneration in the development of this disease. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that underlie such synaptic dysfunction remain largely unknown. Recently we have shown that β-amyloid (Aβ), the main component of senile plaques, induced a significant decrease in dynamin 1, a protein that plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle recycling, and hence, in the signaling properties of the synapse. We report here that this dynamin 1 degradation was the result of calpain activation induced by the sustained calcium influx mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in hippocampal neurons. In addition, our results showed that soluble oligomeric Aβ, and not fibrillar Aβ, was responsible for this sustained calcium influx, calpain activation, and dynamin 1 degradation. Considering the importance of dynamin 1 to synaptic function, these data suggest that Aβ soluble oligomers might catalyze a stage of synaptic dysfunction that precedes synapse loss and neurodegeneration. These data also highlight the calpain system as a novel therapeutic target for early stage AD intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2102681667,"Boiga dendrophila (mangrove catsnake) is a colubrid snake that lives in Southeast Asian lowland rainforests and mangrove swamps and that preys primarily on birds. We have isolated, purified, and sequenced a novel toxin from its venom, which we named denmotoxin. It is a monomeric polypeptide of 77 amino acid residues with five disulfide bridges. In organ bath experiments, it displayed potent postsynaptic neuromuscular activity and irreversibly inhibited indirectly stimulated twitches in chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparations. In contrast, it induced much smaller and readily reversible inhibition of electrically induced twitches in mouse hemidiaphragm nerve-muscle preparations. More precisely, the chick muscle α1βγδ-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was 100-fold more susceptible compared with the mouse receptor. These data indicate that denmotoxin has a bird-specific postsynaptic activity. We chemically synthesized denmotoxin, crystallized it, and solved its crystal structure at 1.9 Å by the molecular replacement method. The toxin structure adopts a non-conventional three-finger fold with an additional (fifth) disulfide bond in the first loop and seven additional residues at its N terminus, which is blocked by a pyroglutamic acid residue. This is the first crystal structure of a three-finger toxin from colubrid snake venom and the first fully characterized bird-specific toxin. Denmotoxin illustrates the relationship between toxin specificity and the primary prey type that constitutes the snake's diet.

They share a similar structure and are characterized by three β-stranded finger-like loops, emerging from a globular core and stabilized by four conserved disulfide bridges. An additional disulfide linkage may sometimes be present in the first (non-conventional toxins) or second (long-chain α-neurotoxins and κ-toxins) loop (1Endo T. Tamiya N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 403-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Kini R.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2002; 29: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3Nirthanan S.

All 3FTXs are monomers except for κ-toxins, which are noncovalent homodimers isolated from Bungarus venoms. Minor structural differences in the three-finger fold, viz. the number of β-strands, overall morphology of the loops, and differential lengths of turns or C-terminal tails (6Ricciardi A. Le Du M.H.

Hence, 3FTXs affect a broad range of molecular targets, including α1-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; short- and long-chain α-neurotoxins), α7-nAChRs (long-chain α-neurotoxins), and α3- and α4-nAChRs (κ-toxins) (4Servent D.

As the interaction with such a broad spectrum of target proteins results in a variety of pharmacological effects, the understanding of the physiological role and mechanism of action supported by the architecture of 3FTXs could be of great value in the development of novel research tools or rational drug design. For instance, studies with α-bungarotoxin led to a detailed characterization of muscle nAChR, helping to elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms involved in neuromuscular transmissions (17Chang C.C. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 368-375PubMed Google Scholar). 3FTXs were thought to occur only in the venoms of the snake family Elapidae. But recently, our laboratory reported the first colubrid snake venom toxin (α-colubritoxin from Coelognathus radiatus), a reversible antagonist of chick muscle nAChRs (18Fry B.G. Lumsden N.G. Wuster W. Wickramaratna J.C. Hodgson W.C. Kini R.M. J. Mol. Evol. 2003; 57: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The large polyphyletic family Colubridae consists of approximately two-thirds of the described species of the advanced snakes and includes >700 different venomous species (19Vidal N. Hedges S.B. C. R. Biol. 2002; 325: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Vidal N. Hedges S.B. C. R. Biol. 2005; 328: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Colubrid snakes possess a venom gland (the Duvernoy's gland) with a common duct extending to the posterior lingual region of the maxilla, commonly associated with grooved or enlarged posterior maxillary teeth. Relatively little is known of the chemistry, toxicology, and immunology of colubrid venoms, and a more thorough investigation of colubrid venom components holds great promise for discovering new bioactive compounds (21Hill R.E. Mackessy S.P. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 1663-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Mackessy S.P. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2002; 21: 43-83Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this work, we report the isolation, purification, and pharmacological and structural characterization of a novel bird-specific neurotoxin, denmotoxin, one of the major venom components of the mangrove catsnake (Boiga dendrophila). Denmotoxin produced a virtually irreversible blockage of chick muscle α1βγδ-nAChRs, whereas it produced a much weaker, readily reversible blockage of mouse muscle α1βγδ-nAChRs. In addition to pharmacological and biochemical studies, we have established a chemical synthesis and refolding protocol for synthetic denmotoxin and solved the high resolution crystal structure of the protein. Denmotoxin has great potential to become a model for a better understanding of the mechanisms of species specificity as well as reversible binding of venom neurotoxins.

Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was from Pierce. Snake Venoms—B. dendrophila venom was extracted as described previously (23Hill R.E. Mackessy S.P. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) from snakes originating from Sulawesi, Indonesia. Bungarus multicinctus venom was obtained from Venom Supplies Pty. Ltd. (Tanunda, South Australia, Australia), and α-bungarotoxin was purified using a standard method (24Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1963; 144: 241-257PubMed Google Scholar). Animals—Swiss-Webster albino mice (32 ± 2 g of body weight) were purchased from the Laboratory Animals Center of the National University of Singapore (Sembawang, Singapore) and kept in the Department of Pharmacology animal holding unit. Paper pellet bedding and food was purchased from Glen Forrest Stockfeeders (Glen Forrest, Western Australia, Australia). Food and water were available ad libitum. The animals were housed five per cage in a light-controlled room (12-h light/dark cycles) at 23 °C and 60% relative humidity. 6-10-day-old domestic chicks (Gallus domesticus) were purchased from an agricultural farm in Singapore and delivered on the day of experimentation. Experimental animals were killed by exposure to 100% CO2. Protein Purification—Previously, we had performed liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry crude venom profiling of B. dendrophila venom (25Fry B.G. Wuster W. Ramjan S.F.R. Jackson T. Martelli P. Kini R.M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 2047-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to identify venom complexity and to predict the composition of venom proteins. A major protein component was purified from the venom using a two-step process involving cation exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Crude venom was applied to a UNO S6 cation exchange column attached to an ΔKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences AB) and separated into fractions with a linear gradient of 0-50% solvent B over 50 min (solvent A = 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); solvent B = 1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). The pooled fractions containing the protein of interest were applied to an RP-Jupiter C18 HPLC column using the same chromatography system and eluted with a linear gradient of 30-40% solvent B over 80 min (solvent A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and solvent B = 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O). Elution was monitored at 215 and 280 nm. To assess potential protein oligomerization, the purified lyophilized protein was diluted to 4 mg/ml in H2O, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and applied to a Superdex 30 gel filtration column attached to an ΔKTA purifier system. Protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was monitored at 215 and 280 nm. Mass Analysis—A Sciex API300 LC/MS/MS mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Thornton, Canada) was used to determine the precise masses and purity of the native protein as well as the generated peptides. Ion spray, orifice, and ring voltages were set at 4600, 50, and 350 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a curtain gas at a flow rate of 0.6 μl/min and as a nebulizer gas at a pressure setting of 100 p.s.i. The mass was determined by direct injection at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using a Shimadzu LC-10AD liquid chromatography pump as the solvent delivery system (50% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in H2O). BioMultiView software was used to analyze the mass spectra. Unblocking and Sequencing of the N Terminus—Pfu pyroglutamate aminopeptidase digestion was performed to remove the pyroglutamic acid residue that was blocking the N terminus of the protein. Enzymatic digestion was carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA at a ratio of 2 milliunits of enzyme to 1 nmol of protein. The reaction was incubated for 10 h at 50 °C, followed by N-terminal sequencing by automated Edman degradation using an ABI Procise 494 pulsed-liquid phase protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an on-line 785A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Peptide Generation and Protein Sequencing—Lyophilized protein (500 μg) was dissolved in 500 μl of 0.13 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 6 m guanidine HCl (pH 8.5) and reduced with 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h under N2. Subsequently, 100 μl of alkylating reagent (4-vinylpyridine) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h under N2 at room temperature in the dark. The alkylated toxin mixture was immediately loaded onto a μRPC C2/C18 column attached to a Smart workstation (Amersham Biosciences AB). The column was washed for 30 min with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O), followed by protein elution with a linear gradient of 0-50% solvent B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O). Lyophilized pyridylethylated protein was then subjected to enzymatic digestion with Lys-C endopeptidase or trypsin. Protein (250 μg) was dissolved in 250 μl of enzymatic digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 4 m urea, and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)), and proteases were added at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Cleavages were performed at 37 °C for 16 h. The peptides generated were separated on a μRPC C2/C18 column attached to the same chromatography system using a linear gradient of 15-40% solvent B over 1 h (solvent A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and solvent B = 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O). The flow rate was 200 μl/min. Eluted peptides were monitored at 215, 254, and 280 nm. The amino acid sequences of the peptides were obtained by automated Edman degradation using an ABI Procise sequencer. Total RNA Isolation—5 days after milking, the B. dendrophila specimen was killed by an overdose of CO2. The pair of venom glands was dissected and stored in RNAlater at -80 °C until used. Total RNA extraction was performed using a rotor homogenizer and an RNeasy mini kit. The amount of RNA was calculated according to the absorbance of the sample at 260 nm. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Based on the available amino acid sequence of the protein, the following degenerate primers were designed to obtain partial cDNA sequence: RT-forward, 5′-GCICCIGTRCARCAYTTIAC-3′; and RT-reverse, 5′-TGYTTIGCIGTIGGMCACAT-3′. One-step RT-PCR was carried out using 100 ng of total RNA under the following conditions: RT at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by activation of HotStartTaq polymerase at 95 °C for 15 min and 30 cycles of three-step PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cloning and Sequencing of RT-PCR Products—Amplification products were purified using a PCR purification kit, ligated with the pDrive vector, and transformed by a heat shock method into competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells. Selection of the transformants (blue/white colony screening) was performed on LB-agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and supplemented with X-gal (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). The sizes of the inserts were estimated by EcoRI digestion, followed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide visualization. All sequencing reactions were carried out with an ABI PRISM 3100 automated DNA sequencer using a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All clones were sequenced in both directions using T7 and SP6 sequencing primers. Sequence Analysis—Sequence analysis was carried out using the BLAST program at the NCBI Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and ExPASy proteomics tools (www.expasy.ch). Sequence alignments were carried out using the ClustalW program (www.ebi.ac.uk) or DNAMAN Version 4.15 (Lynnon Corp.). Chemical Synthesis—Chemical synthesis and assembly of protein were performed with an Applied Biosystems 431 peptide synthesizer using a modified version of the Applied Biosystems standard 0.1 mmol small-scale program (26Mourier G. Servent D. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with N-hydroxybenzotriazole as the coupling reagent and N-methylpyrrolidone as the solvent. Fmoc-protected amino acids were used with the following side chain protections: t-butyl ester (Glu and Asp), t-butyl ether (Ser, Thr, and Tyr), t-butylcarbonyl (Lys), trityl (Cys, His, Asn, and Gln), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchromane-6-sulfonyl (Arg), and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Trp). The toxin was assembled on Fmoc-Asp-t-butoxy-Wang resin (loading, 0.55 mmol/g) (27Wang S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis was performed using the improved software armed with UV deprotection step monitoring, which, in the case of deprotection failure, automatically extends the deprotection and coupling time for the particular amino acid (28Mourier G. Dutertre S. Fruchart-Gaillard C. Ménez A. Servent D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After each coupling, the resin was acetylated with a mixture of 5% acetic anhydride and 6% 2,4,6-collidine in dimethylformamide. At the end of the synthesis, the peptide resin was treated with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (90%), triisopropylsilane (5%), and distilled water (5%) to cleave the peptide from the resin and to remove the protecting groups from amino acid side chains. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature with constant mixing, the crude material was filtered and precipitated in cold tert-butyl methyloxide. Precipitates were washed three times with tert-butyl methyloxide, followed by centrifugation at 1700 × g and resuspension in 10% acetic acid. Lyophilized crude synthetic toxin was then reduced with a molar excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for at least 30 min (to reduce incorrectly formed disulfide bonds) and purified by RP-HPLC using a Discovery® BIO wide pore C5 column (10 × 250 mm) with a gradient of 40-60% of solvent B over 40 min (solvent A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and solvent B = 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O). The flow rate was 3 ml/min, and elution was followed at 215 and 280 nm. Purification and Refolding of the Synthetic Toxin—The reduced synthetic peptide was dissolved in 200 μl of distilled water to evaluate protein concentration based on absorbance at 278 nm. It was then diluted with refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 0.5 m guanidium chloride, GSH, and GSSH at a molar ratio of 10:1) to a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml and incubated for 2-4 days in 4 °C. The mixture was acidified with 20% trifluoroacetic acid and purified on a Discovery® BIO wide pore C5 column with a gradient of 30-50% solvent B over 40 min (solvent A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and solvent B = 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O). The flow rate was 3 ml/min, the elution was followed at 215 and 280 nm. The synthetic and native toxins were compared by co-elution profiles and circular dichroism spectra. In Vivo Toxicity Test—The native protein was injected intraperitoneally into male Swiss-Webster mice (19 ± 2 g) at 0.1, 1, 10, and 20 mg/kg (n = 2). All doses were made up to a volume of 200 μl in saline. The same volume of normal saline was injected intraperitoneally into control animals. Mice were observed for 6-8 h and killed after 24 h for autopsy. Mice (19 ± 2 g) were injected intracerebroventricularly with the protein at 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg in 5 μl of saline (n = 2 per dose) or with 5 μl of control saline (n = 2) using a fine capillary Hamilton microsyringe. Animals were killed for autopsy after 5 h of observation. Chick Biventer Cervicis Muscle (CBCM) Preparations—Pairs of CBCMs were isolated from 6-10-day-old chicks and mounted in an 8-ml organ bath (29Gilsborg B.L. Warriner J. Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1960; 15: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) containing Krebs solution continuously aerated with 5% CO2 in O2. The temperature of the organ bath was maintained at 35 °C. The resting tension of the isolated tissue was adjusted to ∼1 g. Electrical field stimulation was carried out through platinum ring electrodes using an S88 stimulator (Grass Instruments, Quincey, MA). The data were transferred via a Model FT03 force displacement transducer (Grass Instruments) and recorded using a PowerLab 6 system (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, New South Wales, Australia). Maximal twitch responses of the muscle were elicited indirectly via stimulation of the motor nerve by applying an electrical field of 7-10-V potential difference at a frequency of 0.2 Hz in supramaximal rectangular pulses of 0.1-ms duration. The preparation was equilibrated for 30-50 min before the beginning of an experiment, with changes of Krebs solution at 10-min intervals. To ensure selective stimulation of the motor nerve, d-tubocurarine (10 μm) was added, with subsequent abolition of twitches, which were then re-established after a thorough wash. At appropriate intervals, submaximal control contractures to exogenously applied 300 μm acetylcholine, 8 μm carbachol, or 30 mm KCl were obtained in the absence of an electrical field. The contact times for these agonistic drugs were 30, 90, and 60 s, respectively, followed by a wash with ∼100 ml of fresh Krebs solution. The electrical stimulation was then recommenced; and after stabilization of twitch height, the effects of various concentrations of denmotoxin (0.1-100 μg/ml, 11.8 nm to 11.8 μm; n = 5), α-bungarotoxin (0.1 nm to 0.5 μm; n = 3), or vehicle were investigated. Neuromuscular blockage is expressed as a percentage of the original twitch height in the absence of toxin. Dose-response curves representing the percent blockage after 30 min of CBCM exposure to the respective toxins were plotted. Each preparation was exposed to only one dose of toxin, and both muscles from the same specimen were used to test two different doses. The reversibility of the inhibitory effect of the toxin on twitches was assessed by the replacement of Krebs solution in the organ bath at 10-min intervals combined with a slow drip wash over 180 min. The effect of neostigmine (10 μm) on the reversal of neuromuscular blockage was also examined. Mouse Hemidiaphragm Muscle (MHD) Preparations—MHD with the associated phrenic nerve was isolated as described by Bulbring (30Bulbring E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and mounted in a 5.5-ml organ bath. Indirect stimulation was performed at a frequency of 0.2 Hz in rectangular pulses of 0.2-ms duration at a supramaximal voltage of 7-10 V. α-Bungarotoxin (10, 50, and 100 nm; n = 3) was used as a positive control. Partial dose-response curves for denmotoxin (117.5 nm, 1.175 μm, and 11.75 μm (n = 3) and 2.35 and 5.88 μm (n = 1)) were determined. In control experiments, the effect of uninterrupted nerve stimulation of MHD was assessed. Also, the recovery of twitches was assessed by washing with Krebs solution overflow, followed by slow drip wash. To eliminate batch-to-batch variations of the protein during the experiments, all CBCM and MHD experiments were performed using same protein stock solution. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Data were analyzed and fitted using Fig.P Version 2.98 (Fig.P Software Corp., Durham, NC). Crystallization—Lyophilized protein was resuspended in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) containing 0.02% sodium azide, washed four times to remove salts, and reconcentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration with an Amicon 5-kDa cutoff filter (Millipore Corp.). Crystallization experiments were carried out using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 291 K (18 °C). In initial crystallization experiments, Hampton Research Crystal Screens 1 and 2 were used, and setups contained 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution. The final conditions were optimized by seeding to bypass spontaneous nucleation and hence to control the number of crystals and to improve their growth. Crystals for diffraction were kept in cryoprotectant solution containing 1.5 m LiSO4 and 25 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and flash-frozen in liquid ethane. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystal diffraction was performed on beam line ID-29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The data were processed using the HKL package (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and the structure was solved using the molecular replacement method. Different search models were tried out to find the proper rotation and translation solution. To choose the best model for the molecular replacement method, a FASTA search was conducted using the protein sequence against the Protein Data Bank. The closest match found was the crystal structure of neurotoxin-1 from Naja naja oxiana (PDB code 1NTN). Based on this molecule, the denmotoxin search model was built by residue replacement. Several other homology models were tried in a different resolution range, but no solution could be found. Finally, the proper solution was found using native data and a search model built based on irditoxin (PDB code 2H7Z) with partial deletions of loops regions. The programs MOL-REP (32Vagin A.

https://openalex.org/W2011993897,"Smad proteins are crucial for the intracellular signaling of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Upon their receptor-induced activation, Smad proteins are phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus to activate the transcription of a select set of target genes. Here, we show that the co-activator p300/CBP bound and acetylated Smad3 as well as Smad2 in vivo, and that the acetylation was stimulated by TGF-beta. A major acetylation site of Smad3 by p300/CBP is Lys-378 in the MH2 domain (Smad3C) known to be critical for the regulation of transcriptional activity. Replacement of Lys-378 with Arg decreased the transcriptional activity of GAL4-Smad3C in a luciferase assay. Moreover, p300/CBP potentiated the transcriptional activity of GAL4-Smad3C, but not the acetylation-resistant GAL4-Smad3C(K378R) mutant. These results suggest that acetylation of Smad3 by p300/CBP regulates positively its transcriptional activity."

https://openalex.org/W1990595543,"Identification of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) silenced by methylation uncovers mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identifies new epigenetic tumor markers for early cancer detection. Both nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and esophageal carcinoma are major tumors in Southern China and Southeast Asia. Through expression subtraction of NPC, we identified Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 (DLC1)/ARHGAP7 (NM_006094) – an 8p22 TSG as a major downregulated gene. Although expressed in all normal tissues, DLC1 was silenced or downregulated in 11/12 (91%) NPC, 6/15 (40%) esophageal, 5/8 (63%) cervical and 3/9 (33%) breast carcinoma cell lines. No genetic deletion of DLC1 was detected in NPC although a hemizygous deletion at 8p22–11 was found by 1-Mb array-CGH in some cell lines. We then located the functional DLC1 promoter by 5′-RACE and promoter activity assays. This promoter was frequently methylated in all downregulated cell lines and in a large collection of primary tumors including 89% (64/72) NPC (endemic and sporadic types), 51% (48/94) esophageal, 87% (7/8) cervical and 36% (5/14) breast carcinomas, but seldom in paired surgical marginal tissues and not in any normal epithelial tissue. The transcriptional silencing of DLC1 could be reversed by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or genetic double knock-out of DNMT1 and DNMT3B. Furthermore, ectopic expression of DLC1 in NPC and esophageal carcinoma cells strongly inhibited their colony formation. We thus found frequent epigenetic silencing of DLC1 in NPC, esophageal and cervical carcinomas, and a high correlation of methylation with its downregulation, suggesting a predominant role of epigenetic inactivation. DLC1 appears to be a major TSG implicated in the pathogenesis of these tumors, and should be further tested as a molecular biomarker in patients with these cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2039364136,"Glucan formation catalyzed by two GH-family 70 enzymes, Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F dextransucrase and L. mesenteroides NRRL B-1355 alternansucrase, was investigated by combining biochemical and kinetic characterization of the recombinant enzymes and their respective products. Using HPAEC analysis, we showed that two molecules act as initiator of polymerization: sucrose itself and glucose produced by hydrolysis, the latter being preferred when produced in sufficient amounts. Then, elongation occurs by transfer of the glucosyl residue coming from sucrose to the non-reducing end of initially formed products. Dextransucrase preferentially produces an isomaltooligosaccharide series, whose concentration is always low because of the high ability of these products to be elongated and form high molecular weight dextran. Compared with dextransucrase, alternansucrase has a broader specificity. It produces a myriad of oligosaccharides with various α-1,3 and/or α-1,6 links in early reaction stages. Only some of them are further elongated. Overall alternan polymer is smaller in size than dextran. In dextransucrase, the A repeats often found in C-terminal domain of GH family 70 were found to play a major role in efficient dextran elongation. Their truncation result in an enzyme much less efficient to catalyze high molecular weight polymer formation. It is thus proposed that, in dextransucrase, the A repeats define anchoring zones for the growing chains, favoring their elongation. Based on these results, a semi-processive mechanism involving only one active site and an elongation by the non-reducing end is proposed for the GH-family 70 glucansucrases."

https://openalex.org/W2083874142,"In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells activate various DNA repair pathways to remove DNA lesions and, meanwhile, halt cell cycle progressions to allow sufficient time for repair. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the ATR-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation are two major cellular responses to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation. However, how these two processes are coordinated in the response is poorly understood. Here we showed that the essential NER factor XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum group A) underwent nuclear accumulation upon UV irradiation, and strikingly, such an event occurred in an ATR (Ataxia-Telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related)-dependent manner. Either treatment of cells with ATR kinase inhibitors or transfection of cells with small interfering RNA targeting ATR compromised the UV-induced XPA nuclear translocation. Consistently, the ATR-deficient cells displayed no substantial XPA nuclear translocation while the translocation remained intact in ATM (Ataxia-Telangiectasia mutated)-deficient cells in response to UV irradiation. Moreover, we found that ATR is required for the UV-induced nuclear focus formation of XPA. Taken together, our results suggested that the ATR checkpoint pathway may modulate NER activity through the regulation of XPA redistribution in human cells upon UV irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W1992197155,"The inactive transcription factor NF-kappaB is localized in the cytoplasm and rapidly responds to a variety of extracellular factors and intracellular stress conditions to initiate multiple cellular responses. While the knowledge regarding NF-kappaB signaling pathways initiated by extracellular ligands is rapidly expanding, the mechanisms of activation by intracellular stress conditions are not well understood. We recently described a critical role for a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification of NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB kinase, in response to certain genotoxic stress conditions. One important unanswered question is whether the role of this modification is limited to the genotoxic agents or some other signaling pathways also employ SUMOylation of NEMO to regulate NF-kappaB activation. Here, we report that a variety of other stress conditions, including oxidative stress, ethanol exposure, heat shock and electric shock, also induce NEMO SUMOylation, thus demonstrating that DNA damage per se is not necessary for this NEMO modification to occur. Moreover, combinations of certain SUMO stress and ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) activation conditions lead to NF-kappaB activation without inducing DNA damage. Our study helps to conceptualize how individual or a combination of different stress conditions may funnel into this previously unappreciated signal transduction mechanism to regulate the activity of the ubiquitous NF-kappaB transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1996854121,"Top quartile serum prolactin levels confer a twofold increase in the relative risk of developing breast cancer. Prolactin exerts this effect at an ill defined point in the carcinogenic process, via mechanisms involving direct action via prolactin receptors within mammary epithelium and/or indirect action through regulation of other hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. We have addressed these questions by examining mammary carcinogenesis in transplants of mouse mammary epithelium expressing the SV40T oncogene, with or without the prolactin receptor, using host animals with a normal endocrine system. In prolactin receptor knockout transplants the area of neoplasia was significantly smaller (7 versus 17%; P < 0.001 at 22 weeks and 7 versus 14%; P = 0.009 at 32 weeks). Low-grade neoplastic lesions displayed reduced BrdU incorporation rate (11.3 versus 17% P = 0.003) but no change in apoptosis rate. Tumor latency increased (289 days versus 236 days, P < 0.001). Tumor frequency, growth rate, morphology, cell proliferation and apoptosis were not altered. Thus, prolactin acts directly on the mammary epithelial cells to increase cell proliferation in preinvasive lesions, resulting in more neoplasia and acceleration of the transition to invasive carcinoma. Targeting of mammary prolactin signaling thus provides a strategy to prevent the early progression of neoplasia to invasive carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2063309485,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the attachment of cognate amino acids to specific tRNA molecules. To prevent potential errors in protein synthesis caused by misactivation of noncognate amino acids, some synthetases have evolved editing mechanisms to hydrolyze misactivated amino acids (pre-transfer editing) or misacylated tRNAs (post-transfer editing). In the case of post-transfer editing, synthetases employ a separate editing domain that is distinct from the site of amino acid activation, and the mechanism is believed to involve shuttling of the flexible CCA-3′ end of the tRNA from the synthetic active site to the site of hydrolysis. The mechanism of pre-transfer editing is less well understood, and in most cases, the exact site of pre-transfer editing has not been conclusively identified. Here, we probe the pre-transfer editing activity of class II prolyl-tRNA synthetases from five species representing all three kingdoms of life. To locate the site of pre-transfer editing, truncation mutants were constructed by deleting the insertion domain characteristic of bacterial prolyl-tRNA synthetase species, which is the site of post-transfer editing, or the N- or C-terminal extension domains of eukaryotic and archaeal enzymes. In addition, the pre-transfer editing mechanism of Escherichia coli prolyl-tRNA synthetase was probed in detail. These studies show that a separate editing domain is not required for pre-transfer editing by prolyl-tRNA synthetase.

The aminoacylation active site plays a significant role in preserving the fidelity of translation by acting as a filter that selectively releases non-cognate adenylates into solution, while protecting the cognate adenylate from hydrolysis. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze a two-step reaction resulting in the esterification of specific amino acids onto the 3′-adenosine of cognate tRNA molecules. In the first step, an amino acid is activated in the presence of ATP to form an enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate (aa-AMP) 3The abbreviations used are: aa-AMP, aminoacyl adenylate; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; CP1, connective polypeptide 1; INS, insertion domain; Ec, Escherichia coli; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Mj, Methanaococcus jannaschii; Mm, Methanaococcus maripaludis; Mt, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum; TES, N-tris(hydroxyl-methyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; l-ASA, 5′-O-[N-(l-alanyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine; l-PSA, 5′-O-[N-(l-prolyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine; WT, wild type. intermediate. In the second step, the activated amino acid is transferred to the 3′-end of the tRNA (1Freist W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6787-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fidelity of this process is critical for the faithful translation of genetic information. Each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase selects and activates its cognate amino acid from a cellular pool of 20 different proteinaceous amino acids. The similar sizes and/or chemical structures of many amino acid side chains make accurate discrimination by synthetases challenging. As a result, misactivation of non-cognate amino acids and misacylation of tRNAs may occur. Such errors, if left uncorrected, ultimately would lead to cell death due to incorporation of the incorrect amino acid during protein synthesis (2Orgel L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 49: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 3Laughrea M. Exp. Gerontol. 1982; 17: 305-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Freist W. Sternbach H. Pardowitz I. Cramer F. J. Theor. Biol. 1998; 193: 19-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To correct these errors, some synthetases have evolved editing or proofreading mechanisms (5Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In pre-transfer editing, the non-cognate aa-AMP is hydrolyzed prior to transfer to the tRNA (Fig. 1, paths 1–3). Post-transfer editing involves deacylation of a mischarged tRNA (Fig. 1, path 4). The pre-transfer editing process may occur in either a tRNA-dependent (Fig. 1, path 3) or tRNA-independent (Fig. 1, paths 1 and 2) manner. Two distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been identified on the basis of conserved sequence and structural motifs (6Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Evidence of hydrolytic editing was first discovered in class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, which hydrolyzes Val-AMP in a tRNAIle-dependent manner (7Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this model, the aminoacylation active site acts as a coarse first sieve, excluding larger noncognate amino acids based upon size, whereas a second active site acts as a fine sieve, editing noncognate amino acids of smaller size than the cognate amino acid. Support for the double-sieve model to explain post-transfer editing has been obtained from biochemical studies (16Chen J.F. Guo N.N. Li T. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L.

By contrast, the site and mechanism of pre-transfer editing are less well understood, especially for class II synthetases.

Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 519-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, based on x-ray crystallography, the two active sites are separated ∼30 Å, and the mechanism of this translocation remains unclear. Recently, a post-transfer initiated pre-transfer editing model has been postulated for isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase and leucyl-tRNA synthetase, where an initial post-transfer editing step is used to trigger a conformational change to an editing active conformation that can now perform pre-transfer editing in the CP1 domain (36Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12989-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Support for the role of the CP1 domain in pre-transfer editing also comes from x-ray crystallography studies showing that both pre- and post-transfer editing substrate analogs bind in overlapping sites in the CP1 domain of leucyl-tRNA synthetase and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (9Lincecum Jr., T.L.

However, recent studies of class I glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, which normally lacks editing function and a spatially separate editing domain, have provided evidence for a pre-transfer editing-like reaction occurring in the synthetic active site (39Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The location of pre-transfer editing in the case of class II synthetases has not been extensively investigated. Class II Escherichia coli (Ec) threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which edits misacylated Ser-tRNAThr via an N-terminal editing domain, appears to lack pre-transfer editing activity (20Dock-Bregeon A.

On the other hand, Ec alanyl-tRNA synthetase and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase edit Gly- and Ser-tRNAAla and Trp-tRNAPhe, respectively, and also possess a tRNA-dependent pre-transfer editing function (19Beebe K. Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ProRS is another class II synthetase that possesses both pre- and post-transfer hydrolytic editing activities (21Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Post-transfer editing of Ala-tRNAPro by bacterial ProRS is carried out by a large insertion domain (INS) located between motifs 2 and 3, which make up the aminoacylation active site (31Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Nagan M. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7108-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Wong F.C. Beuning P.J. Silvers C. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52857-52864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An N-terminal domain with weak homology to INS also appears to function as a post-transfer editing domain in some lower eukaryotic species (41Ahel I. Korencic D. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15422-15427Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Pre-transfer editing of alanyl-adenylate has been observed in ProRSs from all three kingdoms of life, even those that lack an INS domain (22Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the ProRS system, hydrolysis of the misactivated adenylate occurs in the absence of tRNA and tRNA addition does not stimulate the activity (21Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8916-8920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30779-30785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, this represents an ideal system to specifically probe the mechanism of pre-transfer editing, because the lack of a requirement for tRNA ensures only pre-transfer editing is being observed. In this work, we investigate ProRS truncation mutants designed to probe the INS domain of bacterial ProRS, as well as the N- and C-terminal extension domains found in lower eukaryotic and archaeal ProRSs, respectively, for their role in amino acid activation, aminoacylation, and pre-transfer editing. In addition to probing the site of pre-transfer editing, we also explore the mechanism of tRNA-independent pre-transfer editing by Ec ProRS in more detail. Any mechanism that involves formation of a non-cognate adenylate, followed by preferential removal of that adenylate from the reaction pathway leading to aminoacylated tRNA, can be considered pre-transfer editing. However, there are multiple possible mechanisms to achieve selectivity after the adenylate has been synthesized. One mechanism, which we will term “selective hydrolysis,” involves the transport of the adenylate to a distinct active site in which the hydrolysis of non-cognate adenylates, but not cognate adenylates, is catalyzed. Alternatively, enzymatic hydrolysis of non-cognate adenylates may occur in the aminoacylation active site. In a third possible mechanism, which we will term “selective release,” non-cognate adenylates are bound to the enzymatic active site considerably less strongly than cognate adenylates, leading to the release of the non-cognate products into solution, where the intrinsic instability of mixed anhydride functionality leads to rapid, non-enzymatic, hydrolysis (Fig. 1, path 2). When the rate of adenylate release is faster than the rate of aminoacyl transfer, this path has been referred to as “kinetic proofreading” (42Hopfield J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4135-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). To distinguish between enzyme-catalyzed selective hydrolysis and selective release of Ala-AMP, a thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-based assay was employed to directly measure the rate of AMP formation by Ec ProRS. A separate “chase” assay was used to release bound adenylate from the active site of the enzyme to measure the rate of non-catalytic adenylate hydrolysis in solution. The results of these experiments support a critical role for the aminoacylation active site in selective release of noncognate adenylates by Ec ProRS. Materials—All amino acids were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest quality available (>99% pure). 3H-Labeled proline and alanine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Primers for site-directed mutagenesis and PCR were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT). Enzyme Preparation—Overexpression and purification of histidine-tagged Ec wild-type (WT) ProRS was performed as described earlier (43Burke B. Lipman R.S. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Hou Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20286-20291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two constructs encoding Ec ProRS lacking the INS domain were constructed using Excite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The 163 residues of the INS domain (amino acids 232–394) were replaced with either an 8-residue Gly6Ser2 linker or a 16-residue Gly12Ser4 linker by PCR amplification of the full-length plasmid pCS-M1S (44Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for the 8-residue linker: 5′-AGAACCGCCGCCACCAGAACCGCCCGCTGCATAGTCAGAGGTGTCGGAGAAGAC-3′ and 5′-TCTGGTGGCGGCGGTTCTGGTGGCCCAAGCCCGGATGGCCAGGGTAGGCTGCTG-3′. The underlined region encodes the linker residues and a similar strategy was used to construct the 16-residue linker. The PCR product was first digested with DpnI to remove the parental plasmid followed by blunt end ligation. The ligated product was then transformed into Ec XL1-blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene), plated on Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Results of cloning were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Microchemical Facility, University of Minnesota). Plasmids encoding both constructs were transformed into Ec SG13009 (pREP4) (Qiagen) competent cells and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 20 h at room temperature. Histidine-tagged protein was purified using a Co2+-chelated Talon resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The desired proteins (designated EcΔINS Gly6Ser2 and EcΔINS Gly12Ser4) were eluted with 25 mm imidazole, concentrated, and stored as described earlier (43Burke B. Lipman R.S. Shiba K.

Plasmid pM445Mj-P encoding the WT Methanococcus jannaschii (Mj) proS gene and plasmid pM446Mtht-P encoding WT Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Mt) ProRS were provided by Professor Kiyotaka Shiba (Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan). Each WT proS gene was cloned into the pKS583 plasmid (45Shiba K. Takahashi Y. Noda T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which contains a histidine-tagged sequence. Mt ProRS was overexpressed and purified according to previously described procedures (46Stehlin C. Heacock 2nd, D.H. Liu H. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2932-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis to incorporate a stop codon at position 374 of Mj ProRS (to generate MjΔC81) was performed with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of undesired changes at other positions were confirmed by sequencing the entire gene. Plasmids encoding histidine-tagged WT Mj ProRS and MjΔC81 (pPRS374) were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysE cells and colonies were selected by growth on chloramphenicol and ampicillin media. Purification of WT Mj ProRS was performed as described earlier (46Stehlin C. Heacock 2nd, D.H. Liu H. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2932-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MjΔC81 was purified using the Talon batch method. Briefly, Co2+-chelated Talon resin (Clontech) was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol and equilibrated for 20 min in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, saturated 2-propanol solution of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 0.75 mg/ml). The resin was then centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was removed. Supernatant from the sonicated cells was added to the prepared resin and allowed to equilibrate with shaking (<100 rpm) for 20–30 min. The resin was washed with 10 bed volumes of sonication buffer, followed by 20 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole). The desired protein was then eluted with 10 1-ml aliquots of wash buffer containing 80 mm imidazole. Peak fractions containing MjΔC81 were detected by SDS-PAGE. The gene encoding Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) ProRS was cloned via PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from bakers' yeast using Pwo polymerase (Roche) and PCR primers, 5′-CGCGCATGCCTGCCTGTTTCGGAAGCGTTT-3′ and 5′-CGCAAGCTTCTAATAAGAACGACCGAACAT-3′. The PCR product was gel purified, digested with SphI and HindIII, and ligated into the histidine-tagged protein expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) to construct plasmid pJS550. A truncated Sc ProRS mutant lacking the N-terminal 183 residues (ScΔ183) was constructed similarly using primers 5′-CGCGCATGCCTTATTGGTATCACCGTAGAC-3′ and 5′-CGCAAGCTTCTAATAAGAACGACCGAACAT-3′. Histidine-tagged WT Sc ProRS and ScΔ183 proteins were purified as described previously (43Burke B. Lipman R.S. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Hou Y.M. J. Biol.

The genomic sequence of Methanococcus maripaludis (Mm) was obtained from Professor John Leigh at the University of Washington. PCR amplification of the Mm proS gene from Mm cell paste (provided by Professor Jim Brown, North Carolina State University) was carried out using Taq polymerase and the following PCR primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGGAATTTTCCGAATGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGTCGACTTAGTATGTTCTGGCAACTGAAAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pCR2.1TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen). The results of cloning were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing and the product was then digested with BamHI and SalI and directionally cloned into the histidine-tagged protein expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen), resulting in plasmid pJS860. The plasmid was transformed into Ec SG13009 (pREP4) (Qiagen) competent cells and Mm ProRS was overexpressed and purified using a Co2+-chelated Talon resin (Clontech).

A plasmid encoding the Mm tRNAPro gene was constructed by incorporating three changes (deletion of U20b; mutation of G45A and A57G) into the plasmid encoding WT Mj tRNAPro using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid encoding Mm tRNAPro contains a FokI site within the target sequence so the template for in vitro transcription was generated via PCR using primers 5′-CCTGCAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG3′ and 5′-TGGTGGGCCTGCCCAGATTCGAAC-3′, and Turbo polymerase (Stratagene). The gene encoding Sc tRNAPro was obtained by PCR of genomic DNA isolated from bakers' yeast using primers 5′-CGGATTTCCTGCAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGTGTGGTCTAGTGG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTGGGGGGCGAGCTGGGAATTG-3′. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into plasmid pFVal119 (47Liu H. Horowitz J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 264PubMed Google Scholar). An intron present within the tRNAPro gene was removed using Transformer site-directed mutagenesis (Clontech) to generate pJS607t.

https://openalex.org/W2083138749,"Promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF) is a transcriptional repressor and tumor suppressor. PLZF is expressed in melanocytes but not in melanoma cells, and recovery of PLZF expression markedly suppresses melanoma cell growth. Several target genes regulated by PLZF have been identified, but the precise function of PLZF remains uncertain. Here, we searched for candidate target genes of PLZF by DNA microarray analysis. Pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) was one of the prominently suppressed genes. Pbx1 was highly expressed in melanoma cells, and its expression was reduced by transduction with the PLZF gene. Moreover, the growth suppression mediated by PLZF was reversed by enforced expression of Pbx1. Knockdown of Pbx1 by specific small interfering RNAs suppressed melanoma cell growth. We also found that Pbx1 binds HoxB7. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that repression of Pbx1 by PLZF reduces the expression of HoxB7 target genes, including tumor-associated neoangiogenesis factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, angiopoietin-2 and matrix metalloprotease 9. These findings suggest that deregulation of Pbx1 expression owing to loss of PLZF expression contributes to the progression and/or pathogenesis of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2091467901,"Sumoylation and ubiquitinylation reversibly regulate the activity of transcription factors through covalent attachment to lysine residues of target proteins. We examined whether the Ets-1 transcription factor is modified by sumoylation and/or ubiquitinylation. Among four potential SUMO motifs in Ets-1, we identified lysines 15 and 227 within the LK15YE and IK227QE motifs, as being the sumoylation acceptor sites. Using transfection of Ets-1 wildtype (WT) or its sumoylation deficient version (Ets-1 K15R/K227R), as well as WT or mutant proteins of the SUMO pathway, we further demonstrated that the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and a E3 SUMO ligase, PIASy, can enhance Ets-1 sumoylation, while a SUMO protease, SENP1, can desumoylate Ets-1. We also found that Ets-1 is modified by K48-linked polyubiquitinylation independently of the sumoylation acceptor sites and is degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway, while sumoylation of Ets-1 does not affect its stability. Finally, sumoylation of Ets-1 leads to reduced transactivation and we demonstrated that previously identified critical lysine residues in Synergistic Control motifs are the sumoylation acceptor sites of Ets-1. These data show that Ets-1 can be modified by sumoylation and/or ubiquitinylation, with sumoylation repressing transcriptional activity of Ets-1 and having no clear antagonistic action on the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1993714839,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) degradation under normoxia is critical to modulating vascular growth. This degradation is mediated during normoxia by the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL)-E3 ubiquitin ligase in partnership with the E2 enzyme UbcH5. In current models of the functionally similar Skp1, cullin, F-box (SCF)-E3 ligase, the E3 binds the target protein and the E2 catalyses ubiquitin transfer to lysines in an appropriately positioned domain. In the present study, we report that for efficient ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha to occur, three conserved lysines are required in both the HIF-1alpha and endothelial Per-ARNT-Sim domain protein (EPAS) sequences. The site of ubiquitin attachment via UbcH5 was mapped, and is shown to involve three HIF-1alpha lysines, K532, K538 and K547, and the same aligned lysines in EPAS. Only one of these lysines need to be intact for full ubiquitination to occur, analogous to the mechanism of Sic1 ubiquitination by the SCF/Cdc34 complex and further strengthening the functional link between the VHL and SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligases. We also report that lysines can be moved around the HIF-1alpha sequence with only minor losses in ubiquitination efficiency, thus suggesting HIF-1alpha and EPAS regulation by hypoxia depends primarily on an interaction with VHL per se, rather than the highly specific positioning of flanking lysine acceptors."

The biological and clinical characteristics of epithelial type malignant mesothelioma are distinct from those of biphasic and sarcomatous type tumors. The goal of our study was to examine the molecular basis for this distinction. Microarray analysis confirmed that the molecular signatures of epithelial and biphasic histologic subtypes were distinct. Among the differentially expressed functional gene categories was the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which was upregulated in biphasic tumors. Cytotoxicity experiments indicated that 211H cells derived from biphasic tumors were synergistically sensitive to sequential combination regimens containing the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and oxaliplatin. The mechanism of this synergistic response, which was not detected in cells of epithelial tumor origin, was apoptosis. Together, our results identify the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a biomarker of poor prognosis biphasic peritoneal mesothelioma tumors and suggest that proteasome inhibitors could increase the effectiveness of cytotoxic chemotherapy in this subset of patients."

Fhit is a member of the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein superfamily, encoding a diadenosine polyphosphate (ApnA) hydrolase that cleaves substrates such as Ap3A to AMP plus the other nucleotide (12Barnes L.D.

These biological functions of Fhit are consistent with its tumor suppressor activity. In Arabidopsis, Nit family members (Nit1-3) are believed to convert indole-3-acetonitrile into indole-3-acetic acid, known as a plant growth hormone auxin, which plays an important role in development of the embryo, leaf formation, and root initiation (26Normanly J.

Structural analysis of C. elegans NitFhit protein, gene name nft-1, showed that NitFhit is a tetramer in which the Nit domains are localized at the center with Fhit dimers at the poles with Fhit nucleotide binding sites facing away from Nit and that recombinant D. melanogaster NitFhit was capable of cleaving Ap3A to AMP and ADP (30Pace H.C.

The biological role of worm and fly Nit domains, as well as Nit1-interacting proteins and substrates, is unknown. In this study, we conducted diverse experiments in vitro and in vivo to elucidate the biological or physiological effects of Nit1 expression in mammalian cells and in mice. In particular, possible roles of Nit1 as a tumor suppressor were assessed on the basis of the previous data that supported Fhit-modulated cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mouse Models and Genotyping Protocols—A conditional deletion construct for the murine Nit1 gene was designed to flank exon 4 through 7 with LoxP sites. Briefly, LoxP sites were put into intron 3 and intron 7 with a phosphoglycerate kinaseneomycin cassette, and a diphtheria toxin cassette was included in the construct for negative selection. This targeting vector was transfected into 129/SVJ embryonic stem cells, and after neomycin selection, embryonic stem clones with heterozygously recombined Nit1 alleles were identified by Southern blot. DNAs digested with BamHI and PvuII and blotted onto a nylon membrane were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. Correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones were injected into blastocysts. Germ line transmitters were obtained by crossing the chimeric mice with C57BL/B6 mice, which were then crossed with EIIa Cre transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) to obtain mosaic mice. Segregation of the mosaic mice by crossing with C57BL/B6 mice resulted in Nit1fl/fl and Nit1fl/- mice. The whey acidic protein (Wap)-Cre transgenic mice (National Cancer Institute Mouse Models to Human Cancers Consortium, Rockville, MD) were mated with the Nit1fl/fl mice and ultimately produced Wap-Cre Nit1fl/fl mice. All animals used in the studies were treated humanely in accordance with federal guidelines and institutional policies. Screening of founder animals and their offspring was performed by genomic PCR with the following primer sets: Nit1 floxed/wild-type allele, 5′-GTTGGTCTAGCAATCTGTTATGA-3′ and 5′-GTGCTGGGATTAAAGGTGTGC-3′; Nit1 deletion allele, 5′-GTACCGGATACCGATTACTTCGA-3′ and 5′-GTGCTGGGATTAAAGGTGTGCA-3′; Wap-Cre transgene, 5′-TAGAGCTGTGCCAGCCTCTTC-3′ and 5′-CATCACTCGTTGCATCGACC-3′. Genotypes of Nit1fl/- and Nit1-/- mice obtained from the offspring of Nit1fl/fl mice were also confirmed by genomic PCR. Nit1fl/fl and Nit1-/- Mouse Kidney Cells and Cell Culture—Whole kidneys from a Nit1fl/fl mouse were dissected and placed in culture, and cells were grown and subcultured in minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To generate Nit1-deficient (Nit1-/-) cells, Nit1fl/fl cells were infected with retrovirus-expressing Cre recombinase, constructed using pLNCX1-IRES-EGFP (Clontech). Viral infection efficiencies were determined by inspection of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression and fluorescence-activated cell sorter-based counting. A549 (Fhit-positive) and H1299 (Fhit-negative) human lung cancer cells (15Semba S. Trapasso F. Fabbri M. McCorkell K.A. Volinia S. Druck T. Iliopoulos D. Pekarsky Y. Ishii H. Garrison P.N.

Cell Viability Test, DNA Damage Induction, and Flow Cytometric Analyses—The ViCell cell counter (Beckman Coulter) was used for cell counting and viability tests (15Semba S. Trapasso F. Fabbri M. McCorkell K.A. Volinia S. Druck T. Iliopoulos D. Pekarsky Y. Ishii H. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MMC treatment and UVC light exposure experiments were carried out as reported (24Ottey M. Han S.Y. Druck T. Barnoski B.L. McCorkell K.A. Croce C.M. Raventos-Suarez C. Fairchild C.R. Wang Y. Huebner K. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1669-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with medium supplemented with2or5 μm MMC (Fisher) or exposed to 30 or 60 J/m2 UVC (254 nm) irradiation. Viable cell numbers were estimated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo). To analyze cellular DNA content and cells positive for active caspase-3 with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur cytometer (BD Biosciences), cells were stained with propidium iodide and phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal anti-active (cleaved) caspase-3 (BD Biosciences), respectively (15Semba S.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Nit1 mRNA expression was confirmed by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNAs were amplified with OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), using primers as follows: 5′-GTACTTTGTACTCAGCCCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATAGAGGTCAGGTCTGCG-3′ (reverse). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses were performed using the iCycler multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The primer set for amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA served as a housekeeping control gene (15Semba S. Trapasso F. Fabbri M. McCorkell K.A. Volinia S. Druck T.

Rabbit polyclonal Nit1 antiserum against human Nit1 C-terminal peptide (QHRRPDLYGSLGHPLS) was custom-made by Zymed Laboratories Inc. and shown to specifically detect both human and mouse Nit1 protein. Specificity was shown by immunoblot and immunohistochemistry using tissues from mice with homozygous deletion of the floxed NIT1 alleles. These tissues were shown to be negative for staining of the Nit1-sized band on immunoblots and negative for immunohistochemical staining relative to Nit1-positive controls, as seen below under “Results” and in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2. Tubulin (NeoMarkers) and green fluorescent protein (Molecular Probes) antibodies were used in detection of protein in loading controls. Recombinant Adenoviral Vector Construction—Adenoviruses carrying human recombinant NIT1 (Ad-NIT1) and FHIT (Ad-FHIT) were constructed as described previously (14Trapasso F. Krakowiak A. Cesari R. Arkles J. Yendamuri S. Ishii H. Vecchione A. Kuroki T. Bieganowski T. Pace H.C. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1592-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The transfer vector pAdenoVator-CMV5-GFP (Qbiogene) carrying full-length human NIT1 or FHIT cDNAs and the AdVator ΔE1/E3 adenoviral genome construct were mixed and recombination performed in BJ5183 Escherichia coli. Resulting recombinant vectors were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells to package viruses. Isolated single viral plaques were expanded and assessed for Nit1 or Fhit expression by Western blot. Ad-GFP virus was used as a nonspecific control (Qbiogene). Viral titers were determined by absorbance measurement, multiplicity of infection test, and tissue culture infectious dose 50 methods. Cells were incubated with adenoviral aliquots at a desired multiplicity of infection (0-100) for 4 h prior to addition of culture medium (>25 × volume of virus inoculum). Transfections—For transient expression of exogenous wild-type and mutant Nit1, Nit1-/- cells were transfected with pIRESneo vector (Clontech) encoding wild-type (pNit1) or C203A mutant Nit1 (pNit1-C203A). Transient transfection was conducted with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transformation, cells were assessed for viability, active caspase-3, and expression of specific proteins. Mating Experiments for the Mammary Gland Development Study—Wap-Cre Nit1fl/fl and Nit1fl/fl matings were set up late in the afternoon and female mice checked for copulation plugs over the following few days to determine time of mating. The morning on which a copulation plug was observed was pregnancy day 0.5 and the female separated from the male. Mice were sacrificed for phenotypic analysis during pregnancy (P13, P16, P19) or lactation (L1, L4). For whole mount analysis of mammary glands, the fourth inguinal mammary glands were spread on glass, fixed in Carnoy's solution, defatted, and stained in carmine alum solution overnight. The tissue was then dehydrated and mounted on glass. The average numbers of branch points and total number of endbuds between nipple and endbuds were counted microscopically (34Deans A.J.

For histological examination, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or subjected to immunohistochemical analyses. Immunofluorescent and Immunohistochemical Analyses—Nit1fl/fl cells on coverslips and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded whole mount mouse embryo (E13) sections were used. Cells were incubated with the antiserum against Nit1 and goat Texas Red or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Mounting medium containing 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) was used for nuclear staining. Immunohistochemical staining by a modified version of the immunoglobulin enzyme bridge technique was performed to detect Nit1 and cyclin D1 expression (15Semba S. Trapasso F. Fabbri M. McCorkell K.A. Volinia S. Druck T. Iliopoulos D. Pekarsky Y. Ishii H. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1-positive cells in mammary ducts and lobules were counted in at least 10 high power fields (×400) for each section. For detection of apoptotic bodies, ApopTag Peroxidase kit (Chemicon) was used. Briefly, mouse mammary gland sections were pretreated with proteinase K and incubated with 2 N HCl. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme was added to the pre-equilibrated cells. Antidigoxigenin peroxidase conjugate IgG and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride-dihydrate were added to the slides. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The percent of ApopTag-positive cells was determined by counting cells in at least 10 high power fields. NMBA Carcinogenicity Study—Nit1fl/fl, Nit1fl/-, and Nit1-/- mice (15 each) were given intragastric doses of NMBA (Ash Stevens), 2 mg/kg body weight, a total of six times over a 3-week period. All mice were sacrificed 10 weeks after the final NMBA dose and examined for end-point tumor incidence (33Fong L.Y. Fidanza V. Zanesi N. Lock L.F. Siracusa L.D. Mancini R. Siprashvili Z. Ottey M. Martin S.E. Druck T. McCue P.A. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4742-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). At autopsy, whole stomachs were removed and opened longitudinally. The number of animals bearing tumors in the esophagus, the forestomach, and the squamocolumnar junction and number of papillomas and dysplasias (carcinomas in situ) were scored by histological examination. Fhit-/- mice, which were known to show enhanced susceptibility to NMBA-induced upper digestive tract tumors, were included in the study as controls. Statistical Analysis—p values calculated by the Student's two-sided t test were used to determine significance of differences in measurements of mammary gland developmental stages in the Nit1fl/fl and Wap-Cre Nit1fl/fl mice. Expression of Nit1 Protein in Normal Tissues—To study the function of Nit1 in murine homeostasis and embryogenesis, we initially examined Nit1 protein expression in adult mouse tissues and embryos. Nit1 expression was detected in most tissues and was particularly abundant in adult liver and kidney (Fig. 1, A and C) and in embryonic adrenal gland and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1D). In cultured mouse kidney cells, endogenous Nit1 was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, weakly in nuclei, and, apparently, partially in mitochondria (Fig. 1B). Because the strongest case for Rosetta Stone proteins decoding real interactions can be made when the separate genes have similar gene expression patterns (1Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M. Ng H.L. Rice D.W. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Science. 1999; 285: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar), we compared expression patterns of Nit1 and Fhit in mouse tissues and found that the pattern of Nit1 expression in adult mouse tissues partially overlapped the Fhit pattern (Fig. 1A). Nit1 Deficiency Results in Up-regulated Growth, Increased Cyclin D1 Expression, and Resistance to DNA-damaging Agents—We generated conditional knock-out mice in which Nit1 coding exons 4-7 can be deleted through Cre-mediated recombination (Fig. 2A); Nit1fl/+ mice were mated and Nit1fl/fl mice obtained (Fig. 2, B and C). Mice with two floxed Nit1 alleles developed normally to adulthood; males and females were fertile, without phenotypic abnormalities, suggesting that insertion of the selectable marker did not affect transcriptional regulation of the Nit1 gene. To investigate the role of Nit1 in cultured cells, we established Nit1-/- cells by infecting Nit1fl/fl mouse kidney cells with a retrovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Homozygous genomic deletion of the targeted alleles, decreased levels of truncated Nit1 mRNA expression, and resultant loss of Nit1 protein expression were confirmed; Fhit expression was unaffected in Nit1 null cells (Fig. 2D). Nit1-/- cells exhibited round and compact shapes, loss of lobular structure, higher cell density with increased S and G2/M cell populations, and >3-fold higher clonogenicity in comparison with Nit1fl/fl cells (Fig. 3, A-C). To clarify mechanisms of acceleration of cell growth induced by Nit1 deficiency, Nit1fl/fl and Nit1-/- cell lysates were immunoblotted for assessment of expression of specific proteins. Deficiency of Nit1 expression caused higher cyclin D1 expression, whereas differences in the other cell cycle-associated proteins appeared minimal (Fig. 3D). Because Fhit modulates cell survival and resistance to MMC and UVC light (24Ottey M. Han S.Y. Druck T. Barnoski B.L. McCorkell K.A. Croce C.M. Raventos-Suarez C. Fairchild C.R. Wang Y. Huebner K. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 1669-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we examined sensitivity to these DNA-damaging agents in cells with or without Nit1 expression. Enhanced survival of the Nit1-/- cells after treatment with MMC and UVC light was observed; these DNA-damaging agents seemed to influence cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E). Mutation of the Nit1 Catalytic Site Did Not Alter Nit1-mediated Biological Effects—Previous reports have demonstrated induction of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis by Ad-FHIT-wild-type in human cancer cells (16Ji L. Fang B. Yen N. Minna J.D. Roth J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3333-3339PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dumon K.R. Ishii H. Vecchione A. Trapasso F. Baldassarre G. Chakrani F. Druck T. Rosato E.F. Williams N.N. Baffa R. During M.J. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4827-4836PubMed Google Scholar). However, Nit1 has not been shown to interact with Fhit nor has its biological activity been examined. Thus, we assessed the apoptosis-inducing effect of Ad-NIT1 and Ad-FHIT in cells with or without Nit1 expression. Recombinant protein expression and equivalent infectivity of the two viruses were confirmed by Western blot (data not shown). Irrespective of Nit1 expression, overexpression of NIT1 and FHIT by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery resulted in increased populations of active caspase-3 positive cells and cells with sub-G1 DNA content in a multiplicity of infection-dependent manner; Ad-FHIT-mediated induction of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis was more effective in Nit1fl/fl cells than in Nit1-/- cells (Fig. 4A). Conversely, we examined Ad-NIT1 effects in cells with or without Fhit expression. Ad-NIT1 could in"

In cells using ammonium or glutamine, the GATA transcription factor Gln3 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Ure2 whereas it enters the nucleus after a shift to a nonpreferred nitrogen source like proline or upon addition of rapamycin, the TOR complex inhibitor. Recently, the Npr1 kinase and the Rsp5, Bul1/2 ubiquitin ligase complex were reported to have antagonistic roles in the nuclear import and Gln3-mediated activation. The Npr1 kinase controls the activity of various permeases including transporters for nitrogen sources that stimulate NCR such as the Mep ammonium transport systems. Combining data from growth tests, Northern blot analysis and Gln3 immunolocalization, we show that the Npr1 kinase is not a direct negative regulator of Gln3-dependent transcription. The derepression of Gln3-activated genes in ammonium-grown npr1 cells results from the reduced uptake of the nitrogen-repressing compound because NCR could be restored in npr1 cells by repairing ammonium-uptake defects through different means. Finally, we show that the impairment of the ubiquitin ligase complex does not prevent induction of NCR genes under nonpreferred nitrogen conditions. The apparent Rsp5-, Bul1/2-dependent Gln3 activation keeps to the cellular status, as it is only observed in cells having left the balanced phase of exponential growth.

During growth on a preferred nitrogen source, such as sufficient ammonium or glutamine, nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) 5The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; WT, wild type; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. is exerted on catabolic enzymes and transport systems devoted to nonpreferred nitrogen sources such as proline utilization (reviewed in Ref. 1Magasanik B. Kaiser C.A. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 290: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Under NCR conditions, the Gln3 GATA transcription factor bound to Ure2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing Gln3-dependent activation of nitrogen-regulated genes (2Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The nitrogen-regulated localization of Gln3 is thought to be under the control of the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling pathway. For instance, upon treatment with rapamycin, condition which inactivates the TOR kinase complex, Gln3 is released from Ure2 and transferred to the nucleus in an active form (2Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Similarly, upon a cell shift from NCR conditions to a nonpreferred nitrogen source, Gln3 enters the nucleus where transcription activation of nitrogen-regulated genes may occur. The S/T kinase Npr1 has recently been described as a negative regulator of Gln3-dependent transcription because the absence of the kinase results in a nuclear localization of active Gln3 under ammonium supply (3Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Rsp5/Bul1/Bul2 ubiquitin ligase complex was further proposed to be required for Gln3 activation in the absence of Npr1 or upon a cell shift from the preferred to the nonpreferred nitrogen source, indicating that an ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway controls Gln3-dependent transcription (3Crespo J.L.

On the other hand, the Npr1 kinase is well known as a major element for the development of optimal activity for a variety of permeases (4Grenson M. Eur. J.

Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Grenson M. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 121: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For instance, the kinase is required for the activity of the high affinity ammonium transport system Mep1 and for a lower affinity component (8Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, we show that derepression of Gln3-dependent genes in npr1 cells grown on ammonium results from the reduced uptake of the nitrogen repressing compound. We further unravel key components of the medium influencing the extent of nitrogen derepression in the absence of the Npr1 kinase. Finally, we show that in cells growing in the balanced phase of exponential growth, the impairment of the ubiquitin ligase complex does not prevent the induction of NCR gene expression under nonpreferred nitrogen conditions arguing against a direct involvement of the complex.

Strain OS29 was obtained from OS27–1 after KanMX removal using the Cre-lox P system (31Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Strain 31034c was obtained by crossing MG4000 (8Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with 23344c (ura3). A C-terminal tagging of the GLN3 chromosomal copy with 13 copies of Myc epitope was performed as described in (32Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, all yeast strains were grown in minimal buffered medium (pH 6.1) containing 3% glucose, vitamins, mineral traces (10Jacobs P. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When stated, yeast strains were grown on synthetic medium (YNB) without amino acids and without ammonium. The nitrogen sources were ammonium at the indicated concentration or proline (0.1%). For some experiments, the YNB medium was buffered with citric acid-KOH at pH 6.1. To test the effect of zinc concentration, YNB medium was prepared according to the composition described in Difco catalogue except for zinc, we used 0.014 mg/liter zinc sulfate (0.05 μm) instead of 0.4 mg/ml (1.4 μm) in the commercial YNB. Rapamycin (Sigma) (dissolved in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol) was added to the culture, where indicated to a final concentration of 200 ng/ml for 30 min.TABLE 1Strains of S. cerevisiae used in this studyStrainsRelevant genotypeSource23344cura3André's laboratory collection21994bnpr1 ura3Vandenbol et al.

Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (34Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DIG-DNA probes of about 500 bp were generated by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides, and labeled using a PCR DIG probe synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were carried out according to standard procedures. Detection of digoxigenin-labeled nucleic acids was performed by enzyme immunoassay with luminescence following the supplier procedure (Roche Applied Science). The Hybond-N+ nylon membranes were analyzed using a chemiluminescence camera (Chemi-Smart from Vilbert-Lourmat). The exposure time was 120 min. The RNA signals were quantified using the Bio-1D analysis program from Vilbert-Lourmat. Relative levels of expression of mRNAs were normalized to histone3 mRNA (HHT1). Western Blot Analysis—Exponentially growing cells (50 ml) were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics). Next, 300 mg of glass beads were added, and cells were disrupted three times for 30 s. in a Bead-Beater. The broken cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was added to an equal volume of gel loading buffer containing 4% (w/v) SDS, 125 mm Tris pH 6.8, b mercaptoethanol 10% (v/v), 20% (v/v) glycerol and blue bromophenol. Samples were heat-treated (100 °C, 10 min). After electrophoresis on NuPAGE 6% Trisglycine/acetate gels, followed by transfer to Hybond-ECL membrane, the Gln3-Myc13 proteins were visualized using mouse monoclonal antibodies (working dilution, 1:5000) raised against the Myc epitope (Invitrogen). Western blots were performed according to a standard chemiluminescent protocol provided with the WesternBreeze Chemiluminescent kit-anti-mouse from Invitrogen. The Hybond-ECL membrane was analyzed using a chemiluminescence camera (Chemi-Smart from Vilbert-Lourmat). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Gln3-Myc13 was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence on whole fixed cells. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed according to standard procedures (35Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 30 min in formaldehyde (3.7%). They were washed and resuspended in sorbitol buffer (1.2 m sorbitol and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5). Cell walls were digested for 50 min at 30 °C in sorbitol buffer supplemented with β-mercaptoethanol (40 mm final) and lyticase (80 units/ml) (92807 Fluka). Gln3-Myc13 was detected with monoclonal antibody c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a working dilution of 1:30. The secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (heavy plus light chains) (A-11029; Molecular Probes) (working dilution, 1:200). DNA was stained with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop2 Plus microscope equipped with a Plan Neofluar ×100/1.3 objective. Images were acquired with an AxiocamHRm camera and the native Axiovision4 software from Zeiss (release 4.4). Images were formatted in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Derepression of NCR Genes in npr1 Cells Results from Ammonium Uptake Limitation—A direct negative role of the Npr1 kinase on the Gln3 transcription factor has been recently proposed because derepression of NCR genes was observed in npr1 cells grown on ammonium (3Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the npr1 mutation impaired ammonium uptake (8Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), indicating that the derepression of Gln3-dependent genes in npr1 cells could be a consequence of the reduced uptake rate of the repressing nitrogen compound (9Grenson M. Dubois E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 121: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To evaluate both hypotheses, we analyzed the expression of NCR genes in conditions where, upon increasing ammonium uptake, wild-type and npr1 cells grew at similar rates. Growth tests were performed in minimal medium (10Jacobs P. Jauniaux J.C. Grenson M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 691-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) buffered at pH 6.1 and containing varying concentrations of ammonium as sole nitrogen source (hereafter cited as medium M.am). The growth defect of npr1 cells was similar to that of a mep1Δmep2Δmep3Δ strain (triple mepΔ strain) defective in the three endogenous Mep ammonium transport systems (11Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Namely, it was severe in medium containing 1 mm ammonium, still detectable at 20 mm ammonium, whereas wild-type growth rate was recovered at 80 mm ammonium (Fig. 1 and Table 2). The growth defect was also suppressed in npr1 cells further harboring an amu1 mutation previously shown to restore ammonium uptake in the kinase mutant (8Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Northern blot experiments were performed using DAL5, DAL7 and MEP2 as control genes for the NCR response. The three genes were derepressed in npr1 cells growing with 20 mm ammonium, while repression was largely or completely restored by increasing the external concentration of ammonium 4-fold or by adding the amu1 mutation (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the derepression of NCR genes was comparable in npr1 cells and cells lacking the three ammonium transport proteins Mep1, Mep2, and Mep3 (Fig. 2). In both strains, the repression of NCR genes was restored in the presence of 80 mm ammonium suggesting that the derepression results from a limitation of ammonium uptake.TABLE 2Generation doubling time of wild-type and mutated strains growing on buffered or unbuffered media containing different ammonium concentrationsMediaAmmoniumWild type (23344c)npr1(21994b)npr1 amu1(31034c)mmM.am202h052h192h07M.am802h082h112h06YNB202h044h452h00YNB802h072h321h57 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Relation between derepression of NCR genes and ammonium uptake limitation in npr1 cells.

Relative levels of expression of mRNAs (Rel. mRNA level) were normalized to histone H3 mRNA (HHT1). These experiments were repeated three times with RNA extracted from independent cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further sustain this hypothesis, we tested the consequence of expressing a heterologous ammonium transport system in the npr1 strain. The ectomycorrhizal HcAmt1 protein from the fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum has previously been shown to rescue the growth ability of the yeast triple mepΔ strain even at 1 mm ammonium as the sole nitrogen source (12Javelle A. Andre B. Marini A.M. Chalot M. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 53-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1. HcAmt1 was not sensitive to the npr1 mutation as the heterologous transporter restored growth on 1 mm ammonium upon expression in the yeast kinase mutant (Fig. 1). The latter transformed cells grew as the wild-type strain on 20 mm ammonium and displayed a very low level of DAL5, DAL7, and MEP2 RNA on Northern blot (Fig. 2) confirming that derepression of NCR genes in npr1 cells results from reduced ammonium uptake. To extend these observations, we assessed Gln3 localization in wild-type, npr1 and npr1 amu1 cells growing on 20 or 80 mm ammonium. Strains bearing a chromosomal-tagged version of Gln3 (Gln3-Myc13) were constructed allowing visualization of Gln3-Myc13 by indirect immunofluorescence. The functionality of Gln3-Myc13 has been confirmed by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). In wild-type cells grown at 20 or 80 mm ammonium, i.e. NCR conditions, Gln3-Myc13 was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm but not uniformly (Fig. 3). This localization in foci has been previously described in glutamine-grown cells and has been proposed to reflect Gln3 association with intracellular membrane structures (13Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gln3-Myc13 was mainly nuclear in npr1 cells grown on 20 mm ammonium, in agreement with the induced expression of NCR genes (Fig. 3). In npr1 cells at 80 mm ammonium as well as in npr1 amu1 cells at 20 mm ammonium, Gln3-Myc13 was localized into the cytoplasm in keeping with the low expression of NCR genes (Fig. 3). Our data clearly demonstrate that in npr1 cells the transduction of the nitrogen signal is restored as soon as ammonium uptake is no longer limiting, leading to cytosolic localization of Gln3 and to the repression of NCR genes. Restoration of Nitrogen Repression in npr1 Cells by Increasing the External Ammonium Concentration is pH- and Zinc-dependent—Hall and co-workers (3Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have proposed the Npr1 kinase to act downstream of the Sit4 phosphatase to repress Gln3 activity by preventing its entry into the nucleus. In strong contrast to our observations (Fig. 2), they found MEP2 to be highly expressed in npr1 cells on YNB (Yeast Nitrogen Base) medium containing 76 mm ammonium (3Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because for at least part of the experiments the genetic background of strains is identical, the source of discrepancies could be linked to the composition of the growth medium. Growth tests simultaneously performed in our M.am laboratory buffered medium and in YNB medium containing 1, 20, or 80 mm ammonium were compared (Fig. 1 and Table 2). It is worth noting that npr1 as well as triple mepΔ mutant cells presented a slow growth on YNB 20 mm ammonium compared with the growth on the buffered medium containing 20 mm ammonium (Fig. 1). In contrast, the amu1 mutation or the expression of a heterologous ammonium transport system (HcAmt1) restored normal growth to the npr1 strain on YNB 20 mm ammonium (Fig. 1). Northern blot analysis was then performed using RNA extracted from cells growing on YNB medium. On this medium, raising the ammonium concentration from 20 to 80 mm did not restore the repression of NCR genes in the npr1 strain whereas the amu1 mutation or the HcAmt1 expression were sufficient to recover repression on YNB 20 mm (Fig. 4). A major difference between both media is the presence of a buffer. For instance, when cells growing exponentially are harvested, the pH of the YNB medium was at a value of 3.6 whereas it was at 5.9 in the buffered M.am medium. The pH could have potential major effects on ammonium uptake and NH3 diffusion rate (see “Discussion”). Accordingly, upon buffering YNB medium (pH 6.1), npr1 cells displayed a significant increase of their growth rate at 20 mm ammonium (data not shown). However, Northern blot analysis showed that buffering the YNB medium was not sufficient to repress NCR genes in the npr1 mutant growing at 80 mm ammonium (Fig. 5). Besides the buffer, the two media present other differences especially in the metal concentrations. For instance, YNB contains 20–50-fold more metals except for iron whose concentration is 25-fold lower. We analyzed the effect of each independent metal on NCR gene expression in wild-type and npr1 strains (data not shown). According to our overall Northern blot experiments, it can be concluded that two factors are responsible for the discrepancies between the data from both media. The presence of a buffer and a low zinc concentration (0.05 μm in M.am compared with 1.4 μm in YNB) were the two conditions necessary to restore NCR gene repression in npr1 cells at 80 mm ammonium (Fig. 5). Progressively decreasing zinc concentration in the YNB buffered medium led to gradual restoration of NCR. Expression of the ZRT1 gene encoding a zinc transporter induced upon zinc limitation (14Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) was monitored as a control. Levels of ZRT1 mRNA illustrated that our M.am medium led to a zinc limitation whereas YNB medium did not (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Restoration of nitrogen repression in npr1 cells by increasing the ammonium concentration in the medium is pH and zinc-dependent. Total RNA was isolated from wild-type (23344c) and npr1 (21994b) cells grown on minimal medium containing concentrations of ammonium and ZnSO4 as indicated. M.am is a buffered medium (pH 6.1), YNB is not buffered. M.am- buf stands for M.am medium without buffer, YNB+ buf stands for YNB medium with a buffer (pH 6.1). These experiments were repeated twice with RNA extracted from independent cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Buffer and low zinc concentration were also necessary to lead to the cytosolic localization of Gln3 in the kinase mutant strain at high ammonium concentration (80 mm) whereas Gln3 is clearly nuclear on nonbuffered YNB and on buffered YNB at high zinc concentration (Fig. 6). Interestingly, Gln3 is cytosolic in npr1 amu1 cells independently of the pH and of the zinc concentration in the growth medium. The Npr1 Kinase Has No Major Influence on Gln3-Myc13 Phosphorylation—Differences in the phosphorylation state of Gln3 have been reported but a clear correlation with the subcellular localization of the transcriptional activator could not be demonstrated. Indeed methionine sulfoximine, the glutamine synthetase inhibitor and rapamycin, the Tor1, 2 kinase inhibitor, although leading both to the nuclear localization of Gln3-Myc13 and to NCR-sensitive transcription, generate opposite effects on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation (2Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 15Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We checked whether the Npr1 kinase and Amu1 might influence Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation by comparing the electrophoretic mobility of Gln3-Myc13 in Western blot. Although Gln3-Myc13 is cytoplasmic in both conditions, we observed a significant decrease in the mobility of Gln3-Myc13 in wild-type cells upon raising the ammonium concentration from 20 to 80 mm (Fig. 7), in agreement with a previous report (15Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The npr1 mutation had no major effect on this migration profile. However, it is worth noting that the Gln3-Myc13 signal detected in wild-type and npr1 cells grown on 80 mm ammonium was similar to that in nrp1 amu1 cells on 20 mm ammonium (Fig. 7), indicating that the amu1 mutation, which restores Mep activity, mimics the effect of a high ammonium concentration on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation. Our data are consistent with the lack of correlation between Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and intracellular localization in cells provided with various nitrogen sources (15Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is likely controlling other aspects than determining Gln3-Myc13 intracellular localization. However, simple analysis of electrophoretic mobility to study the phosphorylation status of a protein remains an approximate approach as a similar migration profile might correspond to the phosphorylation of different sites and the phosphorylation of some sites might have an inhibitory or activating action. Npr1 and Amu1 Are Not Required for NCR Genes Activation in Response to Rapamycin Treatment and to Nitrogen Limitation or Starvation— Because we found that the transduction of the repressive nitrogen signal can be restored in npr1 cells, we next searched to determine whether Npr1 might influence the response to the activation signal induced by rapamycin treatment and by nitrogen limitation or starvation. The amounts of DAL5 mRNA were compared after rapamycin treatment, after a 1-h shift to proline medium and after a 1-h nitrogen starvation in wild-type and npr1 cells grown on 80 mm ammonium as well as in npr1 amu1 cells grown on 20 mm ammonium (Fig. 8). The induction of DAL5 expression was similar in the 3 strains indicating that the activation of NCR genes such as DAL5 does not require the integrity of Npr1, nor Amu1 (Fig. 8). The Npi1/Rsp5 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Is Not Required to Activate NCR Genes under Poor Nitrogen Supply—It has been reported that the kinase Npr1 and the ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Npi1/Rsp5 and Bul1/2 have antagonistic roles in the nuclear import and activation of NCR genes by Gln3 (3Crespo J.L. Helliwell S"
https://openalex.org/W2005319940,"Events directly regulating Gln3 intracellular localization and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are interconnected with many cellular processes that influence the utilization of environmental metabolites. Among them are intracellular trafficking of the permeases that transport nitrogenous compounds and their control by the Tor1,2 signal transduction pathway. Npr1 is a kinase that phosphorylates and thereby stabilizes NCR-sensitive permeases, e.g. Gap1 and Mep2. It is also a phosphoprotein for which phosphorylation and kinase activity are regulated by Tor1,2 via Tap42 and Sit4. Npr1 has been reported to negatively regulate nuclear localization of Gln3 in SD (ammonia)-grown cells. Thus we sought to distinguish whether Npr1: (i) functions directly as a component of NCR control; or (ii) influences Gln3 localization indirectly, possibly as a consequence of participating in protein trafficking. If Npr1 functions directly, then the ability of all good nitrogen sources to restrict Gln3 to the cytoplasm should be lost in an npr1Δ just as occurs when URE2 (encoding this well studied negative Gln3 regulator) is deleted. We show that nuclear localization of Gln3-Myc13 in an npr1Δ occurred only with ammonia as the nitrogen source. Other good nitrogen sources, e.g. glutamine, serine, or asparagine, restricted Gln3-Myc13 to the cytoplasm of both wild type and npr1Δ cells. In other words, the npr1Δ did not possess the uniform phenotype for all repressive nitrogen sources characteristic of ure2Δ. This suggests that the connection between Gln3 localization and Npr1 is indirect, arising from the influence of Npr1 on the ability of cells to utilize ammonia as a repressive nitrogen source. Events directly regulating Gln3 intracellular localization and nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR)-sensitive transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are interconnected with many cellular processes that influence the utilization of environmental metabolites. Among them are intracellular trafficking of the permeases that transport nitrogenous compounds and their control by the Tor1,2 signal transduction pathway. Npr1 is a kinase that phosphorylates and thereby stabilizes NCR-sensitive permeases, e.g. Gap1 and Mep2. It is also a phosphoprotein for which phosphorylation and kinase activity are regulated by Tor1,2 via Tap42 and Sit4. Npr1 has been reported to negatively regulate nuclear localization of Gln3 in SD (ammonia)-grown cells. Thus we sought to distinguish whether Npr1: (i) functions directly as a component of NCR control; or (ii) influences Gln3 localization indirectly, possibly as a consequence of participating in protein trafficking. If Npr1 functions directly, then the ability of all good nitrogen sources to restrict Gln3 to the cytoplasm should be lost in an npr1Δ just as occurs when URE2 (encoding this well studied negative Gln3 regulator) is deleted.

This suggests that the connection between Gln3 localization and Npr1 is indirect, arising from the influence of Npr1 on the ability of cells to utilize ammonia as a repressive nitrogen source. The increasing use of rapamycin derivatives in the clinical treatment of tissue rejection and neoplastic disease has motivated intense research into the mechanisms through which their target, mTor (mammalian target of rapamycin), regulates the many processes it directly and indirectly influences (1Schluter M.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a highly informative model organism in this research, proving especially useful for identifying proteins that interact with Tor and elucidating their functions (5Thomas G. Sabatini D. Hall M.N. Current Topics in Microbiology & Immunology. 279. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004Google Scholar, 6Inoki K. Ouyang H. Li Y. Guan K.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this yeast, there are two Tor proteins, Tor1 and Tor2, that possess serine/threonine kinase activity and are specifically inhibited by a complex composed of rapamycin and prolyl isomerase (7Michnick S.W. Rosen M.K. Wandless T.J. Karplus M. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 252: 836-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These kinases possess partially redundant functions, with only Tor2 being essential for viability (8Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). A major cellular response to rapamycin treatment is global changes in gene expression (9Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G.

Tor1 and Tor2 are thought to affect these changes by controlling the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors, which in turn regulates their intracellular localization and thus their ability to mediate transcription. Studies of the GATA family transcription activator Gln3, and the response of its intracellular localization to rapamycin, were instrumental in developing our current view of transcription factor regulation by Tor1,2 (9Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 10Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C.

Those studies demonstrated that treating cells with rapamycin induced three important effects: (i) dephosphorylation of Gln3, (ii) nuclear localization of Gln3, and (iii) increased transcription of genes whose expression depended on Gln3 (9Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 10Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C.

All of these effects occurred under growth conditions in which the GATA transcription factors would normally have been localized to the cytoplasm of untreated cells and hence unable to function. Gln3 and Gat1/Nil1 are GATA family proteins that activate nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) 2The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; YNB, yeast nitrogen base.-sensitive transcription, which allows S. cerevisiae to selectively utilize good nitrogen sources in preference to poor ones. Physiological control by NCR occurs in the following manner. Gln3 and Gat1 mediate high level expression of genes encoding the permeases and enzymes needed to transport and degrade poor nitrogen sources (e.g. proline) when good nitrogen sources (e.g. glutamine and in some strains ammonia) are not available or are present in limited amounts. On the other hand, when good nitrogen sources are present in sufficient quantities, Gln3 and Gat1 do not bind to their target GATA sequences upstream of NCR-sensitive genes, are localized to the cytoplasm, and the expression of these genes is repressed (13Hofman-Bang J. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 35-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ure2, the first negative regulator of NCR-sensitive gene expression to be identified (16Drillien R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Drillien R. Aigle M. Lacroute F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is thought to be responsible for cytoplasmic sequestration of Gln3, because a Gln3-Ure2 complex can be isolated from cells in which NCR-sensitive transcription is repressed (11Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Beck T. Hall M.N.

A similar Gat1-Ure2 complex has not yet been reported. Reported connections between NCR-sensitive gene expression and rapamycin inhibition of Tor1,2 are shown in abbreviated form in Fig. 1. According to this model, a rich nitrogen supply generates high intracellular levels of glutamine (or a metabolite of it), which is sensed by and activates the Tor1,2 protein kinases (19Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Activated Tor1,2 phosphorylate Tap42 (20Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and/or Tip41 (21Jacinto E. Guo B. Arndt K.T. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar); there is not yet a uniform view of this step. However, the outcome of these phosphorylation events is postulated to be the formation of a complex between Tap42 and the type 2A-related phosphatase, Sit4 (12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Sit4 is posited to be inactive in the complex, thereby preventing it from dephosphorylating Gln3 (11Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Therefore, in excess nitrogen, Gln3 is highly phosphorylated and restricted to the cytoplasm (11Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Whether Gln3 phosphorylation causes it to associate with Ure2, thereby preventing nuclear entry, or alternatively Ure2 stabilizes the phosphorylated form of Gln3, achieving the same outcome, remains unclear (11Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In Msx- or rapamycin-treated cells, Tor1 and Tor2 are inactivated, in the first instance because glutamine production, and hence the posited signal of nitrogen excess, is inhibited and does not reach Tor1,2 (19Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and in the second because of direct inhibition of the kinases (12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As a result, Tap42 and/or Tip41 are not phosphorylated, Sit4 is freed from its association with Tap42 and is then able to dephosphorylate Gln3 (11Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of Gln3 correlates with its nuclear localization and increased NCR-sensitive transcription. A search for additional factors controlling Gln3 identified Npr1 as a negative regulator of Gln3 nuclear localization. Gln3 was nuclear in an npr1Δ growing under conditions (in SD medium, which contains ammonia as the nitrogen source) that restrict it to the cytoplasm of wild type cells (22Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nuclear Gln3 localization in SD-grown npr1Δ cells additionally requires Rsp5 and Bul1/2, leading to their being designated as positive regulators of Gln3 nuclear localization (22Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The finding that rsp5 and bul1/2 mutations were epistatic to npr1 suggested that these proteins functioned downstream of Npr1 in the regulation of Gln3 (Fig. 1) (22Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Npr1-mediated negative regulation of Gln3 was concluded to be independent of Sit4, because the NCR-sensitive reporter gene, MEP2-lacZ, was expressed at the same levels in npr1 single and npr1sit4 double mutants (22Crespo J.L. Helliwell S.B. Wiederkehr C. Demougin P. Fowler B. Primig M. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37512-37517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Npr1 was first discovered as a mutant whose phenotype was a pleiotropic loss of general amino acid, ammonia, proline, and ureidosuccinate permease activities (23Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Vissers S. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Npr1 was shown to be required for the stability of the NCR-sensitive general amino acid permease (Gap1) protein itself (Fig. 1) (23Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Npr1 mediates NCR-sensitive permease stabilization has since been studied in significant detail (23Grenson M. Eur. J.

In the absence of Npr1-mediated phosphorylation, Gap1 is ubiquitinated, which targets it for endocytosis and degradation in a process that requires Ubi1 (23Grenson M. Eur. J.

Although not as thoroughly studied as Gap1, ammonia permeases encoded by the MEP genes are reported to be regulated similarly (23Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Vandenbol M. Jauniaux J.C. Vissers S. Grenson M. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Insights into the mechanism through which Npr1 itself is regulated were achieved with the following findings. (i) Npr1 is phosphorylated in ammonia-grown cells and dephosphorylated following rapamycin treatment or transfer to nitrogen-free or proline-containing medium (26Schmidt A. Beckm T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). (ii) Rapamycin-induced Npr1 dephosphorylation does not occur in sit4 mutants (Fig. 1) (21Jacinto E. Guo B. Arndt K.T. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). (iii) Active Npr1 positively correlates with its dephosphorylated form (Fig. 1) (26Schmidt A. Beckm T. Koller A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6924-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although many of the regulatory steps depicted in Fig. 1 are soundly supported by experimental data, an increasing number of observations have led to the suggestion that Tor1,2 regulation of Gln3 phosphorylation and intracellular localization may be more complicated than or somewhat different from the model described above (40Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16537-16538Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Cooper T.G. Winderickx J. Taylor P.M. Topics in Current Genetics. 7. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2004: 225-257Google Scholar). Among these observations are the following. (i) Association with Tap42 is required for Sit4 phosphatase activity, making Tap42 a positive rather than a negative regulator of Sit4 (43Duvel K. Santhanam A. Garrett S. Schneper L. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1467-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 44Wang H. Wang X. Jiang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 45Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). (ii) Cells provided with glutamine, ammonia (good nitrogen sources), or proline (a poor nitrogen source) exhibit nearly indistinguishable levels of detectable Gln3 phosphorylation; in fact, Gln3 is sometimes slightly more phosphorylated in proline-grown cells than in those provided with glutamine (46Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (iii) Detectable Gln3 phosphorylation correlates with its nuclear localization at short, but not long, times after rapamycin treatment (46Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (iv) Detectable dephosphorylation of Gln3 does not correlate with nitrogen-starvation (46Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). (v) Msx and rapamycin treatment both induce nuclear localization of Gln3 but have opposite effects on Gln3 phosphorylation (47Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). (vi) Rapamycin-induced Gat1 dephosphorylation could not be demonstrated in cells where it clearly occurred with Gln3, even though both Gln3 and Gat1 phosphorylation levels were demonstrated to increase in parallel following carbon starvation (48Kulkarni A. Buford T.D. Rai R. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The paradoxical observations cited above, and the regulatory function of Npr1 in the turnover of NCR-sensitive permeases, prompted us to query whether or not the apparent negative regulation of Gln3 nuclear localization by Npr1 occurred indirectly, deriving from the fact that Npr1 is required for ammonia to serve as an effective repressive nitrogen source. The experiments described below show that loss of Gln3 restriction to the cytoplasm in npr1 mutants is specific to the use of ammonia as nitrogen source. Gln3 nuclear localization and NCR-sensitive gene expression in wild type and npr1Δ mutants are similarly repressed when glutamine instead of ammonia is provided as sole nitrogen source. Cytoplasmic restriction of Gln3 in npr1Δ cells also occurs with serine, asparagine, or YPD as the nitrogen source. These observations indicate that apparent Npr1-mediated negative regulation of Gln3 derives indirectly from defects in the ability of ammonia to serve as a repressive nitrogen source in npr1Δ mutants rather than from direct control of Gln3 localization itself. Strains and Culture Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains used in this work were TCY36 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG leu2::hisG), RR140 (Matα lys2 ura3 trp1::hisG leu2::hisG npr1Δ::TRP1), TB123 (MATa leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX]), TB138-1a (MATa leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX], ure2::URA3), and RR143 (MATa leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX], npr1Δ::TRP1). TCY36 and RR140 are derivatives of ∑1278b, and TB123, TB138-1a, and RR143 are derivatives of JK9-3da. Strains were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5) in YPD (yeast extract, 10 g; peptone, 20 g; dextrose, 20 g/liter or in Difco yeast nitrogen base (YNB; without amino acids and ammonium sulfate) medium containing 2% glucose, the required auxotrophic supplements (120 μg/ml leucine, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine, 40 μg/ml lysine, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, 20 μg/ml arginine), and the nitrogen source indicated (0.1% final concentration unless otherwise indicated). Note that this is a different medium than the one used in early studies of NPR1. Rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (dissolved in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol) was added to the cultures, where indicated, to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml for 30 min prior to cell harvest for either RNA isolation or indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Experiments in which yeast were transferred from one medium to another were performed as follows. A sample of the exponentially growing cells (A600 nm = 0.4-05) was harvested from the initial medium for indirect immunofluorescence imaging. The remaining volume of the culture (or half of it in the case of a split culture) was quickly collected by filtration and resuspended in an equal volume of the new medium; this process required 35-45 s. Additional samples were then collected and processed at the indicated times. Strain Construction—A DNA fragment containing wild type NPR1 from TCY36 was generated using PCR and primers (positions -368 to -338 and +2532 to +2499) to which had been added recognition sites for XhoI and EagI. The PCR product was cloned into pBS (KS+) and digested with XhoI and EagI to yield pRR490. This plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and a 2.1-kb fragment from the interior of NPR1 was deleted and replaced with a 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing TRP1 (-94 to +726 in which the native StuI site was replaced with EcoRI by PCR methods) to yield pRR494. The 1.6-kb XhoI-EagI fragment containing the npr1Δ and TRP1 marker was isolated from pRR494, and the linear DNA was used to transform TCY36 and TB123. Transformants containing the deletion RR140 and RR143, respectively, were selected on solid YNB medium. Southern blot analyses were used to confirm the structure of the deletions in RR140 and RR143. Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was isolated and Northern blots performed as described previously (47Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hybridization probes other than that for NPR1 were described previously (50Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NPR1 probe was prepared by PCR using primers 5′-CTTCGAACTCATCACCGAGAA-3′ and 5′-AAGACAAAGAGGAGCTGTTGC-3′. Radiolabeled hybridization probes were prepared using the Invitrogen RadPrime™ labeling system. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell preparation and assay of Gln3-Myc13 by indirect immunofluorescence was performed using a modified form of a method described earlier (47Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the earlier method performed well for wild type strains, it was found to be inadequate for analysis of Gln3-Myc13 intracellular distribution in some mutants. The modifications were: (i) fixation in the growth medium for 60 min, (ii) the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (10 mm final concentration) to the zymolyase digestion mixture, and (iii) adjustment of the digestion times depending on the strain and growth conditions used. The optimum digestion time was determined for each strain and condition. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described by Cox et al. (46Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gln3-Myc13 was visualized using 9E10(c-myc) monoclonal antibody (Covance MMS-150P, at a dilution of 1:1000) as the primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, at a dilution of 1"

In a previous work we showed that expression of TASK-3 increases in cerebellar granule neurons as they mature in culture. Here we show that within the cerebellum, levels of TASK-3 mRNA increase as granule neurons migrate to their adult positions and receive excitatory mossy fiber input. To understand the mechanism of this increase in TASK-3 expression we used an in vitro model culturing the neurons in either depolarizing conditions mimicking neuronal activity (25K, 25 mm KCl) or in conditions which approach deafferentation (5K, 5 mm KCl). An important increase in TASK-3 mRNA is uniquely observed in 25K and is specific since other background K+ channel levels remain unchanged or decrease. The rise in TASK-3 mRNA leads to an increase in TASK-3 protein and the IKso conductance resulting in hyperpolarization. Blocking L-type calcium channels or their downstream effector calcineurin, abrogates TASK-3 expression and IKso, leading to hyperexcitability. This is the first study demonstrating that depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry can directly regulate cellular excitability by dynamically regulating the transcription of a resting K+ conductance. The appearance of this conductance may play an important role in the transition of depolarized immature neurons to their mature hyperpolarized state during neuronal development.

Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) 3The abbreviations used are: CGN, cerebellar granule neurons; EGL, external granule layer; IGL, internal granule layer; EPSC, excitatory post-synaptic current; RR, ruthenium red; MEF-2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CNQX, cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. are the excitatory glutamatergic interneurons which transmit mossy fiber input to the Purkinje cells (1Ross C.A.

Neurosci. 1997; 20: 61-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The standing outward K+ current, IKso, plays an important role in controlling CGN excitability since it behaves as a leak conductance and is inhibited by the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (4Watkins C.S. Mathie A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 401-412Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Mathie A. Clarke C.E. Ranatunga K.M. Veale E.L. Cerebellum. 2003; 2: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For example, in cultured rat CGNs the application of muscarine increases the input resistance and enhances cell excitability by reducing IKso (4Watkins C.S. Mathie A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 401-412Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This mechanism has also been shown to have a clear physiological role in vivo. In the vestibule cerebellum, inhibition of IKso by acetylcholine released from cholinergic mossy fibers increases the firing frequency of CGNs, which in turn enhances the spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) in Purkinje neurons (6Takayasu Y. Iino M. Furuya N. Ozawa S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular components of IKso have been identified as TASK-1 and TASK-3, members of the tandem pore family of K+ channels (7Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

They are highly sensitive to external pH, such that acidic conditions reduce while alkaline conditions enhance their activity (7Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

(Lond.). 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is well documented that elevated concentrations of external potassium, or other depolarizing conditions increase intracellular calcium levels and promote long term survival of CGNs in culture (22Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bessho Y. Nawa H. Nakanishi S.

It is believed that it mimics the glutamatergic innervation that CGNs receive in vivo from mossy fibers by post-natal day 12 (25Balazs R. Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Brain Res. 1988; 468: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that neurotransmitter or ion channel subunit expression depends on the culture conditions (26Resink A. Villa M. Benke D. Mohler H. Balazs R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Resink A. Villa M. Boer G.J. Mohler H. Balazs R. Eur. J.

Kristiansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16543-16550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For instance, levels of the GABAA receptor α6 subunit, the principle subunit of the cerebellum, are lower in CGNs when they are cultured in high K+ versus physiological concentrations of K+ in the presence of growth factors that inhibit apoptosis (28Gault L.M. Siegel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2391-2399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Engblom A.C. Johansen F.F. Kristiansen U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16543-16550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GABAA δ subunit mRNA increases in high K+ cultures and its in vivo expression coincides with the formation of synaptic contacts of GNs with afferent excitatory mossy fibers within the internal granule layer (IGL). These findings strongly suggest that synaptic depolarization plays a role in the expression of this subunit (28Gault L.M. Siegel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2391-2399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Engblom A.C. Johansen F.F. Kristiansen U. J. Biol.

Mature neonatal cultures of CGNs express particularly high levels of TASK-3, and most of the currents in 1-week-old cultures correspond to TASK-3 homomeric channels (17Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M.

Indeed, this increased expression of TASK-3 is largely responsible for K+-dependent apoptosis observed in CGNs (11Patel A.J. Lazdunski M. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 448: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M. Honore E. Duprat F. Ehrengruber M.U. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. J. Biol.

In the present work, we took advantage of the CGN cell culture model to understand the mechanism of TASK-3 up-regulation and determine that depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx is involved in the regulation of TASK-3 expression. Cell Cultures and Treatments—Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 7-8-day-old Wistar rats (Charles River France) decapitated under anesthesia with isoflurane. Cultures were prepared as described previously (17Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M. Honore E. Duprat F. Ehrengruber M.U. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32068-32076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 neurons were seeded on poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated or Biocoat® 35-mm dishes (Falcon) and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, BDNF (50 ng/ml), and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To prevent growth of glial cells, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (10 μm) was added to the cultures 1 day following plating. Where indicated 20 mm KCl (25K medium) or the same volume of 20 mm NaCl as control (5K medium) were added 3 h following plating. Nifedipine (10 μm), FK506 (2.5 μg/ml), cyclosporin A (1 μm), or KN93 (5 μm), all purchased from Sigma, were added 3 h after plating. Actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) were added 1-2 days after plating. Corresponding solvents were added in the control conditions. Hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared from 18-19-day-old fetal Wistar rats (Charles River France). 2 × 106 neurons were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated plates and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (Sigma), 2 mm glutamine, and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. To prevent growth of glial cells, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (10 μm) was added to the cultures 1 day following plating. Where indicated 20 mm KCl (25K) or 20 mm NaCl (5K) were added 3 h following plating. As indicated, nifedipine (10 μm) was added 3 h following plating. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with rat TASK-3 or rat TASK-1 cDNAs using the DEAE-dextran method. These cells were used for either Western blot analysis or immunocytochemistry. Total RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative PCR—Total RNAs from hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar granule neurons cultured in 35-mm dishes were extracted with the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Reverse transcription was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Realtime PCR assays for each gene target were performed on cDNA samples using SYBR Green Mastermix Plus (Eurogentec) in 96-well optical plates on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Biosystems). PCR data were captured using Sequence Detector Software. The data were analyzed using the comparative CT method where the amount of target is normalized to an endogenous reference (cyclophylin D) (User Bulletin Number 2, Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Primer sequences, which were used for quantitative PCR, are provided in the supplemental information. Standard curves were generated for each set of primers using serial dilutions of rat brain cDNA to ensure a similar efficiency of amplification. In Situ Hybridization—For in situ hybridization, post-natal day 6, 12, and 30 (P6, P12, and P30) Wistar rats were anesthetized and decapitated. Brains were removed and frozen at -40 °C. Horizontal and coronal brain sections (12 μm) were cut in a cryostat (Leica), thaw-mounted onto charged slides (Superfrost Plus), and immediately fixed for 5 min in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as described previously (30Talley E.M. Solorzano G. Lei Q. Kim D. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7491-7505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Washburn C.P. Sirois J.E. Talley E.M. Guyenet P.G. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using identical α-33P-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes. After hybridization, slides were washed and exposed to film (BioMax, Eastman Kodak Co.) for about 6-7 days. The resulting autoradiograms were imaged using a film scanner at 3000 dpi resolution and processed in Adobe Photoshop. Selected slides were then covered with photographic emulsion (Hypercoat RPN40, Amersham Biosciences) and left to expose at 4 °C for 5 weeks. After development, slides were stained with cresyl violet. Preparation and Characterization of a Polyclonal Rabbit TASK-3 Antibody—Anti-TASK-3 antibodies were raised against a gluthatione S-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 55 amino acids of mouse TASK-3 (from Thr348 to Ile402, GenBank™ accession number NP001029048). The preparation of fusion proteins and rabbit immunization were performed as described previously (32Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cerebellar granule neurons or COS transfected cells were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min, treated with 50 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After blocking for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum and 0.1% Tween 20, cells were incubated with TASK-3 antibody (1:500 to 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. After washes, cells were incubated in goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488 (1/800) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells immunoreactive for TASK-3 were visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss) equipped with 25× and 63× oil immersion objectives. Images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera (Coolsnap HQ, Photometrics) driven by Metavue software. Electrophysiological Recordings—Currents were recorded in the perforated patch configuration or in the standard whole cell configuration. The external solution contained (in mm) 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH. In the depolarizing solution, 20 mm of NaCl was replaced with KCl. The perforated patch pipette solution contained 240 μg/ml amphotericin B, and (in mm) 125 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 0.1 EGTA, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH. The whole cell patch pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 K-ATP, 2.7 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with KOH. Cells were continuously superfused with a microperfusion system during the time course of the experiments (0.1 ml/min). Experiments were performed at room temperature. Acidic pH of the external solution was obtained with HCl. CNQX stock solution (20 mm, distilled water) were stored at -20 °C and used on the day of experiment. Zinc and ruthenium red (Sigma) were directly dissolved in the external medium. The synaptic activity was analyzed using Mini-analysis program (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ), the threshold for detection was 15 pA. During cerebellar development, CGNs initially localized in the external granule layer (EGL) migrate across the molecular layer to reach the IGL. Within the IGL, GNs synapse with afferent glutamatergic mossy fibers (1Ross C.A. Bredt D. Snyder S.H. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 216-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Voogd J. Glickstein M.

Neurosci. 1997; 20: 61-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the level of TASK-3 mRNA increases as a function of cerebellar development (17Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M. Honore E. Duprat F. Ehrengruber M.U. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32068-32076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the highest increase in TASK-3 mRNA occurs in the second week after birth. The temporal expression profile of TASK3 mRNA parallels that of the GABAA α6 receptor subunit mRNA, a well known marker of mature CGNs (33Laurie D.J. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4151-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In situ hybridization analysis of rat brain slices at different developmental stages using a TASK-3 specific antisense riboprobe was used to study TASK-3 expression in detail. Little or no labeling was observed with the corresponding sense probe (data not shown). At postnatal day 7 (P7), before the migration of CGNs, a weak expression of TASK-3 was observed in the EGL (Fig. 1B). At postnatal day 12 (P12), neurons that had reached the IGL were strongly labeled compared with granule neurons remaining in the EGL (Fig. 1, B-D). In adult (P30), the hybridization signal was slightly increased compared with the signal in the IGL at P12. As previously described, TASK-3 mRNA is strongly expressed in the adult cerebellum but is also abundant in many other brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and brain stem (30Talley E.M. Solorzano G. Lei Q. Kim D. Bayliss D.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7491-7505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings show that the increase of TASK-3 mRNA levels in granule neurons coincides with their arrival in the IGL and suggest that depolarization due to synaptic activity may contribute to the increase in TASK-3 mRNA expression. To test the hypothesis that neuronal depolarization plays a role in increasing TASK-3 expression, cultured CGNs were grown in a medium containing either a physiological (5 mm, 5K medium) or depolarizing (25 mm, 25K medium) concentrations of KCl. Granule neurons cultivated in 5K die by apoptosis during the first days in culture. To prevent apoptosis, BDNF was added to the culture medium. BDNF by itself did not modify TASK-3 mRNA expression in either 5K or 25K (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, TASK-3 mRNA expression increases significantly in depolarizing versus physiological conditions depending on the number of days in culture (Fig. 2A). The TASK-3 mRNA levels increase as a function of external potassium concentration with maximal levels at 20 mm KCl (Fig. 2B). Since K+-dependent depolarization. Among the two pore K+ channels tested, only the mRNA for TASK-3 is up-regulated, while the others are either down-regulated or remain unchanged (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, TASK-1, which can associate with TASK-3 to form heteromeric channels (17Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M. Honore E. Duprat F. Ehrengruber M.U. Lazdunski M. Patel A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32068-32076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,19Czirjak G. Enyedi P. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was found to be significantly down-regulated by KCl. To follow whether the rise in TASK-3 mRNA is reflected by an increase in TASK-3 protein, we generated an antibody against the carboxyl terminus of mTASK-3. Anti-TASK-3 specifically detects a duplex in lysates from COS cells transfected with rTASK-3, while no bands were detected in the control conditions (supplemental Fig. 1A). The antibody was also characterized using immunocytochemistry on COS cells transfected with the rTASK-3 subunit. Only cells expressing rTASK-3 were labeled, while cells transfected with the rTASK-1 subunit or the vector alone were not fluorescent (supplemental Fig. 1B). Immunocytochemistry was also performed on CGNs cultured in either 5K or 25K for 7 days. A specific membrane labeling was observed for TASK-3 only under depolarizing conditions (Fig. 3A) demonstrating that the increase in TASK-3 mRNA leads to a concomitant increase in protein. We and others (4Watkins C.S. Mathie A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 401-412Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Lauritzen I. Zanzouri M. Honore E. Duprat F. Ehrengruber M.U. Lazdunski M.

A detailed electrophysiological comparison between granule neurons cultured in 5K versus 25K was performed. Depolarizing medium significantly increases the amplitude of the pH-sensitive IKso component (29.3 ± 6.0 pA, n = 25, p = 0.0005) as compared with the current observed in neurons cultured in 5K (1.6 ± 0.3 pA, n = 17, p = 0.0005) for a period of 6-10 days (Fig. 3B/C). Conditions that increase IKso current lead to membrane hyperpolarization (Fig. 3C). The resting membrane potential measured in physiological K+ concentration was -40.9 ± 3.4 mV (n = 13) as compared with -68.4 ± 2.9 mV in depolarizing conditions (n = 28, p < 10-5). We used a pharmacological approach to distinguish the TASK-3 homomer from TASK-1 homomeric and TASK-1/-3 heteromeric channels. Zinc (100 μm) and ruthenium red (10 μm) are known to selectively inhibit TASK-3 homomers (19Czirjak G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5426-5432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Czirjak G. Enyedi P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Clarke C.E. Veale E.L. Green P.J. Meadows H.J. Mathie A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 560: 51-62Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Zn2+ (100 μm) and ruthenium red (10 μm) reduced the current to 25.7 ± 3.4% (n = 7, p = 0.001) and 23.1 ± 2.6% (n = 8, p = 0.0006), respectively, which is the same degree of inhibition observed with acidosis (pH 5.5), which was 16.7 ± 2.3% (n = 10, p < 10-4) (Fig. 3D). The application of Zn2+ and ruthenium red leads to membrane depolarization (25K: -73.6 ± 4.2 mV, n = 7; 25K, pH 5.5: -35.9 ± 2.5 mV, n = 7, p < 10-6; 25K + Zn2+: -51.9 ± 4.3 mV, n = 7, p = 0.0002; 25K + RR: -48.8 ± 6.2 mV, n = 5, p = 0.0005). These results confirm that the TASK-3 homomeric channel is the principle component of IKso recorded in 25K. The difference observed between current inhibition obtained with external acidosis and that with Zn2+/RR could be due to TASK-1 homomers and/or TASK-1/-3 heteromers, since both channels are resistant to inhibition by Zn2+ and RR. Indeed, PCR quantification experiments reveal that TASK-3 mRNA levels strongly increase in 25K, while levels of TASK-1 mRNAs decline, which might explain the low levels of TASK-1/-3 heteromeric channels and/or TASK-1 homomeric channels under such culture conditions. Potassium depolarization of granule neurons leads to the activation of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (24Nakanishi S. Okazawa M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; (in press)Google Scholar, 35Carafoli E. Genazzani A. Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 624-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To establish whether calcium entry via voltage-dependent calcium channels is responsible for the increase in TASK-3 expression, we used the L-type inhibitor nifedipine. Nifedipine totally blocks the depolarization-induced increase in TASK-3 mRNA (Fig. 4A), suggesting a correlation between an increase in intracellular calcium and TASK-3 mRNA levels. Increases in intracellular Ca2+ lead to the activation of calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, which is crucial for the regulation of the expression of numerous genes in CGNs (36Kramer D. Fresu L. Ashby D.S. Freeman T.C. Genazzani A.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Sato M. Suzuki K. Yamazaki H. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5874-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test whether this phosphatase plays a role in the expression of TASK-3, granule cells were cultured under depolarizing conditions in the presence or absence of FK506 (2.5 μg/ml) and cyclosporin A (1 μm), two inhibitors of calcineurin (38Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3620) Google Scholar). FK506 and cyclosporin A prevent the depolarization-induced increase in TASK-3 mRNA (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the TASK-3 protein and consequently IKso are also strongly reduced by these calcineurin inhibitors (Fig. 4, B and C). Acute application of FK506 on neurons cultured in 25K has no immediate effect on IKso (data not shown). KN93, an inhibitor of CaM kinases, which are also downstream effectors of Ca2+ signaling (39Marley P.D. Thomson K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was without effect on either TASK-3 mRNA or protein in 25K (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, cells grown in 25K with FK506 display depolarized resting membrane potentials with values close to those recorded in cells grown in 5K conditions (Fig. 4C, right panel) indicating that FK506 is acting at the level of TASK-3 expression to decrease IKso. Ca2+-dependent TASK-3 expression could occur at the transcriptional and/or the post-transcriptional level. To establish whether transcriptional activit"

Inhibition of caspases by addition of Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone, by stable transfection with the Baculovirus gene coding for p35, or by Bax knockout reduced all signs of apoptosis, yet failed to suppress radio-induced micro- and multinucleation. Moreover, pharmacological caspase inhibition, p35 expression or Bax knockout had no effect on the clonogenic survival that was reduced by gamma-irradiation and caspase inhibition failed to abolish the increased radiosensitivity of 14-3-3sigma-deficient cells. Micro- and multinucleation was detectable among non-apoptotic cells lacking PS exposure, as well as among cells undergoing apoptosis. Moreover, a fraction of micro- or multinucleated cells manifested caspase activation, and videomicroscopic analyses revealed that such cells could succumb to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Altogether, these results suggest that genomic instability induced by gamma-irradiation can trigger apoptosis, although apoptosis is dispensable for radio-induced clonogenic death."
https://openalex.org/W2069726454,"We recently showed that p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) plays an important role in maintaining cells in G0/G1 phase by keeping c-myc in a repressed state. Consistent with this, adenovirus E1A oncoprotein induces c-myc in a p300-dependent manner, and the c-myc induction is linked to S-phase induction. The induction of S phase by E1A is dependent on its binding to and inactivating several host proteins including p300/CBP. To determine whether there is a correlation between the host proteins binding to the N-terminal region of E1A, activation of c-myc and induction of S phase, we assayed the c-myc and S-phase induction in quiescent human cells by infecting them with Ad N-terminal E1A mutants with mutations that specifically affect binding to different chromatin-associated proteins including pRb, p300, p400 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). We show that the mutants that failed to bind to p300 or pRb were severely defective for c-myc and S-phase induction. The induction of c-myc and S phase was only moderately affected when E1A failed to bind to p400. Furthermore, analysis of the E1A mutants that fail to bind to p300, and both p300 and PCAF suggests that PCAF may also play a role in c-myc repression, and that the two chromatin-associated proteins may repress c-myc independently. In summary, these results suggest that c-myc deregulation by E1A through its interaction with these chromatin-associated proteins is an important step in the E1A-mediated cell cycle deregulation and possibly in cell transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2047457300,"Ovarian cancer is currently the second leading cause of gynecological malignancy and cisplatin or cisplatin-based regimens have been the standard of care for the treatment of advance epithelial ovarian cancers. However, the efficacy of cisplatin treatment is often limited by the development of drug resistance either through the inhibition of apoptotic genes or activation of antiapoptotic genes. We have previously reported the overexpression of human UO-44 (HuUO-44) in ovarian cancers and the HuUO-44 antisera markedly inhibited NIH-OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell attachment and proliferation (Oncogene 23: 5707–5718, 2004). In the present study, we observed through the cancer cell line profiling array that the expression of HuUO-44 was suppressed in the ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3) after treatment with several chemotherapeutic drugs. Similarly, this suppression in HuUO-44 expression was also correlated to the cisplatin sensitivity in two other ovarian cancer cell lines NIH-OVCAR3 and OV-90 in a dose-dependent manner. To elucidate the function of HuUO-44 in cisplatin chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cell, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were employed to mediate HuUO-44 silencing in ovarian cancer cell line, NIH-OVCAR3. HuUO-44 RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. Importantly, HuUO-44 RNAi significantly increased sensitivity of NIH-OVCAR3 to cytotoxic stress induced by cisplatin (P<0.01). Strikingly, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of HuUO-44 significantly conferred cisplatin resistance in NIH-OVCAR3 cells (P<0.05). Taken together, UO-44 is involved in conferring cisplatin resistance; the described HuUO-44-specific siRNA oligonucleotides that can potently silence HuUO-44 gene expression may prove to be valuable pretreatment targets for antitumor therapy or other pathological conditions that involves aberrant HuUO-44 expression."

Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Each connexon comprises six connexin subunits (2Cascio M. Kumar N.M. Safarik R. Gilula N.B. J. Biol.

Kumar N.M. Houghten R. Unwin N. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2967-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The channels are ∼15 Å in diameter at their narrowest point (5Unger V.M.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Connexins have been implicated in several diseases. For example, mutations in the gene encoding connexin 32 (Cx32; gene symbol GJB1) cause X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a common form of inherited motor and sensory neuropathy (7Bergoffen J. Scherer S.S. Wang S. Scott M.O. Bone L.J. Paul D.L. Chen K. Lensch M.W. Chance P.F. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 1993; 262: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), and mutations in the gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26; gene symbol GJB2) are responsible for a large proportion of cases of severe to profound non-syndromic hearing loss (8Kelsell D.P.

Nature. 1997; 387: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar).The structure of the gap junction has been solved only at intermediate resolution, revealing the approximate locations of each of the α-helices comprising the TM domain (5Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) but not the locations of its constituent amino acids. As with many other human membrane proteins that lack bacterial homologs, structural analyses of connexins have been impeded by the absence of an atomic resolution structure (9Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Ben-Tal N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 106-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In particular, the effects of disease-causing mutations on gap junction structural stability have not been probed experimentally, and it has been difficult to design and interpret biochemical experiments on the structural aspects of connexins relating to individual amino acid residues. Instead, studies have focused on connexin domains (10Kronengold J. Trexler E.B. Bukauskas F.F. Bargiello T.A. Verselis V.K. J. Gen.

Cymes G. Kasperek E. Cao F.L. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, based on the intermediate resolution structure (5Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and computational inference methods (15Fleishman S.J. Harrington S. Friesner R.A. Honig B.

Biol. 2004; 340: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), a model of canonical α-helices corresponding to the M1-M4 segments, which specifies the approximate positions of α-carbons in the TM domain, was recently proposed (see Fig. 1) (17Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the TM domain of connexins has been well conserved through evolution (17Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Yeager M. Gilula N.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 929-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), this model structure may serve as a template for all connexin isoforms, although the various isoforms are likely to exhibit slightly different helix-packing interactions. Hence, by specifying which residues are located in proximity to one another, the model can serve as a basis on which to formulate explicit hypotheses on interactions between amino acid positions.We have studied several hypotheses of interactions between residue pairs by probing the localization of mutated human Cx26 and Cx32 that were C-terminally fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed in HeLa cells that do not express endogenous connexins (19Aasen T. Hodgins M.B. Edward M. Graham S.V. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7969-7980Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Connexin trafficking to and insertion into the plasma membrane is dependent on several factors and processes, among them is the proper folding and oligomerization of the protein (20Evans W.H. Martin P.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar); substantial disruption of the protein stability could therefore result in mislocalized protein. We introduced single and double mutations into the connexin TM domain. A destabilizing mutation would show aberrant localization outside the plasma membrane. However, a carefully chosen second-site mutation could stabilize the mutated protein and retrieve the wild-type localization at the sites of cell-cell apposition. This procedure is similar in spirit to the double-mutant cycle (21Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and to second-site suppression assays (22Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In all of these analyses, if the phenotypic effects of one mutation are found to depend on whether or not the other is mutated as well, this will indicate that the two amino acid sites interact (23Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Yifrach O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It should be noted that these experimental assays cannot, on their own, distinguish between direct physical interactions of a pair of positions and indirect interactions mediated via other residues (24Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Kovalenko O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the model structure, although approximate, helped us to constrain the possible explanations. Based on the results of the mutation analyses, we identified the most likely justification for the observed phenotypes by computing approximate models of the side chains of interacting residues. We thus detected, for the first time, interactions that apparently stabilize contacts between TM helices in connexins; abrogation of these interactions leads to aberrant phenotype and disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn general, we followed the experimental procedures presented in Ref. 37Gottfried I.

A comparison of the phenotypes using either fixation agent revealed no observable differences (data not shown). The data presented in the paper are based on paraformaldehyde as the fixation agent, as was done, e.g. in Refs. 14Skerrett I.M. Aronowitz J. Shin J.H. Cymes G. Kasperek E. Cao F.L. Nicholson B.J. J.

For each of the fluorescence images shown here, we examined the phase-contrast image to identify the regions of apposition between cells. The phase-contrast and fluorescence images are available as supplemental data.Structural Modeling—The template structure of the TM domain of the gap junction, comprising Cx32 monomers (Protein Data Bank code 1txh) (17Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was used as a starting point. Backbone atoms were added to this model using the Biopolymer module of the InsightII program (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The sequences of Cx26 and Cx32 were aligned (17Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to generate a model of the gap junction formed by Cx26 monomers. Side chains were then added to both structures using default parameters. Steric clashes were ignored at this stage. The rotameric states of Lys-22 (Cx26), Arg-32, and Arg-142 (Cx32) were examined manually, and rotamers were selected that minimized distances from the putative salt bridge partners, while also minimizing steric clashes with other parts of the protein.RESULTSA Salt Bridge between the M1 and M3 Pore-lining Helices—A region of the model structure that showed particular promise for this approach was the interface between the M1 and M3 pore-lining helices, where a triad of charged positions (Arg-32, Arg-142, and Glu-146 of Cx32) is located (Fig. 1). These three positions (the first two occupied by basic residues and the last by an acidic residue) are highly conserved throughout all connexins. In theory, the Arg and Glu residues, which are reciprocally charged and are near the water-filled pore lumen, could be involved in stabilizing electrostatic interactions; it has been estimated that salt bridges embedded in water can add nearly 1 kcal/mol to protein stability (25Horovitz A. Serrano L. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Hendsch Z.S. Tidor B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar).We investigated the possible existence of an interaction between Arg-32 and Glu-146 by reversing the charges of these positions singly and doubly in Cx32 (Fig. 2A) (Table 1). Both single mutants, R32E and E146R, were localized outside the plasma membrane, which might be indicative of protein misfolding. Interestingly, a similar charge-reversing mutation, E146K in Cx32, was implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (27Numakura C. Lin C. Ikegami T. Guldberg P. Hayasaka K. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 20: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the double mutant R32E/E146R, which re-establishes charge complementarity between M1 and M3, restored membrane localization. The compensation suggests that the two residues interact. Given the model structure, it is likely that this interaction involves a salt bridge that stabilizes the interface between M1 and M3 (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2A, charged amino acids at the interface between the pore-lining helices M1 and M3 of Cx32 were mutated singly and doubly. Localization assays show that the two single charge reversals are mislocalized (top). The R32E/E146R double mutant restores membrane localization (yellow arrows), indicating that these positions interact. Pictures were taken by confocal microscopy. For each field, three images were taken: phase contrast, to show the boundaries of the cells, green fluorescence, to show the expression of the connexin-GFP chimera protein and a merge of the two, to verify the localization of gap junction plaques in the plasma membrane in points of cell-cell apposition. The phase-contrast and fluorescence images for all figures presented in the manuscript are available as supplemental data. B, the modeled side chains suggest that only the paired residues Arg-32/Glu-146 could form a salt bridge without invoking severe steric clashes, as shown by the localization assays. Because the localization assays (A) did not detect interactions between Arg-142 and other residues, this modeled side chain (shown on the right) should be considered as speculative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Frequency of coupled cells transfected with wild-type and mutated connexins Means and S.D. for each connexin were computed on the basis of three separate experiments and normalized to the levels in the wildtype.

Here too, both single mutants were mislocalized. Despite the proximity between positions 142 and 146, however, the R142E/E146R double mutant did not elicit wild-type localization.To explain this pattern of phenotypes, we examined the connexin model structure and explored the possible rotameric states (i.e. conformations) of the side chains of Arg-32, Arg-142, and Glu-146 (Fig. 2B). One of the rotamers of Arg-32 complied with the formation of an interhelical salt bridge with Glu-146. By contrast, none of the potential rotameric states of the side chain of Arg-142 could interact with Glu-146 without generating steric clashes with other parts of the protein. Hence, guided by the mutation assays, modeling of the side chains provided putative mechanistic explanations of the observed localization phenotypes. However, it should be borne in mind that this explanation is based on the model that the localization assay is attempting to support and that correct modeling of side chains is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the C-α model structure (28Fleishman S.J. Ben-Tal N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Although wild-type connexins are membrane-localized, our images show fluorescence also outside the membrane, even in wild-type connexin (e.g. Fig. 1). Localization of wild-type connexins outside the membrane, in addition to the existence of gap junction plaques, have been observed in other studies involving overexpressed connexins, and it has been suggested that the cytoplasmic fraction of the protein is at least in part localized in aggresomes (29Das Sarma J. Meyer R.A. Wang F. Abraham V. Lo C.W. Koval M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4013-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The important point to notice from the perspective of the current study is that, along with the localization of some of the protein in the cytoplasm, wild-type and doubly mutated connexins are localized in the plasma membrane, whereas the single mutants are not.A Salt Bridge at the Intercellular Part of the TM Domain— The charged residues of another pair, Lys-22 (M1) and Glu-209 (M4) of Cx26, face one another in the model structure, potentially forming a salt bridge (Fig. 1). These positions are conserved throughout the connexin family to basic and acidic identities, respectively. Mutations in both positions of the homologous Cx32 were implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (30VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 31Ressot C. Latour P. Blanquet-Grossard F. Sturtz F. Duthel S. Battin J. Corbillon E. Ollagnon E. Serville F. Vandenberghe A. Dautigny A. Pham-Dinh D. Hum. Genet. 1996; 98: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results show that, in Cx26, the single mutant E209R is mislocalized (Fig. 3A), similar to the disease-causing mutation to Lys in the homologous Cx32 (30VanSlyke J.K. Deschenes S.M. Musil L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1933-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). By contrast, K22E was properly localized in the plasma membrane (Table 1). The double mutant K22E/E209R rescued the aberrant localization phenotype of E209R and restored wild-type localization in the plasma membrane, suggesting that the two positions interact probably through an interhelical salt bridge. However, the normal localization of K22E, where no salt bridge can be formed, suggests that additional forces contribute to stabilization of this region. We did not detect similar compensation when testing this double mutant in Cx32 (data not shown), possibly because of subtle sequence and structure differences between these isoforms (Lys-22 in Cx26 is aligned with Arg-22 in Cx32). It is nevertheless very likely that the overall structure and salt bridge interactions present in Cx26 are also present in Cx32 (17Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Yeager M. Gilula N.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 929-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It should be noted that, although compensation is a sign of physical interaction, lack of compensation (as in Cx32) does not necessarily indicate that the residues are remote (discussed in Refs. 32Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A. Schreiber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13231-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 33Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Lin W. Teng C.

The single mutants E209R and K22E are cytoplasm- and membrane-localized, respectively. The mutation K22E suppresses the aberrant phenotype of E209R, indicating that the two positions interact. B, Lys-22 (M1) and Glu-209 (M4) of Cx26 may form a salt bridge. The two positions are located on the cytoplasmic boundary of the presumed hydrophobic core of the membrane and may thus be embedded in water or in the vicinity of the polar headgroups. The distance between the modeled amino and carboxyl moieties is <5 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further examination of the model structure in light of the results of the localization assay revealed one choice of rotamers for the modeled side chains of Lys-22 and Glu-209, where the carboxyl and amino moieties of the side chains could point toward one another and are roughly 4-5 Å apart (Fig. 3B). The two positions are located at the end of the presumed hydrophobic core of the membrane on the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 1) and thus are likely to be exposed to the polar headgroups and the water in this environment. Embedded in water, this salt bridge is also expected to have stabilizing energetic effects on the folding of the protein (25Horovitz A. Serrano L. Avron B. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 26Hendsch Z.S. Tidor B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It is instructive that the model structure provides a framework for understanding why one of the single mutants has deleterious effects on stability, whereas the other does not (Fig. 3A). The E209R mutation not only replaces the charge in this position but also adds to the side chain length, destabilizing the structure by bringing a positive charge from position 209 into the vicinity of the endogenous positively charged Lys-22 as well as by adding the potential for forming steric clashes. The compensating K22E mutation places two negative charges in the same region. However, because of the significant length difference between the side chains of Lys and Glu, the charges are more distant from one another in comparison to the distance between these residues in the wild type, reducing the effects of same-charge repulsion. By contrast, the above-mentioned Arg→Glu mutations in positions 32 and 142 did not show wild-type localization (Fig. 2A). The model offers an explanation for this difference in phenotypes as well. Whereas the interface between Arg-32 and Glu-146 on the pore-lining helices M1 and M3 is quite tight (Fig. 2B), increasing the effects of same-charge repulsion, the interface between M1 and M4, where positions Lys-22 and Glu-209 are located, is less tight (Fig. 3B).One Disease-causing Mutation Compensates for the Aberrant Localization Phenotype of Another— Another pair of residues, Ser-139 (M3) and Asn-206 (M4) of Cx26, is particularly relevant because of its involvement in a genetic disease (34Marlin S. Garabedian E.N. Roger G. Moatti L. Matha N. Lewin P. Petit C. Denoyelle F. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2001; 127: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Kenna M.A. Wu B.L. Cotanche D.A. Korf B.R. Rehm H.L. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2001; 127: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutations in these two amino acids also demonstrate a pattern of localization phenotypes suggestive of an interaction. Theoretically, interactions between these polar positions could result from hydrogen bonding or steric packing (Fig. 1). The localization assays showed that the S139N mutant was mislocalized, whereas N206S exhibited wild-type localization (Fig. 4A) (Table 1), although altered voltage-gating properties in this latter mutant have been reported (36Mese G. Londin E. Mui R. Brink P.R. White T.W. Hum. Genet. 2004; 115: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both of these mutations were implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss (34Marlin S. Garabedian E.N. Roger G. Moatti L. Matha N. Lewin P. Petit C. Denoyelle F. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2001; 127: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 35Kenna M.A. Wu B.L. Cotanche D.A. Korf B.R. Rehm H.L. Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 2001; 127: 1037-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When this pair is doubly mutated, however, one disease-causing mutation compensates for the effects of the other, restoring wild-type localization (Fig. 4A). Although the model suggests that the two residues are oriented toward one another (Figs. 1 and 4B), the modeled side chains do not appear to be in direct contact (∼6-7 Å apart). This is mainly because of a difference in the register along the axis vertical to the plane of the membrane, precluding the formation of a hydrogen bond. Hence, interpretation of the localization assay in light of the model suggests that the interaction between these residues results from packing with intermediate amino acid positions (24Horovitz A. Bochkareva E.S. Kovalenko O. Girshovich A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas the S139N mutation adds to the volume at the interface between helices M3 and M4, resulting in mislocalization, the N206S mutation compensates for this increased volume and restores membrane localization in the double mutant.FIGURE 4A, of the two mutations that cause deafness, S139N and N206S in Cx26, only the first is mislocalized. The second mutation compensates for the effects of the first, restoring the wild-type localization. The wild-type localization phenotype of Cx26 is"
