https://openalex.org/W2123647733,"Bromodomains (BRDs) are protein interaction modules that specifically recognize ε-N-lysine acetylation motifs, a key event in the reading process of epigenetic marks. The 61 BRDs in the human genome cluster into eight families based on structure/sequence similarity. Here, we present 29 high-resolution crystal structures, covering all BRD families. Comprehensive crossfamily structural analysis identifies conserved and family-specific structural features that are necessary for specific acetylation-dependent substrate recognition. Screening of more than 30 representative BRDs against systematic histone-peptide arrays identifies new BRD substrates and reveals a strong influence of flanking posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, suggesting that BRDs recognize combinations of marks rather than singly acetylated sequences. We further uncovered a structural mechanism for the simultaneous binding and recognition of diverse diacetyl-containing peptides by BRD4. These data provide a foundation for structure-based drug design of specific inhibitors for this emerging target family."

By lineage mapping, we show Lrig1, a pan-ErbB inhibitor, marks predominately noncycling, long-lived stem cells that are located at the crypt base and that, upon injury, proliferate and divide to replenish damaged crypts. Transcriptome profiling of Lrig1(+) colonic stem cells differs markedly from the profiling of highly proliferative, Lgr5(+) colonic stem cells; genes upregulated in the Lrig1(+) population include those involved in cell cycle repression and response to oxidative damage. Loss of Apc in Lrig1(+) cells leads to intestinal adenomas, and genetic ablation of Lrig1 results in heightened ErbB1-3 expression and duodenal adenomas. These results shed light on the relationship between proliferative and quiescent intestinal stem cells and support a model in which intestinal stem cell quiescence is maintained by calibrated ErbB signaling with loss of a negative regulator predisposing to neoplasia."

Here, we investigate membrane fission by shallow hydrophobic insertions quantitatively and mechanistically. We provide evidence that membrane insertion of the ENTH domain of epsin leads to liposome vesiculation, and that epsin is required for clathrin-coated vesicle budding in cells. We also show that BAR-domain scaffolds from endophilin, amphiphysin, GRAF, and β2-centaurin limit membrane fission driven by hydrophobic insertions. A quantitative assay for vesiculation reveals an antagonistic relationship between amphipathic helices and scaffolds of N-BAR domains in fission. The extent of vesiculation by these proteins and vesicle size depend on the number and length of amphipathic helices per BAR domain, in accord with theoretical considerations. This fission mechanism gives a new framework for understanding membrane scission in the absence of mechanoenzymes such as dynamin and suggests how Arf and Sar proteins work in vesicle scission.

Basic cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi complex (GC), mitochondria, and intracellular transport intermediates (such as endocytic vesicles), contain in their structures highly curved tubular and spherical membrane elements undergoing persistent transformations and mutual conversion (McMahon and Gallop, 2005McMahon H.T.

To form these intracellular membrane shapes, there are two essentially different types of membrane-sculpting events: generation of membrane curvature without disturbing membrane integrity and membrane remodeling by fission and fusion. A lipid bilayer, constituting the structural basis of all cell membranes, resists both bending and remodeling (fission) (Chernomordik and Kozlov, 2003Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Protein-lipid interplay in fusion and fission of biological membranes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Therefore, forces have to be applied and energy supplied to intracellular membranes in order to drive membrane curvature and fission. Several unrelated mechanisms have been suggested for protein-mediated membrane sculpting (Farsad and De Camilli, 2003Farsad K. De Camilli P. Mechanisms of membrane deformation.Curr. Opin.

The mechanisms of curvature generation by peripheral membrane proteins may be classified into two groups: (1) hydrophobic insertion mechanisms, based on penetration of hydrophobic or amphipathic protein domains into the lipid bilayer matrix, and (2) scaffolding mechanisms, where intrinsically curved and sufficiently rigid hydrophilic protein domains (or assemblies thereof) adhere to the lipid bilayer surface and impress their shapes on the membrane (McMahon and Gallop, 2005McMahon H.T.

This has enabled a quantitative and unifying understanding of the action of practically all peripheral membrane proteins proven to date to generate membrane curvature. The state of the current understanding of membrane fission is less advanced. So far, several hypothetical models of membrane division have been suggested for Arf1 and dynamin (Beck et al., 2011Beck R. Prinz S. Diestelkötter-Bachert P. Röhling S. Adolf F. Hoehner K. Welsch S.

Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), but these do not provide a quantitative basis on the forces driving membrane scission. The present work establishes that shallow hydrophobic insertions, previously shown to generate membrane curvature, are sufficient to drive membrane fission resulting in the transformation of continuous membranes into separate vesicles. Previous work showed that the ENTH domain-containing protein epsin and N-BAR domain-containing proteins endophilin and amphiphysin could generate membrane vesicles in addition to the reported tubules with diameters from 20 to 50 nm (Ford et al., 2002Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

BAR domains as sensors of membrane curvature: the amphiphysin BAR structure.Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). This suggested that, in addition to promoting membrane curvature during endocytic vesicle formation (McMahon and Boucrot, 2011McMahon H.T. Boucrot E. Molecular mechanism and physiological functions of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 517-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), ENTH and N-BAR domains could also promote membrane scission. As the common feature of these domains is the presence of membrane-inserting amphipathic helices at their N termini, we hypothesize that this structural module might be the key factor necessary and, likely, sufficient for membrane fission. A theoretical analysis was conducted of the elastic energy of small vesicles and membrane tubules, using a coarse-grained model, accounting effectively for the molecular features of lipids and proteins. This analysis predicted that proteins containing shallow insertion domains promote membrane scission, whereas a protein whose membrane interaction face is crescent-like, such as crescent BAR domains (without insertions or twists), which bend membranes by the scaffolding mechanism, prevent membrane fission, hence, counteracting membrane insertions. We validated these predictions using a new in vitro quantitative vesiculation assay and found a crucial role for epsin during clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) budding in cells. Membrane fission involves rearrangements of membrane continuity requiring specialized protein modules. To foresee the effect of shallow hydrophobic insertions and/or crescent-like protein scaffolds on membrane fission, we undertook a comparative analysis of system energies in tubular and vesicular states based on a coarse-grained semiquantitative physical model (see Extended Experimental Procedures). The results can be presented in the form of phase diagrams (Figures 1A and 1B ; Figure S1 available online) predicting formation of the vesicular state, tubular state, and coexistence between them for different protein-to-lipid ratios, x, and different ratios between the scaffold and lipid bilayer bending moduli, κp/κm. The latter parameter characterizes the ability of scaffolds to generate membrane curvature. Vanishing values of this parameter, κp/κm=0, describe proteins that do not produce any scaffolding effect and bend membranes solely by shallow insertion of amphipathic helices. The larger κp/κm, the stronger the scaffolding effect. Qualitatively an increase of κp/κm is equivalent to a decrease in the number of amphipathic helices per scaffold for a given protein rigidity κp (Figure 1A). The extended phase diagram in Figure 1B corresponds to an N-BAR with an extra amphipathic domain in the middle (such as endophilin). The points corresponding to κp/κm=0 describe scaffold-less proteins such as epsin ENTH domains. Complete modeling is presented in the Extended Experimental Procedures.Figure S1Predicted Membrane-Shaping Effects of Hydrophobic Insertions and Crescent-like Scaffolds, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Structures of Epsin ENTH domain (PDB: 1h0a), Amphiphysin BAR domain (PDB: 1uru), and endophilin BAR domain (PDB: 2c08) (Ford et al., 2002Ford M.G.

The major conclusion illustrated by the phase diagrams (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1D–S1F) is that shallow hydrophobic insertions are predicted to be sufficient for vesicle formation, driving membrane fission, whereas crescent-like protein scaffolds are predicted to support formation of continuous membrane tubules, hence disfavoring fission (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1). The mechanistic background for these predictions comes from a qualitative consideration of the mechanical stability of a funnel-like membrane neck, an unavoidable intermediate stage of the fission process (Figure 1C). Fission occurs if this neck is unstable, i.e., possesses extra energy, which can be released as a result of membrane scission. Geometrical considerations show that the saddle-like shape of the neck membrane is characterized by having a larger midplane area than outer and inner leaflet surface areas (occupied by lipid head groups). Expansion of the head group region with respect to the bilayer midplane would stress and destabilize the neck, hence, favoring its fission. This reasoning can be expressed in exact terms of the insertion contribution to the membrane modulus of Gaussian curvature and the role of the latter in determining membrane conformations (Huse and Leibler, 1991Huse D.A.

Topics. 1999; 59: 5528-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Shallow hydrophobic insertions, such as amphipathic helices from proteins like epsin, span mainly the polar head regions of membrane monolayers and do not penetrate deeply into the monolayer hydrocarbon region (Kweon et al., 2006Kweon D.H. Shin Y.K. Shin J.Y. Lee J.H. Lee J.B. Seo J.H. Kim Y.S. Membrane topology of helix 0 of the Epsin N-terminal homology domain.Mol. Cells. 2006; 21: 428-435PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, these insertions expand the bilayer surface(s) with respect to the bilayer midplane and, hence, are predicted to destabilize the neck and favor membrane fission. Although this effect is strongest if insertions are introduced into both membrane monolayers (expanding the head groups region on both sides), estimations show that amphipathic helices inserted only in the outer monolayer at biologically reasonable concentrations can be sufficient to drive fission on their own. Moreover, insertions are predicted not only to make fission energetically favorable but also to accelerate this reaction by reducing its energy barrier. The fission rate was previously proposed to be limited by the energy of the membrane stalk intermediate (Bashkirov et al., 2008Bashkirov P.V. Akimov S.A. Evseev A.I. Schmid S.L. Zimmerberg J.

Kozlov M.M. Membrane fission: model for intermediate structures.Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and computations show that a positive contribution to outer monolayer spontaneous curvature generated by the insertions (Campelo et al., 2008Campelo F.

J. 2008; 95: 2325-2339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) decreases the stalk energy (Kozlovsky and Kozlov, 2003Kozlovsky Y. Kozlov M.M. Membrane fission: model for intermediate structures.Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Taken together, shallow hydrophobic insertions are expected to support membrane fission into small vesicles both in terms of the overall energy balance and kinetically. Crescent-like scaffolds, such as BAR and F-BAR domains that do not penetrate lipid monolayers, do not change the area balance between membrane surfaces and the midplane. Instead, they mold, locally, the membrane into a cylindrical shape, which is curved only along the line of the scaffold-membrane interface (Figure S1H). The energetically most favorable situation for multiple crescent-like scaffolds is where they are oriented parallel to each other on a tubular surface. Hence, pure crescent-like scaffolds are not expected to support membrane fission but rather are predicted to generate tubular shapes (Figure S1). “Hybrid” proteins, such as N-BAR domains, with both insertion and scaffolding effects, are predicted to generate coexisting vesicles and tubules with the degree of preference for the former or latter depending on the amount of the amphipathic helices per scaffold and on the effective rigidity of the scaffold, which includes the strength of the scaffold binding to the membrane surface (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1). Hence, scaffolding by BAR domains is predicted to restrain membrane fission mediated by hydrophobic insertions, and BAR domains with an increasing number of amphipathic helices are predicted to support increasing membrane vesiculation (Figures S1D–S1I) and so potentially in vivo will be on the pathway to membrane fission. Epsin proteins were initially chosen as a paradigm for insertion activity in the absence of scaffolding. Epsin proteins play a role in cargo selection and membrane sculpting of CCV (Ford et al., 2002Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

EpsinR is involved in CCV formation from intracellular compartments (Mills et al., 2003Mills I.G. Praefcke G.J. Vallis Y. Peter B.J. Olesen L.E. Gallop J.L. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), whereas the remaining epsins are believed to function from the plasma membrane. We measured the effects of individual or combinatorial depletion of epsin1, -2, and -3 by RNAi on clathrin-mediated endocytic activity as measured by transferrin (Tf) uptake (Figure 2A ). We found that only simultaneous depletion of epsin1, -2, and -3 (1+2+3 RNAi) led to a significant decrease in Tf uptake, giving a similar effect to depletion of clathrin, FCHo proteins (Henne et al., 2010Henne W.M. Boucrot E. Meinecke M. Evergren E. Vallis Y. Mittal R. McMahon H.T. FCHo proteins are nucleators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.Science. 2010; 328: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), or AP2 (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). This phenotype was specific as it was confirmed using up to five different 1+2+3 siRNA pools (comprising 24 different siRNAs) in three different cell lines and could be specifically rescued by coexpression of rat epsin1-RFP, which was resistant to the epsin1 siRNA in pools 1 and 2 (Figures 2B and S2A). Rat epsin1-RFP did not rescue, as expected, clathrin or AP2 RNAi. The perturbation was specific to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, as the uptake of the fluid-phase marker dextran was not affected (Figure S2C ). Because epsin3 is known to be upregulated in some tumors (Coon et al., 2011Coon B.G. Direnzo D.M. Konieczny S.F. Aguilar R.C. Epsins' novel role in cancer cell invasion.Commun Integr Biol. 2011; 4: 95-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the phenotype was confirmed in a normal diploid cell line (hTERT-RPE1) where we have shown by mass spectrometry that epsins 1, 2, and 3 are all expressed (Figures 2A and S2B). The block of Tf uptake upon codepletion of epsins was largely due to a defect in scission of clathrin-coated structures (CCS) as epsin 1+2+3 RNAi cells had most (63.3%) of their AP2- and clathrin punctae arrested and enlarged (“1+2+3,” Figures 2C–2F). These defects were rescued by the re-expression of rat epsin1-RFP (“rescue,” Figures 2C–2F). By electron microscopy (EM), the number of CCS per μm cell perimeter was not significantly different in the control and epsin 1+2+3 RNAi cells (control: 0.065 ± 0.042 CCS/μm, n = 70; 1+2+3 RNAi: 0.070 ± 0.036 CCS/μm, n = 70; p > 0.05). The relative abundance of different stages of CCS—shallow, invaginated, and constricted—were similar in the two samples. However, a marked increase in the number of multiheaded CCS were observed in the epsin 1+2+3 RNAi sample, representing 23% of the total number of pits versus 4% in the control (Figure 2G). Large patches of flat clathrin-coated plasma membrane were also observed, reminiscen"

However, the mechanisms by which osteoblasts control hematopoiesis remain unknown. We show that augmented HIF signaling in osteoprogenitors results in HSC niche expansion associated with selective expansion of the erythroid lineage. Increased red blood cell production occurred in an EPO-dependent manner with increased EPO expression in bone and suppressed EPO expression in the kidney. In contrast, inactivation of HIF in osteoprogenitors reduced EPO expression in bone. Importantly, augmented HIF activity in osteoprogenitors protected mice from stress-induced anemia. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases1/2/3 in osteoprogenitors elevated EPO expression in bone and increased hematocrit. These data reveal an unexpected role for osteoblasts in the production of EPO and modulation of erythropoiesis. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate a molecular role for osteoblastic PHD/VHL/HIF signaling that can be targeted to elevate both HSCs and erythroid progenitors in the local hematopoietic microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2021069369,"Store operated calcium entry (SOCE) is a principal cellular process by which cells regulate basal calcium, refill intracellular Ca2+ stores, and execute a wide range of specialized activities. STIM and Orai proteins have been identified as the essential components enabling the reconstitution of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels that mediate SOCE. Here, we report the molecular identification of SARAF as a negative regulator of SOCE. Using heterologous expression, RNAi-mediated silencing and site directed mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological, biochemical and imaging techniques we show that SARAF is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane resident protein that associates with STIM to facilitate slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation of SOCE. SARAF plays a key role in shaping cytosolic Ca2+ signals and determining the content of the major intracellular Ca2+ stores, a role that is likely to be important in protecting cells from Ca2+ overfilling."

Using electron cryomicroscopy, we present reconstructions of full-length endophilin and its N-terminal N-BAR domain in their membrane-bound state. Endophilin lattices expose large areas of membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners."

Through the analysis of more than 500 genomes, we identify two kingdom-specific tRNA modifications as major contributors that separated archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal genomes in terms of their tRNA gene composition. We show that, contrary to prior observations, genomic codon usage and tRNA gene frequencies correlate in all kingdoms if these two modifications are taken into account and that presence or absence of these modifications explains patterns of gene expression observed in previous studies. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that human gene expression levels correlate well with genomic codon composition if these identified modifications are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2086347537,"Crossovers (COs) between homologous chromosomes ensure their faithful segregation during meiosis. We identify C. elegans COSA-1, a cyclin-related protein conserved in metazoa, as a key component required to convert meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs) into COs. During late meiotic prophase, COSA-1 localizes to foci that correspond to the single CO site on each homolog pair and indicate sites of eventual concentration of other conserved CO proteins. Chromosomes gain and lose competence to load CO proteins during meiotic progression, with competence to load COSA-1 requiring prior licensing. Our data further suggest a self-reinforcing mechanism maintaining CO designation. Modeling of a nonlinear dose-response relationship between IR-induced DSBs and COSA-1 foci reveals efficient conversion of DSBs into COs when DSBs are limiting and a robust capacity to limit cytologically differentiated CO sites when DSBs are in excess. COSA-1 foci serve as a unique live cell readout for investigating CO formation and CO interference."

However, there is no direct evidence for the existence of cis-trans protein isomers in vivo or for their conformation-specific function or regulation. Here we develop peptide chemistries that allow the generation of cis- and trans-specific antibodies and use them to raise antibodies specific for isomers of phosphorylated tau. cis, but not trans, p-tau appears early in the brains of humans with mild cognitive impairment, accumulates exclusively in degenerated neurons, and localizes to dystrophic neurites during Alzheimer's progression. Unlike trans p-tau, the cis isomer cannot promote microtubule assembly, is more resistant to dephosphorylation and degradation, and is more prone to aggregation. Pin1 converts cis to trans p-tau to prevent Alzheimer's tau pathology. Isomer-specific antibodies and vaccines may therefore have value for the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

Engulfment has classically been believed to be performed by professional phagocytes, but recent data show that non-professional phagocytes are highly involved in the removal of cell corpses in various situations. The role of astrocytes in cell clearance following trauma has however not been studied in detail. We have found that astrocytes actively collect and engulf whole dead cells in an in vitro model of brain injury and thereby protect healthy neurons from bystander cell death. Time-lapse experiments showed that migrating neurons that come in contact with free-floating cell corpses induced apoptosis, while neurons that migrate through groups of dead cells, garnered by astrocytes, remain unaffected. Furthermore, apoptotic cells are present within astrocytes in the mouse brain following traumatic brain injury (TBI), indicating a possible role for astrocytes in engulfment of apoptotic cells in vivo. qRT-PCR analysis showed that members of both ced pathways and Megf8 are expressed in the cell culture, indicating their possible involvement in astrocytic engulfment. Moreover, addition of dead cells had a positive effect on the protein expression of MEGF10, an ortholog to CED1, known to initiate phagocytosis by binding to phosphatidylserine. Although cultured astrocytes have an immense capacity for engulfment, seemingly without adverse effects, the ingested material is stored rather than degraded. This finding might explain the multinuclear astrocytes that are found at the lesion site in patients with various brain disorders."

Here, we describe a modular system for the generation of artificial thymopoietic environments in the mouse embryo. Thymic epithelium that lacks hematopoietic function but is physiologically accessible for hematopoietic progenitor cells is functionalized by individual and combinatorial expression of four factors, the chemokines Ccl25 and Cxcl12, the cytokine Scf, and the Notch ligand DLL4. The distinct phenotypes and variable numbers of hematopoietic cells in the resulting epithelial environments reveal synergistic, context-dependent, and hierarchical interactions among effector molecules. The surprisingly simple rules determining hematopoietic properties enable the in vivo engineering of artificial environments conducive to the presence of distinct myeloid or T or B lymphoid lineage precursors; moreover, synthetic environments facilitate the procurement of physiological progenitor cell types for analytical purposes and future therapeutic applications.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJhNTRjMWI2ZWFhZGUwZTQwYjFkY2IyYjVmNmVlOGZlNyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0Nzc2NTUyfQ.R_Kb8VD0lDE9G3ZRtfMiyHxbUg4WBJ2EQa_Ydpv7eMdMip3V5_laYdP8YFxWcCKuiUCbDys2ptXU7_RUpZEW74Ae1BkVj_iKpUcRUcVo5cT4L4095ICGOa_Rbau_NRuDzkzvCLYImV8U1qXW9PnFBS503aK6dcwkDCV48sP0iPV3KZMBAJixBjbPVhfeNSr3fR9so4edvLdXgK3yveAT4ny_ZeGz08Tqmc5hpyxIsOJBWLqHKQrlRNClAfMwvKuFQpHiilp0J3gC9rXfeqD3e_KTaGCnoiE_8eOLFmqAuoPLA4Wjm5BBr1ShB8wADK0-KG91KXpKdr6eNAZiptSEOg(mp4, (12.68 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2017543281,"Research into the etiology of breast cancer has recently focused on the role of the immunity and inflammation. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F can mediate inflammation and cancer. To evaluate the influences of IL-17A and IL-17F gene polymorphisms on the risk of sporadic breast cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Chinese Han women.We genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-17A (rs2275913, rs3819025 and rs3748067) and five SNPs in IL-17F (rs7771511, rs9382084, rs12203582, rs1266828 and rs763780) to determine the haplotypes in 491 women with breast cancer and 502 healthy individuals. The genotypes were determined using the SNaPshot technique. The differences in the genotypic distribution between breast cancer patients and healthy controls were analyzed with the Chi-square test for trends. For rs2275913 in IL-17A, the frequency of the AA genotype was higher in patients than controls (P = 0.0016). The clinical features analysis demonstrated significant associations between IL-17 SNPs and tumor protein 53 (P53), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) and triple-negative (ER-/PR-/Her-2-) status. In addition, the haplotype analysis indicated that the frequency of the haplotype A(rs2275913)G(rs3819025)G(rs3748067), located in the IL-17A linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, was higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.0471 after correction for multiple testing).Our results suggested that SNPs in IL-17A but not IL-17F were associated with the risk of breast cancer. Both IL-17A and IL-17F gene polymorphisms may provide valuable information for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer in Chinese women."

Experience-dependent plasticity occurs at synapses—the specialized points of contact between neurons where signaling occurs. However, the mechanisms that regulate the strength of synaptic signaling are not well understood. Here, we define a Wnt-signaling pathway that modifies synaptic strength in the adult nervous system by regulating the translocation of one class of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to synapses. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that mutations in CWN-2 (Wnt ligand), LIN-17 (Frizzled), CAM-1 (Ror receptor tyrosine kinase), or the downstream effector DSH-1 (disheveled) result in similar subsynaptic accumulations of ACR-16/α7 AChRs, a consequent reduction in synaptic current, and predictable behavioral defects. Photoconversion experiments revealed defective translocation of ACR-16/α7 to synapses in Wnt-signaling mutants. Using optogenetic nerve stimulation, we demonstrate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and its dependence on ACR-16/α7 translocation mediated by Wnt signaling via LIN-17/CAM-1 heteromeric receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1973677971,"A theoretical model shows how sexual selection, on its own, can maintain biodiversity, provided that two realistic assumptions are met: that carrying capacity varies spatially, and that females searching for mates incur costs in doing so. The coexistence of species is facilitated by mechanisms that reduce range overlap between them. Sexual selection is one such mechanism, but conventional wisdom suggests that, on its own, it is not sufficient to separate species that are otherwise ecologically coextensive. This theoretical study challenges that view by demonstrating that species kept apart by sexual selection can coexist for long periods without ecological differences, despite range overlap, providing that two conditions are met. These conditions — that carrying capacity varies over space and that searching for mates is costly — are both common in natural ecosystems. This model provides an innovative explanation for how long-term coexistence has been sustained in groups of closely related species that seem to differ primarily in sexual characters, such as the cichlids of Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria. Empirical data indicate that sexual preferences are critical for maintaining species boundaries1,2,3,4, yet theoretical work has suggested that, on their own, they can have only a minimal role in maintaining biodiversity5,6,7,8,9. This is because long-term coexistence within overlapping ranges is thought to be unlikely in the absence of ecological differentiation9. Here we challenge this widely held view by generalizing a standard model of sexual selection to include two ubiquitous features of populations with sexual selection: spatial variation in local carrying capacity, and mate-search costs in females. We show that, when these two features are combined, sexual preferences can single-handedly maintain coexistence, even when spatial variation in local carrying capacity is so slight that it might go unnoticed empirically. This theoretical study demonstrates that sexual selection alone can promote the long-term coexistence of ecologically equivalent species with overlapping ranges, and it thus provides a novel explanation for the maintenance of species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2032882465,"The impairment of immune functions in the elderly (immunosenescence) results in post-vaccination antibody titers that are significantly lower than in young individuals. It is, however, a controversial question whether also the quality of antibodies declines with age. In this study, we have therefore investigated the age-dependence of functional characteristics of antibody responses induced by vaccination with an inactivated flavivirus vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). For this purpose, we quantified TBE virus-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in post-vaccination sera from groups of young and elderly healthy adults and determined antibody avidities and NT/ELISA titer ratios (functional activity). In contrast to the quantitative impairment of antibody production in the elderly, we found no age-related differences in the avidity and functional activity of antibodies induced by vaccination, which also appeared to be independent of the age at primary immunization. There was no correlation between antibody avidity and NT/ELISA ratios suggesting that additional factors affect the quality of polyclonal responses, independent of age. Our work indicates that healthy elderly people are able to produce antibodies in response to vaccination with similar avidity and functional activity as young individuals, albeit at lower titers."
https://openalex.org/W2048627992,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are considered important regulators of neural development. However, results mainly from a wide set of in vitro gain-of-function experiments are conflicting since these show that BMPs can act either as inhibitors or promoters of neurogenesis. Here, we report a specific and non-redundant role for BMP7 in cortical neurogenesis in vivo using knockout mice. Bmp7 is produced in regions adjacent to the developing cortex; the hem, meninges, and choroid plexus, and can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Bmp7 deletion results in reduced cortical thickening, impaired neurogenesis, and loss of radial glia attachment to the meninges. Subsequent in vitro analyses of E14.5 cortical cells revealed that lack of Bmp7 affects neural progenitor cells, evidenced by their reduced proliferation, survival and self-renewal capacity. Addition of BMP7 was able to rescue these proliferation and survival defects. In addition, at the developmental stage E14.5 Bmp7 was also required to maintain Ngn2 expression in the subventricular zone. These data demonstrate a novel role for Bmp7 in the embryonic mouse cortex: Bmp7 nurtures radial glia cells and regulates fundamental properties of neural progenitor cells that subsequently affect Ngn2-dependent neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2040163651,"In this paper we present a multiscale, individual-based simulation environment that integrates CompuCell3D for lattice-based modelling on the cellular level and Bionetsolver for intracellular modelling. CompuCell3D or CC3D provides an implementation of the lattice-based Cellular Potts Model or CPM (also known as the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg or GGH model) and a Monte Carlo method based on the metropolis algorithm for system evolution. The integration of CC3D for cellular systems with Bionetsolver for subcellular systems enables us to develop a multiscale mathematical model and to study the evolution of cell behaviour due to the dynamics inside of the cells, capturing aspects of cell behaviour and interaction that is not possible using continuum approaches. We then apply this multiscale modelling technique to a model of cancer growth and invasion, based on a previously published model of Ramis-Conde et al. (2008) where individual cell behaviour is driven by a molecular network describing the dynamics of E-cadherin and -catenin. In this model, which we refer to as the centre-based model, an alternative individual-based modelling technique was used, namely, a lattice-free approach. In many respects, the GGH or CPM methodology and the approach of the centre-based model have the same overall goal, that is to mimic behaviours and interactions of biological cells. Although the mathematical foundations and computational implementations of the two approaches are very different, the results of the presented simulations are compatible with each other, suggesting that by using individual-based approaches we can formulate a natural way of describing complex multi-cell, multiscale models. The ability to easily reproduce results of one modelling approach using an alternative approach is also essential from a model cross-validation standpoint and also helps to identify any modelling artefacts specific to a given computational approach."
https://openalex.org/W2042748903,"Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by frequent neuropsychiatric involvement, which includes cognitive impairment (CI). We aimed at assessing CI in a cohort of Italian SLE patients by using a wide range of neurocognitive tests specifically designed to evaluate the fronto-subcortical dysfunction. Furthermore, we aimed at testing whether CI in SLE is associated with serum autoantibodies, disease activity and chronic damage. Methods Fifty-eight consecutive patients were enrolled. Study protocol included data collection, evaluation of serum levels of ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I, anti-P ribosomal, anti-endothelial cell, and anti-Nedd5 antibodies. SLEDAI-2000 and SLICC were used to assess disease activity and chronic damage. Patients were administered a test battery specifically designed to detect fronto-subcortical dysfunction across five domains: memory, attention, abstract reasoning, executive function and visuospatial function. For each patient, the raw scores from each test were compared with published norms, then transformed into Z scores (deviation from normal mean), and finally summed in the Global Cognitive Dysfunction score (GCDs). Results Nineteen percent of patients had mild GCDs impairment (GCDs 2–3), 7% moderate (GCDs 4–5) and 5% severe (GCDs≥6). The visuospatial domain was the most compromised (MDZs = −0.89±1.23). Anti-cardiolipin IgM levels were associated with visuospatial domain impairment (r = 0.331, P = 0.005). SLEDAI correlated with GCDs, and attentional and executive domains; SLICC correlated with GCDs, and with visuospatial and attentional domains impairment. Conclusions Anti-phospholipids, disease activity, and chronic damage are associated with cognitive dysfunction in SLE. The use of a wide spectrum of tests allowed for a better selection of the relevant factors involved in SLE cognitive dysfunction, and standardized neuropsychological testing methods should be used for routine assessment of SLE patients."
https://openalex.org/W1966719374,"The oncogene FOXM1 has been implicated in all major types of human cancer. We recently showed that aberrant FOXM1 expression causes stem cell compartment expansion resulting in the initiation of hyperplasia. We have previously shown that FOXM1 regulates HELLS, a SNF2/helicase involved in DNA methylation, implicating FOXM1 in epigenetic regulation. Here, we have demonstrated using primary normal human oral keratinocytes (NOK) that upregulation of FOXM1 suppressed the tumour suppressor gene p16(INK4A) (CDKN2A) through promoter hypermethylation. Knockdown of HELLS using siRNA re-activated the mRNA expression of p16(INK4A) and concomitant downregulation of two DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The dose-dependent upregulation of endogenous FOXM1 (isoform B) expression during tumour progression across a panel of normal primary NOK strains (n = 8), dysplasias (n = 5) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines (n = 11) correlated positively with endogenous expressions of HELLS, BMI1, DNMT1 and DNMT3B and negatively with p16(INK4A) and involucrin. Bisulfite modification and methylation-specific promoter analysis using absolute quantitative PCR (MS-qPCR) showed that upregulation of FOXM1 significantly induced p16(INK4A) promoter hypermethylation (10-fold, P<0.05) in primary NOK cells. Using a non-bias genome-wide promoter methylation microarray profiling method, we revealed that aberrant FOXM1 expression in primary NOK induced a global hypomethylation pattern similar to that found in an HNSCC (SCC15) cell line. Following validation experiments using absolute qPCR, we have identified a set of differentially methylated genes, found to be inversely correlated with in vivo mRNA expression levels of clinical HNSCC tumour biopsy samples. This study provided the first evidence, using primary normal human cells and tumour tissues, that aberrant upregulation of FOXM1 orchestrated a DNA methylation signature that mimics the cancer methylome landscape, from which we have identified a unique FOXM1-induced epigenetic signature which may have clinical translational potentials as biomarkers for early cancer screening, diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2069527559,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family of enveloped DNA viruses. It was previously shown that HBV can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activate the IRE1-XBP1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR), through the expression of the viral regulatory protein X (HBx). However, it remained obscure whether or not this activation had any functional consequences on the target genes of the UPR pathway. Of these targets, the ER degradation-enhancing, mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) are thought to play an important role in relieving the ER stress during UPR, by recognizing terminally misfolded glycoproteins and delivering them to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In this study, we investigated the role of EDEMs in the HBV life-cycle. We found that synthesis of EDEMs (EDEM1 and its homologues, EDEM2 and EDEM3) is significantly up-regulated in cells with persistent or transient HBV replication. Co-expression of the wild-type HBV envelope proteins with EDEM1 resulted in their massive degradation, a process reversed by EDEM1 silencing. Surprisingly, the autophagy/lysosomes, rather than the proteasome were involved in disposal of the HBV envelope proteins. Importantly, inhibition of the endogenous EDEM1 expression in HBV replicating cells significantly increased secretion of both, enveloped virus and subviral particles. This is the first report showing that HBV activates the ERAD pathway, which, in turn, reduces the amount of envelope proteins, possibly as a mechanism to control the level of virus particles in infected cells and facilitate the establishment of chronic infections."

Moreover, we developed a unique in vitro assay with a biotinylated recombinant Notch1 substrate and demonstrated that PS1 FAD mutations directly and significantly reduced γ-secretase activity for Notch1 cleavage. Substitution of the Notch Cys-1752 residue, which interacts with the S2 subsite, with Val, Met, or Ile has little effect on wild-type PS1 but leads to more efficient substrates for mutant PS1s. This study indicates that alteration of this S2 subsite plays an important role in determining the activity and specificity of γ-secretase for APP and Notch1 processing, which provides structural basis and insights on how certain PS1 FAD mutations lead to AD pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2126486632,"A variety of functionally important protein properties, such as secondary structure, transmembrane topology and solvent accessibility, can be encoded as a labeling of amino acids. Indeed, the prediction of such properties from the primary amino acid sequence is one of the core projects of computational biology. Accordingly, a panoply of approaches have been developed for predicting such properties; however, most such approaches focus on solving a single task at a time. Motivated by recent, successful work in natural language processing, we propose to use multitask learning to train a single, joint model that exploits the dependencies among these various labeling tasks. We describe a deep neural network architecture that, given a protein sequence, outputs a host of predicted local properties, including secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane topology, signal peptides and DNA-binding residues. The network is trained jointly on all these tasks in a supervised fashion, augmented with a novel form of semi-supervised learning in which the model is trained to distinguish between local patterns from natural and synthetic protein sequences. The task-independent architecture of the network obviates the need for task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate that, for all of the tasks that we considered, our approach leads to statistically significant improvements in performance, relative to a single task neural network approach, and that the resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance."
https://openalex.org/W1988500358,"The 7th edition of AJCC staging manual implicitly states that only T1 and T2 lesions that lack regional lymph node metastasis but have tumor deposit(s) will be classified in addition as N1c, though it is not consistent in that pN1c is also an option for pT3/T4a tumors in the staging table. Nevertheless, in this TNM classification, how to classify tumor deposits (TDs) in colorectal cancer patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and TDs simultaneously is still not clear. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of counting TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in TNM classification and to identify its prognostic value for colorectal cancer patients.In this retrospective study, 513 cases of colorectal cancer with LNM were reviewed. We proposed a novel pN (npN) category in which TDs were counted as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification. Cancer-specific survival according to the npN or pN category was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify significant prognostic factors. Harrell's C statistic was used to test the predictive capacity of the prognostic models. The results revealed that the TD was a significant prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses uniformly indicated that the npN category was significantly correlated with prognosis. The results of Harrell's C statistical analysis demonstrated that the npN category exhibited a superior predictive capacity compared to the pN category of the 7th edition TNM classification. Moreover, we also found no significant prognostic differences in patients with or without TD in the same npN categories.The counting of TDs as metastatic lymph nodes in the TNM classification system is potentially superior to the classification in the 7th edition of the TNM staging system to assess prognosis and survival for colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2073664416,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a critical regulator of protein serine/threonine phosphorylation. However, the physiological and developmental roles of different PP2A complexes are very poorly understood. Here, we show that a newly characterized PP2A inhibitory protein CIP2A is co-expressed with ki-67 and with self-renewal protein PLZF in the spermatogonial progenitor cell (SPC) population in the testis. CIP2A and PLZF expression was shown also to correlate Ki-67 expression in human testicular spermatogonia. Functionally, CIP2A mutant mouse testes exhibited smaller number of PLZF-positive SPCs and reduced sperm counts. Moreover, seminiferous tubuli cells isolated from CIP2A mutant mice showed reduced expression of Plzf and other renewal genes Oct-4 and Nanog at mRNA level. However, PLZF-deficient testes did not show altered CIP2A expression. Importantly, spermatogonia-specific restoration of CIP2A expression rescued PLZF expression and sperm production defects observed in CIP2A mutant mice. Taken together, these results reveal first physiological function for an emerging human oncoprotein CIP2A, and provide insights into maintenance of PLZF-positive progenitors. Moreover, demonstration that CIP2A expression can be systematically inhibited without severe consequences to normal mouse development and viability may have clinical relevance regarding targeting of oncogenic CIP2A for future cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2093724516,"In many tumor types serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels is an indirect marker of tumor hypoxia, neo-angiogenesis and worse prognosis. However data about hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking in the clinical setting of patients undergoing transarterial-chemoembolization (TACE) in whom hypoxia and neo-angiogenesis may represent a molecular key to treatment failure. Aim of our analysis was to evaluate the role of LDH pre-treatment levels in determining clinical outcome for patients with HCC receiving TACE. One hundred and fourteen patients were available for our analysis. For all patients LDH values were collected within one month before the procedure. We divided our patients into two groups, according to LDH serum concentration registered before TACE (first: LDH≤450 U/l 84 patients; second: LDH>450 U/l 30 patients). Patients were classified according to the variation in LDH serum levels pre- and post-treatment (increased: 62 patients vs. decreased 52 patients). No statistically significant differences were found between the groups for all clinical characteristics analyzed (gender, median age, performance status ECOG, staging systems). In patients with LDH values below 450 U/l median time to progression (TTP) was 16.3 months, whereas it was of 10.1 months in patients above the cut-off (p = 0.0085). Accordingly median overall survival (OS) was 22.4 months and 11.7 months (p = 0.0049). In patients with decreased LDH values after treatment median TTP was 12.4 months, and median OS was 22.1 months, whereas TTP was 9.1 months and OS was 9.5 in patients with increased LDH levels (TTP: p = 0.0087; OS: p<0.0001). In our experience, LDH seemed able to predict clinical outcome for HCC patients undergoing TACE. Given the correlation between LDH levels and tumor angiogenesis we can speculate that patients with high LDH pretreatment levels may be optimal candidates for clinical trial exploring a multimodality treatment approach with TACE and anti-VEGF inhibitors in order to improve TTP and OS."
https://openalex.org/W2038520150,"Objective Correlations have been reported between behavioral and cognitive outcomes in adolescence and exposure to maternal depression during the first postpartum year, but the effects of timing of maternal depression during subsequent exposure periods have rarely been controlled for. This study aims to methodically investigate the importance of timing of initial exposure to maternal depression with respect to adolescent mental health outcomes. Methods This study used data on 937 children from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a nationally-representative longitudinal survey established in 1994 by Statistics Canada. Ordinal logistic regression was used to confirm associations between adolescent emotional disorder (at 12–13 years) and initial exposure to maternal depression during 2-year intervals from birth to adolescence. Following their initial exposure to maternal depression, children were dropped from subsequent cycles. Stressful life events, chronic health conditions, maternal alcohol use, maternal marital status, gender, and SES were included as covariates. Results The results indicated that adolescents who were initially exposed to maternal depression between the ages of 2–3 years and 4–5 years had a two-fold increase in odds of emotional disorder. No increase in odds was observed in those initially exposed during the first postpartum year or later in childhood. Conclusions The results demonstrate that a sensitive period of initial exposure to maternal depression may occur between the ages of 2 and 5, and not during the first year of life indicated by previous research. These findings are congruent with the literature on emotional and behavioral development in early childhood."

The two main isoforms of these peptides have 40 (Aβ40) or 42 residues (Aβ42), the latter having a higher propensity to aggregate in vitro and being the main component of the plaques observed in vivo in AD patients. We have designed a series of tandem dimeric constructs of these Aβ peptides to probe the manner in which changes in the aggregation kinetics of Aβ affect its deposition and toxicity in a Drosophila melanogaster model system. The levels of insoluble aggregates were found to be substantially elevated in flies expressing the tandem constructs of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 compared with the equivalent monomeric peptides, consistent with the higher effective concentration, and hence increased aggregation rate, of the peptides in the tandem repeat. A unique feature of the Aβ42 constructs, however, is the appearance of high levels of soluble oligomeric aggregates and a corresponding dramatic increase in their in vivo toxicity. The toxic nature of the Aβ42 peptide in vivo can therefore be attributed to the higher kinetic stability of the oligomeric intermediate states that it populates relative to those of Aβ40 rather than simply to its higher rate of aggregation.

The misfolding and subsequent aberrant aggregation of proteins into a range of potentially toxic conformers underlie many age-related neurodegenerative diseases (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Although a relatively small fraction of proteins is found to be associated with such diseases, the intrinsic ability to self-assemble into stable and organized amyloid aggregates is a generic feature of all such molecules (2Dobson C.M.

A detailed molecular description of these processes is essential if we are to intervene in a rational manner to prevent or treat the many diseases that are linked to protein misfolding and aggregation.

We have shown previously that it is possible to investigate the significance of kinetic factors in fibril formation in vitro by conjugating multiple copies of a protein to one another in a head-to-tail fashion using flexible linkers that allow the individual peptides of the tandem repeats to interact in an optimal manner, while substantially increasing their effective local concentration (13Bader R.

Here, we use this strategy to design tandem repeats to probe the aggregation behavior of the Aβ peptide in vivo and its links to neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that expression of these tandem Aβ peptides in the brains of Drosophila melanogaster provides insights into the mechanisms of Aβ aggregation in vivo, the extent to which such mechanisms differ for the Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, and how these differences relate to their relative neurotoxicities. Tandem Aβ transgenes were synthesized (Eurofins MWG Operon, Munich, Germany) using insect optimized codons. Aβ peptides within tandem constructs are linked either directly or by a 12- (GGGGSGGGGSGG) or a 22- (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGG) amino acid linker, as indicated in the text. These linker regions were chosen on the basis of previous work (13Bader R. Bamford R. Zurdo J. Luisi B.F. Dobson C.M. Probing the mechanism of amyloidogenesis through a tandem repeat of the PI3-SH3 domain suggests a generic model for protein aggregation and fibril formation.J. Mol.

Each construct was subcloned into the pUASTattB (GenBank Accession number EF362409) plasmid downstream of a secretory signal peptide derived from the Drosophila necrotic gene (28Green C. Levashina E. McKimmie C. Dafforn T. Reichhart J.M. Gubb D. The necrotic gene in Drosophila corresponds to one of a cluster of three serpin transcripts mapping at 43A1.2.Genetics. 2000; 156: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-specific transgenesis to the 51D locus (yM{int.Dm}ZH2Aw*;M{3xP3RFP.attP}ZH-51D) was achieved using the ϕC31 system (15Bischof J. Maeda R.K. Hediger M. Karch F. Basler K.

The transgenic lines were back-crossed for six generations into w1118 flies to obtain isogenic lines. To analyze the effect of Aβ expression, transgenic UAS-Aβ lines were subsequently crossed to GAL4 driver lines, allowing a tissue-specific expression. Double transgenic flies were generated to express two identical transgenes (51D/51D) using the same driver. Importantly, a 51D line without insert but crossed to the GAL4 driver line was used as a negative control for all crosses to account for genetic effects and the possible consequences of GAL4 protein expression in specific tissues. Twenty fly heads were homogenized in 2% (w/v) SDS in water, sonicated for 480 s, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as the “SDS-soluble fraction.” The remaining pellet (the “SDS-insoluble fraction”) was washed in PBS before being resuspended in 5 μl of a 80% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 20% (v/v) water solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before the addition of 15 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The samples were again sonicated for 480 s in a water bath, and a brief centrifugation was performed to eliminate any visible debris. The supernatant was collected as the SDS-insoluble fraction. These fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for Aβ using a mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody (6E10; Covance) as described previously (17Luheshi L.M. Tartaglia G.G. Brorsson A.C. Pawar A.P. Watson I.E. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Lomas D.A. Dobson C.M. Crowther D.C. Systematic in vivo analysis of the intrinsic determinants of amyloid β pathogenicity.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e290Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Protein aggregates in brain extracts from flies reared at 25 °C and collected 24 h after eclosion were detected using a filter retardation assay. Fifteen fly heads were homogenized in 60 μl of a 2% (w/v) SDS solution and sonicated for 8 min on ice. Samples were briefly centrifuged to pull down debris, and total protein concentration was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Equal amounts of protein for each sample were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a membrane, and probed with a β-actin antibody. The pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml DNase I and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.11-μm pore size) using a 96-well dot blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Once the samples had passed through the membrane under vacuum, the membranes were removed from the apparatus and boiled for 5 min in PBS and incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% (w/v) milk in PBS with 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. The immunodetection of Aβ peptides was then performed as described previously (17Luheshi L.M. Tartaglia G.G. Brorsson A.C. Pawar A.P. Watson I.E. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Lomas D.A. Dobson C.M. Crowther D.C. Systematic in vivo analysis of the intrinsic determinants of amyloid β pathogenicity.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e290Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The signal intensity of each spot was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (distributed by National Institutes of Health) and normalized to the intensity of the corresponding β-actin band from the immunoblotted SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using ANOVA followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Flies expressing Aβ variants were crossed with the elavc155-GAL4 driver line. From the progeny, 100 mated female flies were collected on the day of eclosion, and their longevity was analyzed as described previously (29Crowther D.C. Kinghorn K.J. Miranda E. Page R. Curry J.A.

Intraneuronal Aβ, non-amyloid aggregates and neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease.Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Differences in survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier survival plots and log-rank analysis (GraphPad Prism). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Fly brains were dissected from adult flies expressing tandem Aβ peptides under the control of GMR-GAL4 24 h after eclosion and immunostained with the mouse anti-Aβ antibody 6E10 as described previously (17Luheshi L.M. Tartaglia G.G. Brorsson A.C. Pawar A.P. Watson I.E. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Lomas D.A. Dobson C.M. Crowther D.C. Systematic in vivo analysis of the intrinsic determinants of amyloid β pathogenicity.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e290Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Confocal scanning images were collected using identical acquisition parameters at intervals of 5 μm using a Nikon Eclipse C1si on Nikon E90i upright stand (Nikon Corporation) with a 20× objective. Images were projected and processed using ImageJ software. We designed tandem Aβ constructs in which two copies of the Aβ monomer were linked together by a 12-amino acid linker (T12Aβ; Fig. 1A, ii and iv). The length and glycine-rich composition of this linker peptide were designed to provide sufficient flexibility to allow the individual Aβ peptides to adopt a wide range of conformations. This objective is achieved while still significantly reducing the entropic barrier associated with aggregate formation for the two Aβ sequences within the tandem construct compared with two freely diffusing monomeric Aβ molecules. Identical sets of tandem constructs were made for Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides (Fig. 1A, T12Aβ40 and T12Aβ42). To determine the effects on aggregation in vivo of linking pairs of Aβ peptides together, we generated transgenic Drosophila in which either the tandem Aβ40 or the tandem Aβ42 construct was inserted into an identical genomic locus; controls were also generated in which single copies of the monomeric Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides were inserted into the same genomic locus. The use of a single defined genomic locus for insertion of all transgenes ensures that levels of transcription of each transgene are comparable by minimizing variability in expression arising from the different genomic context of transgenes inserted in different locations. We tested the efficacy of this approach by comparing the transcript levels, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, for flies expressing either Aβ40 or Aβ42 inserted in the same genomic locus. There was no significant difference in their levels of expression. (supplemental Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods) (15Bischof J. Maeda R.K. Hediger M. Karch F. Basler K.

Retinal expression of a single tandem Aβ peptide transgene or of two transgenes of the monomeric counterparts was achieved using the GMR-GAL4 driver, and total head homogenates were prepared to analyze the extent of Aβ aggregation in each case. Aβ aggregates were quantified by a filter retardation assay. Both T12Aβ40 and T12Aβ42 formed significant quantities of large, insoluble deposits in the fly head (Fig. 1B) as measured by this assay. By contrast, nontransgenic flies (Fig. 1B, 51D) did not contain detectable levels of such mature SDS-insoluble aggregates, although a very low level of nonspecific binding of the antibody to the insoluble material from these flies was observed. Immunohistochemical staining of the fly brains confirmed the presence of discrete aggregates for both tandem peptides, although their appearances differed somewhat, being more clearly punctate in flies expressing T12Aβ42 compared with T12Aβ40 (Fig. 1C). Dissolution of SDS-insoluble material in 80% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting confirmed that aggregation of the tandem peptides is increased very significantly compared with the corresponding monomeric peptides. Both T12Aβ40 and T12Aβ42 generated abundant SDS-insoluble aggregates (Fig. 1D, T12Aβ40 and T12Aβ42), whereas the negative control (i.e. Fig. 1D, 51D) along with the corresponding monomeric Aβ peptides, whether expressed from one (Fig. 1D, Aβ40 and Aβ42) or two (Fig. 1D, Aβ40/Aβ40 and Aβ42/Aβ42) copies of the respective transgenes failed to generate a signal on the Western blot. Whereas the single dominant band on the Western blot for both tandem species indicates that the SDS-insoluble aggregates were largely dissociated from monomeric peptides by treatment with 80% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, interestingly T12Aβ42 was found to have retained some residual supramolecular structure. Whereas joining two copies of the Aβ peptide by a linker sequence increases the effective concentration of the Aβ peptides, too short a linker may create steric barriers to the formation of optimally stable aggregates, and, conversely, too long a linker will reduce the favorable entropic factors promoting faster aggregation (14Wright C.F. Teichmann S.A. Clarke J. Dobson C.M. The importance of sequence diversity in the aggregation and evolution of proteins.Nature. 2005; 438: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To investigate further the interplay between these different factors, we proceeded to generate tandem dimeric Aβ peptides in which the linker between the two Aβ sequences was either removed (TNLAβ) or extended to 22 amino acids (T22Aβ). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting we found that all of the dimer constructs, when expressed using the GMR-GAL4 driver, generated abundant SDS-insoluble aggregates (Fig. 2). This finding indicates that in all cases the tethering of two copies of Aβ peptides increases the rate of formation of insoluble aggregates. Material from flies expressing T22Aβ42 was not completely disaggregated to monomeric peptides but generated a ladder of bands on the Western blot; similar bands were not detectable for any tandem Aβ40 constructs. Aggregation-prone Aβ peptides may cause developmental neurotoxicity in the Drosophila eye when their expression is driven by GMR-GAL4. We therefore compared the severity of the rough eye phenotype elicited by expression of the tandem Aβ peptides with the results from the corresponding monomeric Aβ peptides. The retinal expression of two copies of the monomeric Aβ40 or Aβ42 transgenes yields flies with eyes that are normal and comparable with nontransgenic controls (Fig. 3A, vii–ix). However, T12Aβ42 expression in the retina causes severe eye malformation with loss of the ommatidial arrays and the appearance of melanized patches of necrotic tissue (Fig. 3A, v). This severe rough eye phenotype is also observed upon expression of T22Aβ42 (Fig. 3A, vi) but is notably less severe upon expression of TNLAβ42 (Fig. 3A, iv). By contrast, expression of tandem Aβ40 in the retina does not result in a detectable rough eye phenotype regardless of linker length (Fig. 3A, i–iii) and despite the accumulation of insoluble material (Fig. 2). A quantitative measure of the toxic effects of tandem Aβ peptides in the adult CNS was provided by determining the longevity of flies expressing transgenes driven by the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 construct. Concordant with the eye phenotypes described above, flies expressing a single copy of the T12Aβ42 construct (Fig. 4A, red line) have a significantly shorter lifespan compared with controls expressing two transgenes (Fig. 4A, blue line) of the unlinked Aβ42 (median survival 6 days versus 19 days, n = 100 for both genotypes, p < 0.0001). Likewise, T22Aβ42 expression in the brain causes a further reduction in longevity (Fig. 4A, green line). Moreover, the longevity assay revealed significant neurotoxicity for the TNLAβ42 (Fig. 4A, yellow line, median survival 23 days versus 35 days for the unlinked Aβ42/Aβ42 control, n = 100 for both genotypes, p < 0.0001). Despite the deposition of insoluble aggregates, however, the expression of all the tandem Aβ40 constructs was compatible with a normal lifespan, and equivalent, within experimental error, to that of control flies (Fig. 4B). Thus, longevity assays show that whereas the existence of both 12- and 22-residue linker peptides accelerates the formation of insoluble aggregates for both Aβ42 and Aβ40, high levels of neurotoxicity are evident only for the Aβ42 peptides. Although we have shown previously that the systematic introduction of single amino acid substitutions reveals correlations between the intrinsic aggregation rate and toxicity of the Aβ sequence, an increase in the overall aggregation propensity does not always result in a corresponding increase in in vivo neurotoxicity (17Luheshi L.M. Tartaglia G.G. Brorsson A.C. Pawar A.P. Watson I.E. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Lomas D.A. Dobson C.M. Crowther D.C.

Rather, such toxicity has been found to correlate more strongly with the formation of prefibrillar oligomeric aggregates leading to the conclusion, in accord with other studies, that it is these species that are likely to be particularly damaging to neuronal cells (18Lesné S.

To investigate the levels of soluble, oligomeric aggregates of Aβ we prepared extracts of SDS-soluble proteins from fly heads and visualized the species present using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. When we expressed peptides in the neuronal tissue of the retina we observed abundant SDS-soluble oligomeric Aβ aggregates for tandem Aβ42 constructs containing linker peptides. Importantly, we observed a correlation between the abundance of such SDS-soluble aggregates and the severity of the rough eye phenotypes when the constructs were expressed in the retina. Likewise, quantification of these retinal SDS-soluble aggregates correlated with the reduction in median survival when the same constructs were expressed throughout the brain. No such SDS-soluble aggregates were detected in flies expressing any of the Aβ40 constructs and were likewise absent for both TNLAβ peptides. Quantification of the SDS-soluble Aβ aggregates demonstrated a remarkably close logarithmic correlation (R2 = 0.98) between the abundance of these oligomeric Aβ42 aggregates in the retinal tissue and the relative decrease in median survival of flies with these constructs expressed in the brain. These data strongly suggest that the observed neurotoxic effect of Aβ in Drosophila is caused by soluble oligomeric species rather than by insoluble aggregates. In this study we have created tandem dimers of the most common forms of the AD-related Aβ peptide, Aβ40 and Aβ42, in which two copies of the peptide are conjoined head-to-tail by a flexible linker of varying length, and we have expressed them in neuronal tissues of D. melanogaster. We found that the deposition of insoluble aggregates of these dimeric peptides in neuronal tissue is substantially increased compared with equivalent concentrations of their monomeric counterparts. This finding is consistent with in vitro studies undertaken previously on two model protein aggregation systems, the SH3 domain of PI3 kinase and an immunoglobulin domain of cardiac titin (13Bader R. Bamford R. Zurdo J. Luisi B.F. Dobson C.M.

The importance of sequence diversity in the aggregation and evolution of proteins.Nature. 2005; 438: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) in which such repeat sequences were found to aggregate much more rapidly than the monomeric species; such a result can be attributed to an increase of approximately 1 order of magnitude in the effective concentration that is engendered by the covalent linkage of two peptides (13Bader R. Bamford R. Zurdo J. Luisi B.F. Dobson C.M. Probing the mechanism of amyloidogenesis through a tandem repeat of the PI3-SH3 domain suggests a generic model for protein aggregation and fibril formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the propensity of Aβ42 dimers to populate soluble oligomeric species is significantly greater than that of Aβ40 dimers, indicating that their mechanisms of aggregation may differ significantly in vivo, or alternatively that the peptides have different intrinsic stabilities and thus are present at differing concentrations in the cell. Furthermore, it is the appearance of these soluble oligomeric aggregates, rather than the level of insoluble aggregates, that is associated with high levels of neurotoxicity in our Drosophila model. The detection of stable soluble oligomers of dimeric Aβ42 but not dimeric Aβ40 is consistent with recent observations from another in vitro study in which these two peptides, when constrained by an intramolecular disulfide bond (Aβcc peptides), were found to aggregate via different pathways, resulting in very different propensities to populate stable oligomers and protofibrils (23Sandberg A. Luheshi L.M. Sollvander S. Pereira de Barros T. Macao B. Knowles T.P. Biverstal H. Lendel C. Ekholm-Petterson F. Dubnovitsky A. Lannfelt L. Dobson C.M. Hard T. Stabilization of neurotoxic Alzheimer amyloid β oligomers by protein engineering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15595-15600Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this case, Aβ42cc was observed to be more prone to form oligomers and larger protofibrils rich in β-sheet content than Aβ40cc and to be more neurotoxic than its more disordered counterparts. Two other recent studies that have linked Aβ40 peptides either by cysteine substitution at position Ser-26 or at the N or C terminus have also reached similar conclusions (24O'Nuallain B. Freir D.B. Nicoll A.J. Risse E. Ferguson N. Herron C.E. Collinge J. Walsh D.M. Amyloid β protein dimers rapidly form stable synaptotoxic protofibrils.J.

A disulfide-linked amyloid-β peptide dimer forms a protofibril-like oligomer through a distinct pathway from amyloid fibril formation.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 7100-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the differential ability of Aβ40 and Aβ42 dimers to populate stable oligomeric states observed in vivo in the present study is likely to reflect underlying differences in the kinetics of specific steps in their aggregation mechanisms. A particularly clear finding of the present study is that although Aβ aggregation is required for neurotoxicity, it is clearly not sufficient. This conclusion is evident from the finding that the retinal expression of all the dimeric Aβ40 constructs failed to generate any detectable developmental eye abnormalities despite their significantly accelerated aggregation, compared with monomeric Aβ40, in the eye. To confirm these findings in the eye we then used the more quantitative approach of longevity analysis to measure the consequences of ubiquitous expression of the peptide constructs in the nervous system. All Aβ40 constructs were found to have negligible effects on longevity whereas all of the tandem Aβ42 peptides significantly reduced median survival. Moreover, as determined by the rough eye and longevity phenotypes, the degree of neurotoxicity observed is dependent on the length of the linker peptides; the tandem Aβ42 constructs containing linker peptides are clearly more toxic than those without a linker sequence, and longer linkers were found to result in more severe phenotypes than shorter linkers. Moreover, the fractional reduction in fly longevity was observed to be proportional to the abundance of oligomeric aggregates for each of the tandem Aβ42 constructs. Whereas the most neurotoxic conformations are denied to tandem repeats of Aβ42 in the absence of a linker peptide, presumably because of steric factors, our data indicate that longer linker peptides allow the greater flexibility required to generate stable, neurotoxic, oligomeric aggregates. In the present study the distinction between Aβ deposition in vivo and toxicity is consistent with the observation that many elderly humans are able to accumulate large numbers of β-amyloid plaques in their brains without suffering significant clinical consequences (26Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease: progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10962) Google Scholar). The comparable flies are those expressing tandem Aβ40, where abundant Aβ deposition may occur in the brain without neurotoxic consequences. Our data are consistent with the view that genetic or environmental factors that destabilize oligomeric prefibrillar aggregates, relative to either the monomeric or fibrillar forms of the peptide, could protect the brain in elderly individuals despite ongoing plaque formation. The detailed characterization of the variety and proportions of aggregates formed in vivo will, therefore, be essential to understand their specific proteotoxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the aggregation process for Aβ42, as the peptide undergoes transitions in vivo that convert it from a soluble monomeric state to insoluble amyloid deposits, involves the relatively high population of a variety of misfolded oligomeric species that are particularly toxic. This accumulation of prefibrillar intermediates may be attributable to the magnitude of the energy barriers that trap such species in local energy minima on the energy landscape that describes the aggregation process, or to the other differences in the relative importance of the various microscopic processes that contribute to the overall aggregation reaction (4Knowles T.P. Waudby C.A. Devlin G.L. Cohen S.I. Aguzzi A. Vendruscolo M. Terentjev E.M. Welland M.E. Dobson C.M. An analytical solution to the kinetics of breakable filament assembly.Science. 2009; 326: 1533-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the aggregation process for Aβ40, however, appears to progress more rapidly to mature forms of aggregate without populating such intermediate states to an extent detectable in vivo. This observation is consistent with recent studies of Aβ40 in vitro that show clearly that oligomeric species formed during aggregation are able to be rapidly sequestered by molecular chaperones (27Narayan P. Orte A. Clarke R.W. Bolognesi B. Hook S. Ganzinger K.A. Meehan S. Wilson M.R. Dobson C.M. Klenerman D. The extracellular chaperone clusterin sequesters oligomeric forms of the amyloid-β1–40 peptide.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 79-83Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the toxic effects of the lower levels Aβ40 oligomers relative to those of Aβ42 can be more effectively suppressed by the inherent protective mechanisms present in vivo. In any case, the results of this paper suggest that therapeutic advantage could be gained not only by increasing the barrier to initial peptide aggregation but also by facilitating the progression of Aβ42 oligomers toward the more inert fibrillar state.

Bacteriovorax are halophilic prokaryotes that prey on susceptible gram-negative bacteria. We recently reported novel observations on the differential selection of Bacteriovorax phylotypes by two different prey, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus. However, the conclusion is restricted by the limited number of prey tested. In this study, we have conducted two independent investigations involving eight species of prey bacteria while using V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolytics as reference strains. Water samples collected from Dry Bar, Apalachicola Bay were used to establish microcosms which were respectively spiked with prey strains Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida to examine the response of native Bacteriovorax to freshwater bacteria. Indigenous Vibrio sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., Photobacterium sp. and a clinical strain of V. vulnificus were also tested for the impact of saltwater prey on the Bacteriovorax community. At 24 hour intervals, optical density of the microcosm samples and the abundance of Bacteriovorax were measured over five days. The predominant Bacteriovorax plaques were selected and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. In addition, the impacts of prey on predator population and bacterial community composition were investigated using culture independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Strikingly, Cluster IV was found consistently as the predominant phylotype produced by the freshwater prey. For all saltwater prey, subgroups of Bacteriovorax phylotype IX were the major predators recovered. The results suggest that prey is an important factor along with temperature, salinity and other environmental parameters in shaping Bacteriovorax communities in aquatic systems."

For this reason much research in the area of face perception has employed stimuli without hair. To investigate the effect of the presence of hair we used faces with and without hair in a recognition task. Participants took part in trials in which the state of the hair either remained consistent (Same) or switched between learning and test (Switch). It was found that in the Same trials performance did not differ for stimuli presented with and without hair. This implies that there is sufficient information in the internal features of the face for optimal performance in this task. It was also found that performance in the Switch trials was substantially lower than in the Same trials. This drop in accuracy when the stimuli were switched suggests that faces are represented in a holistic manner and that manipulation of the hair causes disruption to this, with implications for the interpretation of some previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W2004688501,"Previous studies revealed a significant production of inflammatory cytokines together with severe thymic atrophy and thymocyte migratory disturbances during experimental Chagas disease. Migratory activity of thymocytes and mature T cells seem to be finely tuned by cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Systemic TNF-α is enhanced during infection and appears to be crucial in the response against the parasite. However, it also seems to be involved in disease pathology, since it is implicated in the arrival of T cells to effector sites, including the myocardium. Herein, we analyzed the role of TNF-α in the migratory activity of thymocytes in Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) acutely-infected mice. We found increased expression and deposition of TNF-α in the thymus of infected animals compared to controls, accompanied by increased co-localization of fibronectin, a cell migration-related ECM molecule, whose contents in the thymus of infected mice is also augmented. In-vivo studies showed an enhanced export of thymocytes in T. cruzi-infected mice, as ascertained by intrathymic injection of FITC alone or in combination with TNF-α. The increase of immature CD4+CD8+ T cells in secondary lymphoid organs was even more clear-cut when TNF-α was co-injected with FITC. Ex-vivo transmigration assays also revealed higher number of migrating cells when TNF-α was added onto fibronectin lattices, with higher input of all thymocyte subsets, including immature CD4+CD8+. Infected animals also exhibit enhanced levels of expression of both mRNA TNF-α receptors in the CD4+CD8+ subpopulation. Our findings suggest that in T. cruzi acute infection, when TNF-α is complexed with fibronectin, it favours the altered migration of thymocytes, promoting the release of mature and immature T cells to different compartments of the immune system. Conceptually, this work reinforces the notion that thymocyte migration is a multivectorial biological event in health and disease, and that TNF-α is a further player in the process."

Our objective was to determine risk factors associated with the acquisition of ERE in hospitalized patients; to assess associated patient outcomes; and to describe the molecular characteristics of ERE.A retrospective case-case-control study was conducted in 2009 at a tertiary care hospital. Hospitalized patients with ERE and those with ertapenem-sensitive Enterobacteriaceae (ESE) were compared with a common control group consisting of patients with no prior gram-negative infections. Risk factors analyzed included demographics; co-morbidities; instrumentation and antibiotic exposures. Two parallel multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify independent variables associated with ERE and ESE acquisition respectively. Clinical outcomes were compared between ERE and ESE patients.Twenty-nine ERE cases, 29 ESE cases and 87 controls were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression showed that previous hospitalization (Odds ratio [OR], 10.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.19-49.20) and duration of fluoroquinolones exposure (OR, 1.18 per day increase; 95% CI, 1.05-1.34) were unique independent predictors for acquiring ERE. Duration of 4(th)-generation cephalosporin exposure was found to predict for ESE acquisition (OR, 1.63 per day increase; 95% CI, 1.05-2.54). In-hospital mortality rates and clinical response rates were significantly different between ERE and ESE groups, however ERE infection was not a predictor of mortality. ERE isolates were clonally distinct. Ertapenem resistance was likely to be mediated by the presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases or plasmid-borne AmpC in combination with impermeability due to porin loss and/or efflux pumps.Prior hospitalization and duration of fluoroquinolone treatment were predictors of ERE acquisition. ERE infections were associated with higher mortality rates and poorer clinical response rates when compared to ESE infections."

https://openalex.org/W2044519683,"Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum is regulated by transcriptional switches among members of the var gene family, each expressed in a mutually exclusive manner and encoding a different variant of the surface antigens collectively named PfEMP1. Antigenic switching starts when the first merozoites egress from the liver and begin their asexual proliferation within red blood cells. By erasing the epigenetic memory we created parasites with no var background, similar to merozoites that egress from the liver where no var gene is expressed. Creating a null-var background enabled us to investigate the onset of antigenic switches at the early phase of infection. At the onset of switching, var transcription pattern is heterogeneous with numerous genes transcribed at low levels including upsA vars, a subtype that was implicated in severe malaria, which are rarely activated in growing cultures. Analysis of subsequent in vitro switches shows that the probability of a gene to turn on or off is not associated with its chromosomal position or promoter type per se but on intrinsic properties of each gene. We concluded that var switching is determined by gene specific associated switch rates rather than general promoter type or locus associated switch rates. In addition, we show that fine tuned reduction in var transcription increases their switch rate, indicating that transcriptional perturbation can alter antigenic switching."
https://openalex.org/W2084545149,"The yeast Shu complex, consisting of the proteins Shu1, Shu2, Psy3, and Csm2, maintains genomic stability by coupling post-replication repair to homologous recombination. However, a lack of biochemical and structural information on the Shu proteins precludes revealing their precise roles within the pathway. Here, we report on the 1.9-Å crystal structure of the Psy3-Csm2 complex. The crystal structure shows that Psy3 forms a heterodimer with Csm2 mainly through a hydrophobic core. Unexpectedly, Psy3 and Csm2 share a similar architecture that closely resembles the ATPase core domain of Rad51. The L2 loop present in Psy3 and Csm2 is similar to that of Rad51 and confers the DNA binding activity of the Shu complex. As with Rad51, the Shu complex appears to form a nucleoprotein filament by binding nonspecifically to DNA. Structure-based mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of the Shu complex is essential for repair of the methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage. Our findings provide good foundations for the understanding of the Srs2 regulation by the Shu complex."
https://openalex.org/W2040750333,"The lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) is one of the most destructive insect pests of stored grain. This pest has been controlled successfully by fumigation with phosphine for the last several decades, though strong resistance to phosphine in many countries has raised concern about the long term usefulness of this control method. Previous genetic analysis of strongly resistant (SR) R. dominica from three widely geographically dispersed regions of Australia, Queensland (SR(QLD)), New South Wales (SR(NSW)) and South Australia (SR(SA)), revealed a resistance allele in the rph1 gene in all three strains. The present study confirms that the rph1 gene contributes to resistance in a fourth strongly resistant strain, SR2(QLD), also from Queensland. The previously described rph2 gene, which interacts synergistically with rph1 gene, confers strong resistance on SR(QLD) and SR(NSW). We now provide strong circumstantial evidence that weak alleles of rph2, together with rph1, contribute to the strong resistance phenotypes of SR(SA) and SR2(QLD). To test the notion that rph1 and rph2 are solely responsible for the strong resistance phenotype of all resistant R. dominica, we created a strain derived by hybridising the four strongly resistant lines. Following repeated selection for survival at extreme rates of phosphine exposure, we found only slightly enhanced resistance. This suggests that a single sequence of genetic changes was responsible for the development of resistance in these insects."
https://openalex.org/W2044530708,"TIF1γ (Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 γ) has been implicated in Smad-dependent signaling by Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β). Paradoxically, TIF1γ functions both as a transcriptional repressor or as an alternative transcription factor that promotes TGF-β signaling. Using ordinary differential-equation models, we have investigated the effect of TIF1γ on the dynamics of TGF-β signaling. An integrative model that includes the formation of transient TIF1γ-Smad2-Smad4 ternary complexes is the only one that can account for TGF-β signaling compatible with the different observations reported for TIF1γ. In addition, our model predicts that varying TIF1γ/Smad4 ratios play a critical role in the modulation of the transcriptional signal induced by TGF-β, especially for short stimulation times that mediate higher threshold responses. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and quantification of the expression of TGF-β target genes as a function TIF1γ/Smad4 ratios fully validate this hypothesis. Our integrative model, which successfully unifies the seemingly opposite roles of TIF1γ, also reveals how changing TIF1γ/Smad4 ratios affect the cellular response to stimulation by TGF-β, accounting for a highly graded determination of cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1973281035,"Osteoclasts are essential for bone dynamics and calcium homeostasis. Recently, we reported that serum calcium-decreasing factor, caldecrin, which is a secretory-type serine protease isolated from the pancreas, inhibits osteoclast differentiation by suppression of NFATc1 activity regardless of its own protease activity (Hasegawa, H., Kido, S., Tomomura, M., Fujimoto, K., Ohi, M., Kiyomura, M., Kanegae, H., Inaba, A., Sakagami, H., and Tomomura, A. (2010) Serum calcium-decreasing factor, caldecrin, inhibits osteoclast differentiation by suppression of NFATc1 activity. J. Biol. Chem. 285, 25448-25457). Here, we investigated the effects of caldecrin on the function of mature osteoclasts by treatment with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). Caldecrin inhibited the RANKL-stimulated bone resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts. Furthermore, caldecrin inhibited RANKL-mediated sealing actin ring formation, which is associated with RANKL-evoked Ca(2+) entry through transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 4. The inhibitors of phospholipase Cγ, Syk, and c-Src suppressed RANKL-evoked Ca(2+) entry and actin ring formation of mature osteoclasts. Interestingly, caldecrin significantly inhibited RANKL-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Src, Syk, phospholipase Cγ1 and Cγ2, SLP-76, and Pyk2 but not that of ERK, JNK, or Akt. Caldecrin inhibited RANKL-stimulated c-Src kinase activity and c-Src·Syk association. These results suggest that caldecrin inhibits RANKL-stimulated calcium signaling activation and cytoskeletal organization by suppression of the c-Src·Syk pathway, which may in turn reduce the bone resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts. Thus, caldecrin is capable of acting as a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function of bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W2043430736,"MutM, a bacterial DNA-glycosylase, plays a critical role in maintaining genome integrity by catalyzing glycosidic bond cleavage of 8-oxoguanine (oxoG) lesions to initiate base excision DNA repair. The task faced by MutM of locating rare oxoG residues embedded in an overwhelming excess of undamaged bases is especially challenging given the close structural similarity between oxoG and its normal progenitor, guanine (G). MutM actively interrogates the DNA to detect the presence of an intrahelical, fully base-paired oxoG, whereupon the enzyme promotes extrusion of the target nucleobase from the DNA duplex and insertion into the extrahelical active site. Recent structural studies have begun to provide the first glimpse into the protein-DNA interactions that enable MutM to distinguish an intrahelical oxoG from G; however, these initial studies left open the important question of how MutM can recognize oxoG residues embedded in 16 different neighboring sequence contexts (considering only the 5'- and 3'-neighboring base pairs). In this study we set out to understand the manner and extent to which intrahelical lesion recognition varies as a function of the 5'-neighbor. Here we report a comprehensive, systematic structural analysis of the effect of the 5'-neighboring base pair on recognition of an intrahelical oxoG lesion. These structures reveal that MutM imposes the same extrusion-prone (""extrudogenic"") backbone conformation on the oxoG lesion irrespective of its 5'-neighbor while leaving the rest of the DNA relatively free to adjust to the particular demands of individual sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2057658173,"Meningococcal factor H binding protein (fHbp) is a promising vaccine candidate. Anti-fHbp antibodies can bind to meningococci and elicit complement-mediated bactericidal activity directly. The antibodies also can block binding of the human complement down-regulator, factor H (fH). Without bound fH, the organism would be expected to have increased susceptibility to bacteriolysis. Here we describe bactericidal activity of two anti-fHbp mAbs with overlapping epitopes in relation to their different effects on fH binding and bactericidal activity.Both mAbs recognized prevalent fHbp sequence variants in variant group 1. Using yeast display and site-specific mutagenesis, binding of one of the mAbs (JAR 1, IgG3) to fHbp was eliminated by a single amino acid substitution, R204A, and was decreased by K143A but not by R204H or D142A. The JAR 1 epitope overlapped that of previously described mAb (mAb502, IgG2a) whose binding to fHbp was eliminated by R204A or R204H substitutions, and was decreased by D142A but not by K143A. Although JAR 1 and mAb502 appeared to have overlapping epitopes, only JAR 1 inhibited binding of fH to fHbp and had human complement-mediated bactericidal activity. mAb502 enhanced fH binding and lacked human complement-mediated bactericidal activity. To control for confounding effects of different mouse IgG subclasses on complement activation, we created chimeric mAbs in which the mouse mAb502 or JAR 1 paratopes were paired with human IgG1 constant regions. While both chimeric mAbs showed similar binding to fHbp, only JAR 1, which inhibited fH binding, had human complement-mediated bactericidal activity.The lack of human complement-mediated bactericidal activity by anti-fHbp mAb502 appeared to result from an inability to inhibit binding of fH. These results underscore the importance of inhibition of fH binding for anti-fHbp mAb bactericidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2120796986,"""Hypomyelination and Congenital Cataract"", HCC (MIM #610532), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital cataract and diffuse cerebral and peripheral hypomyelination. HCC is caused by deficiency of Hyccin, a protein whose biological role has not been clarified yet. Since the identification of the cell types expressing a protein of unknown function can contribute to define the physiological context in which the molecule is explicating its function, we analyzed the pattern of Hyccin expression in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS). Using heterozygous mice expressing the b-galactosidase (LacZ) gene under control of the Hyccin gene regulatory elements, we show that the gene is primarily expressed in neuronal cells. Indeed, Hyccin-LacZ signal was identified in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, olfactory bulb, and cortical pyramidal neurons, while it did not colocalize with oligodendroglial or astrocytic markers. In the PNS, Hyccin was detectable only in axons isolated from newborn mice. In the brain, Hyccin transcript levels were higher in early postnatal development (postnatal days 2 and 10) and then declined in adult mice. In a model of active myelinogenesis, organotypic cultures of rat Schwann cells (SC)/Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, Hyccin was detected along the neurites, while it was absent from SC. Intriguingly, the abundance of the molecule was upregulated at postnatal days 10 and 15, in the initial steps of myelinogenesis and then declined at 30 days when the process is complete. As Hyccin is primarily expressed in neurons and its mutation leads to hypomyelination in human patients, we suggest that the protein is involved in neuron-to-glia signalling to initiate or maintain myelination."

Proteomics technology has been applied extensively to the study of the proteins involved in carcinogenesis. In this paper, a classification method was developed based on principal components of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) spectral data. This method was applied to SELDI spectral data from 71 lung adenocarcinoma patients and 24 healthy individuals. Unlike other peak-selection-based methods, this method takes each spectrum as a unity. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate that this unity-based classification method is more robust and powerful as a method of diagnosis than peak-selection-based methods. Results The results showed that this classification method, which is based on principal components, has outstanding performance with respect to distinguishing lung adenocarcinoma patients from normal individuals. Through leaving-one-out, 19-fold, 5-fold and 2-fold cross-validation studies, we found that this classification method based on principal components completely outperforms peak-selection-based methods, such as decision tree, classification and regression tree, support vector machine, and linear discriminant analysis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance The classification method based on principal components of SELDI spectral data is a robust and powerful means of diagnosing lung adenocarcinoma. We assert that the high efficiency of this classification method renders it feasible for large-scale clinical use."

In this study, we investigated the role of JWA in chemical carcinogenesis using conditional JWA knockout (JWA(Δ2/Δ2)) mice and two-stage model of skin carcinogenesis. Our results indicated that JWA(Δ2/Δ2) mice were resistant to the development of skin papillomas initiated by 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In JWA(Δ2/Δ2) mice, the induction of papilloma was delayed, and the tumor number and size were reduced. In primary keratinocytes from JWA(Δ2/Δ2) mice, DMBA exposure induced more intensive DNA damage, while TPA-promoted cell proliferation was reduced. The further mechanistic studies showed that JWA deficiency blocked TPA-induced activation of MAPKs and its downstream transcription factor Elk1 both in vitro and in vivo. JWA(Δ2/Δ2) mice are resistance to tumorigenesis induced by DMBA/TPA probably through inhibition of transcription factor Elk1 via MAPKs. These results highlight the importance of JWA in skin homeostasis and in the process of skin tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2016660890,"Nkx3.1 is a homeoprotein transcription factor (TF) that inhibits proliferation of prostate epithelial cells (PECs) and acts as a tumor suppressor for prostate cancer (PCa). Because TFs classically function within the cells that produce them, Nkx3.1-induced growth inhibition was considered to occur in a cell-autonomous manner. We, however, found that Nkx3.1 protein can be secreted from cultured PECs and is detectable in the prostatic fluid and urine. A PCa-related point mutation (T164A) abolished Nkx3.1 secretion. Amazingly, secreted Nkx3.1 protein can translocate into adjacent cells, bind to the regulatory sequence of Nkx3.1 target genes and impact the expression of these genes in these adjacent cells. Expression of Nkx3.1 in PECs can also affect gene expression in adjacent cells, and this effect is abolished by the T164A mutation. Nkx3.1 protein inhibits cell proliferation when added to the culture. Expression of Nkx3.1, not the T164A mutant, also inhibits the proliferation of co-cultured cells. These results indicate that Nkx3.1 functions as a ""para-transcription factor (PTF),"" with the ability to regulate genes and inhibit cell proliferation in a non-cell autonomous manner. We also demonstrate that Nkx3.1 contains an evolutionarily conserved protein transduction domain essential for its PTF function, implicating potentially common PTF function among homeoproteins. In addition to the PCa-related T164A mutant, the secreted Nkx3.1 is reduced drastically in the prostatic fluid and urine of mice with PCa. These results indicate that Nkx3.1 can function as a PTF to suppress PCa and the urinary Nkx3.1 may be a potential biomarker for PCa diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W1995393865,"Background Accumulated evidences indicate that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis related genes are associated with risk of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). COL18A1 encodes the precursor of endostatin, which is a broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor, and we speculate that SNPs in COL18A1 may be associated with susceptibility to HCC. Methods and Findings We carried out a 2-stage association study in 3 independent case-control groups in a total of 1067 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 808 hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC patients in Han Chinese. Four SNPs which can represent all potential functional SNPs with MAF>0.1 recorded in HapMap database were genotyped using TaqMan methods. Levels of total COL18A1 mRNA were also examined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. We found that rs7499 located in 3′-UTR to be strongly associated with HBV related HCC (Pcombined = 0.0000005, OR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.63–0.82). COL18A1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased as the disease progressed (P = 0.000026). Conclusion These findings indicate that COL18A1 rs7499 may contribute to the risk of HCC in Han Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2075786878,"Background When observers are asked to identify two targets in rapid sequence, they often suffer profound performance deficits for the second target, even when the spatial location of the targets is known. This attentional blink (AB) is usually attributed to the time required to process a previous target, implying that a link should exist between individual differences in information processing speed and the AB. Methodology/Principal Findings The present work investigated this question by examining the relationship between a rapid automatized naming task typically used to assess information-processing speed and the magnitude of the AB. The results indicated that faster processing actually resulted in a greater AB, but only when targets were presented amongst high similarity distractors. When target-distractor similarity was minimal, processing speed was unrelated to the AB. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that information-processing speed is unrelated to target processing efficiency per se, but rather to individual differences in observers' ability to suppress distractors. This is consistent with evidence that individuals who are able to avoid distraction are more efficient at deploying temporal attention, but argues against a direct link between general processing speed and efficient information selection."
https://openalex.org/W2079926432,"Introduction The aim of the study was to evaluate whether subject positioning would affect the measurement of raw body volume, thoracic gas volume, corrected body volume and the resulting percent body fat as assessed by air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Methods Twenty-five young adult men (20.7±1.1y, BMI = 22.5±1.4 kg/m2) were measured using the BOD POD® system using a measured thoracic gas volume sitting in a ‘forward bent’ position and sitting up in a straight position in random order. Results Raw body volume was 58±124 ml (p<0.05) higher in the ‘straight’ position compared to the ‘bent’ position. The mean difference in measured thoracic gas volume (bent-straight = −71±211 ml) was not statistically significant. Corrected body volume and percent body fat in the bent position consequently were on average 86±122 ml (p<0.05) and 0.5±0.7% (p<0.05) lower than in the straight position respectively. Conclusion Although the differences reached statistical significance, absolute differences are rather small. Subject positioning should be viewed as a factor that may contribute to between-test variability and hence contribute to (in)precision in detecting small individual changes in body composition, rather than a potential source of systematic bias. It therefore may be advisable to pay attention to standardizing subject positioning when tracking small changes in PF are of interest.The cause of the differences is shown not to be related to changes in the volume of isothermal air in the lungs. It is hypothesized and calculated that the observed direction and magnitude of these differences may arise from the surface area artifact which does not take into account that a subject in the bent position exposes more skin to the air in the device therefore potentially creating a larger underestimation of the actual body volume due to the isothermal effect of air close to the skin."
https://openalex.org/W2106331193,"The regulatory mechanisms underlying pulsatile secretion are complex, especially as it is partly controlled by other hormones and the combined action of multiple agents. Regulatory relations between hormones are not directly observable but may be deduced from time series measurements of plasma hormone concentrations. Variation in plasma hormone levels are the resultant of secretion and clearance from the circulation. A strategy is proposed to extract inhibition, activation, thresholds and circadian synchronicity from concentration data, using particular association methods. Time delayed associations between hormone concentrations and/or extracted secretion pulse profiles reveal the information on regulatory mechanisms. The above mentioned regulatory mechanisms are illustrated with simulated data. Additionally, data from a lean cohort of healthy control subjects is used to illustrate activation (ACTH and cortisol) and circadian synchronicity (ACTH and TSH) in real data. The simulation and the real data both consist of 145 equidistant samples per individual, matching a 24-hr time span with 10 minute intervals. The results of the simulation and the real data are in concordance."
https://openalex.org/W1992991076,"Dose constraints for traditional neural critical structures (e.g. optic chiasm, brain stem) are a standard component of planning radiation therapy to the central nervous system. Increasingly, investigators are becoming interested in accounting for the dose delivered to other non-target neural structures (e.g. hippocampi), which are not easily identified on axial imaging. In this pilot study, a commercially available digital atlas was used to identify cryptic neural structures (hippocampus, optic radiations, and visual cortices) in 6 patients who received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) as part of multimodal management of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The patient's original IMRT plans were re-optimized, with avoidance parameters for the newly identified critical structures. Re-optimization was able to reduce both mean and maximum dose to the volumes of interest, with a more pronounced effect for contralateral structures. Mean dose was reduced by 11% and 3% to contralateral and ipsilateral structures, respectively, with comparable reduction in maximum dose of 10% and 2%, respectively. Importantly, target coverage was not compromised, with an average change in coverage of 0.2%. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating tools for cryptic critical structure identification into the treatment planning process for GBM."
