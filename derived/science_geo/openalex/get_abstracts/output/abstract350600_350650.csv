https://openalex.org/W2087638855,"We developed a chemical route to produce graphene nanoribbons (GNR) with width below 10 nanometers, as well as single ribbons with varying widths along their lengths or containing lattice-defined graphene junctions for potential molecular electronics. The GNRs were solution-phase–derived, stably suspended in solvents with noncovalent polymer functionalization, and exhibited ultrasmooth edges with possibly well-defined zigzag or armchair-edge structures. Electrical transport experiments showed that, unlike single-walled carbon nanotubes, all of the sub–10-nanometer GNRs produced were semiconductors and afforded graphene field effect transistors with on-off ratios of about 10 7 at room temperature."

This synthetic genome, named M. genitalium JCVI-1.0, contains all the genes of wild-type M. genitalium G37 except MG408, which was disrupted by an antibiotic marker to block pathogenicity and to allow for selection. To identify the genome as synthetic, we inserted “watermarks” at intergenic sites known to tolerate transposon insertions. Overlapping “cassettes” of 5 to 7 kilobases (kb), assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, were joined by in vitro recombination to produce intermediate assemblies of approximately 24 kb, 72 kb (“1/8 genome”), and 144 kb (“1/4 genome”), which were all cloned as bacterial artificial chromosomes in Escherichia coli . Most of these intermediate clones were sequenced, and clones of all four 1/4 genomes with the correct sequence were identified. The complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , then isolated and sequenced. A clone with the correct sequence was identified. The methods described here will be generally useful for constructing large DNA molecules from chemically synthesized pieces and also from combinations of natural and synthetic DNA segments."
https://openalex.org/W1991883784,"Many developmental processes in plants are regulated jointly by light and by the gibberellins, yet the molecular basis of cross-talk between the two is not fully understood. Two groups now report results that reveal a signalling cascade that contributes to coordinated plant growth regulation by light and gibberellins. In the absence of gibberellins, DELLA proteins inhibit the binding of the transcription factor PIF3 (a phytochrome-interacting protein) to gene promoters. Gibberellins trigger the degradation of DELLA proteins, thereby allowing PIFs to bind to their target promoters and regulate gene expression. Light acts via a photoreceptor to destabilize PIF4. Thus the DELLA proteins, and competitive interactions between members of the PIF family, appear to key components linking light to the gibberellins. Light and gibberellins (GA) regulate multiple aspects of plant development, and this paper is one of two studies that provide molecular insights into the connection between these pathways. Without GA, DELLA proteins (GA-signalling repressors) interact with PIFs (phytochrome-interacting proteins) and inhibit their binding to gene promoters. GA triggers degradation of DELLA proteins, thereby allowing PIFs to bind to their target promoters and regulate gene expression. These results reveal a signalling cascade that contributes to coordinated plant growth regulation by light and gibberellins. Cell elongation during seedling development is antagonistically regulated by light and gibberellins (GAs)1,2. Light induces photomorphogenesis, leading to inhibition of hypocotyl growth, whereas GAs promote etiolated growth, characterized by increased hypocotyl elongation. The mechanism underlying this antagonistic interaction remains unclear. Here we report on the central role of the Arabidopsis thaliana nuclear transcription factor PIF4 (encoded by PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4)3 in the positive control of genes mediating cell elongation and show that this factor is negatively regulated by the light photoreceptor phyB (ref. 4) and by DELLA proteins that have a key repressor function in GA signalling5. Our results demonstrate that PIF4 is destabilized by phyB in the light and that DELLAs block PIF4 transcriptional activity by binding the DNA-recognition domain of this factor. We show that GAs abrogate such repression by promoting DELLA destabilization, and therefore cause a concomitant accumulation of free PIF4 in the nucleus. Consistent with this model, intermediate hypocotyl lengths were observed in transgenic plants over-accumulating both DELLAs and PIF4. Destabilization of this factor by phyB, together with its inactivation by DELLAs, constitutes a protein interaction framework that explains how plants integrate both light and GA signals to optimize growth and development in response to changing environments."

These results reveal a signalling cascade that contributes to coordinated plant growth regulation by light and gibberellins. Light and gibberellins (GAs) mediate many essential and partially overlapping plant developmental processes. DELLA proteins are GA-signalling repressors that block GA-induced development1. GA induces degradation of DELLA proteins via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway2, but light promotes accumulation of DELLA proteins by reducing GA levels3. It was proposed that DELLA proteins restrain plant growth largely through their effect on gene expression4,5. However, the precise mechanism of their function in coordinating GA signalling and gene expression remains unknown. Here we characterize a nuclear protein interaction cascade mediating transduction of GA signals to the activity regulation of a light-responsive transcription factor. In the absence of GA, nuclear-localized DELLA proteins accumulate to higher levels, interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 (PIF3, a bHLH-type transcription factor) and prevent PIF3 from binding to its target gene promoters and regulating gene expression, and therefore abrogate PIF3-mediated light control of hypocotyl elongation. In the presence of GA, GID1 proteins (GA receptors) elevate their direct interaction with DELLA proteins in the nucleus, trigger DELLA protein’s ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, and thus release PIF3 from the negative effect of DELLA proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2019703934,"Although commensalism with gut microbiota exists in all metazoans, the host factors that maintain this homeostatic relationship remain largely unknown. We show that the intestinal homeobox gene Caudal regulates the commensal-gut mutualism by repressing nuclear factor kappa B–dependent antimicrobial peptide genes. Inhibition of Caudal expression in flies via RNA interference led to overexpression of antimicrobial peptides, which in turn altered the commensal population within the intestine. In particular, the dominance of one gut microbe, Gluconobacter sp. strain EW707, eventually led to gut cell apoptosis and host mortality. However, restoration of a healthy microbiota community and normal host survival in the Caudal-RNAi flies was achieved by reintroduction of the Caudal gene. These results reveal that a specific genetic deficiency within a host can profoundly influence the gut commensal microbial community and host physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1997595402,"The hippocampus is an area of the brain involved in learning and memory. It contains parallel excitatory pathways referred to as the trisynaptic pathway (which carries information as follows: entorhinal cortex --> dentate gyrus --> CA3 --> CA1 --> entorhinal cortex) and the monosynaptic pathway (entorhinal cortex --> CA1 --> entorhinal cortex). We developed a generally applicable tetanus toxin-based method for transgenic mice that permits inducible and reversible inhibition of synaptic transmission and applied it to the trisynaptic pathway while preserving transmission in the monosynaptic pathway. We found that synaptic output from CA3 in the trisynaptic pathway is dispensable and the short monosynaptic pathway is sufficient for incremental spatial learning. In contrast, the full trisynaptic pathway containing CA3 is required for rapid one-trial contextual learning, for pattern completion-based memory recall, and for spatial tuning of CA1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2027123328,"Plant respiratory burst oxidase homolog (rboh) proteins, which are homologous to the mammalian 91-kDa glycoprotein subunit of the phagocyte oxidase (gp91phox) or NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), have been implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) both in stress responses and during development. Unlike mammalian gp91phox/NOX2 protein, plant rboh proteins have hydrophilic N-terminal regions containing two EF-hand motifs, suggesting that their activation is dependent on Ca2+. However, the significance of Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand motifs on ROS production has been unclear. By employing a heterologous expression system, we showed that ROS production by Arabidopsis thaliana rbohD (AtrbohD) was induced by ionomycin, which is a Ca2+ ionophore that induces Ca2+ influx into the cell. This activation required a conformational change in the EF-hand region, as a result of Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand motifs. We also showed that AtrbohD was directly phosphorylated in vivo, and that this was enhanced by the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (CA). Moreover, CA itself induced ROS production and dramatically enhanced the ionomycin-induced ROS production of AtrbohD. Our results suggest that Ca2+ binding and phosphorylation synergistically activate the ROS-producing enzyme activity of AtrbohD.

ROS production is induced in plants in response to recognition of pathogenic signals, such as pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) or elicitors. Elicitor-induced ROS production is preceded by a rapid increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) (5Blume B. Nurnberger T. Nass N. Scheel D.

The overexpression of rice two-pore channel 1 (OsTPC1), which is a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, enhanced elicitor-induced ROS production (9Kurusu T. Yagala T. Miyao A. Hirochika H. Kuchitsu K. Plant J. 2005; 42: 798-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Elicitor-induced ROS production is also inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), which is known to inhibit NADPH oxidase activity (6Kadota Y. Goh T. Tomatsu H. Tamauchi R. Higashi K. Muto S.

NADPH oxidase activity in the microsomal membrane fraction from tomato and tobacco was activated by adding Ca2+ in vitro (11Sagi M. Fluhr R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), suggesting that elicitor-induced ROS production by plant NADPH oxidase might be dependent on Ca2+. In mammalian phagocytes, ROS production is mediated by the NADPH-dependent phagocytic oxidase (phox) complex, which consists of the catalytic subunit gp91phox/NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2, together with the regulatory subunits p22phox, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTP-binding protein Rac (12Bedard K.

In plants, NOX family members, which are called respiratory burst oxidase homolog (rboh) proteins, have been identified as gp91phox/NOX2 homologs in various plant species, including rice, Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, and tobacco (10Yoshioka H.

Plant J. 2002; 31: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the only homolog for the regulatory subunits that has been identified in plants is that for Rac. In total, 10 rboh genes (AtrbohA–J) have been identified in the genome of A. thaliana (18Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). atrbohC/root hair-defective2 (rhd2) mutant was defective in ROS accumulation at the apex of the root hair bulge (19Foreman J.

A. 2002; 99: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). These genetic studies suggested that Atrboh proteins are significant in ROS production. We focused on the AtrbohD gene in the current study because it has an important role in ROS production in response to biotic and abiotic stress, and its contribution to ROS production in leaves is known to be greater than that of the AtrbohF gene (18Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 20Kwak J.M. Mori I.C. Pei Z.M. Leonhardt N. Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Bloom R.E. Bodde S. Jones J.D. Schroeder J.I.

A. 2002; 99: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Plant rboh proteins have two putative EF-hand motifs (18Torres M.A. Dangl J.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). An immobilized synthetic peptide including the EF-hand motifs of AtrbohF (formerly RbohA) was shown to bind 45Ca2+ (16Keller T. Damude H.G. Werner D. Doerner P. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 255-266PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an important role for Ca2+ binding in its activation. However, neither the biochemical activity nor the physiological function of the EF-hand motifs has been thoroughly studied. Phosphorylation also has been implicated in the activation of rboh, as the protein kinase inhibitor K-252a inhibits elicitor-induced ROS production (6Kadota Y. Goh T. Tomatsu H. Tamauchi R. Higashi K. Muto S. Kuchitsu K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Chandra S. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms for this activation by Ca2+ and phosphorylation have remained unclear, as plant rboh proteins have been difficult to express in systems in which ROS production can be monitored in real time. To address this problem, we applied a heterologous expression system using the mammalian cell line human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T to express AtrbohD. We also measured the affinity for Ca2+ and the α-helical content of the putative EF-hand region of AtrbohD by fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. We found that AtrbohD possesses ROS-producing activity, which is induced by ionomycin. AtrbohD-dependent ROS production requires a conformational change in the EF-hand region as a result of Ca2+ binding, and direct phosphorylation of AtrbohD activated ROS production and enhanced ionomycin-induced ROS production. Our results suggest that both the conformational change in the EF-hand region induced by Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand motifs and direct phosphorylation synergistically activate AtrbohD to produce ROS. Plasmid Constructs—We amplified the coding region of AtrbohD (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative [AGI] code At5g47910, accession no. AF055357, amino acid residues 1–921) from a cDNA library derived from seedlings of A. thaliana, and subcloned it into the pcDNA3.1(-) vector (Invitrogen) to express AtrbohD with the FLAG epitope tag at its 5′-end. We also generated mutants of AtrbohD (E277Q-AtrbohD and N321E-AtrbohD) using point mutant primers and the mega-primer PCR method. For protein expression in Escherichia coli, we amplified the cDNA encoding WT-EF (corresponding to amino acid residues 250–332 and including the two putative EF-hand motifs) by PCR, and subcloned the cDNA into the pET-26b(+) vector (Novagen) at NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. We generated mutants of WT-EF (D266A-EF, E277Q-EF, D310A-EF, and N321E-EF). The primer sequences used were as follows: AtrbohD forward, 5′-ATTGAATTCATGAAAATGAGACGAGGCAA-3′, and reverse 5′-ATTGGTACCCTAGAAGTTCTCTTTGTGGA-3′; WT-EF forward, 5′-CATATGAGCGATGAAAGCTTTGATGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATCCTTACTGGTTTGGTGCTTGTAACAG-3′. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or DMEM nutrient mixture F-12 HAM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG:AtrbohD or an empty pcDNA3.1 vector using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) or GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Similar results were obtained regardless of the culture medium and the transfection reagents used. Measurement of ROS Production—ROS production was measured by the peroxidase-dependent luminol-amplified chemiluminescence technique based on a method described by Bánfi et al. (29Bánfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293T cells were plated in 96-well plates 18 h before transfection. After transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 h, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1.26 mm Ca2+, and measurements were made in HBSS supplemented with 6 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 250 μm luminol (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). To mobilize Ca2+ uptake, 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) was applied to the cells (unless otherwise stated). Chemiluminescence was measured every minute at 37 °C using a microplate luminometer LB96V (EG&G Berthold). ROS production was expressed as relative luminescence units per second (RLU/s). Data are presented as the average of three samples in a representative experiment. We independently replicated this experiment more than five times. Expression and Purification of Recombinant AtrbohD Proteins Containing EF-hand Motifs—The E. coli strain Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) harboring the pET-26b(+)-based expression vector was cultured in LB medium at 37 °C. When the cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.8, 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for another 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA), and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated at 90 °C for 30 min with 1 mm Ca2+ to precipitate the E. coli proteins, centrifuged again, and the supernatant was treated with 3% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the Ca2+-depleted recombinant proteins (30Tanokura M. Yamada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The precipitate was redissolved in 1 m Tris base solution and dialyzed against buffer A. The protein was then purified on a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 m column (Tosoh, Japan) and eluted stepwise with buffer A supplemented with 100, 200, 300, or 400 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was concentrated using VivaSpin (Sartorius) and run through a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare). The purity of the peptides was confirmed by the presence of a single band on SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature (∼20 °C) using a Shimadzu RF-5300PC spectrofluorimeter, with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 310 nm. The pCa value at the half-maximal change in fluorescence (pCa50) was determined by plotting the relative fluorescence change against the pCa and fitting a sigmoidal dose-response (variable response) curve by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism Version 3.00 for Windows (Graph-Pad, San Diego, CA). CD Measurements—Far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectra were acquired at room temperature (∼20 °C) using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, which was set for a 200–260-nm wavelength range, 0.2-nm step resolution, 100-nm·min–1 scan speed, 2-s response time, 1-nm bandwidth, and eight scans per sample. Samples of the 20 μm AtrbohD EF-hand region dissolved in 100 mm KCl and 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0) were measured in the metal-free apo state, and with the addition of 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm MgCl2 in the metal-bound state. The α-helical content of the protein was calculated using the CONTIN program (31Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). In Vivo Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells that had been transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG: AtrbohD or empty pcDNA3.1 vector 48 h earlier were washed and incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 18.5 MBq/ml [32P]orthophosphate (GE Healthcare) for 4 h. The labeled cells were washed with HBSS buffer, incubated for 10 min in HBSS in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm CA, and then solubilized in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The 32P-labeled FLAG:AtrbohD was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C.

AtrbohD-dependent ROS Production in Transfected HEK293T cells—To analyze ROS-producing enzyme activity and the regulatory mechanisms of AtrbohD, we used expression in a heterologous system, HEK293T cells. This cell line is derived from mammalian HEK293 cells, which lack gp91phox/NOX2 and NOX5 (29Bánfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13793-13801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); this allowed us to quantitatively monitor exogenous Ca2+-dependent NADPH oxidase activity in real-time. When HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG:AtrbohD, the amount of recombinant protein expressed was proportional to the concentration of transfected DNA (Fig. 1A, lower panel). We measured the production of ROS in HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG: AtrbohD and empty vector by a peroxidase-dependent luminol-amplified chemiluminescence signal (33Wymann M.P. von Tscharner V. Deranleau D.A. Baggiolini M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The chemiluminescence signal detected in FLAG:AtrbohD-transfected HEK293T cells was significant, and increased in proportion to the amount of transfected FLAG:AtrbohD (Fig. 1A, upper panel). These results demonstrated that AtrbohD expressed in HEK293T cells possessed ROS-producing enzyme activity. ROS-producing Activity of AtrbohD is Ca2+-dependent—We added ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, which induces Ca2+ influx into the cell, to FLAG:AtrbohD-transfected and empty vector-transfected cells, to examine the effect of Ca2+ on AtrbohD activity. Ionomycin induced rapid transient ROS production in FLAG:AtrbohD-transfected cells, but not in empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). The level of ionomycin-induced ROS production increased in proportion to the amount of transfected DNA (Fig. 1B). To examine the dependence of ionomycin-induced ROS production on NADPH oxidase activity attributable to AtrbohD, we pretreated the transfected cells with DPI, which inhibits NADPH oxidase activity by binding to the redox center of flavoproteins (34O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). DPI inhibited ionomycin-induced ROS production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The addition of SOD, which is a scavenger of the superoxide anion radical, to the FLAG:AtrbohD-transfected cells drastically reduced the ionomycin-induced chemiluminescence signal (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the main ROS produced by AtrbohD are superoxide anion radicals. These results are consistent with physiological evidence that superoxide production in vivo is associated with a flavin-containing NOX-like activity (35Auh C.K. Murphy T.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 36Murphy T.M. Auh C.K. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Van Gestelen P.

Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar). To test the Ca2+ dependence of ionomycin-induced ROS production, AtrbohD-transfected HEK293T cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 from 0 to 1.26 mm. No ROS were produced in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and ROS production increased in proportion to the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1E), showing that ROS production by AtrbohD is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme activity. Ca2+ Binding to the Two Putative EF-hand Motifs—The two putative EF-hand motifs in the N-terminal, cytosolic region of AtrbohD have been suggested to bind Ca2+ based on amino acid sequence homologies. However, Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand motifs has not been directly demonstrated. We measured the affinity of Ca2+ binding to a recombinant protein, WT-EF, which consists of 83 amino acids containing the two putative EF-hand motifs of AtrbohD (Fig. 2A), using fluorescence spectroscopy. The effect of Ca2+ concentration (pCa = –log10[Ca2+]) on the normalized fluorescence attributed to Tyr residues is shown in Fig. 2B. The pCA50 value for WT-EF was 4.0 ± 0.03, indicating that AtrbohD is a Ca2+-binding protein. In addition, we found that the second EF-hand motif of AtrbohD has a non-bidentate Asn in the twelfth (-Z) coordinating position (Fig. 2A, arrow), in contrast to the bidentate Asp/Glu at the same position in most EF-hand motifs. This residue is critical for Ca2+ chelation (30Tanokura M. Yamada K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Gutierrez-Ford C. Levay K. Gomes A.V. Perera E.M. Som T. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Berkovitz G.D. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14553-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); we therefore hypothesized that the first EF-hand motif was likely to make a greater contribution to Ca2+ binding by AtrbohD than the second EF-hand motif. To test this hypothesis, we compared the affinity for Ca2+ of WT-EF with the mutants E277Q-EF and N321E-EF (Fig. 2A), which had substitutions at the twelfth (-Z) position in the first and second EF-hand motifs, respectively. We predicted that the E277Q mutation would reduce the affinity for Ca2+ because of the substitution of a bidentate Glu by a non-bidentate Gln in the first EF-hand motif. Conversely, we predicted that the N321E mutation would increase the affinity for Ca2+ because of the substitution of a non-bidentate Asn by a bidentate Glu in the second EF-hand motif (Fig. 2A). The affinities of N321E-EF and E277Q-EF for Ca2+ were higher and lower, respectively, than that of WT-EF, as we expected. As an Asp residue at the first (X) position in a Ca2+-binding site is known to be critical for Ca2+ chelation (39Gutierrez-Ford C. Levay K. Gomes A.V. Perera E.M. Som T. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Berkovitz G.D. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14553-14565Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we also measured the affinity for Ca2+ of other recombinant proteins with point mutations at this position in the first (D266A-EF) and second (D310A-EF) EF-hand motifs. In agreement with our predictions, the affinities of both D266A-EF and D310A-EF for Ca2+ were lower than that of WT-EF (Fig. 2A). In addition, the D266A mutation reduced the affinity for Ca2+ to a greater extent than the D310A mutation (Fig. 2B); this is consistent with our hypothesis that the first EF-hand motif contributes more than the second EF-hand motif in AtrbohD for Ca2+ binding. Ca2+-induced Conformational Changes in the EF-hand Region—To examine the effect of Ca2+ binding to the two EF-hand motifs on the conformation of the EF-hand region, we measured far-UV CD to estimate the α-helical content of WT-EF, E277Q-EF, and N321E-EF. The CD spectra of these recombinant proteins showed two negative minima at around 208 and 222 nm, which is typical of α-helical proteins (Fig. 2C). The relative α-helical contents of WT-EF, E277Q-EF, and N321E-EF in their Ca2+ bound and apo states were 1.85, 1.41, and 1.57, respectively (Fig. 2D). This indicated that WT-EF underwent a greater change in secondary structure on binding Ca2+ than N321E-EF, while the affinity of WT-EF for Ca2+ was lower than that of N321E-EF (Fig. 2B). E277Q-EF underwent a smaller conformational change than WT-EF on binding Ca2+, which is consistent with it having a low affinity for Ca2+.Mg2+ binding also increased the α-helical content of the three recombinant proteins, but to a lesser extent than Ca2+ binding, indicating that Ca2+ binding to the EF-hand region of AtrbohD could cause a significant conformational change in its secondary structure (Fig. 2D). Effects of Mutations in the EF-hand Motif on ROS Production by AtrbohD—To examine the effects of the mutations in the EF-hand motifs on ionomycin-induced ROS production, we expressed FLAG:AtrbohD proteins carrying point mutations (E277Q-AtrbohD and N321E-AtrbohD) in HEK293T cells, and measured the production of ROS. The mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable to wild type, indicating that the mutations had no effect on protein expression (Fig. 3A). However, the E277Q mutation completely abolished ionomycin-induced ROS production (Fig. 3B). A similar result was obtained with a FLAG:D266A-AtrbohD mutant and a deletion mutant, FLAG:Δ328-AtrbohD, that lacked the N-terminal region containing the two EF-hand motifs (data not shown). These results indicated that ionomycin-induced activation of AtrbohD is mediated by Ca2+ binding to its EF-hand region. Although the affinity of N321E-EF for Ca2+ was higher than that of WT-EF (Fig. 2B), ROS production by FLAG:N321E-AtrbohD was much lower than that of FLAG:AtrbohD (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the correct conformational change in the EF-hand region upon Ca2+ binding, rather than the level of the affinity for Ca2+, is the important factor for ROS production by AtrbohD. Regulation of ROS Production by AtrbohD through Protein Phosphorylation—The protein phosphatase inhibitor CA is known to induce ROS production (24Felix G. Regenass M. Spanu P. Boller T. Proc. Natl.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore tested its effect on ROS production in FLAG:AtrbohD-transfected cells in the absence of ionomycin, and found it induced ROS production (Fig. 4A), but at a much lower level and over a much longer time period than ionomycin. We observed CA-induced ROS production in FLAG:E277Q-AtrbohD-transfected cells that did not produce ROS in response to ionomycin (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that the mechanisms by which ionomycin and CA induce ROS production differ. We also observed a rapid initial phase of CA-induced ROS production in FLAG:AtrbohD-transfected cells. This might be due to trace amounts of Ca2+ influx (Fig. 4A), as it was eliminated in FLAG: E277Q-AtrbohD transfected cells (Fig. 4B). To investigate the phosphorylation of AtrbohD in vivo, HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-AtrbohD or empty vector and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized"
https://openalex.org/W2036853240,"The spin of an electron is a natural two-level system for realizing a quantum bit in the solid state. For an electron trapped in a semiconductor quantum dot, strong quantum confinement highly suppresses the detrimental effect of phonon-related spin relaxation. However, this advantage is offset by the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the 10(4) to 10(6) spins of the host nuclei in the quantum dot. Random fluctuations in the nuclear spin ensemble lead to fast spin decoherence in about ten nanoseconds. Spin-echo techniques have been used to mitigate the hyperfine interaction, but completely cancelling the effect is more attractive. In principle, polarizing all the nuclear spins can achieve this but is very difficult to realize in practice. Exploring materials with zero-spin nuclei is another option, and carbon nanotubes, graphene quantum dots and silicon have been proposed. An alternative is to use a semiconductor hole. Unlike an electron, a valence hole in a quantum dot has an atomic p orbital which conveniently goes to zero at the location of all the nuclei, massively suppressing the interaction with the nuclear spins. Furthermore, in a quantum dot with strong strain and strong quantization, the heavy hole with spin-3/2 behaves as a spin-1/2 system and spin decoherence mechanisms are weak. We demonstrate here high fidelity (about 99 per cent) initialization of a single hole spin confined to a self-assembled quantum dot by optical pumping. Our scheme works even at zero magnetic field, demonstrating a negligible hole spin hyperfine interaction. We determine a hole spin relaxation time at low field of about one millisecond. These results suggest a route to the realization of solid-state quantum networks that can intra-convert the spin state with the polarization of a photon."
https://openalex.org/W2040848874,"Downs syndrome cell adhesion molecules (Dscams) are adhesion molecules of the immunoglolulin superfamily. Drosophila Dscams have been implicated in the organization of neural connectivity, but little is known about the functions of the closely related molecules in vertebrates. Masahito Yamagata and Joshua Sanes now demonstrate a role for Dscam and DscamL in patterning of lamina-specific connections in the chick retina. Two other adhesion molecules, called Sidekick-1 and Sidekick-2, act in a similar way. These molecules are widely distributed in the nervous system and may be part of an 'adhesive code' that patterns neural connections in the brain. Further evidence for the importance of Dscams in vertebrate neural patterning comes from Fuerst et al., who identify a role for DSCAM in establishing neural circuits in the retina of mice. The computing power of the brain depends on its components, nerve cells, being wired to each other in very specific patterns. Some of the molecules involved in this specificity have been identified, and it is demonstrated that nerve cells miss-wire when these molecules are missing or, conversely, when they are present in the wrong place. Synaptic circuits in the retina transform visual input gathered by photoreceptors into messages that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) send to the brain. Processes of retinal interneurons (amacrine and bipolar cells) form synapses on dendrites of RGCs in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The IPL is divided into at least 10 parallel sublaminae; subsets of interneurons and RGCs arborize and form synapses in just one or a few of them1,2,3. These lamina-specific circuits determine the visual features to which RGC subtypes respond3,4,5. Here we show that four closely related immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) adhesion molecules—Dscam (Down’s syndrome cell adhesion molecule), DscamL (refs 6–9), Sidekick-1 and Sidekick-2 (ref. 10)—are expressed in chick by non-overlapping subsets of interneurons and RGCs that form synapses in distinct IPL sublaminae. Moreover, each protein is concentrated within the appropriate sublaminae and each mediates homophilic adhesion. Loss- and gain-of-function studies in vivo indicate that these IgSF members participate in determining the IPL sublaminae in which synaptic partners arborize and connect. Thus, vertebrate Dscams, like Drosophila Dscams11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, play roles in neural connectivity. Together, our results on Dscams and Sidekicks suggest the existence of an IgSF code for laminar specificity in retina and, by implication, in other parts of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2043981786,"Bacterial flagella contain a specialized secretion apparatus that functions to deliver the protein subunits that form the filament and other structures to outside the membrane. This apparatus is related to the injectisome used by many gram-negative pathogens and symbionts to transfer effector proteins into host cells; in both systems this export mechanism is termed 'type III' secretion. The flagellar secretion apparatus comprises a membrane-embedded complex of about five proteins, and soluble factors, which include export-dedicated chaperones and an ATPase, FliI, that was thought to provide the energy for export. Here we show that flagellar secretion in Salmonella enterica requires the proton motive force (PMF) and does not require ATP hydrolysis by FliI. The export of several flagellar export substrates was prevented by treatment with the protonophore CCCP, with no accompanying decrease in cellular ATP levels. Weak swarming motility and rare flagella were observed in a mutant deleted for FliI and for the non-flagellar type-III secretion ATPases InvJ and SsaN. These findings show that the flagellar secretion apparatus functions as a proton-driven protein exporter and that ATP hydrolysis is not essential for type III secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2036559452,"To establish functional circuitry, retinal neurons occupy spatial domains by arborizing their processes, which requires the self-avoidance of neurites from an individual cell, and by spacing their cell bodies, which requires positioning the soma and establishing a zone within which other cells of the same type are excluded. The mosaic patterns of distinct cell types form independently and overlap. The cues that direct these processes in the vertebrate retina are not known. Here we show that some types of retinal amacrine cells from mice with a spontaneous mutation in Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam), a gene encoding an immunoglobulin-superfamily member adhesion molecule, have defects in the arborization of processes and in the spacing of cell bodies. In the mutant retina, cells that would normally express Dscam have hyperfasciculated processes, preventing them from creating an orderly arbor. Also, their cell bodies are randomly distributed or pulled into clumps rather than being regularly spaced mosaics. Our results indicate that mouse DSCAM mediates isoneuronal self-avoidance for arborization and heteroneuronal self-avoidance within specific cell types to prevent fasciculation and to preserve mosaic spacing. These functions are analogous to those of Drosophila DSCAM (ref. 6) and DSCAM2 (ref. 7). DSCAM may function similarly in other regions of the mammalian nervous system, and this role may extend to other members of the mammalian Dscam gene family."
https://openalex.org/W2062892191,"Bacterial flagella contain a secretion apparatus related to the type III secretion system used by many pathogens to transfer effector proteins into host cells. It is generally assumed that the ATPase FliI provides energy for transport, but two reports argue against this view. Both groups find that flagellar secretion occurs even in the absence of the ATPase, and that the energy required derives from the proton motive force. Bacterial flagella contain a secretion apparatus that is related to the type III secretion system used by many pathogens to transfer effector proteins into host cells. It has been thought that the ATPase, FliL provides the energy for transport. This is one of two papers that argue against this widely held view and show that flagellar secretion can occur even in the absence of the ATPase and is instead driven by the proton motive force. Translocation of many soluble proteins across cell membranes occurs in an ATPase-driven manner. For construction of the bacterial flagellum responsible for motility, most of the components are exported by the flagellar protein export apparatus1,2. The FliI ATPase is required for this export3, and its ATPase activity is regulated by FliH4; however, it is unclear how the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is used for the export process. Here we report that flagellar proteins of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are exported even in the absence of FliI. A fliH fliI double null mutant was weakly motile. Certain mutations in FlhA or FlhB, which form the core of the export gate, substantially improved protein export and motility of the double null mutant. Furthermore, proton motive force was essential for the export process. These results suggest that the FliH–FliI complex facilitates only the initial entry of export substrates into the gate, with the energy of ATP hydrolysis being used to disassemble and release the FliH–FliI complex from the protein about to be exported. The rest of the successive unfolding/translocation process of the substrates is driven by proton motive force."

Through genetic screen of mutants showing ectopic cytosine methylation in a genic region, we identified a jmjC-domain gene, IBM1 (increase in bonsai methylation 1 ), in Arabidopsis thaliana . In addition to the ectopic cytosine methylation, the ibm1 mutations induced a variety of developmental phenotypes, which depend on methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9. Paradoxically, the developmental phenotypes of the ibm1 were enhanced by the mutation in the chromatin-remodeling gene DDM1 ( decrease in DNA methylation 1 ), which is necessary for keeping methylation and silencing of repeated heterochromatin loci. Our results demonstrate the importance of chromatin remodeling and histone modifications in the differential epigenetic control of repeats and genes."
https://openalex.org/W2039678320,"Theory on the evolution of ornamental male traits by sexual selection assumes consistency in selection over time. Temporal variation in female choice could dampen sexual selection, but scant information exists on the degree to which individual female preferences are flexible. Here we show that in lark buntings sexual selection on male traits varied dramatically across years and, in some cases, exhibited reversals in the direction of selection for a single trait. We show that these shifts are probably because of flexibility in mate choice by individual females and that they parallel shifts in the male traits that predict female reproductive success in a given year. Plasticity in choice and concomitant reversals in mating patterns across time may weaken the strength of sexual selection and could maintain genetic variation underlying multiple sexual ornaments."
https://openalex.org/W2041730142,"The residence time of fine-root carbon in soil is one of the least understood aspects of the global carbon cycle, and fine-root dynamics are one of the least understood aspects of plant function. Most recent studies of these belowground dynamics have used one of two methodological strategies. In one approach, based on analysis of carbon isotopes, the persistence of carbon is inferred; in the other, based on direct observations of roots with cameras, the longevity of individual roots is measured. We show that the contribution of fine roots to the global carbon cycle has been overstated because observations of root lifetimes systematically overestimate the turnover of fine-root biomass. On the other hand, isotopic techniques systematically underestimate the turnover of individual roots. These differences, by virtue of the separate processes or pools measured, are irreconcilable."

Instead, the sample resembles chondritic meteorites from the asteroid belt, composed mostly of inner solar nebula materials.

These results are fully consistent with a simple thermodynamic description of the transition. Examination of previous compression data shows that the magnitude of softening increases with iron content up to at least x = 0.20. Although the spin transition in (Mg,Fe)O is too broad to produce an abrupt seismic discontinuity in the lower mantle, the transition will produce a correlated negative anomaly for both compressional and shear velocities that extends throughout most, if not all, of the lower mantle."

Those clusters with an odd number of atoms tend to react much more slowly than their even-numbered counterparts. We used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to show that spin conservation straightforwardly accounts for this trend. The reaction rate of odd-numbered clusters increased appreciably when singlet oxygen was used in place of ground-state (triplet) oxygen. Conversely, monohydride clusters Al n H – , in which addition of the hydrogen atom shifts the spin state by converting formerly open-shell structures to closed-shell ones (and vice versa), exhibited an opposing trend: The odd- n hydride clusters reacted more rapidly with triplet oxygen. These findings are supported by theoretical simulations and highlight the general importance of spin selection rules in mediating cluster reactivity."

Members of the abundant Hsp70 class of chaperones play essential roles in diverse cellular processes, including the folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins, the transport of proteins across membranes, the refolding of misfolded proteins, and the regulation of signal transduction proteins (1Craig E.A. Huang P. Buchner J. Kiefhaber T. Protein Folding Handbook. 2. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2005: 490-515Google Scholar).

The basic chaperone cycle of Hsp70 proteins is modulated by cofactors that affect either ATP hydrolysis or exchange of ADP for ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is stimulated by J-domain-harboring co-chaperones that also deliver substrates and thereby facilitate substrate binding as well as provide specificity to the Hsp70s. Nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) accelerate nucleotide release by associating with specific conformations of the Hsp70 NBD that exhibit low affinity for ADP and ATP. Rebinding of ATP and the concomitant dissociation of the NEF complete the exchange reaction. Recently, it has become clear that several members of the Hsp70 superfamily function as NEFs for canonical Hsp70 chaperones. The first example of this functional diversification within the Hsp70 superfamily came from the finding that the yeast Grp170-class protein Lhs1 is a NEF for the endoplasmic reticulum resident Hsp70 chaperone Kar2 (3Steel G.J. Fullerton D.M. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Science. 2004; 303: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, the eukaryotic cytoplasm harbors a divergent branch of the Hsp70 superfamily with NEF activity. The Hsp110 proteins differ from other Hsp70 chaperones by an extended C-terminal domain, with an inserted acidic region between the terminal strands of the predicted β-sheet subdomain of the C-terminal domain as well as an elongated C terminus (4Easton D.P.

A recent crystal structure of the yeast Hsp110 Sse1 lends further support to the close relationship between Hsp70 and Hsp110 (5Liu Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 2007; 131: 106-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, despite this similarity, Hsp110 proteins do not appear to be effective folding chaperones but rather act as NEFs for the cytosolic Hsp70 machinery (6Dragovic Z. Broadley S.A. Shomura Y. Bracher A. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2519-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbors two highly homologous members of the Hsp110 family, the abundant Sse1 and the less expressed Sse2. Mutational analysis suggests that Sse1 and Sse2 have overlapping and essential activities; sse1 null mutant cells are slow growing, whereas sse2 null mutant cells exhibit no apparent phenotype and double null mutant cells are inviable (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Trott A. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Genetics. 2005; 170: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Viability is restored by overexpression of Fes1, another NEF cognate to Hsp70 chaperones (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that the essential in vivo role of Sse1 and Sse2 is NEF activity. The canonical Hsp70 chaperones in the cytoplasm of yeast fall into the two classes, Ssa (Ssa1–4) and Ssb (Ssb1–2). The Ssa chaperones are required for viability and are involved in housekeeping functions as well as stress-related protein folding processes, whereas the Ssb chaperones are dispensable for viability and appear to facilitate nascent polypeptide folding at the ribosome. Sse1 forms high affinity complexes with both Hsp70 classes, whereas Sse2 is restricted to the Ssa class (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 9Shaner L. Wegele H. Buchner J. Morano K.A. J. Biol.

The meaning of these stable complexes in the cell is unclear and has lately been the subject of controversy. One possibility is that the Hsp70 in these complexes are trapped in a conformation with low affinity for nucleotide and that they therefore represent a nucleotide-sensitive intermediate state in the nucleotide-exchange reaction. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Biacore) experiments indicate that the presence of ATP drastically reduces the interaction between Ssa1 and Sse1 (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, a set of experiments using gel shift assays to assess the interaction between Sse1 and a C-terminally truncated bovine Hsc70 indicates that ATP is required for formation of a heterodimeric complex (10Shaner L. Sousa R. Morano K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15075-15084Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, labeled ATP was found to persist in the complex and only very slowly undergo hydrolysis, leading the authors to postulate an unconventional and multi-step mechanism for the Sse1 NEF function (10Shaner L. Sousa R. Morano K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15075-15084Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Shaner L. Morano K.A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007; 12: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting observations call for a thorough analysis of how nucleotides influence the formation, integrity, and dissociation of the complex between Sse1 and its cognate Hsp70, Ssa1. Here we show that nucleotide binding stabilizes the highly flexible Sse1 and in two steps induces a conformation that is able to associate with Ssa1 and catalyze nucleotide release. Nucleotide persists in the stable heterodimeric complex; nevertheless, removal of all bound nucleotide does not affect complex integrity nor does it appear to compromise the folding status of Sse1 in the complex. Excess nucleotide triggers dissociation of the complex by binding to Ssa1, via a mechanism similar to that of other characterized NEFs. Taken together, our data indicate that nucleotide is the key regulator of the NEF cycle of Sse1, driving both complex formation and dissociation. Reagents—N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5′-diphosphate (MABA-ADP) was purchased from TriLink Technologies Inc., San Diego, CA. ATP, ADP, and AMP were obtained from Roche Applied Science. ADP was purified to remove contaminating ATP by anion exchange chromatography using a ReSourceQ 1-ml column eluted with a 0.1–1 m NH4CO3 gradient followed by lyophilization. D2O buffer for hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HX) experiment was prepared using 99.85% D2O (Euriso-top, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), lyophilized, and re-dissolved five times in fresh D2O volumes. Plasmids—The expression vector pCA528 supports T7-promoted expression of proteins as His6-SUMO fusions and was constructed by ligating a SMT3 PCR product amplified from yeast chromosomal DNA (primers CCTTGGCATATGGGTCATCACCATCATCACCATGGTTCGGACTCAGAAGTCAATC, GCTCCTGGATCCGGTCTCCCACCAATCTGTTCTCTGT) into pET24a (Novagen). pCA597 is a derivative of pCA528 carrying a triple Strep Tag II instead of the His6 tag. To obtain the Ssa1 expression vector pCA533, SSA1 was PCR-amplified from pET20b-SSA1 (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (primers CCAGTGGGTCTCAGGTGGTATGTCAAAAGCTGTCGGTATTG, CCAGTGCTCGAGCTTAATCAACTTCTTCAACGGTTG), restricted with BsaI/XhoI, and ligated into pCA528. pCA599 was constructed similarly but a His10 tag was introduced in the reverse primer and the PCR product was ligated into the vector pCA597. pCA534 was obtained by the same strategy as for pCA533, but the coding sequence of SSE1 was PCR-amplified using primers CCAGTGGGTCTCAGGTGGTATGAGTACTCCATTTGGTTTAG and CCAGTGCTCGAGCTTAGTCCATGTCAACATCAC. For expression of the NBD domain of Ssa1, pCA592 was constructed by PCR-amplifying a fragment of SSA1 (primers CCAAGGTCAATGACGCTG, GCGGCGCTCGAGTTAAGTCAAAATAGCAGCTTGAAC) and KpnI/XhoI-restricting the product and ligating it with similarly restricted pCA533. The expression vector pCA569 was constructed in multiple steps generating a pUHE21-2fdΔ12 (13Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) derivative expressing Sse1 carrying a C-terminal Strep-Tag II (WSH-PQFEK). The Sse1 K69M mutation was introduced into pCA569 as a BamHI/HindIII fragment obtained from pUHE-SSE1K69M (14Raviol H. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pET20b-SSA1G198D-His10 was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of pET20b-SSA1-His10 (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Ssa1 with a Ulp1-cleavable N-terminal His6-SUMO tag was expressed from the vector pCA533 in BL21-SI/pCodonPlus cells (Invitrogen) by induction at 20 °C with 0.3 m NaCl and 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purified using Ni-IDA matrix (Protino; Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany); eluted material containing 250 mm imidazole was supplemented with His6-Ulp1 protease, dialyzed overnight, and contaminants were removed by incubation with Ni-IDA matrix. The NBD of Ssa1 was purified similarly but expressed from pCA592. Sse1 was expressed and purified as described previously (14Raviol H. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or expressed from pCA534 and purified in a similar manner as Ssa1. Ssa1 and Ssa1G198D carrying a C-terminal His10 tag (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) were expressed as described for the SUMO-fused Ssa1 with exclusion of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Sse1 and Sse1K69M carrying a C-terminal Strep-Tag II were expressed from the vector pCA568. To isolate stoichiometric complexes, cells from separate expression cultures were pooled, lysed, and purified using Ni-IDA matrix. Eluted material was applied onto StrepTactin-Sepharose (IBA, GmbH, Göttingen, Germany), and bound complexes were eluted by addition of 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. Doubly tagged Ssa1 carrying a Strep-Tag-II-SUMO at its N terminus and a His10 tag at its C terminus was expressed from pCA599 and purified similarly. Nucleotide Removal—Proteins were made nucleotide-free by a protocol modified from Theyssen et al. (15Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Hepes-KOH, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of calf intestine phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. Calf intestine phosphatase was removed by ion exchange chromatography over a ReSourceQ 6-ml column in the same buffer containing 5% (v/v) glycerol. The nucleotide content (<3–5%) in the final protein fraction was assessed by analytical ion exchange chromatography (ReSourceQ 1 ml in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 6.5, 0–1.5 m KCl). Ssa1-Sse1 Association Assay—To assess complex formation, 2 μm nucleotide-free Sse1 was incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with ATP or purified ADP at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 mm in 250 μl of LWB (40 mm Hepes-KOH, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Ssa1 carrying an N-terminal Strep-Tag-II3-SUMO fusion was added to a final concentration of 2 μm and incubated for 10 min before 25 μl of StrepTactin-Sepharose suspension was added. After 20 min, unbound material was removed by washing and bound material was eluted by proteolytic cleavage of the SUMO tag by incubation with Ulp1 protease. Eluted material was analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE that was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Ssa1-Sse1 Dissociation Assay—Ssa1-His10 Sse1-Strep-Tag-II complexes and mutant derivatives were immobilized onto Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) by incubation of 600 μl of 5 μm protein solutions in LWB with 75 μl of matrix suspension at 4 °C for 60 min. Unbound protein was removed by washing, and beads were incubated with buffer with and without addition of 4 mm ATP or purified ADP for 30 min at 4 °C. Released material was collected from the supernatant, and remaining bound material was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Collected fractions were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Size Exclusion Chromatography—8 μm Sse1 was incubated alone or with 24 μm Ssa11–378 for 30 min at 30 °C in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of 10 mm ATP. The samples (100 μl) were analyzed on an analytical Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The fractions were analyzed on a silver-stained 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Nucleotide Release Analysis—Nucleotide release was measured using the fluorescently labeled analogue of ADP, MABA-ADP (15Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the stopped flow instrumentation SX-18MV from Applied Photophysics (Surrey, UK). 0.5 μm Ssa1 was preincubated with 0.5 μm MABA-ADP in HKM buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 30 °C. For determination of the basal dissociation rate, equal volumes of protein-MABA-ADP complex and HKM buffer, or HKM buffer containing excess unlabeled nucleotide (250 μm ATP, 250 μm or 2 mm purified ADP), were rapidly mixed in the stopped flow device and the decrease in fluorescent signal was monitored. Stimulation of the dissociation rate was assessed by mixing Ssa1-MABA-ADP with a solution of 2 μm nucleotide-free Sse1 or 2 μm Sse1 preincubated at 30 °C with 250 μm unlabeled ATP, 250 μm or 2 mm purified ADP, respectively. The measurement time scales ranged from 0.1 to 10 s. The kinetic rate constants were obtained by fitting the data using the Applied Photophysics SpectraKinetic Work station v4.56-1. Hydrogen-deuterium Exchange Experiments and Mass Spectrometry—HX experiments were performed in a manner similar to that described earlier (16Rist W. Jorgensen T.J. Roepstorff P. Bukau B. Mayer M.P.

To initiate amide proton-deuteron exchange, 100–200 pmol of purified proteins alone or supplemented with defined nucleotides were diluted 10-fold (Fig. 2) or 20-fold (Figs. 3 and 4) into D2O-based buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). After incubation at 30 °C for a fixed time period, the exchange reaction was stopped by addition of 1 volume of ice-cold quench buffer (0.4 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 2.2). Quenched samples were immediately injected into the high performance liquid chromatography setup and analyzed on an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (17Rist W.

A, nucleotide removal does not compromise the interaction between Sse1 and Ssa1. The Ssa1-His10-Sse1 complex was purified in the presence of residual-bound ADP or made nucleotide-free by calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) treatment. The samples (load) were incubated with Ni-IDA matrix, the matrix was washed (unbound), and the bound material eluted with imidazole (eluted). The amount of Sse1 that co-isolated with Ssa-His10 was assessed from SDS-PAGE analysis. B, nucleotide removal affects the properties of free Sse1 in HX experiments, but not of Ssa1-bound Sse1. Mass increase through deuteron incorporation is shown for Sse1-Strep-Tag II alone or in its complex with Ssa1-His10 as a function of the HX reaction time. The measurements were performed at 30 °C in the presence of residual ADP in the complex (•) and after complete removal of nucleotide by calf intestine phosphatase treatment (○).

For the data of Fig. 2C, excess nucleotide was removed by passage over a Zeba Desalt Spin Column (Pierce) before the HX experiment. Nucleotides Are Required for Formation of an Ssa1-Sse1 Complex—To understand how Hsp110 regulates the chaperone cycle of Hsp70, we set out to characterize the complex that is formed between yeast Ssa1 and Sse1. We started by investigating the formation of the complex using purified components in a defined nucleotide state. Ssa1 was incubated with nucleotide-free Sse1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) on StrepTactin matrix by means of a Strep-Tag-II-SUMO moiety fused to its N terminus. After washing, Ssa1 and bound Sse1 were eluted by proteolytic severing of the SUMO tag and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. In the absence of added nucleotide, Sse1 did not form any detectable complex with Ssa1 (Fig. 1A, lower panel, lane 2). In contrast, the presence of ADP (purified free from contaminating ATP, see “Experimental Procedures”) in amounts ranging from equimolar to 1000-fold excess supported weak formation of the complex (Fig. 1A, lower panel, lanes 3–6) and addition of ATP supported the interaction even more robustly than ADP (lanes 7–9). In the assay, ADP and ATP appear to be most effective in promoting Ssa1-Sse1 association when added in an equimolar ratio or up to a 100-fold excess, whereas a 1000-fold excess resulted in significantly less detectable complex (compare lanes 7–9 with lane 10). In an independent approach, we assessed the nucleotide requirement for complex formation using size exclusion chromatography applied on full-length Sse1 and the isolated NBD of Ssa1 (Ssa11–378). In the absence of added nucleotide, Sse1 and Ssa11–378 eluted in separate fractions according to their respective sizes when the mixture was analyzed on a size exclusion column (Fig. 1B, upper panel), indicating that no complex was formed. In contrast, addition of 10 mm ATP to the mixed proteins before chromatography resulted in significant complex formation as evidenced by co-elution of Ssa11–378 and Sse1 (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Note that excess ATP was separated from the protein during size exclusion chromatography, because the running buffer did not contain nucleotide. The NBD of Ssa1 is predicted to be sufficient for a bona fide Hsp70-NEF interaction (10Shaner L. Sousa R. Morano K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15075-15084Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J.

Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) but cannot support a putative Hsp70-substrate interaction between Ssa1 and Sse1. Consequently, the experiment formally rules out the possibility that the complex studied is an Hsp70-substrate interaction. Similar experiments using full-length Ssa1 and Sse1 also revealed interaction of the proteins only when ATP was present in the sample (data not shown). Sse1 Requires Nucleotide to Efficiently Catalyze Nucleotide Release from Ssa1—The nucleotide dependence for complex formation between Ssa1 and Sse1 enabled us to directly test whether the observed interaction correlates with catalyzed release of ADP from Ssa1. Preloaded complexes consisting of Ssa1 and the fluorescent nucleotide derivative MABA-ADP were rapidly mixed with Sse1, and dissociation of MABA-ADP was followed by decrease in its fluorescence signal in stopped flow measurements (7Raviol H. Sadlish H. Rodriguez F. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2510-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the presence of a 4-fold excess of nucleotide-free Sse1 over Ssa1, only 6-fold acceleration of the basal release rate could be detected (Fig. 1C). Under identical conditions, a 4-fold excess of Sse1 preincubated with 250 μm ADP resulted in 20-fold acceleration of the basal release rate. In contrast, when incubated with 250 μm ATP Sse1 accelerated the basal release rate 85-fold. Increasing the ADP concentration to 2 mm under otherwise identical conditions enabled Sse1 to accelerate the basal release rate 29-fold. The distinct stimulatory effects of ADP and ATP on the NEF activity of Sse1 directly correlate with the different capacities of the two nucleotides to support complex formation between Ssa1 and Sse1. We conclude that nucleotides promote the NEF activity of Sse1 and that ATP induces this activity far more potently than ADP. ATP Binding Induces a Stabilization of Sse1—We next sought to explain why nucleotide binding to Sse1 is required to generate a functional NEF complex with cognate Hsp70s. We applied amide hydrogen exchange (HX) combined with mass spectrometry to analyze the effects of nucleotides on Sse1. With this technique, conformational changes and binding interfaces to partners can be resolved by monitoring changes in solvent accessibility of amide hydrogen positions in the protein (21Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified nucleotide-free proteins were equilibrated with defined nucleotides and then diluted in D2O-based buffer solution for a fixed time period. The number of incorporated deuterons was determined by mass spectrometry after stopping the HX reaction. Nucleotide-free Sse1 exchanges as much as 62% of all available amide hydrogens in the 2-min reaction (410 deuterons incorporated, Fig. 2A), which indicates a very dynamic and loosely folded conformation of the molecule. This unusual behavior is in contrast to that of canonical Hsp70 chaperones, which exchange much more slowly. For comparison, 42 and 37% of all available amide hydrogen positions exchange within a 2-min reaction in Ssa1 and DnaK, respectively (17Rist W. Graf C. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 7J. Fiaux and B. Bukau, unpublished observations. When increasing concentrations of ATP were added to Sse1, we observed a gradual decrease in the number of deuterons incorporated in the 2-min exchange reaction down to ∼59% of exchangeable positions (391 deuterons, Fig. 2A, panels 1–6), indicating stabilization of the molecule. In addition, ATP promoted the emergence of a second distinct species of Sse1 that exchanges much more slowly than the nucleotide-free protein (272 deuterons incorporated, i.e. 41% of available amide hydrogens that exchanged within 2 min; Fig. 2A, spectra 3–8). These observations suggest that Sse1 undergoes a two-step ATP-driven compacting reaction (Fig. 2B). According to this model, nucleotide-free Sse1 predominantly adopts a highly flexible conformation (Fig. 2B, I) whereas it exists mostly in a stabilized state when bound to nucleotide (Fig. 2B, II). This form can in turn adopt a fully compacted and nucleotide-bound structure (Fig. 2B, III). ATP is efficient at inducing stabilization and conversion to the compact form of Sse1, whereas ADP at 2 mm induces full stabilization (Conformation II) but does not yield any detectable compact form (Fig. 1A, lane 9, III). However, inclusion of phosphate in the ADP condition resulted in detection of the compact form (data not shown), suggesting that ADP-Sse1 is maintained in a strongly biased equilibrium between conformations II and III. To make sure that our HX experiments were performed under saturating ATP and ADP conditions, we determined the affinities that Sse1 exhibits toward these nucleotides. The KD for ADP is 23 ± 9 μm and for ATP 2.1 ± 0.6 μm as determined by MABA-ATP competition titration (data not shown) (15Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to ATP, ADP only very inefficiently supports conversion of Sse1 to the compact conformation III even under nucleotide saturation conditions (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3–6 with lane 9). We used HX experiments to characterize the complex f"
https://openalex.org/W1971236504,"For gene regulation, some transcriptional activators bind periodically to promoters with either a fast (∼1 minute) or a slow (∼15 to 90 minutes) cycle. It is uncertain whether the fast cycle occurs on natural promoters, and the function of either cycle in transcription remains unclear. We report that fast and slow cycling can occur simultaneously on an endogenous yeast promoter and that slow cycling in this system reflects an oscillation in the fraction of accessible promoters rather than the recruitment and release of stably bound transcriptional activators. This observation, combined with single-cell measurements of messenger RNA (mRNA) production, argues that fast cycling initiates transcription and that slow cycling regulates the quantity of mRNA produced. These findings counter the prevailing view that slow cycling initiates transcription."

Current automatic face-recognition systems are defeated by natural changes in lighting and pose, which often affect face images more profoundly than changes in identity.

We modeled human familiarity by using image averaging to derive stable face representations from naturally varying photographs.

https://openalex.org/W2132097726,"It is natural to assume that patchiness in an ecosystem must reflect an underlying property of the habitat. Yet there are several lines of evidence to suggest that intrinsic biological dynamics can produce pattern even in an ecosystem that is homogeneous for the organisms involved. Outside of the laboratory, it is difficult to convincingly demonstrate large-scale pattern formation from biological interactions, mainly because it is close to impossible to exclude habitat variables. Vandermeer et al. have used the artificiality of shade trees planted in a coffee plantation to get around this problem, and demonstrate significant patterning of a particular species of ant, Azteca instabilis, that nests in those trees. Ant population density is controlled by natural enemies, mainly a parasitic fly, but the distribution of ant nest clusters follows a strong spatial pattern despite habitat homogeneity. This paper describes and models a striking example of non-random ecological patterning over large spatial scales apparently caused by the interaction between a common species of tropical arboreal ant and one of its natural enemies under spatially homogeneous conditions. Although sometimes difficult to measure at large scales, spatial pattern is important in natural biological spaces as a determinant of key ecological properties such as species diversity, stability, resiliency and others1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we demonstrate, at a large spatial scale, that a common species of tropical arboreal ant forms clusters of nests through a combination of local satellite colony formation and density-dependent control by natural enemies, mainly a parasitic fly. Cluster sizes fall off as a power law consistent with a so-called robust critical state7. This endogenous cluster formation at a critical state is a unique example of an insect population forming a non-random pattern at a large spatial scale. Furthermore, because the species is a keystone of a larger network that contributes to the ecosystem function of pest control, this is an example of how spatial dynamics at a large scale can affect ecosystem service at a local level."
https://openalex.org/W2017252180,"To explain the elevated osmium isotope ( 186 Os- 187 Os) signatures in oceanic basalts, the possibility of material flux from the metallic core into the crust has been invoked. This hypothesis conflicts with theoretical constraints on Earth's thermal and dynamic history. To test the veracity and uniqueness of elevated 186 Os- 187 Os in tracing core-mantle exchange, we present highly siderophile element analyses of pyroxenites, eclogites plus their sulfides, and new 186 Os/ 188 Os measurements on pyroxenites and platinum-rich alloys. Modeling shows that involvement in the mantle source of either bulk pyroxenite or, more likely, metasomatic sulfides derived from either pyroxenite or peridotite melts can explain the 186 Os- 187 Os signatures of oceanic basalts. This removes the requirement for core-mantle exchange and provides an effective mechanism for generating Os isotope diversity in basalt source regions."

https://openalex.org/W2017156341,"High pressure is known to influence electronic structure and crystal packing, and can in some cases even induce compound formation between elements that do not bond under ambient conditions. Here we present a computational study showing that high pressure fundamentally alters the reactivity of the light elements lithium (Li) and beryllium (Be), which are the first of the metals in the condensed state and immiscible under normal conditions. We identify four stoichiometric Li(x)Be(1-x) compounds that are stable over a range of pressures, and find that the electronic density of states of one of them displays a remarkable step-like feature near the bottom of the valence band and then remains almost constant with increasing energy. These characteristics are typical of a quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure, the emergence of which in a three-dimensional environment is rather unexpected. We attribute this observation to large size differences between the ionic cores of Li and Be: as the density increases, the Li cores start to overlap and thereby expel valence electrons into quasi-two-dimensional layers characterized by delocalized free-particle-like states in the vicinity of Be ions."
https://openalex.org/W2036312369,"Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for bacteremia, gas gangrene, and occasionally food poisoning. Its genome encodes three sialidases, nanH, nanI, and nanJ, that are involved in the removal of sialic acids from a variety of glycoconjugates and that play a role in bacterial nutrition and pathogenesis. Recent studies on trypanosomal (trans-) sialidases have suggested that catalysis in all sialidases may proceed via a covalent intermediate similar to that of other retaining glycosidases. Here we provide further evidence to support this suggestion by reporting the 0.97A resolution atomic structure of the catalytic domain of the C. perfringens NanI sialidase, and complexes with its substrate sialic acid (N-acetylneuramic acid) also to 0.97A resolution, with a transition-state analogue (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid) to 1.5A resolution, and with a covalent intermediate formed using a fluorinated sialic acid analogue to 1.2A resolution. Together, these structures provide high resolution snapshots along the catalytic pathway. The crystal structures suggested that NanI is able to hydrate 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid to N-acetylneuramic acid. This was confirmed by NMR, and a mechanism for this activity is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2086943836,"To coincide with the flyby of the Pluto-bound New Horizons probe, Jupiter was the target of intensive observation, starting in February 2007, from a battery of ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Weeks into the project, on 25 March, an intense disturbance developed in Jupiter's strongest jet at 23° North latitude, lasting to June 2007. This type of event is rare — the last ones were seen in 1990 and 1975. The onset of the disturbance was captured by the HST, and the development of two plumes was followed in unprecedented detail. The two plumes (bright white spots in the small infrared image on the cover) towered 30 km above the surrounding clouds. The nature of the power source for the jets that dominate the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn is a controversial matter, complicated by the interplay of local and planet-wide meteorological factors. The new observations are consistent with a wind extending deep into the atmosphere, well below the level reached by solar radiation. In the larger cover image, turbulence caused by the plumes can be seen in the band that is home to the jet. Observations and modelling of two plumes in Jupiter's atmosphere that erupted at the same latitude as the strongest jet (23° North) are reported. Based on dynamical modelling it is concluded that the data are consistent only with a wind that extends well below the level where solar radiation is deposited. The atmospheres of the gas giant planets (Jupiter and Saturn) contain jets that dominate the circulation at visible levels1,2. The power source for these jets (solar radiation, internal heat, or both) and their vertical structure below the upper cloud are major open questions in the atmospheric circulation and meteorology of giant planets1,2,3. Several observations1 and in situ measurements4 found intense winds at a depth of 24 bar, and have been interpreted as supporting an internal heat source. This issue remains controversial5, in part because of effects from the local meteorology6. Here we report observations and modelling of two plumes in Jupiter’s atmosphere that erupted at the same latitude as the strongest jet (23° N). The plumes reached a height of 30 km above the surrounding clouds, moved faster than any other feature (169 m s-1), and left in their wake a turbulent planetary-scale disturbance containing red aerosols. On the basis of dynamical modelling, we conclude that the data are consistent only with a wind that extends well below the level where solar radiation is deposited."
https://openalex.org/W2111602046,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene product, neurofibromin, functions in part as a Ras-GAP, a negative regulator of Ras. Neurofibromin is implicated in the neuronal abnormality of NF1 patients; however, the precise cellular function of neurofibromin has yet to be clarified. Using proteomic strategies, we identified a set of neurofibromin-associating cellular proteins, including axon regulator CRMP-2 (Collapsin response mediator protein-2). CRMP-2 directly bound to the C-terminal domain of neurofibromin, and this association was regulated by the manner of CRMP-2 phosphorylation. In nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells, neurofibromin and CRMP-2 co-localized particularly on the distal tips and branches of extended neurites. Suppression of neurofibromin using NF1 small interfering RNA significantly inhibited this neurite outgrowth and up-regulated a series of CRMP-2 phosphorylations by kinases identified as CDK5, GSK-3b, and Rho kinase. Overexpression of the NF1-RAS-GAP-related domain rescued these NF1 small interfering RNA-induced events. Our results suggest that neurofibromin regulates neuronal differentiation by performing one or more complementary roles. First, neurofibromin directly regulates CRMP-2 phosphorylation accessibility through the complex formation. Also, neurofibromin appears to indirectly regulate CRMP-2 activity by suppressing CRMP-2-phosphorylating kinase cascades via its Ras-GAP function. Our study demonstrates that the functional association of neurofibromin and CRMP-2 is essential for neuronal cell differentiation and that lack of expression or abnormal regulation of neurofibromin can result in impaired function of neuronal cells, which is likely a factor in NF1-related pathogenesis.

The NF1 gene locates on chromosome 17q11.2 and encodes a large protein of 2,818 amino acids, neurofibromin (2Cawthon R.M. Weiss R. Xu G.F. Viskochil D. Culver M. Stevens J. Robertson M. Dunn D.

Because the great majority of NF1 gene mutations frequently found in NF1 patients prevents the expression of intact neurofibromin, functional disruption of neurofibromin is potentially relevant to the expression of some or all of the multiple abnormalities that occur in NF1 patients (3Costa R.M.

A region centered around 360 amino acid residues encoded by the NF1 gene shows significant homology to the known catalytic domains of mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120 GAP). This region is also similar to yeast IRA1/2 proteins, which have been shown to interact with Ras and mediate hydrolysis of Ras-bound GTP to GDP, resulting in inactivation of Ras protein function. The GAP-related domain of the NF1 gene product (NF1-GRD) also stimulates Ras GTPase and consequently inactivates Ras protein (4Guo H.F. Tong J. Hannan F. Luo L. Zhong Y.

In the region of NF1-GRD, two different isoforms (type I and type II possessing higher and lower GAP activity, respectively) formed by alternative splicing have been identified (6Yunoue S. Tokuo H. Fukunaga K. Feng L. Ozawa T. Nishi T. Kikuchi A. Hattori S. Kuratsu J. Saya H. Araki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26958-26969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated a novel role for neurofibromin on neuronal differentiation in conjunction with regulation of Ras activity via its GAP-related domain (GRD) in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells serving as a model for neuronal cells (6Yunoue S. Tokuo H. Fukunaga K. Feng L. Ozawa T. Nishi T. Kikuchi A. Hattori S. Kuratsu J. Saya H. Araki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26958-26969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, time-dependent increases in the GAP activity of cellular neurofibromin (NF1-GAP) were detected after NGF stimulation, and these increases correlated with down-regulation of Ras activity during neurite elongation. Interestingly, the NF1-GAP increases were because of induction of alternative splicing of NF1-GRD type 1, which was triggered by NGF-induced Ras activation. Dominant-negative (DN) forms of NF1-GRD type I significantly inhibited the neurite extension of PC12 cells via regulation of the Ras state. NF1-GRD-DN also reduced axonal and dendritic branching/extension of rat embryonic hippocampal neurons. These results demonstrated that mutual regulation of Ras and NF1-GAP is essential for normal neuronal differentiation. Thus, we speculated that abnormal regulation of NF1-GAP in neuronal cells may be implicated in NF1-related learning and memory disorder (6Yunoue S. Tokuo H. Fukunaga K. Feng L. Ozawa T. Nishi T. Kikuchi A. Hattori S. Kuratsu J. Saya H. Araki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26958-26969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recent studies using Nf1 gene-targeting animals have also supported our hypothesis. For example, Drosophila homozygotes with Nf1-null mutation showed significant decrements in olfactory learning performance (4Guo H.F. Tong J. Hannan F. Luo L. Zhong Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar); Nf1 heterozygous mice displayed spatial learning disability (7Xu H. Gutmann D.H. Brain Res. 1997; 759: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Li C. Cheng Y. Gutmann D.A. Mangoura D. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and mice lacking the alternatively spliced exon 23a of Nf1 exhibited specific learning impairment (8Li C. Cheng Y. Gutmann D.A. Mangoura D. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, abnormal Ras activity in Nf1 knock-out mice can disrupt learning and memory, indicating that the functional modulation of Ras by neurofibromin is essential for learning and memory. To determine the precise cellular function of neurofibromin, we recently developed an acute knockdown system for neurofibromin using NF1-siRNAs, and we studied its effects on motility in several types of cell lines (9Ozawa T. Araki N. Yunoue S. Tokuo H. Feng L. Patrakitkomjorn S. Hara T. Ichikawa Y. Matsumoto K. Fujii K. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39524-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the glioma and HeLa cells, NF1 siRNA treatment resulted in characteristic morphological changes such as abnormal actin stress fiber formation and elevated phosphorylation levels of cofilin, a protein that regulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization by depolymerizing and severing actin filaments. The elevated cofilin phosphorylation in neurofibromin-depleted cells was induced by activation of the Rho-RhoK/ROCK-LIMK2-cofilin pathway. Based on such evidence, we concluded that neurofibromin plays a significant role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility (9Ozawa T. Araki N. Yunoue S. Tokuo H. Feng L. Patrakitkomjorn S. Hara T. Ichikawa Y. Matsumoto K. Fujii K. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39524-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The above observations prompted us to postulate that neurofibromin plays a key role in regulating cytoskeletal organization during axon formation or neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells, and that functional regulation by unknown factors associated with neurofibromin could collaborate in orchestrating these phenomena. The search for NF1-associated proteins is therefore of particular interest because it may both lead to the identification of novel cellular components in Ras-related and/or other pathways, as well as further our understanding of the mechanism of NF1-related pathogenesis. In this study we analyzed the neurofibromin-associating proteins that functionally relate to neuronal cell differentiation. Using the newly established quantitative differential proteomic method, iTRAQ, more than 50 proteins were identified, including several neuronal regulating proteins. Out of the above, we focused on CRMP-2, which is known as a key molecule for axon formation and guidance. First, we observed that cellular co-localization of CRMP-2 and neurofibromin occurred especially on the neurites in NGF-treated PC12 cells. Subsequently, by suppressing neurofibromin expression using NF1 siRNA, we were able to analyze the functional association of CRMP-2 and neurofibromin in relation to the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. We observed that NF1 siRNA treatment resulted in up-regulation of a series of CRMP-2 phosphorylations and a significant inhibition of the neurite extension of NGF-treated PC12 cells. We then examined the functional correlation between CRMP-2 phosphorylation and neurofibromin suppression by analyzing specific related kinases in PC12 cells using unique proteomic strategies such as two-dimensional-DIGE combined with phosphoprotein staining and Western blotting using specific antibodies. Here we demonstrate that the neurofibromin function for neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells may involve the regulation of CRMP-2 phosphorylation via the direct interaction/complex formation with CRMP-2, and via the regulation of cellular CRMP-2 phosphorylating kinase cascades. We also discuss the implications of a functional association between neurofibromin and CRMP-2 for neuronal regulation in relation to NF1 pathogenesis.

Purification of Binding Proteins from Mouse Brain Cytosolic Fraction by GST-CTD Affinity Chromatography—Mouse brain cytosolic fraction was prepared in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1% protease inhibitors (mixture for mammalian tissues, Sigma) and 1 mm DTT, sodium fluoride (2 mm), sodium orthovanadate (2 mm), and okadaic acid (1 μm) as described (10Tokuo H. Yunoue S. Feng L. Kimoto M. Tsuji H. Ono T. Saya H. Araki N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GST-CTD fusion proteins immobilized on GSH-agarose were packed onto a column and equilibrated with buffer B (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Mouse brain cytosolic fraction was pre-cleared by passing through a GSH column and then loaded onto the GST-CTD column or GST column as a control. After washing the column with buffer A, the proteins bound to the column were eluted by the addition of buffer C (buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl) and used for the proteomic analysis. Protein concentrations of eluted samples were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) or Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Silver Staining—Gels were fixed in fixative (50% methanol and 12% acetic acid) in 0.02% formaldehyde for at least 1 h. Gels were washed in 50% ethanol three times for 20 min and pretreated for 1 min by sodium thiosulfate (0.8 mm). Gels were rinsed in distilled water three times for 20 s. Silver nitrate solution (0.2%) in 0.03% formaldehyde was used for impregnating for 20 min, following rinsing with distilled water two times for 20 s. Developing solution (0.7 m of sodium carbonate, 0.02% formaldehyde, and 16 μm of sodium thiosulfate) was used for developing. Gels were rinsed two times in distilled water for 2 min. Stopping solution (50% methanol and 12% acetic acid) was used for stopping the reaction, and gels were kept in 50% methanol. iTRAQ Sample Preparation and Quantitative Analysis—The 200 μl of protein samples (100 μg) were precipitated with 6× volume of acetone and kept overnight at -80 °C. After centrifugation of the samples at 13,000 × g for 5 min, the precipitants were kept and dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10% AcCN; then 1 μg of trypsin (Promega) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Another 1 μg of trypsin was added before incubating overnight, after which the samples were kept at -80 °C until analysis. Samples were labeled with iTRAQ tags as follows: 100 μg of duplicated protein trypsin peptide fractions eluted from the GST-CTD column were labeled with iTRAQ116 and iTRAQ117; 100 μg of duplicated fractions from GST column as controls were labeled with iTRAQ114 and -115. The labeled samples were then all mixed, desalted, and subjected to LC-ESI-QQ-TOF and LC-MALDI-TOF-TOF MS analysis using the UltiMate NanoLC system (LCPackings A Dionex Company), the API QSTAR Pulsar i, or the 4700 Proteomics analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Obtained data were processed with iTRAQ quantitative analysis software ProQuant version 1.1 for ESI-QQ-TOF MS or GPS Explorer version 3.1 for MALDI-TOF-TOF MS (Applied Biosystems) and MASCOT (Matrix Science). Immunoprecipitation Assays—Mouse brain was homogenized with lysis buffer A containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian tissues (Sigma) and 1 mm DTT, sodium fluoride (2 mm), sodium orthovanadate (2 mm), and okadaic acid (1 μm) as the phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were mixed with the indicated antibodies for 3 h and then mixed with appropriate protein A or G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. The beads were washed with buffer A, and boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred into PVDF membrane electrophoretically, and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with the indicated antibodies. After reaction with horseradish peroxidase- or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies, the reacted protein pattern on the membrane was visualized by an ECL detection system or by scanning with fluorescent scanner Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare), respectively. Binding Assay of CRMP-2 to Neurofibromin Fragments in Vitro—The GST fusion neurofibromin fragment proteins (GST-CSRD-(543-909), GST-GRD-(1168-1530), GST-CTD-(2260-2818)), or GST (500 μg) purified from E. coli were immobilized on GSH-agarose beads and packed onto columns. CRMP-2 protein (500 μg) was prepared after the thrombin (48 units) treatment of GST-CRMP-2 in thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 40 min at room temperature, followed by the gel filtration. Purified CRMP-2 was applied to the neurofibromin fragment columns and washed with buffer A, and the bound CRMP-2 on each column was eluted by 2× SDS loading buffer. The eluted fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane electrophoretically, and subjected to the immunoblotting analysis with anti-CRMP-2 antibody. To check the purity of thrombin-cleaved CRMP-2 and GST-neurofibromin fragments (GST-CSRD, -GRD, -CTD), each protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and their patterns analyzed after staining with Simply Blue (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Quantitative Western Blotting Analysis—After immunoblotting detection, the ECL patterns were scanned using LabScan 5.0 (GE Healthcare) with transparent mode and resolution 300 dpi, and Cy5 patterns were processed by fluorescence scanner Typhoon 9400. The intensities were measured using ProGenesis Work station version 2005 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) with background subtraction and normalization by total spot volume mode. The intensity of each spot was recorded as digital data, and processed by Microsoft Office Excel. Experimental values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Paired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's test was used to identify significant differences where appropriate. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Cell Culture, Stimulation, Transfection, and Preparation of Cell Lysates—PC12 cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Transfection into cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PC12 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (WAKO) for up to 72 h. For preparation of cellular lysates, cells were solubilized with NF1 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) and passed through a 25-gauge syringe 20 times. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). siRNA—Four target sequences for Rat NF1 siRNA were designed as follows: a 21-oligonucleotide siRNA duplex was designed as recommended elsewhere (9Ozawa T.

Annealing of the component strands of each siRNA and transfection were performed as described (9Ozawa T. Araki N. Yunoue S. Tokuo H. Feng L. Patrakitkomjorn S. Hara T. Ichikawa Y. Matsumoto K. Fujii K. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39524-39533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). FITC-labeled rat NF1 sequence (FITC-249 NF1 siRNA) was also synthesized by Gene Link. A 27-oligonucleotide siRNA duplex was designed and synthesized by iGENE therapeutics (Japan) to target the rat NF1 sequence 5′-GAAAGGGGCUUGAAGUUAAUGUCAAAG-3′. For control siRNAs, a 27-oligonucleotide siRNA duplex scramble sequence by iGENE therapeutics (Japan), and a double-stranded RNA targeting human NF1 gene (5′-609AACTTCGGAATTCTGCCTCTG629-3′) were used as a control. Immunofluorescence Analysis—PC12 cells grown on a 35-mm culture dish were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After being washed with PBS, cells were incubated in primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with a fluorescent dye for 60 min at room temperature, or the cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin to stain cellular actin for 60 min at room temperature. Analysis was performed with a confocal microscope (Fluoview, FV300, Olympus) or fluorescence microscope (with 20 × 1.6 Olympus IX71) (DPController, DPManager). Time-lapse Video Analysis—Cells were placed on a collagen-coated glass-bottom plate with 6 wells (Iwaki). Dishes were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in the chamber set under the camera, during the observation. Images were obtained using a 20× UPlan Apo objective (Olympus). The camera, shutters, and filter wheel were controlled by MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging), and the images were collected every 5 min with exposure times of 100 ms. Through-focus z-series stacks consisting of three frames were acquired at each time point. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Two-dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE)—Mouse brain or PC12 cell lysates (10-50 μg), after desalting using two-dimensional-clean up kit (Amersham Biosciences), were mixed with 125 μl of rehydration solution (8 m urea, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.2% (w/v) DTT, 0.5% (v/v) IPG buffer) and loaded into strip holders for first-dimension isoelectric focusing. IPG strips (pH 4-7) (Amersham Biosciences) were used and allowed to re-swell for 12 h. Strips were equilibrated in a two-step process in equilibration solution (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m of urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) for 15 min each step. In step one, 1 mm DTT was added; in step two, 1 mm iodoacetamide was added. Strips were then subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (10% gel, 7 × 7 or 13 × 13 cm2). The proteins separated in two-dimensional gels were stained with protein staining solutions or transferred onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes, and protein patterns were obtained using specific antibodies. The two-dimensional pattern images on the gels or membranes were visualized with fluorescence probes or ECL (GE Healthcare) and scanned by a confocal fluorescence scanner Typhoon 9400 (GE Healthcare). For two-dimensional DIGE, mouse brain or PC12 cell lysates (10-50 μg) were labeled with 400 pmol of CyDye DIGE Fluor minimal dyes (GE Healthcare) freshly dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide. The labeling mixture was incubated on ice in the dark for 30 min, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 10 nmol of lysine. Equal volumes of 2× sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2 mg/ml DTT, 1% (v/v) IPG buffer, pH 4-7) were added to each of the labeled protein samples. The two samples were mixed prior to isoelectric focusing by IPG strip and subjected to the two-dimensional PAGE as described above. Staining of the Two-dimensional Gels by ProQuant Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain and SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain—For ProQuant Diamond staining, two-dimensional gels were fixed in 50% methanol containing 10% acetic acid once for 30 min and again for overnight. Gels were washed three times in water for 10 min and stained with ProQuant Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain (Invitrogen) in the dark for 60-90 min and then washed with destain solution (5% of 1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 20% acetonitrile) three times for 30 min. Gels were washed twice with water for 5 min and scanned by Typhoon. For SYPRO Ruby gel staining, gels were fixed in 50% methanol containing 7% acetic acid for 30 min, stained in SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Invitrogen) for 3 h, and washed with 10% methanol containing 10% acetic acid for 30 min. The fluorescent images were scanned with Typhoon 9400, visualized, and processed as digital data with data mining software ImageQuant version 5.2, DeCyder (GE Healthcare), and ProGenesis Work station version 2005 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The Identification of Neurofibromin C-terminal Associating Proteins—To isolate proteins that physically associate with neurofibromin, we used the C-terminal domain (CTD), one of the crucial regions in regulating neurofibromin function (10Tokuo H.

Mouse brain cytosolic lysates were loaded onto the affinity column with immobilized GST-CTD or GST. Associating proteins on both columns were eluted using high salt elution buffer. The concentration of eluted protein from the GST-CTD column was 3.7 times higher than that from the control column (Fig. 1A).

The regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is synthesized by two distinct classes of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs), the type I and II PIPKs. Although numerous physiological functions have been identified for type I PIPKs, little is known about the functions and regulation of type II PIPK. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified an interaction between the type IIβ PIPK isoform (PIPKIIβ) and SPOP (speckle-type POZ domain protein), a nuclear speckle-associated protein that recruits substrates to Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases. PIPKIIβ and SPOP interact and co-localize at nuclear speckles in mammalian cells, and SPOP mediates the ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ by Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases. Additionally, stimulation of the p38 MAPK pathway enhances the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cul3-SPOP toward multiple substrate proteins. Finally, a kinase-dead PIPKIIβ mutant enhanced ubiquitylation of Cul3-SPOP substrates. The kinase-dead PIPKIIβ mutant increases the cellular content of its substrate lipid phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P), suggesting that PI5P may stimulate Cul3-SPOP activity through a p38-dependent signaling pathway. Expression of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatases that generate PI5P dramatically stimulated Cul3-SPOP activity and was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Taken together, these data define a novel mechanism whereby the phosphoinositide PI5P leads to stimulation of Cul3-SPOP ubiquitin ligase activity and also implicate PIPKIIβ as a key regulator of this signaling pathway through its association with the Cul3-SPOP complex.

These phosphatidylinositol phosphate isomers in turn selectively modulate the activities of effector proteins. In the cytosol, phosphoinositides regulate numerous processes, including actin polymerization, focal adhesion dynamics, ion channel activity, growth factor receptor signaling, and vesicle trafficking (1Bairstow S.F.

In the nucleus, an autonomous phosphoinositide cycle regulates processes, including differentiation, proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis (5Bunce M.W. Bergendahl K. Anderson R.A.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) is a critical phosphoinositide in eukaryotic cells. PI-4,5-P2 is not only itself a potent signaling molecule but is also a precursor of other second messengers such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and diacylglycerol. Because of its multipotent signaling capacity, the regulated synthesis of PI-4,5-P2 is essential for eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, PI-4,5-P2 is synthesized by two classes of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs) (6Anderson R.A. Boronenkov I.V. Doughman S.D. Kunz J. Loijens J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9907-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Type I PIPKs (PIPKIs) preferentially use phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate as a substrate to synthesize PI-4,5-P2, whereas type II PIPKs (PIPKIIs) generate PI-4,5-P2 from PI5P in a catalytically distinct reaction. Type I PIPKs modulate numerous cellular processes, including motility, focal adhesion assembly/disassembly, and vesicular trafficking (1Bairstow S.F. Ling K. Su X. Firestone A.J. Carbonara C.

Although both PIPK subfamilies synthesize PI-4,5-P2, PIPKIIs are functionally non-redundant with PIPKIs (7Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that PIPKIIβ is present within the nucleus at nuclear speckles, suggesting a role for PIPKIIβ in nuclear signaling pathways (10Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, PIPKIIβ and its substrate PI5P have recently been implicated within cellular stress-response pathways in the nucleus (11Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D.

The ubiquitylation and degradation of proteins is essential both for constitutive protein turnover as well as for the modulation of signaling pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. Ubiquitylation involves a three-step process in which ubiquitin is primed by an activating enzyme (E1), transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2), and finally attached to a designated protein substrate by a ubiquitin ligase (E3). Specificity is mediated primarily by the multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligases, which recruit unique substrates through a number of modular specificity factors. One of the best known E3 ubiquitin ligases in eukaryotes is the SCF (Skp1/Cul1/F-box) complex, a modular ubiquitin ligase assembled on the cullin protein Cul1. In addition to Cul1, six other cullins (Cul2, -3, -4A, -4B, 5, and -7) have been identified in humans. Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases are an emerging member of this family (13Furukawa M. He Y.J.

Substrate specificity of Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases is dictated by BTB (Broad complex/Tramtrack/bric-a-brac) domain-containing proteins that bind directly to Cul3 through their BTB domain and bind substrates through a second protein-protein interaction domain (13Furukawa M.

A central theme in the regulation of phosphoinositide signaling pathways is the interaction of enzymes such as PIPKs with upstream regulators and downstream effectors at discrete subcellular sites. To better understand the function and regulation of nuclear phosphoinositide signaling pathways, we sought to identify proteins that interact with PIPKIIβ. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified an interaction between PIPKIIβ and speckle-type POZ domain protein (SPOP), a nuclear speckle-associated BTB domain protein, and substrate adaptor for Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases (13Furukawa M.

We demonstrate that PIPKIIβ and SPOP interact in vitro and in vivo and co-localize at nuclear speckles in HeLa cells. We also demonstrate that Cul3-SPOP mediates the ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ in vivo, and that the ubiquitylation of multiple Cul3-SPOP substrates is potently stimulated by the MKK6-p38 MAPK pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that PI5P, the product of the PI-4,5-P2 4-phosphatases and the lipid substrate of PIPKIIβ, stimulates Cul3-SPOP activity, and this was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Taken together, our data support a novel signaling pathway in which PI5P and PIPKIIβ regulate Cul3-SPOP ubiquitin ligase activity through p38 MAPK. Cell Culture and Antibodies—HEK293 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. MG132 (Boston Biochem, Boston), SB203580, and SP600125 (EMD Bioscience, San Diego) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the media where indicated. α-GST and α-T7 antibodies were purchased from EMD Bioscience. α-Myc and α-hemagglutinin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). α-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. cDNA Synthesis and Cloning—Total cellular RNA for cDNA synthesis was prepared from HEK293 cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs for SPOP, Cul3, and MKK6 were generated from total cellular RNA using the Qiagen One-step reverse transcription-PCR kit. Sequenced cDNAs were cloned into bacterial and mammalian expression vectors as described in the text. cDNA expression constructs for the mammalian PI-4,5-P2 4-phosphatases were a generous gift from Dr. Philip Majerus (Washington University, St. Louis). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The PIPKIIβ cDNA was submitted to the University of Wisconsin Molecular Interaction Facility for two-hybrid screening. The kinase insert domain of PIP-KIIβ (Asp287-Met365) was cloned into a GAL4 fusion vector and screened against human five cDNA libraries according to Molecular Interaction Facility protocols. Expression and Purification Recombinant Proteins—For expression of recombinant proteins, bacterial expression constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3)-competent cells (Novagen). Liquid cultures were inoculated with a single colony, and recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Following expression, bacteria were lysed by sonication in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and Complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). His6 and GST fusion proteins were purified on HisTrap HP and GSTrap FF affinity columns, respectively (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST Pulldown and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—For GST pulldown assays, equimolar amounts of purified recombinant protein were incubated in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8 in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). After 4 h at 4 °C, the resin was pelleted at low speed and washed three times in reaction buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the resin by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, HEK293 cells were transfected via calcium phosphate precipitation by standard methods. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and lysed by low amplitude sonication in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g, and supernatant was recovered. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 3 μg of antibody and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose resin per ml of cell lysate. After incubation at 25 °C for 3 h, the resin was pelleted and washed three times in lysis buffer. Bound protein was eluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were washed in cold PBS and fixed in methanol. Primary antibodies were diluted to 1 μg/ml in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 + 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated on the coverslips at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed three times with PBST and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed with PBST, coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Visualization was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope (W. M. Keck Laboratory for Biological Imaging, Madison, WI). In Vivo Ubiquitylation Assays—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated combinations of expression vectors by calcium phosphate precipitation. 24 h after transfection, MG132 was added to the media at a final concentration of 10 μm, and cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed in PBS with 8 m urea and 0.2% SDS, and sonicated to reduce viscosity. Lysates were incubated for 3 h at 25 °C with nickel-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the resin three times with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted in sample buffer, resolved via SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot. The Kinase Insert Domain of PIPKIIβ Is Necessary and Sufficient for Nuclear Targeting—We have demonstrated previously the presence of the type Iα and type IIβ PIPK isoforms within mammalian nuclei, including their targeting to nuclear speckles (10Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To identify the domain within PIPKIIβ required for its nuclear targeting, a panel of deletion mutants was generated, and their subcellular distributions were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The kinase insert domain of PIPKIIβ was required for nuclear localization, as its deletion prevented nuclear targeting of PIPKIIβ (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with previous reports that an acidic α-helix within the kinase insert domain promotes nuclear targeting of PIPKIIβ (36Ciruela A. Hinchliffe K.A. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 37Richardson J.P. Wang M. Clarke J.H. Patel K.J. Irvine R.F. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether the PIPKIIβ kinase insert domain is sufficient for PIPKIIβ nuclear targeting, the kinase insert was fused to LacZ, and its subcellular localization was examined. Whereas a LacZ control was localized entirely within the cytosol, the kinase insert fusion (Ins-LacZ) targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 1B). These results identified the kinase insert domain of PIPKIIβ as being both necessary and sufficient for its nuclear targeting. Identification of SPOP as a PIPKIIβ-binding Protein—Although the PIPKIIβ kinase insert mediates nuclear translocation, it does not contain a canonical nuclear localization signal. We therefore hypothesized that PIPKIIβ is targeted to the nucleus through its association with interacting partners. To identify proteins that interact with PIPKIIβ, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen against several human cDNA libraries using the PIPKIIβ kinase insert domain as bait (Fig. 2A). One of the proteins identified by the two-hybrid screen was SPOP (speckle-type POZ domain protein) (Fig. 2A), a nuclear speckle-associated protein and a substrate specificity factor for Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases (18Hernandez-Munoz I.

SPOP Interacts Specifically with PIPKIIβ in Vitro and in Vivo—The interaction between PIPKIIβ and SPOP was assessed using both in vitro and in vivo binding assays. To assess their in vitro association, GST pulldown assays were performed with recombinant purified GST-SPOP and His6-PIPKIIβ. PIPKIIβ was specifically retained by GST-SPOP but not by GST alone (Fig. 2B), confirming their interaction. SPOP contains two conserved domains: an N-terminal MATH (Meprin and Traf Homology) domain and a C-terminal BTB domain. To assess the contribution of each domain to the interaction between SPOP and PIPKIIβ, GST pulldown assays were performed with purified recombinant GST-MATH and GST-BTB proteins. PIPKIIβ co-precipitated with GST-MATH but not GST-BTB (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that SPOP interacts with PIPKIIβ through its MATH domain. To assess the specificity of SPOP for PIPKIIβ, the highly similar PIPKIIα isoform was also tested. Despite ∼80% primary sequence identity between the two PIPKII isoforms, SPOP did not interact with PIPKIIα (Fig. 2C). The interaction between PIPKIIβ and SPOP was also tested in vivo. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression constructs of PIPKIIβ and SPOP. Twenty four hours after transfection, PIPKIIβ and SPOP were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and probed by Western blot. PIPKIIβ and SPOP co-precipitated with each other, confirming their in vivo interaction (Fig. 3). Similar to in vitro results, PIPKIIα did not co-precipitate with SPOP. The interaction of endogenous PIPKIIβ and SPOP was also assessed. Endogenous PIPKIIβ was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 lysates using either an α-PIPKIIβ antibody or normal rabbit IgG. Western blot analysis identified endogenous SPOP in the PIPKIIβ immunoprecipitates, thus confirming the interaction of endogenous PIP-KIIβ and SPOP proteins (Fig. 3C). PIPKIIβ Co-localizes with SPOP at Nuclear Speckles—Having confirmed their interaction, we next assessed whether PIP-KIIβ and SPOP co-localize within the nucleus. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with SPOP and PIPKIIβ, and their subcellular distributions were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. A distinct pool of PIPKIIβ co-localized with SPOP at nuclear speckles (Fig. 4). In contrast, PIPKIIα was present exclusively within the cytosol. PIPKIIβ and PIPKIIα share ∼80% primary sequence identity, with the greatest regions of diversity at the N and C termini and within the kinase insert domain. The specific interaction and co-localization of SPOP with PIPKIIβ therefore suggested that the PIPKIIβ kinase insert is necessary for its co-localization with SPOP at nuclear speckles. To test this hypothesis, chimeric PIPKII mutants were generated in which the kinase insert domains of PIPKIIα and PIPKIIβ were exchanged, and their subcellular distributions were analyzed. PIPKIIα(IIβ KI), which contains the PIPKIIβ kinase insert, co-localized with SPOP at nuclear speckles similar to wild type PIPKIIβ. Conversely, PIPKIIβ(IIα KI), which contains the PIPKIIα kinase insert, showed a cytosolic distribution similar to wild type PIPKIIα. These results demonstrate that the PIPKIIβ kinase insert domain mediates its co-localization with SPOP at nuclear speckles. SPOP Promotes the Ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ by Cul3-based Ubiquitin Ligases—The Cul3-SPOP ubiquitin ligase complex has been shown to mediate the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of Daxx (19Kwon J.E. La M. Oh K.H. Oh Y.M. Kim G.R. Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Bang O.S. Joe C.O. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12664-12672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether Cul3-SPOP also promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of PIP-KIIβ. To assess PIPKIIβ turnover, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with Cul3, SPOP, and the RING-box protein Rbx1, which is required for the activation of cullin-based ligases (21Gong L. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12036-12042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Endogenous PIPKIIβ levels were assessed by Western blot either 24 or 48 h after transfection. Interestingly, no discernible change in endogenous PIPKIIβ protein levels was detected in transfected cells (data not shown), suggesting that the Cul3-SPOP ubiquitin ligase may not promote PIPKIIβ turnover. However, as only a fraction of PIPKIIβ (∼20%) is nuclear, it would be difficult to detect enhanced turnover of nuclear PIP-KIIβ in the context of the total cellular PIPKIIβ. Next, the ability of Cul3-SPOP to ubiquitylate PIPKIIβ was tested. PIPKIIβ was co-expressed in HEK293 cells with Cul3, Rbx1, SPOP, and His6-ubiquitin. After treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, cell lysates were purified over nickel resin to capture ubiquitylated proteins (22Jaffray E.G. Hay R.T. Methods (San Diego). 2006; 38: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the Cul3-SPOP complex promoted ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ, detected as a ladder of high molecular weight protein by Western blot (Fig. 5A). Efficient ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ required the Cul3-SPOP complex, as excluding either SPOP or Cul3 and Rbx1 failed to generate ubiquitylated PIPKIIβ. To assess the specificity of the Cul3-SPOP ligase complex for PIPKIIβ, ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ and PIPKIIα was compared. In contrast to PIPKIIβ, no ubiquitylation of PIPKIIα was observed (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that SPOP specifically promotes ubiquitylation of PIPKIIβ in vivo. PIPKIIβ Ubiquitylation by Cul3-SPOP Is Stimulated by MKK6/p38 MAPK—p38 MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate PIPKIIβ in response to UV irradiation and oxidative stress, thereby repressing PIPKIIβ lipid kinase activity (12Jones D.R. Bultsma Y. Keune W.J. Halstead J.R. Elouarrat D. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. D'Santos C.S. Divecha N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that p38 might also modulate PIPKIIβ ubiquitylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, a constitutively active mutant of the p38-activating kinase MKK6 (MKK6+) dramatically enhanced PIPKIIβ ubiquitylation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5C). The MKK6-dependent p38 MAPK activation was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580, further supporting a role for p38 in PIPKIIβ ubiquitylation. Importantly, MKK6+ did not promote PIPKIIβ ubiquitylation in the absence of the Cul3-SPOP complex (Fig. 5C), confirming that Cul3-SPOP is required for p38-stimulated ubiquitylation. PIPKIIβ is phosphorylated at Ser326 by p38 MAPK, and phosphorylation is sufficient to inhibit PIPKIIβ lipid kinase activity in vitro (12Jones D.R. Bultsma Y. Keune W.J. Halstead J.R. Elouarrat D. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. D'Santos C.S. Divecha N. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of PIPKIIβ at Ser326 also modulates its ubiquitylation, the ability of MKK6+ to stimulate ubiquitylation of a PIPKIIβ(S326A) point mutant was assessed. Interestingly, PIPKIIβ(S326A) ubiquitylation was stimulated by MKK6+ similar to wild type PIPKIIβ (Fig. 5D). Thus p38 MAPK stimulates PIPKIIβ ubiquitylation by a mechanism independent of Ser326 phosphorylation. PI5P Activates Cul3-SPOP Ubiquitin Ligase Activity toward Multiple Substrates through a Pathway Inhibited by SB203580—Because PIPKIIβ associates with Cul3-SPOP, we hypothesized that PIPKIIβ ubiquitylation might be modulated by changes in local concentrations of either PI5P or PI-4,5-P2. Previous studies demonstrate that inhibiting PIPKIIβ, for example by p38-dependent attenuation of PIPKIIβ activity or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous PIPKIIβ, or expression of the kinase-dead PIPKIIβ, causes an increase in cellular PI5P levels (11Gozani O.

https://openalex.org/W1986022352,"TATA-binding protein (TBP) is essential for eukaryotic gene transcription. Human TBP contains a polymorphic polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in its N terminus and a DNA-binding domain in its highly conserved C terminus. Expansion of the polyQ domain to >42 glutamines typically results in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17), a neurodegenerative disorder that resembles Huntington disease. Our recent studies have demonstrated that polyQ expansion causes abnormal interaction of TBP with the general transcription factor TFIIB and induces neurodegeneration in transgenic SCA17 mice (Friedman, M. J., Shah, A. G., Fang, Z. H., Ward, E. G., Warren, S. T., Li, S., and Li, X. J. (2007) Nat. Neurosci. 10, 1519-1528). However, it remains unknown how polyQ expansion influences DNA binding by TBP. Here we report that polyQ expansion reduces in vitro binding of TBP to DNA and that mutant TBP fragments lacking an intact C-terminal DNA-binding domain are present in transgenic SCA17 mouse brains. polyQ-expanded TBP with a deletion spanning part of the DNA-binding domain does not bind DNA in vitro but forms nuclear aggregates and inhibits TATA-dependent transcription activity in cultured cells. When this TBP double mutant is expressed in transgenic mice, it forms nuclear inclusions in neurons and causes early death. These findings suggest that the polyQ tract affects the binding of TBP to promoter DNA and that polyQ-expanded TBP can induce neuronal toxicity independent of its interaction with DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2091319903,"Kv1.3 activity is determined by raft association. In addition to Kv1.3, leukocytes also express Kv1.5, and both channels control physiological responses. Because the oligomeric composition may modify the channel targeting to the membrane, we investigated heterotetrameric Kv1.3/Kv1.5 channel traffic and targeting in HEK cells. Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 generate multiple heterotetramers with differential surface expression according to the subunit composition. FRET analysis and pharmacology confirm the presence of functional hybrid channels. Raft association was evaluated by cholesterol depletion, caveolae colocalization, and lateral diffusion at the cell surface. Immunoprecipitation showed that both Kv1.3 and heteromeric channels associate with caveolar raft domains. However, homomeric Kv1.3 channels showed higher association with caveolin traffic. Moreover, FRAP analysis revealed higher mobility for hybrid Kv1.3/Kv1.5 than Kv1.3 homotetramers, suggesting that heteromers target to distinct surface microdomains. Studies with lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages further supported that different physiological mechanisms govern Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 targeting to rafts. Our results implicate the traffic and localization of Kv1.3/Kv1.5 heteromers in the complex regulation of immune system cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066972125,"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs plays an important role in generating biological and functional diversity. Neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 (Nova1) is a neuron-specific splicing factor that controls the alternative processing of a wide array of mRNAs important for synaptic activity. It is essential for the proper development of the mammalian motor system and for the survival of motoneurons. Because Nova1 gene contains putative regulatory AU-rich elements (ARE) in its highly conserved 3′-untranslated region, we investigated whether its expression is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms mediated by ARE-binding proteins. Among these, the neuronal ELAV (nELAV) factors are interesting candidates, because their RNA binding activity is necessary for neuronal differentiation and maintenance. By analysis of ribonucleoprotein complexes in vivo and in vitro we demonstrated that the Nova1 mRNA is a novel target of the nELAV proteins. We defined the nELAV binding site by functional experiments with luciferase reporter gene and Nova1 3′-untranslated region deletion sequences. Gene silencing and overexpression of the nELAV member HuD in motoneuronal NSC34 cells indicate that Nova1 mRNA stability and translation are positively and strongly controlled by the nELAV proteins. In addition, nELAV phosphorylation by a PKC-dependent pathway induces the recruitment of Nova1 mRNA to polysomes. Noteworthy, we found that nELAV proteins are also able to modulate Nova1 splicing activity on its target genes. Our data indicate nELAV proteins as the first factors affecting the expression and activity of the neuronal splicing regulator Nova1 and, consequently, as major candidates for the physiological modulation of Nova1-dependent processing of pre-mRNAs in neurons.

Nova1 protein is mainly localized in the ventral spinal cord and midbrain, whereas Nova2, the other member of the Nova RBP family, shows a different and complementary expression pattern, being involved in the control of pre-mRNA processing in other two brain regions, the neocortex and the hippocampus (5Yang Y.Y.

Nova1 and Nova2 genes are highly homologue and phylogenetically conserved, but profoundly differ in their 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) sequences. Whereas the long Nova1 3′-UTR is well conserved in mammals (97% identity between man and mouse) and enriched in regulatory AU-rich consensus elements (ARE), the shorter Nova2 3′-UTR is more variable among orthologs. These observations suggest that post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms may participate in the control of the differential expression of the two Nova genes in the nervous system. neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1 AU-rich element 3′-untranslated region embryonic lethal abnormal vision system RNA-binding proteins RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays short hairpin RNA 5,6-dichlorobenzamidazole riboside phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate reverse transcriptase human embryonic kidney protein kinase C. Post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms, indeed, rely on specific cis-acting elements present in the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs, and on RBPs and non-coding RNAs as trans-acting factors that specifically recognize and bind such regulatory elements (8Keene J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). RBPs are important determinants of gene expression, controlling distinct steps of mRNA life such as splicing, transport, stability, translation, and degradation (9Moore M.J. Science. 2005; 309: 1514-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Together with ubiquitous factors, tissue-specific RBPs are responsible for the development and maintenance of differentiated cells and tissues, strongly influencing their proteome composition (10Perrone-Bizzozero N. Bolognani F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 68: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). RBP-mediated post-transcriptional mechanisms are particularly relevant during embryogenesis and in highly specialized cells such as neurons, because they allow a precise spatio-temporal control of gene expression, a subcellular compartmentalization of mRNAs, and a fast modulation of mRNA translation. The great potentiality and complexity of these regulatory processes are well described by the post-transcriptional operon or RNA regulon model (8Keene J.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 11Keene J.D. Tenenbaum S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1161-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In this model the fate of a single mRNA may be predicted to be differentially and combinatorially controlled by specific and dynamic sets of RBPs in distinct cell conditions and/or developmental stages, as clearly verified in yeast (12Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E79Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Among the trans-acting factors potentially involved in the post-transcriptional control of Nova1 gene expression, we identified the highly conserved ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision system) proteins as interesting candidates in the nervous system. In mammals the three ELAV family members, HuB, HuC, and HuD, are selectively expressed in neurons, whereas the fourth member, HuR, is ubiquitous (13Pascale A. Amadio M. Quattrone A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). ELAV RBPs act as mRNA stabilizing factors and translational enhancers by binding to AREs in the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs that are usually characterized by high turnover rates (14Antic D. Keene J.D. Am.

In this paper we investigated whether the neuronal splicing factor Nova1, which is essential for motoneuron survival, is a target of the ARE-binding proteins nELAV. In the motoneuronal cell line NSC34 we show that nELAV proteins bind and post-transcriptionally regulate Nova1 mRNA, increasing its stability and translation and, most importantly, modulating Nova1 activity as a splicing factor. NSC34 Cell Culture and Treatments—The motoneuronal cell line NSC34 (a kind gift of N. R. Cashman, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient and stable transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Puromycin (1 μg/ml) was used for selection and maintenance of stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfectants. Neurite length was measured using QWin Plus 3.3 software (Leica Microsystems) on five independent images for a total of more than 600 cells per condition. NSC34 cells were exposed to 50 μm 5,6-dichlorobenzamidazole riboside (DRB), 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or to the solvent (Me2SO) alone for the indicated time. All reagents were purchased from Sigma. mRNP Isolation and Immunoprecipitation—Isolation of endogenous mRNPs was conducted as already described (20Ratti A. Fallini C. Cova L. Fantozzi R. Calzarossa C. Zennaro E. Pascale A. Quattrone A. Silani V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 NSC34 cells were harvested and resuspended in RNP buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm dithiothreitol) plus a protease inhibitory mixture (Roche). NSC34 lysates (350 μg) were incubated in NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) together with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) pre-coated with 5 μg of the pan-neuronal ELAV (16A11, Invitrogen) or the isotopic IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. An aliquot (10%) of the reaction mixture was collected as the initial input for sample normalization and total RNA was then extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. mRNAs were phenol-chloroform extracted from immunoprecipitated mRNPs after digestion with proteinase K for 30 min, retrotranscribed, and quantitated by real time PCR. Data were analyzed as previously reported (20Ratti A. Fallini C. Cova L. Fantozzi R. Calzarossa C. Zennaro E. Pascale A. Quattrone A. Silani V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Real Time Quantitative PCR—mRNA retro transcription was performed after DNase I (Roche) treatment using SuperScriptII RT (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. Oligonucleotide pairs for each gene were designed with Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) on exon boundaries (for primer sequences see supplemental materials Table 1). Real time PCR was performed for 40 cycles with SYBR Green PCR Master mixture (Applied Biosystems) and processed on ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were run in triplicate for each sample and a dissociation curve was generated at the end. Threshold cycles (Ct) for each tested gene were normalized on the housekeeping Rpl10a gene value (ΔCt) and every experimental sample was referred to its control (ΔΔCt). -Fold change values were expressed as 2–ΔΔCt. Plasmid Constructs—Nova1 3′-UTR full-length and deletion fragments were RT-PCR amplified from mouse total brain RNA and cloned in pCRII vector (Invitrogen). For luciferase activity assays, Nova1 A1 deletion fragments were XbaI cloned 3′ of the Renilla reporter gene in the pGL4.71P vector (Promega). For shRNA gene silencing assay, a double-stranded oligonucleotide complementary and specific for the murine HuD sequence was BglII/HindIII cloned into the pSUPER.retro vector modified in the linker region (a kind gift of G. Pelicci, IEO, Milan, Italy). All primer sequences are reported in supplemental materials Table 2. All clones and their orientation were validated by sequencing. Single nELAV cDNAs and the corresponding recombinant proteins were obtained as previously described (20Ratti A. Fallini C. Cova L. Fantozzi R. Calzarossa C. Zennaro E. Pascale A. Quattrone A. Silani V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-HuD plasmid containing the human HuD cDNA was a kind gift of N. I. Perrone-Bizzozero (University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM). In Vitro Transcription, RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (REMSA), and UV Cross-linking—Radiolabeled riboprobes were obtained by transcribing 0.5 μg of restriction enzyme-linearized construct DNA in the presence of 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP as already described (20Ratti A. Fallini C. Cova L. Fantozzi R. Calzarossa C. Zennaro E. Pascale A. Quattrone A. Silani V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting riboprobes were purified on ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumns (GE Healthcare). For REMSA experiments, 300,000 cpm of 32P-labeled riboprobe were incubated with 10 ng of each recombinant nELAV protein for 10 min at room temperature in 25 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 μg/μl tRNA). For competition assays, 2- and 4-fold excess of unlabeled RNA was preincubated for 20 min with a mixture of the three recombinant nELAV proteins prior to the addition of the radioactive Nova1 riboprobe. Samples were then run on a 5% PAGE in TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (20Ratti A. Fallini C. Cova L. Fantozzi R. Calzarossa C. Zennaro E. Pascale A. Quattrone A. Silani V. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1442-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the pan-neuronal ELAV (Invitrogen) or the irrelevant IgG antibody. HEK293T Cell Culture and Luciferase Assay—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For each experimental condition, 300,000 cells were plated in duplicate and transfected using 2 μl of Lipofectamine Plus and 200 ng of each construct (Renilla-A1 subclones and pEGFP-HuD) and 200 ng of firefly reporter vector (pGL3P, Promega). Measurement of the luciferase activity was performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) 24 h after transfection. The Renilla luciferase activity of the Nova1 3′-UTR constructs was normalized against the firefly luciferase output. Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Total mouse brain and NSC34 cells were homogenized in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and supernatants were collected. Proteins from different cell fractions were obtained as previously described (26Pascale A. Fortino I. Govoni S. Trabucchi M. Wetsel W.C. Battaini F. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2471-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with Nova1 (Upstate Biotechnology), PKCα (Transduction Laboratories), HuR, α-tubulin, phosphothreonine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and phosphoserine (Sigma) antibodies. The capability of the HuR antibody to also detect nELAV proteins was tested on tissues of different origin (supplemental materials Fig. S1). Densitometric analyses were performed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Analysis of Alternative Splicing Isoforms—Total RNA, isolated from NSC34 stable transfectants using TRIzol reagent, was treated with DNase I and retrotranscribed as described above. The obtained cDNA was quantified by real time PCR using primers for the housekeeping Rpl10a gene so that an equal amount for each sample was employed in the subsequent PCR amplification. Primers for Neogenin and Jnk2 splicing isoforms were designed as previously reported (27Dredge B.K. Stefani G. Engelhard C.C. Darnell R.B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Ule J. Jensen K.B. Ruggiu M. Mele A. Ule A. Darnell R.B. Science. 2003; 302: 1212-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). 50 pmol of each forward primer were radiolabeled with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche). PCR amplification was then performed using 300 nm of each primer and Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystem) for 25–30 cycles. Amplicons were run on 6% PAGE in TBE buffer and dried gels were visualized by autoradiography. For detection of Jnk2 splicing isoforms, PCR products were digested with RsaI restriction enzyme (Roche) prior to PAGE as described (28Ule J. Jensen K.B. Ruggiu M. Mele A. Ule A. Darnell R.B. Science. 2003; 302: 1212-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Isolation of Polysomes—Polysomes were isolated from 1 × 107 NSC34 cells by a sucrose discontinuous density gradient (1.3/1.9/2.5 m) as described (29Mechler B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation at 90,000 × g for 5 h, the 1.3/1.9 m interface representing the polysomal fraction was collected. The sample was then diluted in gradient buffer (150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 8 h. Total RNA was immediately isolated from the final pellet using TRIzol reagent. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 20 min, blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Invitrogen), and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. The pan-neuronal ELAV (1:40) and Nova1 (1:500) antibodies were used for 70 min at 37 °C and detected by Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. As a negative control, primary antibodies were replaced by normal goat serum. Slides were mounted with Fluorsave (Calbiochem) and acquired by optical (DMIRE2/HCS, Leica Microsystems) and confocal (CS SP2 AOBS, Leica Microsystems) microscopes. nELAV Proteins Associate with Nova1 mRNA in Vivo—The murine Nova1 3′-UTR sequence is very long (5.4 kb) and is 97% identical to the shorter 1.9-kb long human ortholog. This highly conserved region contains putative ARE signatures scattered along the entire sequence. Its secondary structure was predicted by the Sfold algorithm (30Ding Y. Chan C.Y. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W135-W141Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) to be very stable (–505 kcal/mol) and hairpin-rich (data not shown), suggesting the potential binding of trans-acting regulatory factors. We used a ribonomic approach described by Tanenbaum et al. (31Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) to isolate ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes that physiologically form in live cells. To examine whether nELAV proteins and the Nova1 transcript are associated in the motoneuronal NSC34 cells, nELAV-containing mRNP complexes were selectively immunoprecipitated with a pan-neuronal antibody recognizing the three nELAV RBPs HuB, HuC, and HuD. The co-precipitated mRNAs were isolated and the presence of the Nova1 transcript was tested by real time PCR quantitation. Nova1 mRNA was enriched by 5.1-fold in the nELAV-containing mRNP complexes in comparison to the control sample immunoprecipitated by the irrelevant IgG antibody (Fig. 1). We tested the presence of two other well known nELAV targets, Gap43 and Mapt, and we observed the enrichment of their transcripts by 3.9- and 2.9-fold, respectively. These data confirm that nELAV mRNP particles were specifically isolated in the assay. Conversely, the fact that the abundant Rpl10a mRNA, whose 3′-UTR sequence has no evident ARE signature, was not enriched in nELAV-containing mRNPs clearly indicates that Nova1 transcript is specifically associated to nELAV proteins in motoneuronal NSC34 cells. Nova1 3′-UTR Is a Target of the ARE-binding Proteins nELAV—We have shown that nELAV RBPs specifically interact with Nova1 mRNA in vivo. To demonstrate that nELAV binding is dependent on Nova1 3′-UTR sequence, we performed REMSA using recombinant proteins for each nELAV RBP and, as radiolabeled riboprobe, the highly conserved 1.9-kb long fragment of mouse Nova1 3′-UTR. A RNA-protein complex clearly formed with all three nELAV RBPs, but not with the GFP protein used as a negative control (Fig. 2A). nELAV specific binding to Nova1 was further tested in competition experiments, where increasing amounts of unlabeled Nova1 3′-UTR mRNA were able to affect the formation of radiolabeled mRNP complexes (Fig. 2B). The specificity of Nova1 mRNA-nELAV protein interaction was also confirmed when an excess of an unrelated and unlabeled RNA probe was used. In this case no effect on the formation of the Nova1-nELAV mRNP complex was observed in REMSA experiments (Fig. 2C). Functional Mapping of nELAV Binding to Nova1 3′-UTR—To identify the Nova1 sequence responsible for nELAV protein binding, we performed UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assays with different deletion fragments of the Nova1 3′-UTR used in REMSA experiments (Fig. 3A). Two partially overlapping fragments, A and B (about 1.1 kb in length), were used as radiolabeled riboprobes in the presence of mouse brain protein lysate. Gap43 3′-UTR mRNA was employed as a positive control in the assay. After selective immunoprecipitation of nELAV-containing mRNPs and SDS-PAGE of the stably formed radiolabeled complexes, a positive band was visualized with fragment A (Fig. 3B). To better map the Nova1 A binding region, two smaller fragments, A1 and A2, were subsequently used in the assay and only A1 riboprobe was shown to be responsible for nELAV protein binding. The computational analysis of this 435-nucleotide long sequence revealed the presence of 5 scattered putative AREs, of whom only one shows the canonical AUUUA sequence (supplemental materials Fig. S2). We therefore generated three smaller deletion fragments according to the distribution of the predicted AREs and used them in UV cross-linking/immunoprecipitation experiments. Only the 213-bp long deletion fragment A1-(221–435) revealed a positive binding to nELAV proteins (Fig. 3B). To test whether nELAV binding to this region also had functional relevance, we performed a luciferase assay using the three different Nova1 A1 deletion sequences inserted into the unique XbaI cloning site at the 3′ of the Renilla reporter gene. Because the A1-(221–435) fragment contained a XbaI recognition site, we obtained and cloned a smaller 123-bp long fragment (A-(221–345)), in which one of the three predicted AREs was excluded (supplemental materials Fig. S2). We used the human HEK293T cells because they do not express the nELAV proteins, as we could assess by Western blot analysis (data not shown). After transient transfection with the Renilla-A1 constructs, we measured the changes of luciferase activity following expression of the pEGFP-HuD plasmid containing the human HuD cDNA. We found that only the shorter A1-(221–345) 3′-UTR sequence could increase the reporter luciferase activity by 1.7-fold when pEGFP-HuD was transfected into HEK293T cells (Fig. 3C). We thus identified the 123-nucleotide long sequence of Nova1 3′-UTR as the region responsible for the binding of the trans-acting factors nELAV. This region contains a group V ARE sequence (AUUUA) according to the ARE data base (ARED (32Bakheet T. Williams B.R. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D111-D114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar)) followed by a non-canonical AUUUUA sequence with a 7-nucleotide GC-rich stretch in-between. The secondary structure prediction of the A1 fragment showed the formation of a loop corresponding to the canonical ARE contained in the A1-(221–345) sequence, whereas the non-canonical one was folded in a less exposed stem structure (data not shown). HuD Gene Silencing Affects Nova1 Protein Content—In vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that nELAV proteins are able to specifically bind the ARE-containing Nova1 3′-UTR. To obtain functional data about the role of nELAV proteins in regulating post-transcriptionally Nova1 gene expression, we designed a complementary sequence specific to murine HuD mRNA (shHuD) to silence its expression in NSC34 cells by a shRNA plasmid-based technology. After isolation of stable transfectants, examination of shHuD cell morphology revealed a marked phenotypic change with a prominent loss of spontaneous neurite outgrowth and arborization in comparison to both parental and mock-transfected NSC34 cells (supplemental materials Fig. S3, A–C). We found that the proportion of short neurite-bearing cells was significantly increased in shHuD stable transfectants compared with parental and control cells. On the contrary, the subpopulations presenting longer neuronal processes significantly diminished in shHuD cells (supplemental materials Fig. S3D). We evaluated the effective HuD gene silencing in the selected shHuD clone by real time RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Besides the 55% down-regulation of the HuD mRNA level, we also found that HuB and HuC gene expression was greatly decreased (Fig. 4A). To assess whether such down-regulation was selectively restricted to the nELAV transcripts, we evaluated the expression of the ubiquitous HuR and TIA-1 RBP mRNAs. HuR was only partially affected in shHuD cells, whereas no change in the level of the abundant ELAV-related TIA-1 RBP was observed. In line with the mRNA data, Western blot assay confirmed that the amount of nELAV proteins was also consistently decreased in shHuD in comparison to"

We have developed a quantitative cell surface biotinylation assay to determine the compartmentalization and trafficking of apoA-I between the plasma membrane (PM) and intracellular compartments (ICCs). Here we report that 125I-apoA-I exhibited saturable association with the PM and ICCs in baby hamster kidney cells stably overexpressing ABCA1 and in fibroblasts. The PM was found to have a 2-fold higher capacity to accommodate apoA-I as compared with ICCs. Overexpressing various levels of ABCA1 in baby hamster kidney cells promoted the association of apoA-I with PM and ICCs compartments. The C-terminal deletion of apoA-I Δ(187–243) and reconstituted HDL particles exhibited reduced association of apoA-I with both the PM and ICCs. Interestingly, cell surface biotinylation with a cleavable biotin revealed that apoA-I induces ABCA1 endocytosis. Such endocytosis was impaired by naturally occurring mutations of ABCA1 (Q597R and C1477R). To better understand the role of the endocytotic pathway in the dynamics of the lipidation of apoA-I, a pulse-chase experiment was performed, and the dissociation (re-secretion) of 125I-apoA-I from both PM and ICCs was monitored over a 6-h period. Unexpectedly, we found that the time required for 50% dissociation of 125I-apoA-I from the PM was 4-fold slower than that from ICCs at 37 °C. Finally, treatment of the cells with phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, increased the dissociation of apoA-I from the PM. This study provides evidence that the lipidation of apoA-I occurs in two kinetically distinguishable compartments. The finding that apoA-I specifically mediates the continuous endocytic recycling of ABCA1, together with the kinetic data showing that apoA-I associated with ICCs is rapidly re-secreted, suggests that the endocytotic pathway plays a central role in the genesis of nascent HDL. The molecular mechanisms underlying the apoA-I/ABCA1 endocytic trafficking pathway in relation to high density lipoprotein (HDL) formation remain poorly understood.

The molecular interaction of apoA-I with the cell membrane ABCA1 transporter has important implications in reverse cholesterol transport. It provides a mechanism whereby excess cholesterol is removed from peripheral cells that are unable to catabolize cholesterol, including macrophages in the vessel wall. This process plays a crucial role in both the formation and maintenance of HDL 3The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; 22OH, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol; 9CRA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; PAGGE, polyacrylamide nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette AI; apo, apolipoprotein; HCBS, high capacity binding site; ICCs, intracellular compartments; LpA-I, nascent apoA-I-containing particle; rLpA-I, recombinant LpA-I; PLC, phospholipase C; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PM, plasma membrane; TD, Tangier disease; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tf, transferrin; WT, wild type; SMase, sphingomyelinase; BHK, baby hamster kidney; CsA, cyclosporin A. levels in plasma and is believed to be one of the major mechanisms by which HDL protects against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (1Brewer Jr., H.B.

Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Despite a large body of information identifying HDL as a potent physiological protector against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the genesis of HDL at the cellular level remain complex and poorly understood. It is generally thought that the lipidation of apoA-I occurs inside the cell as a part of a retroendocytosis pathway. Of particular interest is the concept of Smith and co-workers (3Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that cellular cholesterol efflux involves endocytosis and resecretion of apoA-I. This concept falls in line with the idea that the ABCA1 transporter may play an important role in the apoA-I retroendocytosis pathway and is supported by previous studies documenting the following: 1) apoA-I colocalizes with ABCA1-containing endosomes (4Smith J.D. Waelde C. Horwitz A. Zheng P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17797-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); and 2) apoA-I-mediated lipid efflux is defective in the lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick type C disease (5Chen W.

Indeed, ABCA1 was found to be present in late endosomes and lysosomes and to traffic between late endosomes and the plasma membrane (PM). The presence of both internalized apoA-I and ABCA1 in late endosomes is thought to be functionally important in mediating lipid efflux from this intracellular location. It is not clear, however, whether apoA-I solubilizes a membrane domain that is created by ABCA1 (9Chroni A. Liu T. Fitzgerald M.L. Freeman M.W. Zannis V.I.

This information is critical to the ongoing assessment of whether PM or intracellular compartments (ICCs) represent active cellular sites for the lipidation of apoA-I. Although it is accepted that a retroendocytosis pathway plays an important role in the formation of nascent HDL particles, the structural determinants governing the dynamics of apoA-I lipidation at different cellular sites have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we have used a quantitative assay based on cell surface biotinylation to investigate the cellular compartmentalization and trafficking of apoA-I/ABCA1 in relation to the biogenesis of nascent HDL particles. Patient Selection—For this study, we selected fibroblasts from three normal control subjects and two patients with TD (homozygous for Q597R at the ABCA1 gene and compound heterozygous for C1477R as described previously (12Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O. Ouelette B.F. Fichter K. Ashbourne-Excoffon K.J. Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M.

The protocol for the study was reviewed and accepted by the Research Ethics Board of the McGill University Health Centre. Separate consent forms for blood sampling, DNA isolation, and skin biopsy were provided. Cell Culture—BHK cells stably transfected with an ABCA1 expression vector that is inducible by treating the cells with mifepristone and cells transfected with the same vector lacking the ABCA1 cDNA insert (mock-transfected) were generously provided by Dr. John F. Oram from the Department of Medicine, University of Washington, and were characterized and cultured as described previously (13Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39898-39902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These BHK cells do not normally express ABCA1. Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from 3.0-mm punch biopsies of the forearm of patients and healthy control subjects and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.1% nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human Plasma ApoA-I—Purified plasma apoA-I (Biodesign) was resolubilized in 4 m guanidine-HCl and dialyzed extensively against PBS buffer. Freshly resolubilized apoA-I was iodinated with 125I by IODO-GEN® (Pierce) to a specific activity of 3000–3500 cpm/ng apoA-I and used within 48 h. Expression of wild type (WT) apoA-I and its mutants in a bacterial system and the isolation and purification of these proteins have been described previously by Marcel et al. (15Frank P.G. Bergeron J. Emmanuel F. Lavigne J.P. Sparks D.L. Denefle P. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Deletion mutant apoA-I Δ(187–234) was provided by Dr. Yves L. Marcel. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—BHK cells stably expressing ABCA1 or mock were treated or not with mifepristone as described by Oram and co-workers (13Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39898-39902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 14Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Confluent fibroblasts were stimulated or not with 2.5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h. Cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml of apoA-I for 45 min at 37 °C or with increasing concentrations of apoA-I. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and surface proteins were biotinylated with 500 μg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin; Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. The biotinylation reaction was quenched for 10 min at 4 °C by removal of the biotin solution and addition of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed, and homogenized. 200 μg of protein was added to 50 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads and incubated overnight on a platform mixer at 4 °C. The pellet (PM) or supernatant (ICCs) was washed with lysis buffer and counted for radioactivity. To test whether the biotinylation of cell surface proteins was complete, BHK cells induced with mifepristone and incubated with 10 μg/ml of 125I-apoA-I for 45 min at 4 °C were washed, and biotinylation was performed as described above. After streptavidin pulldown, the recovery of 125I-apoA-I associated with PM was estimated from total 125I-apoA-I (counts/min) added to the cells. We found that more than 85% of apoA-I at the cell surface was accessible to biotin. Preparation of Reconstituted HDL Particles—Complexes comprising apoA-I and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine were prepared using the sodium cholate dialysis method as described by Jonas et al.

An apoA-I/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine molar ratio of 1:100 was used. rHDL particles were further concentrated by ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, molecular weight cutoff 50,000, Amicon) to discard any lipid-free apoA-I or proteolytic peptides. ApoA-I-lipid complex formation was verified by analysis with two-dimensional PAGGE as we have described previously (17Krimbou L. Hajj H.H. Blain S. Rashid S. Denis M. Marcil M. Genest J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1668-1677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ABCA1 Endocytosis Assay—Endocytosis assays were performed as described previously (18Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Briefly, mifepristone-induced BHK-ABCA1 or 22OH/9CRA-stimulated normal fibroblasts or ABCA1 mutant fibroblasts were biotinylated with a cleavable form of biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1, 3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin); Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. Excess biotin was removed, and cells were incubated with warm DMEM containing 10 μg/ml apoA-I or not. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for various times to permit cellular trafficking. Subsequently, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and biotin cleavage was performed using a non-cell-permeable reducing reagent (50 mm glutathione in 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA containing 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4)), which was applied to the cells twice for 15 min. Reducing reagent was quenched by two 5-min incubations with iodoacetamide (5 mg/ml) at 4 °C. Biotinylated cells incubated with or without apoA-I at 4 °C throughout each assay and subjected to reducing agent were used as controls for the efficacy of biotin cleavage. Under these conditions, more than 95% of biotinylated ABCA1 was cleaved by glutathione. Integrin α4 and activin receptor type II, which localize to the plasma membrane in BHK cells and human fibroblasts, respectively, were used as controls for protein loading. The ratios of endocytosed ABCA1 over integrin α4 and ABCA1 over activin receptor type II were determined. To ensure that application of cleavable biotin did not alter the function of ABCA1, cholesterol efflux assays were carried out on biotinylated cells. We found that labeling cell surface protein with cleavable biotin did not affect significantly apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux via ABCA1 pathway. Dissociation of 125I-ApoA-I from Intact Cells—BHK-ABCA1, normal human fibroblasts, or fibroblasts with ABCA1 mutations (Q597R and C1477R) from Tangier disease subjects were used. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 100-mm diameter dishes and stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h in DMEM/bovine serum albumin. BHK cells stably expressing ABCA1 or mock were treated or not with mifepristone as described above. Cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing to remove unbound 125I-apoA-I, DMEM was added, and the plates were immediately incubated at 37 °C for increasing times. Biotinylation was performed, and 125I-apoA-I dissociation from both plasma membrane and intracellular compartments was quantitated as described above. Analysis of Nascent ApoA-I-containing Particles—125I-ApoA-I released to the medium at the time point (6 h) from mifepristone-induced BHK-ABCA1 cells was analyzed by two-dimensional PAGGE, and the number of apoA-I molecules per particle was assessed by cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), as described previously (20Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7384-7394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Treatment with Phospholipases—Confluent BHK-ABCA1 cells were incubated for 45 min in DMEM containing 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I. After washing to remove unbound 125I-apoA-I, cells were subjected to treatment with 2.5 units/ml phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) or 0.4 units/ml sphingomyelinase (SMase) (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following washes, cell surface biotinylation was performed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Results were compared statistically by Student's t test. Two-tailed p values <0.05 were considered as significantly different. Development of a Quantitative Biotinylation Assay—To investigate the cellular compartmentalization and trafficking pattern of apoA-I in a cell culture model, we developed a quantitative assay based on cell surface biotinylation. This permitted us to quantify the amount of apoA-I associated with the PM and ICCs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, both the incomplete biotinylation of cell surface proteins or the possible contamination of PM with ICCs fractions could result in an inaccurate quantification. To test whether the biotinylation of cell surface proteins was complete, 22OH/9CRA-stimulated fibroblasts were incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I for 45 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated with increasing amounts of biotin (0.25–3 mg/ml). After streptavidin pulldown, 125I-apoA-I associated with PM (pellets) or ICCs (supernatants) was determined by γ-counting. Increasing the amount of biotin beyond 0.5 mg/ml did not result in any significant increase in 125I-apoA-I association with either the PM or ICCs (Fig. 1A). To examine the specificity of the biotinylation reaction, a 30-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I, absence of ABCA1 stimulation with 22OH/9CRA, and ABCA1 mutant fibroblasts (Q597R) were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 1B, the presence of excess unlabeled apoA-I, the absence of stimulation with 22OH/9CRA, or utilization of an ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) drastically reduced the association of 125I-apoA-I with both the PM and ICCs. We have previously reported that the Q597R-ABCA1 mutant does not bind apoA-I but is expressed normally and localizes to the cell surface (19Haidar B. Denis M. Marcil M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9963-9969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To ascertain the integrity of the PM and ICCs fractions, both fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and monitored by appropriate antibodies for the colocalization of specific cellular markers. No significant contamination of the PM with ICCs was observed as assessed by the absence of VAL-α2 from ICCs, which is considered a marker for the PM. Similarly, Hsp-70 and tubulin were found exclusively associated with ICCs (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the biotinylation is complete and limited to the PM. In light of these findings, a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml biotin and an incubation period of 30 min at 4 °C were used for biotinylation throughout this study. Importantly, a period of 45 min of incubation of 125I-apoA-I with cells at 37 °C was chosen to permit sufficient time for equilibration of apoA-I with different cellular compartments. Although several groups used binding at 4 °C to determine the association of apoA-I with the PM, we obtained evidence that incubation at 4 °C alters the association of apoA-I with ABCA1 at the PM (data not shown), in agreement with previous studies (20Denis M.

These results underscore the importance of using physiological temperatures to study apoA-I/ABCA1 interactions. Association of ApoA-I with the PM and ICCs—To determine the association of apoA-I with the PM and ICCs, either BHK cells treated or not with mifepristone or fibroblasts treated or not with 22OH/9CRA were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-apoA-I for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing to remove unbound 125I-apoA-I, biotinylation was performed and 125I-apoA-I associated with the PM and ICCs was determined by γ-counting. As shown in Fig. 2A, 125I-apoA-I exhibited saturable, concentration-dependent association with the PM and ICCs in BHK cells induced with mifepristone. Conversely, 125I-apoA-I showed no significant association with either fraction in noninduced BHK cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, 125I-apoA-I exhibited saturable association with both PM and ICCs in 22OH/9CRA-stimulated fibroblasts (data not shown). Importantly, analysis of affinity parameters for the association of apoA-I with different cellular compartments revealed that the PM possessed nearly a 2-fold higher capacity (Bmax) to accommodate apoA-I as compared with ICCs in BHK expressing ABCA1 and stimulated fibroblasts. In contrast, apoA-I exhibited similar affinity for both the PM and ICCs (Table 1). This result indicates that under conditions of continuous exposure to an excess of apoA-I, two-thirds of apoA-I is found associated with the PM and the remaining one-third with the ICCs.TABLE 1Kinetics of apoA-I association and dissociation from the PM and ICCs in BHK cells and fibroblastsKinetic parametersAssociationDissociationApparent BmaxApparent KdKofft½ng/ μg cell proteinng/ μg cell proteinmin-1minBHK-ABCA1 PM0.58 ± 0.05aFor apparent Bmax, p < 0.001 for PM is compared with ICCs in BHK cells.2.52 ± 0.2030 ± 582 ± 7cFor t½, p < 0.001 for PM is compared with ICCs in BHK cells.

Physiol. 1991; 149: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used as a control. We found that 77% of 125I-Tf was found associated with the PM and 23% with ICCs in HepG2 (0.76 ± 0.02 versus 0.22 ± 0.01 ng of Tf/μg of cell protein). Effect of the C-terminal Deletion of ApoA-I and the Lipidation of WT ApoA-I on the Association with the PM and ICCs—It is well documented that the C-terminal region of apoA-I is important in the ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux pathway. Indeed, previous studies have documented that apoA-I deletion mutants lacking residues 187–243 of the C-terminal domain (Δ(187–243)) exhibit both reduced cell surface binding and the ability to promote lipid efflux (9Chroni A.

Furthermore, we and others have previously shown that lipid association with apoA-I or apoE3 reduced their ability to interact with ABCA1 (20Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L.

We further examined the role of the C-terminal domain of apoA-I and the lipidation of WT apoA-I on the association with different cellular compartments. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, apoA-I Δ(187–243) and rLpA-I exhibited drastically reduced cell association and association with both the PM and ICCs as compared with lipid-free WT apoA-I. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain of apoA-I is important for the compartmentalization of apoA-I between the PM and ICCs. Similarly, they indicate a requirement of lipid-free apoA-I for efficient compartmentalization. Overexpressing ABCA1 Promotes the Compartmentalization of ApoA-I between the PM and ICCs—It is well documented that ABCA1 in late endocytic vesicles plays a role in cellular lipid efflux (4Smith J.D.

To further examine the role of ABCA1 in the cellular compartmentalization of apoA-I, different levels of ABCA1 were expressed in BHK cells under a mifepristone-inducible ABCA1 gene. As shown in Fig. 2C (inset), without induction, BHK-ABCA1 cells had no detectable ABCA1 protein, whereas cells induced with 0.1 and 10 nm mifepristone for 20 h expressed increasing levels of ABCA1. Concomitantly, cellular cholesterol efflux was significantly increased (2 ± 0.35, 8 ± 0.22, and 13 ± 0.68%; 0, 0.1, and 10 nm mifepristone; respectively). Furthermore, ABCA1 induction by mifepristone was paralleled by elevated 125I-apoA-I association to both the PM and ICCs (Fig. 2D). Similarly, stimulation of normal fibroblasts with 22OH/9CRA increased the association of 125I-apoA-I with both the PM and ICCs (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that expression of ABCA1 is required for the association of apoA-I with both the PM and ICCs. The Endocytotic Pathway Is Required for the Association of ApoA-I with ICCs—Having demonstrated that ABCA1 expression is required for the compartmentalization of apoA-I, we examined the impact of ABCA1 trafficking on apoA-I association with the PM and ICCs. Cells were treated with either cyclosporin A (CsA) or probucol, which are known to specifically inhibit ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (28Le Goff W. Peng D.Q. Settle M. Brubaker G.

CsA is a potent inhibitor of ABCA1 shown to block recycling of ABCA1 from the PM to endosomes, resulting in the inhibition of HDL biogenesis and of ABCA1 degradation by calpain proteases (28Le Goff W.

https://openalex.org/W2121932162,"The diaphanous-related formins are actin nucleating and elongating factors. They are kept in an inactive state by an intramolecular interaction between the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and the diaphanous-autoregulatory domain (DAD). It is considered that the dissociation of this autoinhibitory interaction upon binding of GTP-bound Rho to the GTPase binding domain next to DID induces exposure of the FH1-FH2 domains, which assemble actin filaments. Here, we isolated two diaphanous-related formins, mDia1 and Daam1, in platelet extracts by GTP-RhoA affinity column chromatography. We characterized them by a novel assay, where beads coated with the FH1-FH2-DAD domains of either mDia1 or Daam1 were incubated with platelet cytosol, and the assembled actin filaments were observed after staining with rhodamine-phalloidin. Both formins generated fluorescent filamentous structures on the beads. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity of the beads revealed that the initial velocity in the presence of mDia1 was more than 10 times faster than in the presence of Daam1. The actin assembly activities of both FH1-FH2-DADs were inhibited by adding cognate DID domains. GTP-RhoA, -RhoB, and -RhoC, but not GTP-Rac1 or -Cdc42, bound to both mDia1 and Daam1 and efficiently neutralized the inhibition by the DID domains. The association between RhoA and Daam1 was induced by thrombin stimulation in platelets, and RhoA-bound endogenous formins induced actin assembly, which was inhibited by the DID domains of Daam1 and mDia1. Thus, mDia1 and Daam1 are platelet actin assembly factors having distinct efficiencies, and they are directly regulated by Rho GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2080170002,"Migration of oligodendrocyte precursors along axons is a necessary prerequisite for myelination, but little is known about underlying mechanisms. NG2 is a large membrane proteoglycan implicated in oligodendrocyte migration. Here we show that a PDZ domain protein termed syntenin-1 interacts with NG2 and that syntenin-1 is necessary for normal rates of migration. The association of syntenin-1 with NG2, identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, was confirmed by colocalization of both proteins within processes of oligodendroglial precursor cells and by coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts. Syntenin-1 also colocalizes with NG2 in “co-capping” assays, demonstrating a lateral association of both proteins in live oligodendrocytes. RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of syntenin-1 in glial cells results in a significant reduction of migration in vitro, as does the presence of polyclonal antibody against NG2. Thus syntenin plays a role in the migration of oligodendroglial precursors, and we suggest that NG2-syntenin-1 interactions contribute to this.

Thus syntenin plays a role in the migration of oligodendroglial precursors, and we suggest that NG2-syntenin-1 interactions contribute to this. The NG2 proteoglycan is a type I membrane protein that is expressed by a variety of immature cells of several embryonic tissue origins including glia, muscle progenitor cells, and pericytes (1Nishiyama A. Neuroscientist. 2007; 13: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, expression of NG2 was originally thought to specify oligodendroglial progenitor cells, but more recent data suggest that NG2-expressing cells encompass a wider range of immature glial cells in white and gray matter. These include glia that make synaptic-like contacts with neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum (2Bergles D.E. Roberts J.D. Somogyi P. Jahr C.E. Nature. 2000; 405: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) and glial cells specifically associated with the nodes of Ranvier (3Butt A.M. Kiff J. Hubbard P. Berry M. J.

Vanek M. Evans A. Dittmar T. Schmid P. Itin P. Filardo E.J. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9710-9715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Identifying the intracellular NG2-interacting proteins should aid in elucidating the function of this multidomain protein in migratory cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage. The intracellular domain of NG2 consists of the C-terminal 76 amino acids and has the PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1) binding motif QYWV, which can interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins (8Stegmuller J. Werner H. Nave K.A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3590-3598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To define relevant intracellular partners of the glycoprotein, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using the complete intracellular domain of NG2 as bait. One of the proteins that we identified is syntenin-1 (also termed MDA-9). Syntenin-1 is a widely expressed PDZ protein that is often overexpressed in highly migratory metastatic tumors including melanoma (9Sarkar D. Boukerche H. Su Z.Z. Fisher P.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 104: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that syntenin is expressed by primary oligodendrocytes and show functional studies using the oligodendroglial precursor cell line Oli-neu. We provide biochemical, morphological, and functional data demonstrating that NG2 and syntenin-1 form a complex, which we suggest is one component that regulates oligodendroglial precursor migration.

Syntenin-1-directed synthetic siRNA (target sequences TACGTCAGCATAGTACATTTA and CAGATTGCAGATATACTGTCA, 80 pmol each) and non-silencing control siRNA (target sequence AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, 160 pmol) were purchased from Qiagen and nucleofected into 106 Oli-neu cells using the AMAXA basic nucleofection protocol for primary mammalian neural cells. Coimmunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells were transfected with EGFP-syntenin-1 (10Koroll M. Rathjen F.G. Volkmer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the NG2del construct, which contains one-fourth of the extracellular domain, the complete transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail of NG2 (8Stegmuller J. Werner H. Nave K.A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3590-3598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated for 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium, and metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys for 4 h. Cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution fortified with cold Met/Cys and then lysed on ice in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture of iodoacetamide (18 mg/ml in H2O), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 mm in isopropyl alcohol), pepstatin (5 mg/ml in Me2SO), antipain (1 mg/ml in Me2SO), aprotinin (1 mg/ml in H2O), benzamidine HCl (26 mg/ml in H2O), and leupeptin (5 mg/ml in Me2SO). The lysates were chilled for 30 min and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei. For immunoprecipitation the following antibodies were used: rabbit pc AN2, rabbit pc EGFP, and rabbit pc syntenin-1 (Synaptic Systems). Lysates were pre-absorbed with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C (preclear) followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads and a 1-h incubation on a head-over-tail rotator. Precipitates were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7) before adding sample buffer and resolving the proteins by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, exposed to screens, and evaluated with a PhosphorImager (Raytest). Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous NG2 with transfected EGFP-syntenin-1 and endogenous syntenin-1 from Oli-neu cells was carried out following an identical protocol. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and blocked with β-mercaptoethanol and 10% horse serum. Primary antibodies (against syntenin (10Koroll M. Rathjen F.G. Volkmer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)) were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h or overnight in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated for 30 min with the appropriate Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted in blocking buffer. In the case of double labeling, primary antibodies and their corresponding secondary antibodies were separately added. Coverslips were washed in distilled water and then mounted in Moviol for analysis by confocal microscopy (Leica). Capping of Surface Molecules—Primary oligodendrocytes (2 days in vitro (div)) on coverslips were incubated with monoclonal AN2 antibody (1:10) for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Cy2-conjugated goat antirat antibody for 20 min at 37 °C or at 4 °C for control cells. Subsequently, cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with β-mercaptoethanol/10% horse serum, and incubated overnight with pc syntenin-1 antibody. The secondary Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was added the next day before mounting the cells in Moviol. Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences) and blocked with 4% milk powder in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Proteins were detected by sequential incubation with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-species secondary antibodies (Dianova) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Isolation of Syntenin-1 with Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The entire 76-amino acid C-terminal region of mouse NG2 (NH2-RKRNKT.. .NGQYWV-COOH, GenBank™ accession number AF352400) was fused to the Gal4 binding domain by cloning it into the pGBT9 vector (Clontech) with XbaI/HindIII. The resulting bait construct was designated pGBT9cyto. Using the lithium acetate method, the yeast strain CG1945 was transformed sequentially with pGBT9cyto and a 9–12-week-old postnatal mouse brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library in pACT2 (Clontech). 33 × 106 transformants were screened. Transformants were grown on synthetic defined media/Leu–/ Trp–/His– plates; 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was added to the medium to suppress leaky HIS3 reporter gene expression. Positive clones were tested for β-galactosidase gene activity. Yeast colonies were grown on synthetic defined media/Leu–/ Trp–/His– plates, transferred onto reinforced nitrocellulose membrane, submerged in liquid nitrogen, and placed on a Z-buffer/X-gal solution-soaked Whatman paper (Z-buffer: 16.1 g/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.75 g/liter KCl, 0.246 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, pH 7; Z-buffer/X-gal solution: 100 ml of Z-buffer, 0.27 ml of β-mercaptoethanol, 1.67 ml of 20 mg/ml X-gal stock solution). Blue color was allowed to develop for 30 min to 3 h. The specificity of the NG2-syntenin-1 interaction was confirmed by β-galactosidase assay, and the growth selection of cotransformed yeast cells was confirmed with pGBT9cyto and isolated library plasmids. To map the PDZ binding motif at the C terminus of NG2, individual mutations of the 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-positions of the C-terminal peptide QYWV* were introduced by PCR; cloned into pGBT9; and designated NG2 0G (Val mutated to Gly), NG2 1G (Trp to Gly), NG2 2G (Tyr to Gly), NG2 2F (Tyr to Phe), and NG2 3G (Gln to Gly). Mutant NG2 constructs were cotransformed with full-length syntenin-1 and syntenin-1-PDZ1/2. Yeast cells were grown on double dropout medium, assayed for β-galactosidase gene activity, and additionally selected for growth on triple dropout medium. Scratch Migration Assay—Transfected cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated gridded coverslips (15 mm; Bellco Glass). Cells were cultured until they reached 80–90% confluence but were kept at least 16 h prior to experimental manipulation. Cell-free areas were generated by gently scratching the cell monolayer with a sterile blue Gilson pipette tip. Coverslips were subsequently washed with PBS and placed in 3-cm dishes containing preconditioned Sato medium. Phase images (×40 magnification) were captured approximately every 6 h over a period of 1.5 days. The “magnetic pen tool” of Photoshop CS2 was used to manually define the area covered by cells. The marked (covered) areas were exported and quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (MediaCybernetics). The software calculated the marked area as a percentage of the whole picture. The results at each time point were normalized by subtracting the value of the starting area covered by the cells. In this study we have equated the percent increase of marked areas with the migration of the cells. Identification of Syntenin-1 as an Intracellular Partner of NG2 via Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To elucidate the mechanism of NG2 function in migration, we sought to identify novel NG2-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid analysis. The complete mouse NG2 cytoplasmic region consisting of 76 amino acids (RKRN.. .QYWV*, where * indicates the translation stop codon) was used as a bait to screen a postnatal mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech). Screening of 33 × 106 transformants identified several potential binding partners including GRIP (8Stegmuller J. Werner H. Nave K.A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3590-3598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and four independent different library plasmids encoding the PDZ protein syntenin-1 (14Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Each plasmid contained the entire syntenin-1 cDNA, which corresponds to the published mouse sequence (14Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The interaction was verified by cotransforming yeast cells with NG2 and syntenin-1. The transformed yeast cells were viable on double and triple dropout media and in addition tested positive in the β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1A, row 1). This finding suggests that syntenin-1 is a novel interacting partner of NG2. The C terminus of NG2 displays a canonical PDZ binding motif (QYWV). To validate the requirement of the PDZ motif for the interaction of NG2 with syntenin-1, we carried out point mutation analyses and found that the terminal three amino acid residues in the PDZ recognition site of NG2 are important for binding to the PDZ domains of syntenin-1 (Fig. 1A, rows 2–7). These data demonstrate that the PDZ binding motif QYWV of NG2 is critical for the binding to syntenin-1. Syntenin-1 harbors a tandem repeat of two PDZ domains. To determine which PDZ domain is required for the interaction with NG2, we carried out deletion analyses. Syntenin-1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR using full-length mouse syntenin-1 as a template, were cloned into EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pACT2 vector, and were verified by sequencing. The following deletion mutants were tested for interaction with NG2: syntenin-1 N terminus-PDZ1 (MSLYP-HKDSS), syntenin-1-PDZ1 (RAEIK-HKDSS), syntenin-1-PDZ2 (FERTV-TIPEV*), and syntenin-1-PDZ1/2 (RAEIK-TIPEV*). Both PDZ domains were required for binding to NG2 (Fig. 1B). Syntenin-1 Is Expressed by Immature NG2-positive and by More Mature Oligodendrocytes in Vitro—We determined the expression of syntenin-1 in primary oligodendrocytes and the cell line Oli-neu (Fig. 2). Lysates of primary oligodendrocytes (2 div), Oli-neu cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3), and total brain were subjected to Western blot analysis using the syntenin-1 antibody. We found that syntenin-1 is expressed in both primary oligodendrocytes and Oli-neu cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Total brain lysate served as a positive control to validate the 36-kDa syntenin-1 band (lane 1). Interestingly, the highly migratory Oli-neu cells reveal a high expression of syntenin-1. These results show that syntenin-1 is expressed in oligodendroglial cells. Next, we characterized the developmental profile of syntenin-1 in primary oligodendrocytes during differentiation in vitro (Fig. 2B). The expression of syntenin-1 increases with time in culture. The decrease of NG2, which is expressed by immature oligodendrocytes, and the increase of PLP, a marker for more mature oligodendrocytes, suggest that the increase in syntenin-1 expression parallels oligodendrocyte maturation. The possibility that the syntenin-1 signals arise from neuronal and/or astrocytic contamination was excluded by controlling for expression of the neuronal protein neurofilament and the astrocyte-specific protein GFAP. We did not observe detectable amounts of neurofilament, and the low amount of GFAP expression did not correlate with the increase of syntenin-1 over time. These results suggest an increase in syntenin-1 expression in cultures of maturing oligodendrocytes. To corroborate this finding, we subjected cultured oligodendrocytes to immunocytochemistry using stage-specific markers for oligodendrocytes. We found syntenin-1 expression at different stages of oligodendrocyte differentiation (Fig. 3). All NG2-positive cells at 2 div expressed syntenin-1. In addition, we found that many more mature oligodendrocytes in the culture, identified by CNP, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and PLP expression, also express syntenin-1. These data demonstrate that syntenin-1 is expressed by immature as well as by differentiated oligodendrocytes. The extensive syntenin-positive process outgrowth in older cells may contribute to the increase in syntenin-1 with time in culture. Coimmunoprecipitation of NG2 and Syntenin-1—To validate the interaction of syntenin-1 and NG2 biochemically, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding EGFP-syntenin-1 (10Koroll M. Rathjen F.G. Volkmer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10646-10654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and a plasmid encoding NG2del (encompassing one-fourth of the extracellular domain, the complete transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic tail of NG2) (Fig. 1C) (8Stegmuller J. Werner H. Nave K.A. Trotter J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3590-3598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A complex of EGFP-syntenin-1 and NG2 was isolated from the transfected cells after metabolic radiolabeling by precipitation with polyclonal AN2 antibodies against NG2 that recognize NG2del (Fig. 4A, lane 3) or polyclonal antibodies against EGFP that target EGFP-syntenin-1 (lane 4). This finding suggests that NG2 and EGFP-syntenin-1 co-associate. Next, we examined the association of syntenin-1 and NG2 in Oli-neu cells. All Oli-neu cells are NG2-positive. In cells that had been transfected with EGFP-syntenin-1, precipitation with polyclonal AN2 antibodies precipitated endogenous NG2 as well as the 62-kDa EGFP-syntenin-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Precipitation using polyclonal antibodies against EGFP precipitated EGFP-syntenin-1 and associated NG2 (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Polyclonal antibodies against syntenin-1 pulled down EGFP-syntenin-1 and endogenous NG2 and gave a weak signal for endogenous syntenin-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4, arrowhead). Coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous NG2 and endogenous syntenin-1 from native Oli-neu did not yield a syntenin-1 signal. This may be due to the difficulty of extracting NG2 and syntenin-1 from cytoskeleton-associated components. Syntenin-1 has been reported to be difficult to extract from membrane fractions with detergents, high salt, carbonate, and freeze-thawing (15Zimmermann P. Tomatis D. Rosas M. Grootjans J. Leenaerts I. Degeest G. Reekmans G. Coomans C. David G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), compatible with a cytoskeleton association. Furthermore, it is likely that only a small fraction of each protein is associated in a complex. NG2 Colocalizes with Syntenin-1 in NG2-expressing Primary Glial Cells in Vitro—Primary oligodendrocytes were double-labeled with monoclonal AN2 antibody, which recognizes NG2, and with polyclonal antibody against syntenin-1 (Fig. 5, A–C). Although NG2 was predominantly localized at the cell surface, on the cell body, and in cell processes, syntenin-1 is expressed throughout the whole cell in a punctate manner. Strikingly, we found that NG2 and syntenin-1 colocalize at the surface of the cell as indicated by the yellow punctate fluorescence in the overlay (Fig. 5, A–C). The colocalization is particularly intense at distinct varicosities in the processes. These regions may indicate points where branching has just started. Capping of NG2 on Glial Cells Causes a Parallel Redistribution of Syntenin-1—To corroborate that NG2 and syntenin-1 form a complex in primary oligodendrocytes, we performed a co-capping assay (Fig. 5, D–I). Clustering and parallel movement of NG2 and syntenin-1 were explored by incubating live oligodendrocytes (2 div) with monoclonal AN2 antibody for 10 min at 4 °C. This was followed by the addition of a fluorescent secondary antibody and incubation at 37 °C. Patching and capping of NG2 were induced. A similar redistribution of a population of endogenous syntenin-1 resulted in clustering of NG2 and syntenin-1 at or near the cell surface, bolstering our finding that NG2 and syntenin-1 associate in oligodendrocytes. Syntenin-1 Promotes Migration of Oli-neu Cells—NG2 has been implicated in spreading and migration (4Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E.

Signal. 2003; 15: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If syntenin-1-NG2 binding were functionally important, loss of syntenin-1 should reduce the migratory behavior of Oli-neu cells and primary NG2-positive oligodendrocytes. We took an siRNA approach to acutely knock down syntenin-1 in Oli-neu cells. Oli-neu cells were transfected with either control siRNA or syntenin-1 siRNA. By Western blot analysis, we found an efficient knockdown of syntenin-1 in Oli-neu cells 16 h after transfection as compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6, inset). Western blot analysis at different times after transfection demonstrated that the syntenin knockdown was stable at least 54 h after transfection (data not shown) and thus maintained during the whole time course of the migration assays. Control and syntenin-1 siRNA-transfected Oli-neu cells were then analyzed in a scratch assay. Knockdown of syntenin-1 significantly reduced the migration of Oli-neu cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 6C). Inclusion of polyclonal AN2 antibody directed against the whole NG2 molecule, which recognizes primarily the protein core (5Niehaus A. Stegmuller J. Diers-Fenger M. Trotter J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4948-4961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reduced migration to a greater extent than syntenin-1 siRNA alone (Fig. 6D). When both these approaches were combined in the assay, a stronger inhibition of migration was found than with either syntenin-1 siRNA or AN2 antibodies alone, suggesting that the signaling pathways in the migration-promoting effects of NG2 and syntenin are not completely overlapping. These data demonstrate that like NG2, syntenin-1 promotes migration of Oli-neu cells. PDZ Proteins as Partners of NG2—The NG2 proteoglycan binds to several PDZ domain proteins with its C-terminal QYWV motif. This has been shown for MUPP1 and GRIP (8Stegmuller J. Werner H. Nave K.A.

J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PDZ domain proteins act as intracellular scaffolds coordinating and compartmentalizing molecules involved in signal transduction. The majority of the PDZ domain-containing proteins are associated with plasma membrane proteins, and they are generally restricted to specific subcellular domains such as synapses or cell-cell contact points (19Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize syntenin-1 as an additional intracellular ligand of NG2. Expression of Syntenin-1—Syntenin-1 was first identified as an adaptor protein, binding syndecan in focal adhesion complexes (14Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J.

https://openalex.org/W2059639581,"Mutations in the I-II loop of Ca(v)3.2 channels were discovered in patients with childhood absence epilepsy. All of these mutations increased the surface expression of the channel, whereas some mutations, and in particular C456S, altered the biophysical properties of channels. Deletions around C456S were found to produce channels that opened at even more negative potentials than control, suggesting the presence of a gating brake that normally prevents channel opening. The goal of the present study was to identify the minimal sequence of this brake and to provide insights into its structure. A peptide fragment of the I-II loop was purified from bacteria, and its structure was analyzed by circular dichroism. These results indicated that the peptide had a high alpha-helical content, as predicted from secondary structure algorithms. Based on homology modeling, we hypothesized that the proximal region of the I-II loop may form a helix-loop-helix structure. This model was tested by mutagenesis followed by electrophysiological measurement of channel gating. Mutations that disrupted the helices, or the loop region, had profound effects on channel gating, shifting both steady state activation and inactivation curves, as well as accelerating channel kinetics. Mutations designed to preserve the helical structure had more modest effects. Taken together, these studies showed that any mutations in the brake, including C456S, disrupted the structural integrity of the brake and its function to maintain these low voltage-activated channels closed at resting membrane potentials."
https://openalex.org/W1975538735,"Gamma interferon-inducible thiol reductase (GILT) is an enzyme involved in the initial steps of antigen processing and presentation. Recently we have shown that GILT is also expressed in mouse T cells, where it exerts an inhibitory role on T cell activation. In this study, we identified mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) as one of the key intermediaries affected by GILT expression in fibroblasts. Expression and activity of SOD2 is reduced in the absence of GILT because of reduced SOD2 protein stability. The forced increase in SOD2 expression in the absence of GILT restores fibroblast proliferation to wild-type levels. Thus, GILT appears to have a fundamental role in cellular proliferation mediated through its influence on SOD2 protein activity and expression.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 5797-5806PubMed Google Scholar, 10Maric M. Arunachalam B. Uyen P. Dong C. Garrett W.S. Cannon K.S. Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Flavell R. Cresswell P. Science. 2001; 294: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and is present in mouse sera. 3M. Maric, unpublished observations. 3M. Maric, unpublished observations. GILT is constitutively expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), but it is also inducible by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as inter-feron γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1β (9Phan U.T. Arunachalam B. Cresswell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25907-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Using GILT–/– mice as a model, we have shown that GILT catalyzes initial unfolding of antigenic protein (protein becomes more accessible for further processing by cathepsins) and therefore facilitates protein/peptide binding to MHC class II molecules (10Maric M. Arunachalam B. Uyen P. Dong C. Garrett W.S. Cannon K.S. Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Flavell R. Cresswell P. Science. 2001; 294: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). By changing the redox state of exogenous antigenic proteins with disulfide bonds, GILT initiates the adaptive immune response. However, we have shown that GILT is constitutively expressed in T cells and has a role in the regulation of T cell activation. This is so far the only known GILT function not related to MHC class II processing (11Barjaktarevic I. Rahman A. Radoja S. Bogunovic B. Vollmer A. Vukmanovic S. Maric M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4369-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). GILT–/– T cells show increased proliferation and cytotoxic T cell activity in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. This observation suggests that GILT has a more fundamental role in cellular processes than just reduction of antigens in the antigen-processing pathway. We hypothesized that the effect of GILT observed in T cells, is not unique and significant only to T cells, but that fundamentally affects cellular proliferation in other cell types. In support of this hypothesis, we show that GILT–/– mouse fibroblasts also have increased levels of proliferation. Furthermore, we show in this study that a possible mechanism for the regulatory role of GILT in cellular proliferation involves affecting steady-state levels of a mitochondrial enzyme SOD2, involved in scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (12Hernandez-Saavedra D. McCord J.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 159-163PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cadenas E. Davies K.J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the expression, stability, and function of mitochondrial manganese SOD (SOD2) are significantly decreased in GILT–/– mouse fibroblasts. These data suggest an unexpected functional link between lysosomal and mitochondrial enzymes involved in oxido-reductive processes. Mice, Primary Cells, and Cell Lines—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). GILT–/– mice (10Maric M. Arunachalam B. Uyen P. Dong C. Garrett W.S. Cannon K.S. Alfonso C. Karlsson L. Flavell R. Cresswell P. Science. 2001; 294: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were bred and maintained in the Georgetown University pathogen-free animal facility. All mice were used at 6–12 weeks of age. Primary fibroblasts were isolated from GILT–/– and wild-type (WT) mouse spleens and/or ears as previously described (14Rahimi F. Hsu K. Endoh Y. Geczy C.L. Febs J. 2005; 272: 2811-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). GILT–/– and WT SV40 large T antigen immortalized mouse fibroblast cell line was generated from GILT–/– and WT mice in Dr. Peter Creswell's laboratory at Yale University. Stable GILT–/– transfectants with mouse GILT and/or hSOD2 (kind gift from Dr. M. Williams, University of Maryland) were made using a Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) standard protocol. Both constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector with zeocin resistance. Cell Proliferation—GILT–/– and WT mouse fibroblast cell lines were plated in triplicates at density of 1 × 104 cells/well (unless indicated otherwise) in 96-well flat-bottom plates and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]dT (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) overnight, and radioactive thymidine incorporation was subsequently measured on a β scintillation counter 1450 Micro-Beta™ (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Western Blotting and Antibodies—Typically 5 μg and/or 2.5 μg of cell lysates in Tris-saline pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitor mixture were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins from the gel were transferred to nylon membrane (Immobilon P Millipore). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C, with mouse anti-SOD2 antibody (Abcam), rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma), anti-Lamp-1 (Iowa hybridoma bank), and 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibodies horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence Western Lightning™ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some cases, membranes were stripped using Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 120 min, followed by incubation with anti-actin antibody as a loading control and appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol followed by RNase clean-up and treated with DNAse I. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript II RT kit and random hexamers as primers (Invitrogen). All PCR reactions were done in triplicate using ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). SOD2 and 18 S rRNA were amplified using TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and the average threshold cycles (Ct) of the triplicates were used to compare the relative abundance of the mRNA. Ct of 18 S rRNA was used to normalize all samples. Primers and TaqMan probe for SOD2 were designed using Primer Express Software as follows: forward: 5′-cctgctctaatcaggacccatt-3′, reverse: 5′-gtgctcccacacgtcaatcc-3′, TaqMan probe, 5′-FAM-aacaacaggccttattc-MGB-3′. Primers and probe for 18 S rRNA were previously reported (15Bickerstaff A.A. Xia D. Pelletier R.P. Orosz C.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5132-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TaqMan probe for SOD2 was designed to span the junction between two exons to avoid amplification of the genomic DNA. This was not possible for 18 S rRNA, which has no introns. The DNA contamination in these samples was excluded by amplifying control samples treated identically with the exception of the reverse transcriptase step. Cycloheximide Chase Experiment—5 × 106 primary mouse fibroblasts or mouse fibroblast cell lines were incubated in complete RPMI 1640 medium with cycloheximide (0.2 mg/ml). Cell lysates were processed for immunoblotting with mouse anti-SOD2 antibody at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. Equivalent amounts of cell lysates were analyzed at each time point by Western blot. Superoxide Dismutase Activity Assay—2 × 107 GILT–/– and WT mouse fibroblast cells were homogenized in 1 ml of cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 210 mm mannitol, and 70 mm sucrose), pH 7.2, using a Dounce homogenizer. The protein concentration of the cytoplasmic lysate was measured using the BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce). The SOD activity assay was performed as suggested by the supplier (Cayman Chemical). This protocol is based on the tetrazolium salt for the detection of superoxide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. When measuring SOD2 activity to separate cytosolic and mitochondrial SOD activity, 3 mm potassium cyanide was added to some sample wells. When measuring SOD1 activity, fractions containing SOD1 (cytosolic) were separated from fractions containing SOD2 (mitochondrial) by centrifugation at 10,000 × g as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. The absorbance was read at 450 nm using a plate reader SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices), and data were analyzed using SoftMaxPro software (Molecular Devices). ROS Detection—Changes in intracellular ROS concentration were assessed with a method adapted from Bass et al. (16Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). GILT–/– and WT mouse fibroblast cell lines were starved overnight in phenol red-free medium with 1% FBS. Fresh medium and 10 μg/ml of dihydroethidium (DHE) (Molecular Probes) were added and incubated for 5 min at room temperature (preliminary kinetics experiment suggested 5 min to be the optimal incubation time). Cells were washed again in PBS, resuspended in cold PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin buffer, and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. GILT-deficient Mouse Fibroblasts Show Increased Proliferation—GILT–/– T cells display stronger proliferative responses upon stimulation with anti-CD3 (11Barjaktarevic I. Rahman A. Radoja S. Bogunovic B. Vollmer A. Vukmanovic S. Maric M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4369-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined whether GILT might affect cellular proliferation in general. To address this question, we tested the proliferation capabilities of fibroblast cell lines (Fig. 1A) and primary fibro-blasts (Fig. 1B) isolated from GILT–/– and GILT WT mice. Because a high density of fibroblasts may induce contact inhibition of growth (17Meisler A.I. J. Cell Sci. 1973; 12: 847-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we titrated the numbers of fibroblasts used in our proliferation assay. Our data indicate that irrespective of the concentration of cells (1 × 105, 1 × 104, 1 × 103) in 96-well plates incubated overnight, proliferation of GILT–/– and GILT WT fibroblasts was significantly different. GILT–/– fibroblasts persistently showed at least 2-fold increased proliferation. Both GILT–/– and GILT WT fibroblasts were generated by transfection with the large T antigen of SV40 and the increased proliferation in GILT–/– could be a consequence of random insertion of the gene coding for the SV40 large T antigen, an oncogene known to deregulate the cell cycle and cause cellular proliferation. To exclude such a possibility, we tested primary mouse fibroblasts from GILT–/– and GILT WT mouse spleens (Fig. 1B). GILT–/– primary fibroblasts also showed increased proliferation when compared with GILT WT primary fibroblasts. Identical findings were observed if fibro-blasts were treated with EGF, which is known to induce cellular proliferation (Fig. 1C). Thus, GILT–/– mouse fibroblast (MF) cell lines display increased levels of both basal and EGF-induced proliferation. This effect could be ascribed directly to the presence or absence of GILT, because the transfection of the GILT–/– fibroblast cell line with either hGILT (not shown) or mGILT reverses the phenotype (Fig. 1D). GILT–/– fibroblasts transfected with GILT have decreased proliferation levels similar to WT fibroblasts. SOD2 Is Down-regulated in GILT–/– Mouse Fibroblasts—Most of the GILT is sequestered in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment; therefore, its effect on fibroblast proliferation is likely to be exerted by affecting the stability and/or activity of other endosomal/lysosomal proteins. To this end, we first analyzed contents of Lamp-1/cathepsin D+ Percoll fractions in GILT–/– and GILT WT fibroblast cell lines by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by qualitative and quantitative assessment of protein spots. Of the several protein spots that were differentially displayed in two samples, the most intriguing was the identification of mitochondrial SOD2 (gi:17390379). SOD2 was almost absent from heavy fractions of GILT–/– mouse fibroblasts in comparison to heavy fractions of GILT WT mouse fibroblasts (data not shown). The finding of SOD2 in these fractions is not surprising because endosomal/lysosomal and mitochondrial fractions isolated using a Percoll gradient have overlapping density. However, different levels of SOD2 in GILT WT and GILT–/– cell lines were unexpected, given their distinct subcellular localization. To exclude the possibility of altered intracellular localization of SOD2 or the different density of GILT–/– and GILT WT lysosomes, SOD2 protein levels were determined in whole cell lysates using semiquantitative Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2a, SOD2 expression was significantly lower in both the GILT–/– fibro-blast cell line and GILT–/– primary mouse fibroblasts. The lack of GILT in fibroblasts does not correlate with alteration of the expression of other mitochondrial protein such as Hsp60 (data not shown). To test whether the activity of SOD2 is decreased in GILT–/– cells, mouse fibroblasts were tested by an in vitro SOD assay based on the tetrazolium salt for detection of super-oxide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. The lysates of cells contain both cytosolic SOD1 and mitochondrial SOD2; thus, to distinguish between these two enzymes, we added potassium cyanide that inhibits the activity of SOD1 but not of SOD2. Our data clearly show that the GILT–/– mouse fibroblast cell line (Fig. 2b) as well as primary mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2c) have decreased activity of SOD2. Although the role of SOD2 appears to be intrinsic for cellular survival, cytoplasmic copper/zinc SOD (SOD1) is far more abundant in the cell, accounting for 90% of the total SOD activity (18Aquilano K. Vigilanza P. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 1683-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the protein expression of SOD1 in GILT–/– and GILT WT fibroblast cell line and primary fibro-blasts (Fig. 2d). Whereas SOD2 levels were significantly decreased in the GILT–/– fibroblast cell line and primary fibro-blasts, SOD1 levels remain similar in GILT–/– and GILTWT cells. Furthermore, the activity of SOD1 in the GILT–/– fibro-blast cell line and primary fibroblasts also remains similar (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, SOD2 levels and activity are specifically affected by GILT. Reconstitution of GILT Recovers SOD2 Activity—The difference in SOD2 protein expression and activity between GILT–/– and GILT WT cells could be a consequence of GILT presence or a random event. To distinguish between these possibilities, we assessed SOD2 activity in GILT–/– fibroblasts reconstituted with mouse GILT. As shown in Fig. 3, the SOD2 activity of transfectants is increased to the level of WT fibro-blasts. These data suggest that the presence of GILT correlates with the decreased expression and activity of mitochondrial enzyme SOD2. SOD2 Protein Stability Is Decreased in GILT–/– Mouse Fibroblasts—Our data indicate that the lack of GILT correlates with lower activity and the amount of SOD2 in the fibroblasts. The decreased expression of SOD2 in GILT–/– fibroblasts may be due to down-regulation of Sod2 gene expression and/or due to instability of SOD2 protein in the absence of GILT. Thus, we first measured relative levels of SOD2 mRNA in GILT–/– and GILT WT mouse fibroblast cell line by quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 4a, mRNA SOD2 levels were only moderately decreased in GILT–/– mouse fibro-blasts when compared with GILT WT cells. However, this very moderate decrease of SOD2 at the level of gene expression does not preclude the possibility that SOD2 protein is less stable in GILT–/– fibroblasts. To test the stability of SOD2 protein in GILT–/– and WT mouse fibro-blasts, we treated both GILT–/– and GILT WT fibroblasts with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Cell aliquots were collected at different time points up to 48 h of treatment with cycloheximide. The protein concentration of each sample was determined, and equal amounts of protein were loaded per well. Data shown in Fig. 4b indicate that SOD2 stability is reduced in the GILT–/– mouse fibroblast cell line as well as in GILT–/– primary mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 4c), although the amounts of SOD2 between the GILT–/– cell line and primary cells differ. The observed difference is likely to originate from different lengths that cells were kept under cell culture conditions. It is well known that cell culture and hyperoxic environment impose oxidative stress (20Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2007: 851Google Scholar). The cell line has been kept in tissue culture much longer than primary fibroblasts and therefore has been exposed to additional extracellular oxidative stress that may have destabilized SOD2 further than in primary fibro-blasts. Our data suggest a possible dual regulation of GILT on SOD2 expression: at the level of gene expression and also through its effect on the stability of SOD2 protein. GILT-deficient Mouse Fibroblast Cell Line Has Increased Superoxide Anion Levels—As the stability and function of an important antioxidant SOD2 is decreased in GILT–/– mouse fibroblasts, it is possible that the levels of endogenous ROS, particularly superoxide anion, are increased. It has been shown that a moderate increase of endogenous ROS can trigger signaling that induces cell proliferation (21Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 22Jackson S.H. Devadas S. Kwon J. Pinto L.A. Williams M.S. Nat.

Batteux F. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 948-956PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested levels of superoxide anion and ROS in GILT–/– and GILT WT fibroblast cell lines. We used DHE (Fig. 5) and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (data not shown) oxidation-sensitive dyes to detect intracellular ROS. DHE is recognized and widely used as a probe relatively specific for O2·¯ and shows little oxidation by H2O2, ONOO–, or HOCl, while DCF-DA is less specific and is used to assay cellular peroxides, superoxide anions. DCF-DA reacts even faster with various cellular radicals (RO2·¯, RO•, NO2·, CO3·, OH•, and ONOO–); thus, it is not a very specific probe and easily oxidizes (20Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2007: 851Google Scholar, 24Tarpey M.M. Fridovich I. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Fibro-blasts were incubated with DHE in RPMI for 5 min and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Our data indicate that GILT–/– mouse fibroblasts have higher levels of intracellular O2·¯ (Fig. 5a). However, transfection with either hSOD2 (Fig. 5b) or mGILT (Fig. 5c) decreases levels of O2·¯ to the level seen in GILT WT fibroblasts, suggesting that this is the component of the mechanism of increased cellular proliferation. Restoring SOD2 Levels in GILT–/– Fibroblasts Restores Proliferation—We have shown that GILT affects fibroblast proliferation and the levels of SOD2 expression. The key question is whether these two phenotypes are related. If SOD2 expression is the mechanism of GILT-regulated fibroblast proliferation, then reconstitution of SOD2 levels in GILT–/– cells (Fig. 6a) should reverse proliferation to GILT WT levels. Indeed, the proliferation of GILT–/– fibroblasts, reconstituted with human SOD2 (two independently made transfectants show the same phenotype) was markedly lower than in GILT–/– and similar to GILT WT fibroblasts. In addition, our data indicate that SOD2 activity is reconstituted in transfectant cells (Fig. 6b). Thus, regulation of SOD2 expression and activity appears to be the major mechanism of GILT-induced inhibition of fibroblast proliferation. In this study we demonstrate that GILT-deficient mouse fibroblasts have increased levels of proliferation. Surprisingly, our data indicate that GILT deficiency affects the stability and activity of a major antioxidant mitochondrial enzyme SOD2. GILT–/– fibroblasts have 2–4-fold lower SOD2 activity because of a decreased half-life of SOD2. The partial loss of SOD2 activity leads to the rise in superoxide anion as measured by DHE dye and possibly other ROS produced by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Reconstitution of GILT–/– fibroblasts with GILT reverts the SOD2 activity and the proliferation to levels closely resembling that of GILT WT fibroblasts. These data suggest that the presence of GILT is necessary to maintain levels of mitochondrial enzyme SOD2 and cellular proliferation. The transfection of human SOD2 into GILT–/– fibroblasts restored proliferation to WT levels, suggesting that SOD2 is a key step linking GILT and its effects on cellular proliferation. SOD2 is an antioxidant enzyme responsible for the dismutation of the superoxide radical into hydrogen peroxide (20Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2007: 851Google Scholar, 25Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Although superoxide radicals have short life and also spontaneously dismutate into hydrogen peroxide, deletion of the Sod2 gene in mice is perinatal lethal (26Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H.

Genetics. 2003; 165: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mice genetically modified to lack SOD2 in specific tissues show various pathologies (29Friedman J.S. Rebel V.I. Derby R. Bell K.

In addition to SOD2 located in the mitochondria, there are two additional forms of SOD in cells of aerobic organisms, namely SOD1 and SOD3. SOD1 is primarily cytosolic (although a fraction is also found in the intermembrane space of mitochondria) (32Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SOD3 is an extracellular enzyme. SOD1 constitutes up to 90% of the total activity in most cells and tissues and is considered a principal ROS scavenger in the cell. Despite that, genetic inactivation of SOD1 results in a relatively mild pheno-type (33Reaume A.G. Elliott J.L. Hoffman E.K. Kowall N.W. Ferrante R.J. Siwek D.F. Wilcox H.M. Flood D.G. Beal M.F. Brown Jr., R.H. Scott R.W. Snider W.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the levels and the activity of SOD1 in our model system. The levels of SOD1 were unaffected by the absence of GILT. This finding is in agreement with previous findings that cytosolic SOD1 cannot compensate for the loss of mitochondrial SOD2 and vice versa (34Van Remmen H. Williams M.D. Guo Z. Estlack L. Yang H.

Thus, despite additional systems for the removal of ROS (SOD1, catalase,"
https://openalex.org/W2063225331,"The A2A-adenosine receptor is a prototypical Gs protein-coupled receptor but stimulates MAPK/ERK in a Gs-independent way. The A2A receptor has long been known to undergo restricted collision coupling with Gs; the mechanistic basis for this mode of coupling has remained elusive. Here we visualized agonist-induced changes in mobility of the yellow fluorescent protein-tagged receptor by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching microscopy. Stimulation with a specific A2A receptor agonist did not affect receptor mobility. In contrast, stimulation with dopamine decreased the mobility of the D2 receptor. When coexpressed in the same cell, the A2A receptor precluded the agonist-induced change in D2 receptor mobility. Thus, the A2A receptor did not only undergo restricted collision coupling, but it also restricted the mobility of the D2 receptor. Restricted mobility was not due to tethering to the actin cytoskeleton but was, in part, related to the cholesterol content of the membrane. Depletion of cholesterol increased receptor mobility but blunted activation of adenylyl cyclase, which was accounted for by impaired formation of the ternary complex of agonist, receptor, and G protein. These observations support the conclusion that the A2A receptor engages Gs and thus signals to adenylyl cyclase in cholesterol-rich domains of the membrane. In contrast, stimulation of MAPK by the A2A receptor was not impaired. These findings are consistent with a model where the recruitment of these two pathways occurs in physically segregated membrane microdomains. Thus, the A2A receptor is the first example of a G protein-coupled receptor documented to select signaling pathways in a manner dependent on the lipid microenvironment of the membrane.

These findings are consistent with a model where the recruitment of these two pathways occurs in physically segregated membrane microdomains. Thus, the A2A receptor is the first example of a G protein-coupled receptor documented to select signaling pathways in a manner dependent on the lipid microenvironment of the membrane. In the fluid mosaic model, the lipid bilayer is an isotropic milieu, in which membrane-embedded proteins diffuse in two dimensions and thus collide at random with each other (1Singer S.J. Nicolson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6141) Google Scholar). When applied to G protein-coupled receptors, the model predicts that G protein-coupled receptors move in a random walk, and, upon activation, this allows them to engage their cognate G proteins. This “collision coupling” mode of activation was validated in studies using the β-adrenergic receptor and its coupling to the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase in turkey erythrocytes (2Tolkovsky A.M. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3811-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, experiments with the A2-adenosine receptor in turkey erythrocytes revealed kinetic properties of adenylyl cyclase activation that were incompatible with the collision coupling model. The results indicated a tight coupling of the adenosine receptor to Gαs (3Braun S. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2134-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Braun S. Levitzki A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 16: 737-748PubMed Google Scholar); the term “restricted collision coupling” was coined to account for this altered mode of coupling. Restricted collision is not a feature unique to the avian A2-adenosine receptor, because it was also documented for the human A2A receptor in platelet membranes (5Gross W. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 524-530PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the A2A-adenosine receptor has the unusual feature of forming a tight complex with Gs, which persists in detergent solution, which is resistant to guanine nucleotides and which requires the combined addition of guanine nucleotides and high concentrations of NaCl to destabilize the ternary complex (6Nanoff C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nanoff C. Stiles G.L. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This argues for “precoupling” (i.e. a preexisting complex between receptor and G protein, which is already formed in the absence of agonist). The combination of precoupling and a tight association, which is not dissociated in the presence of guanine nucleotides, by definition, gives rise to activation kinetics of adenylyl cyclase indistinguishable from restricted collision coupling. The mechanistic basis for restricted collision coupling has remained elusive. Here, we explored two alternative working hypotheses; the restricted mobility of the receptor may either arise from its interaction with the cytoskeleton, specifically the cortical actin cytoskeleton, or be due the anisotropy of the cell membrane resulting from its cholesterol content. We reexamined the restricted collision coupling model by visualizing the mobility of the A2A receptor by using fluorescence recovery after acceptor photobleaching (FRAP). 4The abbreviations used are: FRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingARNOADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide-binding site opener (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARF6)CFPcyan fluorescent proteinCRFcorticotropin-releasing factorFRETfluorescence energy resonance transferGPCRG protein-coupled receptorNFRETnet FRETPKAprotein kinase AYFPyellow fluorescent proteinXACxanthine amino congenerd-PDMPd-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanolMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseANOVAanalysis of variance. In the present work, we demonstrated that it is the lipid composition of the cell membrane that is important for restricting the mobility of the A2A receptor.

Cell Culture, Radioligand Binding Assay, MAPK Stimulation, and Cellular cAMP Accumulation—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, PC-12 cells were at 5% CO2, 95% air and 37 °C. Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine Plus™. Rat striatal neurons were isolated on E17 and transfected with the PKA cDNA constructs using a rat neuron kit (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly 5 × 106 cells were centrifuged at 500 × g and resuspended in 0.1 ml of nucleofector solution. After the addition of 2 μg of DNA, cells were electroporated with program O-003. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum (0.5 ml) was immediately added, and cells were allowed to recover for 5 min at 37 °C, subsequently seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips, and maintained in neurobasal modified Eagle's medium supplemented with B27 and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were performed after 5 days in vitro. Binding of the antagonist [3H]ZM241385 was determined in a final volume of 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ∼5 × 104 suspended cells and radioligand concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 15 nm. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 5 μm XAC and was less than 10% in the KD concentration range. The reaction mixture was kept in the cell culture incubator at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was terminated by filtration over glass fiber filters using a cell harvester. In competition experiments, the radioligand concentration was 2 nm. To disrupt ternary complexes, 100 μm GTPγS was included in the reaction mixture, and cells were permeabilized by a freeze-thaw cycle (flash freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by rapid thawing).

Fluorescence Microscopy, FRET, and FRAP—Cells were seeded on coverslips and (co-)transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-tagged A2A receptor (or truncated versions thereof) and CFP-tagged D2 receptor. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the coverslips were mounted in the microscope chamber. FRET microscopy was done as with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Cool-SNAP fx cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). For dual emission ratio imaging, we used an excitation filter at 436 nm, a dichroic mirror with a cut-off at 550 nm, and two emission filters (476 nm for CFP and 535 nm for YFP; Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT)) using an automated filter wheel (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd., Hawthorne, NY). An additional excitation filter at 500 nm for YFP was used for three-filter FRET microscopy (13Youvan D. C Silva C.M. Bylina E.J. Coleman W.J. Dilworth M.R. Yang M.M. Biotechnology et alia. 1997; 3: 1-18Google Scholar). Fluorescence images were background-corrected and analyzed with MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Integration time was 200 ms/image. To measure donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching, we acquired a donor (CFP) image before and after photobleaching using the YFP setting for 90 s (excitation 500 nm, dichroic mirror 525 nm, and emission 535 nm) to calculate a ratio image. Fluorescence images were analyzed using the MetaSeries software MetaFluor and MetaMorph (release 4.6, Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Photobleaching FRET microscopy was done by continuous illumination with a 100-W mercury lamp and the CFP filter set with time series imaging for 1 min (with the acquisition of one image every 2 s), which was sufficient to bleach the donor to an extent of less than 20% (14Just H.

Regions of interest were selected over the membrane, and fluorescence emission intensities were quantified using the NIH Image software. The resulting decay curves were fitted to the equation for a single exponential decay approaching a constant value: fluorescence intensity = A0 × e-Kt + b, where A0 denotes the starting value, b denotes the final fluorescence signal, and K is the decay constant. The time constant τ (fluorescence lifetime) is defined as 1/K. Confocal microscopy was performed under oil immersion using a laser scan microscope (Zeiss Axiovert LSM510). FRAP analysis was carried out in cells transfected with YFP-tagged A2A receptors as described previously (15Korkhov V.M. Holy M. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13439-13448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, in circular regions of interest, time series were taken with (i) one scan before bleaching and (ii) about 70 iterations of bleaching with 100% laser power (514 nm) followed by 50-100 scans of the bleach region. An image of the whole cell was taken before and after the FRAP time series in order to calculate the loss in total fluorescence of the compartment investigated. This overall loss in fluorescence was taken into consideration to calculate the actual fluorescence recovery and to correct plateau values defining the mobile versus immobile fraction. Mean fluorescence intensities of the bleached region over time were measured using Scion-Image™ 4.0.2, and the values were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using the single exponential association algorithm, y = M × (1 - e-kx) + b, where b represents the relative fluorescence intensity immediately after the bleaching (before recovery), M is the maximum extent of fluorescence recovery, and k defines the rate of recovery. Data were weighted by 1/y2 to minimize the relative distances squared (which improves the curve fitting for the initial phase of the fluorescence recovery). The half-life of fluorescence recovery t½ is defined by 0.69/k, and the plateau, which represents the percentage of mobile receptors, is given by M + b. For a valid comparison of different FRAP experiments, the calculated half-lives of fluorescence recovery were normalized to the length of the bleached segment. Sustained Signaling by the A2A Receptor Visualized at the Single Cell Level—G protein-coupled receptors exist in several conformational states; when activated by agonist, they may engage their cognate G protein(s), or, alternatively, they may undergo desensitization (by the sequential action of specific kinases and recruitment of arrestin and clathrin adapters). These different species may differ in their mobility and thus confound the analysis. In addition, the time scale over which FRAP analysis can be carried out has a lower limit (of >50-70 s; see below). This precludes the detection of dynamic changes, which occur during the initial events of receptor activation, because these occur on the time scale of milliseconds to seconds (16Hein P. Rochais F. Hoffmann C. Dorsch S. Nikolaev V.O. Engelhardt S. Berlot C.H. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33345-33351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, experiments have to be done under steady state conditions (i.e. in the presence of antagonist) to force the receptor into the inactive conformation or in the continuous presence of agonist under the assumption that the receptor undergoes productive coupling to Gs rather than desensitization. We therefore verified that, over the observation periods typically employed in subsequent FRAP experiments, the A2A receptor gave rise to sustained G protein signaling; we selected two cell types in which the receptor was endogenously expressed: (i) the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 and (ii) striatal neurons. The cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for a YFP-tagged version of the catalytic subunit and a CFP-tagged version of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (8Lissandron V. Terrin A. Collini M. D'alfonso L. Chirico G. Pantano S. Zaccolo M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to allow for measurements of cAMP accumulation at the single cell level. (Fig. 1A). Under basal conditions, the association of the two subunits was detected as FRET. Upon the addition of the specific A2A receptor agonist CGS 21680 (at the subsaturating concentration of 100 nm;EC50 ∼ 30 nm), resonance energy transfer declined, reflecting stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and the resulting dissociation of the catalytic subunit from the regulatory subunit dimer. It is evident from Fig. 1B that cAMP levels remained elevated for up to 30 min of agonist stimulation. The addition of 10 μm of the antagonist XAC did not result in any change of PKA activity. However, the addition of the antagonist XAC to agonist-stimulated cells restored resonance energy transfer to the original level (Fig. 1B, inset). A similar recovery was also seen upon removal of the agonist by washing (not shown). This ruled out the possibility that the persistent loss of FRET was due to degradation of one of the two fluorescent PKA subunits. Based on these observations, we conclude that Gs was continuously activated by the A2A receptor and that there was no indication for desensitization of adenylyl cyclase activation. PC12 cells are a tumor-derived cell line and express high levels of A2A receptors (>1.5 pmol/mg; see Ref. 18Kudlacek O. Just H. Korkhov V.M. Vartian N. Klinger M. Pankevych H. Yang Q. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Boehm S. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: 1317-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These high receptor levels may titrate out components of the desensitization machinery. We therefore also confirmed this observation in striatal neurons, where the receptor is endogenously expressed (at ∼1 pmol/mg, with substantial enrichment in synaptic spines); stimulation of the A2A receptor elicited sustained cAMP accumulation, as judged from the persistent activation of the reporter PKA (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a transient response was observed upon stimulation of D1 receptors, which are also expressed on striatal neurons (albeit on those of the direct pathway). Within 30 min of continuous agonist challenge, resonance energy transfer between the catalytic and regulatory subunit was restored to the original level (Fig. 2B). Thus, the D1 receptor-induced cAMP response had undergone complete desensitization.FIGURE 2Absence of A2A receptor desensitization in striatal neurons. Cells were transiently transfected with plasmids coding for a YFP-tagged version of the catalytic and a CFP-tagged form of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and incubated with 0.1 μm CGS21680 (A) or 10 μm dopamine (B) for the indicated time. Cells were monitored under a fluorescent microscope using the three-filter method; the images shown were captured with the FRET filter set and displayed in pseudocolors. Different time points of a dentritic region (red box) are shown on the right with enhanced contrast to better illustrate the changes in NFRET intensity.

Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The measurement of receptor diffusion and mobility may also be confounded by recycling of receptors from an endocytotic pool, which replenishes the receptor at the membrane (and thus spuriously increases fluorescence recovery). We performed antibody feeding experiments to estimate the size of the internalized receptor pool; a FLAG-tagged version of the A2A receptor was expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cells were incubated with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody prior to agonist (CGS21680) or antagonist (XAC) treatment. Thereafter, the cells were challenged with agonist or antagonist for up to 1.5 h and subsequently fixed for immunostaining. Although some intracellular immunoreactivity was visible, which represented internalized A2A receptors, the bulk of the receptors remained at the cell surface at all time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, and 90 min) tested. We did not observe a difference between agonist (Fig. 3A, top row) and antagonist-treated cells (Fig. 3A, bottom row). However, antibody feeding may be too insensitive for visualizing rapidly cycling receptors (internalization and subsequent rapid exocytosis), because the limited sample throughput does not allow for resolving closely spaced intervals. As an alternative method that allowed us to visualize internalization in real time, a strategy was employed that relied on the quasisimultaneous confocal visualization of the YFP-tagged A2A receptor and CFP-tagged Rab5 (a marker for early endocytotic vesicles). Again, administration of CGS21680 did not result in any appreciable increase in A2A receptor endocytosis (Fig. 3B). Structures that contained both Rab5 and the A2A receptor were formed at the cytoplasmic leaflet and also pinched off the membrane. However, this phenomenon was not only observed after the addition of CGS21680 but also in the presence of the antagonists ZM241385 or XAC or if cells had been only treated with adenosine deaminase to deplete endogenous adenosine (not shown). Accordingly, this endocytosis was classified as basal internalization of the A2A-adenosine receptor. More importantly, basal internalization only removed a modest fraction of the receptor, and the bulk of the A2A receptors stayed at the cell surface. As a positive control, we used the YFP-tagged CRF receptor-1, which readily internalized in CFP-Rab5-positive vesicles upon agonist stimulation (results not shown). Finally, we also evaluated the capacity of agonist to internalize the A2A receptor endogenously expressed in PC12 cells. Cells were preincubated in the presence (Fig. 3C, left-hand set of bars) or absence of the agonist CGS21680 (Fig. 3C, right-hand set of bars). After removal of agonist, receptor levels were determined by binding of the antagonist [3H]ZM241385. The experimental approach relied on the difference in cell permeability of XAC (lipophilic and hence cell-permeable) and of CGS21680 (a hydrophilic adenosine analog, which is not a substrate for concentrative or equilibrative nucleoside transporters and hence does not enter cells). If there was substantial internalization of the receptor, nonspecific binding defined in the presence of XAC should be substantially smaller than that defined by CGS21680 in agonist-pretreated cells. As can be seen from Fig. 3C, there was not any appreciable difference in nonspecific binding levels, regardless of whether assessed in agonist-pretreated or control cells. Lateral Mobility of the A2A Receptor Is Not Affected by Agonist Exposure—The control experiments described above verified that the bulk of the A2A receptor stayed at the cell surface even upon prolonged agonist stimulation. Accordingly, it was possible to measure the lateral mobility of the receptor without confounding effects arising from either receptor desensitization or recycling. A2A receptor activation is predicted to result in the transient formation of a ternary complex that is larger in size by a factor of 3 than the receptor alone (i.e. 135 kDa versus 45 kDa) if the receptor interacted as a monomeric species with a G protein heterotrimer. Because of the increased size, this complex is expected to have a reduced mobility, and it should be detectable by FRAP, provided that this complex accumulates under steady state conditions; the YFP-tagged version of the A2A receptor was expressed in HEK293 cells, and a membrane strip of 5 μm was bleached using an intense laser beam (Fig. 4A). The lateral diffusion rate of the A2A receptor determined the rate of fluorescent recovery in the bleached region (Fig. 4, A and B). The half-life of recovery (t½) was normalized to the length of the stretch, and the distance (in μm) was divided by the half-life of recovery, which gave a value for the relative speed of lateral movement. If HEK293 cells express moderate to high levels of A2A receptor, the receptor is found in an abundant amount in intracellular compartments (10Milojevic T. Reiterer V. Stefan E. Korkhov V.M. Dorostkar M.M. Ducza E. Ogris E. Boehm S. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore selected cells expressing low levels of the receptor (i.e. cells in which the receptor was visualized predominantly at the cell surface). The second parameter that can be extracted from FRAP measurements is the mobile fraction of a certain protein that corresponds to the maximum fluorescence intensity (corrected for bleaching during repeated measurements) reached after recovery from photobleaching. The lateral mobility of the A2A receptor was not modulated upon administration of an agonist or an antagonist compared with basal levels (Fig. 4C); also, the mobile fraction of the A2A receptor was not affected, with maximum recovery reaching 55 to 65% of the original fluorescence (Fig. 4D). Mobility of the Hetero-oligomeric Complex Formed by the D2-dopamine/A2A-adenosine Receptor—The D2-dopamine receptor was analyzed for comparison, because it is a potential hetero-oligomeric partner of the A2A receptor (17Fuxe K.

Hence, screening and identifying natural or synthetic compounds with anti-cancer activity via p53-independent pathway is one of the most challenging tasks for scientists in this field. Compound JKA97 (methoxy-1-styryl-9H-pyrid-[3,4-b]-indole) is a small molecule synthetic anti-cancer agent, with unknown mechanism(s). In this study we have demonstrated that the anti-cancer activity of JKA97 is associated with apoptotic induction via p53-independent mechanisms. We found that co-incubation of human colon cancer HCT116 cells with JKA97 inhibited HCT116 cell anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice and also induced a cell apoptotic response, both in the cell culture model and in a tumorigenesis nude mouse model. Further studies showed that JKA97-induced apoptosis was dramatically impaired in Bax knock-out (Bax(-/-)) HCT116 cells, whereas the knock-out of p53 or PUMA did not show any inhibitory effects. The p53-independent apoptotic induction by JKA97 was confirmed in other colon cancer and hepatocarcinoma cell lines. In addition, our results showed an induction of Bax translocation and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol in HCT116 cells, demonstrating that the compound induces apoptosis through a Bax-initiated mitochondria-dependent pathway. These studies provide a molecular basis for the therapeutic application of JKA97 against human cancers with p53 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1988653222,"An ATP binding cassette transporter LolCDE complex releases lipoproteins from the inner membrane of Escherichia coli in an ATP-dependent manner, leading to the formation of a complex between a lipoprotein and a periplasmic chaperone, LolA. LolA is proposed to undergo a conformational change upon the lipoprotein binding. The lipoprotein is then transferred from the LolA-lipoprotein complex to the outer membrane via LolB. Unlike most ATP binding cassette transporters mediating the transmembrane flux of substrates, the LolCDE complex catalyzes the extrusion of lipoproteins anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane. Moreover, the LolCDE complex is unique in that it can be purified as a liganded form, which is an intermediate of the lipoprotein release reaction. Taking advantage of these unique properties, we established an assay system that enabled the analysis of a single cycle of lipoprotein transfer reaction from liganded LolCDE to LolA in a detergent solution. The LolA-lipoprotein complex thus formed was physiologically functional and delivered lipoproteins to the outer membrane in a LolB-dependent manner. Vanadate, a potent inhibitor of the lipoprotein release from proteoliposomes, was found to inhibit the release of ADP from LolCDE. However, a single cycle of lipoprotein transfer occurred from vanadate-treated LolCDE to LolA, indicating that vanadate traps LolCDE at the energized state."

We found that HIV-1 Tat can activate the RNAPII transcription complexes paused on c-myc by enhancing their elongation efficiency.

Elongation can be regulated by both positive and negative acting factors. For instance, negative transcription elongation factors such as the 5,6-dichloro-1β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole-sensitive inducing factor and the negative elongation factor (5Wada T. Takagi T.

Positive transcription elongation factors such as positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) enhance the overall rate of transcription elongation. P-TEFb is composed of the CDK9 kinase and cyclin T1 (7Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). At present, the mode of action of these negative and positive-acting factors is not well understood. Negative transcription elongation factors somehow pause RNAPII complexes in the 5′ region of the transcription unit, resulting in arrested transcription, whereas positive transcription elongation factors overcome the effects of negative transcription elongation factors by releasing RNAPII complexes from its arrest (5Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H.

Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This is in part accomplished by multiple phosphorylation events of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of the RNAPII. A hyperphosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain correlates with the presence of RNAPII at the coding regions of genes and, thus, is considered a mark of elongating polymerases (8Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Among the most notable examples of promoter-proximal pausing, where RNAPII complexes are stalled in the 5′ region of the transcription unit, are the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genes and the proto-oncogene c-myc. HIV-1 regulates its gene expression through the interplay of specific DNA cis-acting elements located within the long terminal repeat (LTR), the trans-acting viral protein Tat, and cellular factors. Tat activates viral gene expression by enhancing the elongation efficiency of RNAPII complexes in a process that is mediated by the interaction of Tat with P-TEFb, which enhances RNAPII elongation by phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNAPII (9Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Tat activates transcription through an unusual mechanism; it binds to an RNA element designated TAR (for trans-activation response element) in the 5′ end of the HIV-1 transcript. The c-myc proto-oncogene encodes a DNA-binding protein that is involved in the control of cellular proliferation, and its expression is altered in a wide variety of human tumors including breast, colon, cervical carcinomas, small lung carcinomas, osteosarcomas, glioblastomas, and myeloid leukemias (10Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In normal cells, c-myc RNA is expressed at high levels during proliferative growth, but its levels decrease significantly during cellular differentiation. The decrease in c-myc RNA levels has been attributed to mechanisms operating at the level of elongation. In vivo RNAPII footprinting experiments have shown promoter-proximal pausing of transcription complexes in the c-myc gene (11Krumm A. Meulia T. Brunvand M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which suggests that the previously described block to elongation is due to paused RNAPII complexes in the c-myc promoter region (12Krumm A. Meulia T. Groudine M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this context it is possible that the phosphorylation state of the RNAPII carboxyl-terminal domain might contribute to the promoter proximal pausing of transcription complexes. The mechanism and factors that regulate transcriptional elongation and promoter-proximal pausing of c-myc, however, remain to be elucidated. The pausing of RNAPII at discrete sites in the 5′ region of the transcription unit is a widespread phenomenon that takes place at many other genes (for review, see Ref. 13Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar), and based upon similarities in elongation control among some of these genes, a model for control of expression of these genes at the elongation phase of transcription has been proposed (12Krumm A. Meulia T. Groudine M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Cullen B.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 417-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This model suggests that distinct promoter elements can nucleate the assembly of RNAPII transcription complexes that differ in their elongation efficiency. However, the influence that promoters have on promoter-proximal pausing and elongation factor recruitment has not been investigated yet. In the study presented here we have developed an in vitro transcription elongation assay that reproduces promoter-proximal pausing of c-myc gene. We used this assay to carry out an analysis of the regulation of the c-myc and HIV-1 transcription elongation. We found that HIV-1 Tat can activate the c-myc-paused RNAPII transcription complexes, which are then able to elongate more efficiently. We also found that CDK9 regulates transcription elongation of c-myc and show that this factor is present in pre-initiation complexes formed on the c-myc promoter. Finally, we analyzed the different roles of upstream elements of the HIV-1 and c-myc promoters in CDK9-activated elongation by targeted recruitment of this cyclin-dependent kinase in vivo. In our experiments changes engineered into the HIV-1 and c-myc TATA-box sequences greatly alter CDK9 transcriptional induction, which suggest an essential role of this element in nucleate active, elongation-competent transcription complexes. In addition, the specific combinations of upstream activator binding sites present at each promoter contribute to this process by modulating the efficiency of the recruitment of these complexes to the TATA-box. Our data argue that proteins bound to the TATA-box and upstream sequences make simultaneous and stereospecific contacts that are necessary for efficient recruitment of processive transcription complexes. Plasmids—The parental template HIVdGless was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment containing HIV LTR sequences (from–133 to +120) into KpnI/XbaI-digested pTZHIVdGless plasmid (15Suñé C. Goldstrohm A.C. Peng J. Price D.H. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Virology. 2000; 274: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The HIVBLdGless contains a deletion of the TAR bulge. In the HIVTATAmdGless plasmid the TATA-box has been changed to GTCAC by standard techniques. The TdTdGless plasmid contains the initiator element (–6 to +11) from the TATA-less promoter of the TdT gene. The parental P1P2cmycdGless and P2cmycdGless plasmids were constructed by inserting PCR fragments containing human c-myc sequences (from –346 to +42 and from –94 to +42, respectively) into KpnI/XbaI-digested pTZHIVdGless plasmid. Human c-myc DNA was kindly provided by Ana Aranda (Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols,” Madrid, Spain). The c-mycTARdGless plasmids were constructed by inserting PCR fragments containing the HIV TAR or mutated bulge sequences (from +1 to +120) into the parental plasmids by standard techniques. Oligonucleotide sequences and protocols are available upon request. For the transient transfection experiments, the G5HIV-LUC reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting HIV sequences (from –133 to +120) into MluI/NheI-digested G5pGL3 vector. G5pGL3 vector was created by inserting five repeats of GAL4 DNA-binding sequences between KpnI and SacI sites of the pGL3 plasmid (Promega). The HIV mutant promoter plasmids NFI+II, Sp1I+II+III, and TATAm contain mutations that destroy the NF-κB, Sp1, and TATA-box DNA binding sites, respectively. To engineer those mutations we used DNA templates that have been described before (16Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 139-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Suñé C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Kuan-Teh Jeang (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The c-myc-based luciferase plasmid G5cmycP2-LUC contains the P2 promoter with five GAL4 binding sites and was kindly provided by G. Napolitano and L. Lania (University of Naples, Naples, Italy). The G5cmyP2Sp1m was constructed by inserting appropriate DNA sequences from the pmycCAT-XΔNmut (18Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), which was provided by G. Napolitano and L. Lania. G5cmycE2Fm was constructed by changing the core E2F DNA binding sequence from GGCGGG to ATAGGG, which abolishes transcription factor binding as previously described (19Campanero M.R. Armstrong M. Flemington E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8442-8450Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was used to confirm the presence of the appropriate mutations. Finally, GAL4-CDK9 and GAL4-CDK9dn were described previously (20Majello B. Napolitano G. Giordano A. Lania L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by G. Napolitano and L. Lania. Biotinylation of DNA Templates—For the biotinylation of DNA templates used in Western blot analysis, we amplified by PCR the appropriate promoter sequences in the corresponding dGless plasmid. Primer sequences are available upon request. Antibodies and Recombinant Proteins—Antibodies against CDK9, cyclin T1, RNAPII (N-20), TFIID (TATA-box-binding protein (TBP)), CDK2, nucleolin, and rabbit IgGs were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against U2AF65 were kindly provided by J. Valcárcel (CRG, Barcelona, Spain). The CA150 antibodies used in this study were described previously (21Sánchez-Álvarez M. Goldstrohm A.C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Suñé C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4998-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Sp1 were originally provided by J. Horowitz (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Anti-Tat antibodies were a generous gift of K. T. Jeang, and anti-GFP antibodies were from Invitrogen. Expression and purification of recombinant Tat and P-TEFb proteins have been described previously (15Suñé C. Goldstrohm A.C. Peng J. Price D.H. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Virology. 2000; 274: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Suñé C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of PICs—25 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Dynal) pre-equilibrated in 25 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 m NaCl) were incubated with 250 ng of biotinylated templates for 30 min at room temperature. DNA-containing beads were subsequently incubated in IVT buffer (14 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 14% glycerol, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 250 ng of poly(I)·poly(C), 300 ng of poly(dI)·poly(dC), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100 μg/ml) containing 68 mm KCl (IVT-68) and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. After the blocking step beads were washed with IVT-68 buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with 10 μl of HeLa nuclear extracts (8 μg/μl) prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.N. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing IVT-68 buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. HeLa nuclear extract was first treated with 0.1 μg/ml TaqI-digested pGl3 plasmid (Promega) to minimize nonspecific binding. The immobilized templates were then harvested using a magnetic device, and the PICs were washed extensively with IVT buffer containing 150 mm KCl (IVT-150) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. In vitro transcription and Western blot analysis could then be performed using the purified PICs assembled on the immobilized templates. In Vitro Transcription/Elongation Assay—The in vitro transcription/elongation assay was performed as previously described (15Suñé C. Goldstrohm A.C. Peng J. Price D.H. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Virology. 2000; 274: 356-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The trans-activation of short and long transcripts was calculated by measuring the radioactivity for each product with phosphorimaging. Data were normalized for uridine content by dividing the radioactivity of the product by the number of uridine residues in the fragment (24 for the 83-nt cassette and 138 for the 377-nt cassette) (24Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10990-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Elongation efficiency was the calculated as the molar ratio of long to short transcripts. For the in vitro transcription/elongation reactions with the purified PICs, immobilized DNA templates were prepared as described before, but 500 ng of DNA in 50 μl of binding buffer were used. Purified PICs were resuspended in 25 μl of IVT-68 buffer containing 625 μm (each) ATP, CTP, and GTP, 40 μm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 1 μl), and 4 units of RNasin (Promega). After incubating for 30 min at 30 °C, transcription reactions were processed and analyzed as described previously (22Suñé C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of CDK9—Affinity matrices were prepared by binding 170 μl (0.2 μg/ml) of anti-CDK9 antibodies to 100 μl of magnetic Protein A beads (Dynal Biotech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. After washing, immunoglobulins were linked to the matrix with dimethyl pimelimidate as previously described (25Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 521-523Google Scholar). CDK9-containing magnetic beads were incubated with 180 μl of HeLa nuclear extract in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (V/V) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.8 m KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at 4°C. Magnetic beads were collected using a magnet, and the supernatant was saved for a subsequent round of depletion after eluting the immune complexes with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0, washing, and equilibrating the beads. The final supernatant was dialyzed against buffer D containing 0.1 m KCl and used in Western blotting and transcription reactions. ChIP Assay—The stably transfected Jurkat cell line pHR′-2xTat.Flag-IRES-eGFP, which simultaneously expresses the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and Tat genes, was obtained from Eduardo Muñoz (Universidad de Córdoba). We carried out the ChIP experiments following guidelines from Upstate Biotechnology with some modifications. Briefly, cells were fixed with 5 mm dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2 HCl (DTBP) (Pierce) for 30 min on ice and with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and sonicated in a two-step protocol using a Branson Sonifer 450 and the Diagenode Bioruptor. Appropriate DNA size fragments of an average of about 250 bp were obtained. Chromatin was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, PCR was used to amplify the immunoprecipitated DNA. The following primers spanning the promoter region of the c-myc and HIV-1 LTR were used: 5′-CTCGAGAAGGGCAGGGCTTCTCAG-3′ (forward), 5′-AGAGGCGAAGCCCCCTATTCGCTC-3′ (reverse) and 5′-CATCCGGAGTACTTCAAGAACTGC-3′ (forward), and 5′-GGCTTAAGCAGTGGGTTCCCTAG-3′ (reverse), respectively. The sequence of the control primers for the amplification of an intergenic region upstream of the c-myc gene and the exonic region of the B-cell transcription factor OCT-2 were: 5′-TGATCCACTAAGGGGTCATCA-3′ (forward), 5′-GGTCATTCCAGATGAATTGCC-3′ (reverse) and 5′-TGACAAGCCGATAGCCGAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATCCTCAGCTGTGGGGACGC-3′ (reverse), respectively. Cell Culture and Transfections—The human cell lines HeLa or 293T were used in cell transfection experiments. Transfections were performed as described previously (17Suñé C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reporter vector CMV-CAT was used as an internal control for transfection, and pSV2βGAL plasmid was used to keep constant the total amount of nucleic acid. The study of the mechanisms governing transcriptional elongation has been hindered by the lack of appropriate methods to measure RNAPII efficiency. We, therefore, sought to establish an in vitro system that would allow us to biochemically and functionally dissect the regulation of transcription elongation due to promoter proximal pausing in the human c-myc gene. Transcription driven by the c-myc promoter can be observed in vitro by using HeLa nuclear extracts (26London L. Keene R.G. Landick R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4599-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In those in vitro cell-free assays, transcription from the c-myc promoter is measured as run-off products. To directly measure the elongation efficiencies of transcribing polymerases, we established an in vitro elongation assay that utilizes a double G-less cassette template (24Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10990-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) driven by the c-myc promoter. This template synthesizes transcripts that contain two regions (cassettes) of different sizes that lack guanosine residues; therefore, these G-less cassettes are resistant to digestion with RNase T1. One G-less cassette is located proximal to the promoter so as to measure the numbers of transcription complexes that reach nt +146 (short), and the second, downstream, G-less cassette measures the number of transcripts beyond nucleotide +1910 (long) (see Fig. 1A). The c-myc gene is transcribed from four different promoters and the major ones, P1 and P2, accounting for ∼10 and 80%, respectively, of total c-myc steady-state RNA in normal cells (27Battey J. Moulding C. Taub R. Murphy W. Stewart T. Potter H. Lenoir G. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 34: 779-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to construct two different c-myc promoter templates containing either the P2 promoter alone or both the P1 and P2 promoters (Fig. 1A). Transcription from the c-myc promoters was efficient (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 4), reflecting efficiency of RNAPII complexes formed on the c-myc promoter. However, increasing the concentration of DNA template in the transcription reaction dramatically reduced the levels of c-myc elongation as observed by the increase in the amount of short transcripts relative to long (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 5 and 6). We observed the same result when using P1/P2 or P2 DNA templates. At present, the nature of the bands smaller than 83 nucleotides detected at high DNA concentration (lanes 3 and 6) is unknown. As a control, we performed the in vitro transcription/elongation assay in the presence of α-amanitin, which strongly inhibits RNAPII-dependent transcription. Transcription was completely eliminated by 4 μg of α-amanitin per ml, which indicates that RNA synthesis was carried out by RNAPII (data not shown). Those results indicate that premature pausing/termination of transcription complexes assembled on the c-myc promoter increases as a function of the amount of template, suggesting that a factor(s) essential for fully processive elongation may be limiting in the nuclear extract. HIV-1 Tat Activates RNAPII Transcription Complexes Assembled on the c-myc Promoter—The block to elongation in the human c-myc gene is similar to HIV-1 transcription. Activation of HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on the presence of the viral Tat protein, which activates viral gene expression by enhancing the elongation efficiency of RNAPII complexes. This process is mediated by the interaction of Tat with its RNA target called TAR and with P-TEFb (9Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We reproduced this effect in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells by transcribing a template containing the wild type HIV-1 promoter and the two G-less cassettes. In this elongation assay, exogenous recombinant Tat protein strongly increased the level of long transcripts with less effect on the level of short transcripts (Fig. 2A). Quantification of the long and short transcripts shows a bigger effect on the activation of long transcripts by Tat (Fig. 2A), which indicates an increase in the elongation efficiency of RNAPII complexes formed on the HIV-1 promoter. This activation was dependent on a functional TAR element since Tat was unable to activate an HIV-1 promoter containing a deletion in the bulge sequence (Tat binding site) of this element (Fig. 2B). The similarities in elongation control between c-myc and HIV-1 suggest a common mechanism for the control of this phase of transcription. This predicts that cellular proteins regulating HIV elongation would function similarly for c-myc. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the HIV-1 TAR element downstream of the c-myc promoter at a position similar to its natural site in the HIV-1 gene and examined the effect of Tat in c-myc read-through transcription using the elongation assay. Transcription reactions were performed in conditions where the elongation efficiency of the RNAPII complexes formed on the c-myc promoter was low (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6). The addition of Tat strongly activated c-myc transcription as reflected by the preferential increase in the level of the long transcripts (Fig. 2C). Quantification of these data is also shown in graph form (Fig. 2C). Activation of transcriptional elongation of the c-myc gene by Tat was dependent on a functional TAR element (data not shown). Corroborating data were obtained using in vivo transient transfection experiments. The TAR-containing c-myc construct and the HIV promoter construct linked to a luciferase reporter gene were transiently transfected in cells in the absence or presence of a Tat-expressing plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2D, Tat strongly activated transcription driven by both promoters. In this transfection assay Tat failed to activate a c-myc promoter template containing a deletion in the bulge sequence of TAR (data not shown). These data demonstrate that Tat can modify the RNAPII complexes formed on the c-myc promoter to activate elongation efficiency. In the cell-free system described here, Tat stimulates transcription by 3–10-fold, which is consistent with previous in vitro results (22Suñé C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Marciniak R.A. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 791-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have shown, however, that Tat increases transcription by several hundred-fold (such as the data shown in Fig. 2D). The high basal levels of HIV transcription or the inefficient re-initiation observed in vitro and the lack of an appropriate chromatin environment may account for those differences.

https://openalex.org/W2162280686,"The 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine drug-resistant M184I HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) has been shown to synthesize DNA with decreased processivity compared with the wild-type RT. M184A displays an even more severe processivity defect. However, the basis of this decreased processivity has been unclear, and both primer-template binding and dNTP interaction defects have been proposed to account for it. In this study, we show that the altered properties of the M184I and M184A RT mutants that we have measured, including decreased processivity, a slower rate of primer extension, and increased strand transfer activity, can all be explained by a defect in dNTP utilization. These alterations are observed only at low dNTP concentration and vanish as the dNTP concentration is raised. The mutant RTs exhibit a normal dissociation rate from a DNA primer-RNA template while paused during synthesis. Slower than normal synthesis at physiological dNTP concentration, coupled with normal dissociation from the primer-template, results in the lowered processivity. The mutant RTs exhibit normal DNA 3′-end-directed and RNA 5′-end-directed ribonuclease H activity. The reduced rate of DNA synthesis causes an increase in the ratio of ribonuclease H to polymerase activity thereby promoting increased strand transfer. These latter results are consistent with an observed higher rate of recombination by HIV-1 strains with Met-184 mutations.

The p51 and p66 subunits share a common N terminus; the p51 subunit lacks 120 amino acids from the C terminus of the p66 subunit. Active sites for polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) reside in p66. The highly conserved motif YXDD in the polymerase active site of HIV-1 and other retroviral RTs is essential for polymerase activity (1Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N.

It is the l-pseudo sugar version of 3TC that is used to treat patients. The M184I/V mutations cause steric hindrance between the oxathiolane ring of 3TCTP and the β-branched side chain of valine or isoleucine, which hinders incorporation of 3TCTP (6Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L.

Wild-type MLV RT has valine in the second position of the YXDD motif (Val-223), and wild-type MLV is resistant to 3TC (9Halvas E.K. Svarovskaia E.S. Freed E.O. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6669-6674Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Replacing the valine at position X in the YXDD motif of the WT MLV RT with methionine (V223M) makes the virus more susceptible to 3TC, and the MLV RT more sensitive to 3TCTP (10Boyer P.L. Gao H.Q. Clark P.K. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6321-6328Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both HIV-1 and MLV RTs with an alanine substitution at the X position are moderately resistant to 3TC in vitro, even though alanine is not a β-branched amino acid (10Boyer P.L. Gao H.Q. Clark P.K.

Virology. 2004; 322: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This suggests that other factors, such as altered positioning of the template primer in the RT active site, also contribute to 3TC resistance (10Boyer P.L. Gao H.Q. Clark P.K. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6321-6328Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutation of the HIV-1 RT in response to 3TC therapy produces drug resistance, but also alters other properties of the RT. New properties might be helpful, harmful, or neutral with respect to the welfare of the infected patient. For this reason, it is important to understand the biochemical characteristics of 3TC-resistant forms of HIV-1 RT. This has been a goal of previous and current work. human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase nucleocapsid protein donor extension product foldback product transfer product transfer efficiency 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine nucleotide(s) wild-type Moloney leukemia virus dithiothreitol ribonuclease H 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine triphosphate. Most polymerases exhibit processive synthesis, adding a number of nt each time they bind a primer-template. Processivity is the quantitative parameter of processive synthesis, indicating the average number of nucleotides added each time the RT engages the primer (12Bambara R.A. Uyemura D. Choi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The M184V mutant of HIV-1 RT has, relative to the wild-type enzyme, reduced processivity (13Sharma P.L. Crumpacker C.S. J.

Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the reduced processivity of M184I contributes to the reduced fitness of viruses carrying this mutation and to the selection, in vivo, of M184V (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT structure determinations show that the YMDD motif lies on the surface of the palm domain and is part of the polymerase active site. A type II′ turn connects β7 to β8 and allows the side chains of these four amino acids to interact with the primer-template, metal cofactor and the dNTP (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Previously, x-ray structural comparison analyses of complexes of the wild-type and M184I mutant RTs showed differences in the positioning of the primer-template (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Specifically the last few nt of the primer are distorted by the mutant RT. The 3′-OH is moved 1.5 Å out of place. There are also changes on the template position and the β12–β13 “primer grip” loop of the RT. These observations suggest that the repositioning of the primer-template accounts for the decreased processivity (8Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Mutations at position 184 have also been shown to increase the Michaelis constant (Km) for dNTP utilization by HIV-1 RT (18Wilson J.E. Aulabaugh A. Caligan B. McPherson S. Wakefield J.K. Jablonski S. Morrow C.D. Reardon J.E. Furman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13656-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This is indicative of a dNTP binding defect. The decreased ability to bind dNTPs would be expected to reduce the primer elongation rate, affecting the measured processivity value. Moreover, the reduced processivity of Met-184 mutants was exacerbated by limiting dNTP concentrations (16Back N.K. Nijhuis M. Keulen W. Boucher C.A. Oude Essink B.O. van Kuilenburg A.B. van Gennip A.H. Berkhout B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 17Back N.K. Berkhout B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was unclear from these results whether the effects of the mutations on dNTP utilization were a major determinant of the measured processivity defect. An alternative is that the mutant RT forms have a defect that causes premature dissociation even if dNTP concentrations were raised to a point where the mutant and wild-type RTs elongate primers at the same rate. Additional evidence suggests that the M184I mutation also influences strand transfer in HIV (19Nikolenko G.N. Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8761-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HIV-1 packages two copies of its viral genome in the virion. Strand transfer occurs when the RT begins DNA synthesis on one template and switches to the other. Two strand transfers are required for the synthesis of linear viral DNA: minus strand strong stop transfer and plus strand transfer (20Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). Additional stand transfers occur during viral DNA synthesis; these can cause genetic recombination if the two RNA genomes in the virion differ in sequence. Such recombination events promote viral diversity and contribute to the development of drug resistance (20Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar, 21Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An RNase H-minus mutant of RT does not make products that can participate in transfer (24Tanese N. Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4387-4397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that degradation of the RNA template is necessary for strand transfer. The ratio of polymerization and RNase H activities determines the efficiency of strand transfer (26Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Hwang C.K. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7171-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Slow polymerization provides an opportunity for the RNase H to carry out additional cleavages of the RNA template, increasing the number of strand transfers; reducing the RNase H activity results in fewer strand transfers (26Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Hwang C.K. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7171-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A mutation that reduces the rate of DNA polymerization without affecting RNase H activity would be expected to promote strand transfer in vitro and recombination in vivo. Nikolenko and colleagues recently demonstrated that HIV-1 containing the drug-resistant M184I RT had an increased recombination frequency compared with the wild-type RT (19Nikolenko G.N. Svarovskaia E.S. Delviks K.A. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8761-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This observation supports an expectation that the M184I mutation promotes strand transfer in vitro. In this study, we have attempted to understand the consequences of mutations at position 184 in HIV-1 RT. We found that the M184I and M184A mutant HIV-1 RTs, relative to wild-type, display reduced processivity and primer elongation rate, and increased strand transfer. However, these altered properties can all be explained by the effects of the mutations on the decreased utilization of dNTPs. Materials—HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7-(1–72) was chemically synthesized as described (27de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Oligo(dT)-poly(rA) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other enzymes and dNTP solutions were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Preparation of HIV-1 RTs—Wild-type HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the Met-184 mutants, M184I and M184A, were prepared as p66/p51 heterodimers as described previously (6Gao H.Q. Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Boyer P.L. Gao H.Q. Clark P.K. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6321-6328Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of each RT preparation were normalized by their relative specific activities of polymerization. The specific activities of all of the RTs were determined by measuring the rate of dTTP incorporation using oligo(dT)-poly(rA) as the primer-template. The reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 98.75 μm dTTP, 1.25 μm [α-32P]dTTP, and 300 fmol of oligo(dT)-poly(rA) duplex in each 10-μl reaction. The ratio of oligo(dT)∼200 to poly(rA)12–18 is ∼1:1. Three different amounts of each enzyme were tested to make sure that the oligo(dT)-poly(rA) was in considerable excess over the amount of enzyme used. 2 μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto DE-81 paper, which was washed by 0.1 m sodium phosphate (dibasic) five times to remove unincorporated radioactivity, and counts per minute were determined by scintillation counting. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP on this template in a 10-min reaction mixture at 37 °C. The specific activities of the wild-type, M184I, and M184A RT were 56,480, 48,240, and 45,430 units/mg, respectively. Preparation of the RNA Templates—The D520 RNA template, which contains the first 520 nt from the 5′-end of the HIV-1 NL4-3 genome, used for the processivity and rate of polymerization assays, was generated as previously described (28Song M. Balakrishnan M. Chen Y. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24227-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The weakly structured substrates used for the transfer activity assay, donor RNA template Dpol, 184 nt in length, and acceptor RNA template Apol, 227 nt in length, were generated as previously described (29Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The sequence of this and the following templates is provided in the cited references. The 41-nt RNA template (30Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) used for the dissociation rate (koff) and intrinsic RNase H assays was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. All RNA templates were purified using polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis. RNAs were quantitated by UV absorption using a GeneQuant II from Amersham Biosciences. Preparation of Substrates—To 5′-end label the RNA templates, purified RNA was first treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate using the manufacturer's protocol. Then the RNA templates or DNA primers were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated ATP was removed using a Bio-Rad P-30 Micro BioSpin size-exclusion column. The RNA template and DNA primer were mixed in a 1:2 ratio and annealed by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Processivity Assays—Processivity of the RTs was measured using the D520 RNA template annealed with the 5′-end 32P-labeled DNA primer lg31 (5′-GCCTTCTGATGTCTCTAAAAGGCCAGGA). RTs were pre-bound to the substrates at room temperature for 5 min prior to the initiation of the reaction by addition of MgCl2, dNTPs, and the oligo(dT)-poly(rA) trap. The final 12-μl reaction mixture contained 4 nm primer, 2 nm donor RNA, 2 units of RT (25 nm WT, 28 nm M184I or 30 nm M184A), 5 μg (∼1000-fold excess over the substrates) oligo(dT)-poly(rA), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA and dNTP concentrations as described. The reactions were performed at 5 μm, 50 μm, 100 μm, and 200 μm dNTPs and sampled at 20 min. To verify that the oligo(dT)-poly(rA) can trap RT effectively, a control experiment was performed in which the oligo(dT)-poly(rA) was preincubated with substrates prior to RT addition. A second control reaction was performed in the absence of the oligo(dT)-poly(rA) allowing multiple rounds of extension. Products were resolved by 6% electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide/urea gel and visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Determination of koff (Dissociation Rate Constants) for the Primer-Template—The value of koff was determined by preincubating HIV-1 RT with the substrates that the 41-nt RNA template (30Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was annealed to the 5′-end 32P-labeled 24-nt DNA primer (5′-TAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCT). Oligo(dT)-poly(rA) was added, and the incubation was continued for various times in the absence of dNTPs so that any RT that dissociated from the substrate would be trapped by the oligo(dT)-poly(rA). RT that remained bound to substrate at various times was quantitated by primer extension. The assay was performed as previously described with slight modifications (31DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6908-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After incubation with the trap mix, poly(rA)-oligo(dT), for 0–80 s, MgCl2, dCTP, dGTP, and ddATP were added to initiate the reaction. The ddATP limits synthesis to 3 nt. The final 12-μl reaction mixture contained 2 nm substrate, 2 units of RT (25 nm WT, 28 nm M184I, or 30 nm M184A), 1.5 μg (∼1000-fold excess over the substrates) of poly(rA)-oligo(dT), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μm of each dCTP, dGTP, and ddATP. Products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide/urea gel, visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and quantitated with ImageQuaNT software v. 1.2 (GE Healthcare). The dissociation rate was determined by graphing the total remaining capacity for incorporation versus time. Results were fitted to an equation for single-exponential decay (Y = e-kofft), where Y is incorporation at time t relative to incorporation at time 0. DNA Polymerization and Strand Transfer Assay—For DNA polymerization assays, the D520 template and lg31 primer described earlier, and the Dpol template and the MB22 primer (29Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were used. Transfer assays used the Dpol template, with weak pausing, and the MB22 primer (29Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36482-36492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In all cases the donor template and primer were annealed as described above and preincubated with RT at room temperature for 5 min prior to the initiation of the reactions by addition of MgCl2 and dNTPs. The final reaction mixtures contained 2 nm substrates, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 units of RT (25 nm wild-type, 28 nm M184I, or 30 nm M184A), and varying dNTPs concentrations as described. For the RT proteins, the rate of synthesis was obtained by dividing the maximum number of nt incorporated by the reaction time. For strand transfer assays, the acceptor RNA template Apol was used at a final concentration of 8 nm. Transfer reactions and DNA polymerization using Dpol template and MB22 primer were performed in the presence of NC. Sufficient NC to provide 200% coverage of the RNA templates (2 NC per 7 nt) was added to the mixture prior to the addition of RT and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated by addition of 2× termination dye mix (20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide, and 0.1% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole). Reaction products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel and visualized and quantitated as described above. The Two-Sample t-Test was used to compare the transfer efficiency of the wild-type RT and M184I mutant, and the wild-type RT and M184A RT mutant. The significance level of the test (denoted α) was set to 0.05. RNase H Assays—3′-End DNA-directed RNase H assays and 5′-end RNA-directed RNase H assays were performed as previously described with slight modifications (30Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ratio of the 5′-end 32P-labeled 41-nt RNA template to the 24-nt DNA primer or the 77-nt DNA primer (30Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was 1:2. The reactions were performed using identical reaction conditions as the DNA polymerization assay described above, except 0.1 unit of RT was prebound with the substrates, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 6 mm MgCl2. Reaction products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide/urea gel and visualized and quantitated as described above. The drug-resistant mutant of HIV-1 RT M184I, which is usually the first resistance mutation to appear in patients treated with 3TC, displays a moderate decrease in processivity compared with the WT RT (15Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Back N.K. Nijhuis M. Keulen W. Boucher C.A.

Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2484-2491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another mutant engineered at the same position, M184A, is even less processive and is partially resistant to 3TC (10Boyer P.L. Gao H.Q. Clark P.K. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6321-6328Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Julias J.G. Boyer P.L. McWilliams M.J. Alvord W.G. Hughes S.H. Virology. 2004; 322: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our initial goal was to determine the biochemical deficiency that causes this reduction in processivity. The Processivity Defect of the Met-184 RT Mutants Is Minimized at High dNTP Concentrations—To compare the processivity of the WT and mutant RTs, DNA synthesis was carried out in reactions that contained a polymer trap, which sequesters any RT that dissociates from the substrate. We used a 520-nt RNA template derived from the 5′-end region of the HIV-1 genome. A 5′-end-labeled DNA primer was annealed to the 3′-end of the template (see “Materials and Methods”). Equivalent amounts of wild-type and mutant RT proteins, as determined from specific activity measurements on a oligo(dT)-poly(rA) template with 100 μm dTTP, were used in each experiment. This equalized any preparation-related differences in polymerization. The RT was bound to the primertemplate, and DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of magnesium, dNTPs, and excess oligo(dT)-poly(rA) trap (Fig. 1A). The size of the DNA products increased with time until all of the RT had fallen off the primer-template and had been sequestered by the trap (data not shown). The final products then represent the distribution of primer extension lengths from one round of RT binding and DNA synthesis (Fig. 1A). The distribution of product lengths on this long RNA template is a very sensitive indicator of processivity. Assays performed with 5 μm of each dNTP showed that, relative to wild-type RT, M184I has a substantially lower processivity, whereas the M184A mutant had an even lower processivity than M184I. At 50 μm of each dNTP, the processivity of M184I and wild-type RT were similar, whereas M184A still showed a somewhat decreased processivity. At 100 and 200 μm of each dNTP some of the products are of full length, but 80% or more are still a distribution of partial extensions. Based on the distribution of product sizes, all three proteins displayed similar processivity. The effectiveness of the trap was verified by preincubating RT with trap before the addition of substrate, magnesium, and dNTPs. Little to no primer extension was observed under these conditions (Fig. 1B), showing that the trap efficiently sequestered the RT, preventing it from re-binding the labeled substrate. A reaction performed in the absence of a trap showed that the wild-type and mutant RTs synthesized more fully extended products than they did in the presence of a trap. The reaction with 100 μm of each dNTP is shown (Fig. 1C). Both Met-184 RT Mutants Exhibit the Same Dissociation Rate from the Primer-Template as Wild-type RT—One possible explanation for the decreased processivity of the mutant RTs is that they dissociate more rapidly from the primer-template than wild-type RT. We measured the dissociation rate (koff) of RT bound to a primer-template. koff was determined by preincubating the RT-primer-template complex with excess oligo(dT)-poly(rA) for progressively longer times before magnesium and dNTPs were added to initiate the polymerase reaction. Because the dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA-RNA substrate was slow relative to the rate of polymerization, the amount of extended product was proportional to the amount of substrate-bound RT remaining over time (Fig. 2A). The dissociation rate was determined by constructing a graph of the total extension as the time of incubation with trap increased (Fig. 2B). Values of koff were calculated after fitting the data to a single exponential decay equation. All three of the RTs showed similar koff values (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the observed decrease in processive synthesis is not the result of premature dissociation of the mutant RTs from the primer-template. Met-184 RT Mutants Exhib"
https://openalex.org/W2030834210,"We characterized HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) variants either with or without the (-)-2',3'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine-resistant M184I mutation isolated from a single HIV-1 infected patient. First, unlike variants with wild-type M184, M184I RT variants displayed significantly reduced DNA polymerase activity at low dNTP concentrations, which is indicative of reduced dNTP binding affinity. Second, the M184I variant displayed a approximately 10- to 13-fold reduction in dNTP binding affinity, compared with the Met-184 variant. However, the k(pol) values of these two RTs were similar. Third, unlike HIV-1 vectors with wild-type RT, the HIV-1 vector harboring M184I RT failed to transduce cell types containing low dNTP concentrations, such as human macrophage, likely due to the reduced DNA polymerization activity of the M184I RT under low cellular dNTP concentration conditions. Finally, we compared the binary complex structures of wild-type and M184I RTs. The Ile mutation at position 184 with a longer and more rigid beta-branched side chain, which was previously known to alter the RT-template interaction, also appears to deform the shape of the dNTP binding pocket. This can restrict ground state dNTP binding and lead to inefficient DNA synthesis particularly at low dNTP concentrations, ultimately contributing to viral replication failure in macrophage and instability in vivo of the M184I mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2018105773,"Hawaiian volcanoes are formed by the extrusion of large quantities of basaltic magma related to hot-spot activity below the Pacific plate. Despite many years of study, aspects of the topography characteristic of these volcanoes, such as rift zones, giant fault scarps and the resulting landslides, remain largely unexplained. Jean-Luc Got et al. use seismological data and finite-element mechanical modelling to show that surface topography may be controlled by the topography of the oceanic crust beneath the island, which is heavily deformed under the load of the volcano. Seismological investigations and finite-element mechanical modelling are used to show that the load exerted by large Hawaiian volcanoes can be sufficient to rupture the oceanic crust. When combined with the accelerated subsidence of the oceanic crust, this may control the surface morphology of Hawaiian volcanoes. Hawaiian volcanoes are formed by the eruption of large quantities of basaltic magma related to hot-spot activity below the Pacific Plate1,2. Despite the apparent simplicity of the parent process—emission of magma onto the oceanic crust—the resulting edifices display some topographic complexity3,4,5. Certain features, such as rift zones and large flank slides, are common to all Hawaiian volcanoes, indicating similarities in their genesis; however, the underlying mechanism controlling this process remains unknown6,7. Here we use seismological investigations and finite-element mechanical modelling to show that the load exerted by large Hawaiian volcanoes can be sufficient to rupture the oceanic crust. This intense deformation, combined with the accelerated subsidence of the oceanic crust and the weakness of the volcanic edifice/oceanic crust interface, may control the surface morphology of Hawaiian volcanoes, especially the existence of their giant flank instabilities8,9,10. Further studies are needed to determine whether such processes occur in other active intraplate volcanoes."
https://openalex.org/W2029199485,"RFX4_v3 (regulatory factor X4 variant 3) is a brain-specific isoform of the transcription factor RFX4. Insertional mutagenesis in mice demonstrates that Rfx4_v3 is crucial for normal brain development. Many genes involved in critical processes during brain morphogenesis are dysregulated in Rfx4_v3 mutant brains. For example, Cx3cl1 is a CX3C-type chemokine that is abundant in brain and is a direct transcriptional target of RFX4_v3 through a specific promoter X-box (X-box 1), the responsive element for RFX proteins. To identify potential interacting partners for RFX4_v3, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis. Nine candidate interactors were identified, including GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2). Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that GPS2 and RFX4_v3 co-localized to the nucleus. Both GPS2 and RFX4_v3 mRNAs were also present in most portions of the adult mouse brain as well as in brains at different ages, suggesting that the two proteins could bind to each other. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that physical interactions between GPS2 and RFX4_v3 did indeed occur. Furthermore, GPS2 was recruited to the Cx3cl1 promoter by RFX4_v3 and potentiated RFX4_v3 transactivation on this promoter through X-box 1, suggesting that the protein-protein interaction was functionally relevant. GPS2 bound to both the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 575-735) and the middle region (amino acids 250-574) of the RFX4_v3 protein. RFX4_v3 amino acids 1-574 stimulated the Cx3cl1 promoter to a similar extent as the full-length RFX4_v3 protein; however, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region of RFX4_v3 impaired the co-activating abilities of GPS2. Based on these data, we conclude that GPS2 interacts with RFX4_v3 to modulate transactivation of genes involved in brain morphogenesis, including Cx3Cl1.

Chen H. Cornille F. Roques B.P. Reith W. Mach B. Burley S.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These proteins regulate their target genes by binding to symmetrical X-box consensus sequences 5′-GTNRCCN0-3R-GYAAC-3′ (where N is any nucleotide, R is a purine, Y is a pyrimidine, and the two half sites GTNRCC and RGYAAC are separated by 0-3 base pairs). RFX family members have been identified in a broad range of eukaryotic organisms, including yeast, fungi, nematodes, fruit flies, and mammals (2Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In mammals, five RFX proteins have been isolated, named RFX1-RFX5. RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 are structurally related proteins, which share the DBD, glutamine-rich (Q), and/or proline- and glutamine-rich (PQ) regions, and four additional evolutionarily conserved regions, A, B, C, and dimerization domains (2Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These proteins form homodimers or heterodimers through their dimerization domains and regulate downstream gene expression. The functions of RFX1 and RFX2 remain elusive. RFX3 has been shown to direct nodal cilium development and left-right asymmetry specification (3Bonnafe E. Touka M. AitLounis A. Baas D. Barras E. Ucla C. Moreau A. Flamant F. Dubruille R. Couble P. Collignon J. Durand B. Reith W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 4417-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). RFX5 is the most intensively studied family member. It does not contain the dimerization domain and forms a complex with other transcription factors to regulate major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression. Mutations in the RFX5 gene cause the bare lymphocyte syndrome (4Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).The first two full-length RFX4 cDNAs were isolated in 2002 (2Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These isoforms were expressed specifically in testis and named RFX4 transcript variant 1 (RFX4_v1) and RFX4 transcript variant 2 (RFX4_v2). The third variant of RFX4 was identified serendipitously in our laboratories by insertional mutagenesis in 2003. Transgenic mice were generated for cardiac specific overexpression of a human arachidonic acid epoxygenase gene (5Seubert J. Yang B. Bradbury J.A. Graves J. Degraff L.M. Gabel S. Gooch R. Foley J. Newman J. Mao L. Rockman H.A. Hammock B.D. Murphy E. Zeldin D.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 506-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and one line of these mice developed an unexpected brain phenotype. The transgene was found to be inserted into an intron in the mouse Rfx4 locus and to prevent the expression of a novel brain-specific variant of Rfx4, termed Rfx4 transcript variant 3 (Rfx4_v3) (6Blackshear P.J. Graves J.P. Stumpo D.J. Cobos I. Rubenstein J.L. Zeldin D.C. Development. 2003; 130: 4539-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Several additional RFX4 splice variants have been identified more recently (7Matsushita H. Uenaka A. Ono T. Hasegawa K. Sato S. Koizumi F. Nakagawa K. Toda M. Shingo T. Ichikawa T. Noguchi Y. Tamiya T. Furuta T. Kawase T. Date I. Nakayama E. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The Rfx4_v3 transcript variant is the only RFX4 isoform significantly expressed in fetal and adult brain, and its expression is restricted to brain. Studies in mice demonstrated that interruption of a single allele prevented formation of the subcommissural organ, a structure important for cerebrospinal fluid flow through the aqueduct of Sylvius, resulting in noncommunicating congenital hydrocephalus (6Blackshear P.J. Graves J.P. Stumpo D.J. Cobos I. Rubenstein J.L. Zeldin D.C. Development. 2003; 130: 4539-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interruption of both alleles caused failure of dorsal midline brain structure formation and perinatal death (6Blackshear P.J. Graves J.P. Stumpo D.J. Cobos I. Rubenstein J.L. Zeldin D.C. Development. 2003; 130: 4539-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies implicated RFX4_v3 in early brain development as well as in the genesis of the subcommissural organ (6Blackshear P.J. Graves J.P. Stumpo D.J. Cobos I. Rubenstein J.L. Zeldin D.C. Development. 2003; 130: 4539-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rfx4_v3 deficiency presumably caused brain abnormalities by altering the expression levels of key genes that are crucial for brain morphogenesis, such as the signaling components in the Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and retinoic acid (RA) pathways, and some important transcription factors (8Zhang D. Stumpo D.J. Graves J.P. DeGraff L.M. Grissom S.F. Collins J.B. Li L. Zeldin D.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 860-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Besides its role in brain development, RFX4_v3 might also be involved in regulating the circadian clock and the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (9Araki R. Takahashi H. Fukumura R. Sun F. Umeda N.

Craddock N. Owen M.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).RFX4 proteins contain the characteristic DBD, B, C, and dimerization domains but lack the Q/PQ and A regions. Since PQ/Q and A regions play roles in transcriptional activation, it has been suggested that RFX4 has no transactivation capacity but instead functions as a transcriptional repressor (2Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, our experiments indicate that RFX4_v3 could function as a transcriptional activator under certain circumstances. Cx3cl1, a CX3C-type chemokine gene highly expressed in brain (11Tarozzo G. Bortolazzi S. Crochemore C. Chen S.C. Lira A.S. Abrams J.S. Beltramo M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 73: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is down-regulated in Rfx4_v3-/- brains (8Zhang D. Stumpo D.J. Graves J.P. DeGraff L.M. Grissom S.F. Collins J.B. Li L. Zeldin D.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 860-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Both human and mouse Cx3cl1 proximal promoters contain highly conserved X-boxes. RFX4_v3 protein binds directly to the X-box 1 of the mouse Cx3cl1 promoter in vitro and in vivo and activates expression of this gene through this X-box (8Zhang D. Stumpo D.J. Graves J.P. DeGraff L.M. Grissom S.F. Collins J.B. Li L. Zeldin D.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 860-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To date, Cx3cl1 is the only direct transcriptional target identified for the RFX4 protein.To further elucidate the mechanisms whereby RFX4_v3 regulates gene expression, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screening to identify its interacting partners. One of the prey proteins identified was GPS2 (G-protein pathway suppressor 2). GPS2 is a nuclear protein that is ubiquitously expressed and could function as a transcriptional co-factor. In this study, we investigated the physical and functional relationship between RFX4_v3 and GPS2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNuclear Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Automated yeast two-hybrid screening using ProNet technology was performed in conjunction with investigators at Myriad Genetics as previously described with some modifications (12Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA fragments encoding partial human or mouse RFX4_v3 proteins were obtained by PCR amplification and co-transformed with the linear bait vector pGBT.superB into the yeast strain PNY200 (MATα trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 ade2 gal4Δ gal80) to obtain the bait construct in vivo, in which the partial RFX4_v3 proteins were fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (residues 1-147). The cDNAs from each of three different sources were co-transformed with the prey vector pGAD.PN2 into the yeast strain BK100 (MATα trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80 LYS2::GAL-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) to generate three different prey libraries (human whole brain prey library, ∼60 million clones; human hippocampus prey library, ∼38 million clones; mouse embryo prey library, ∼2.9 million clones), in which prey proteins were fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of the Gal4 activation domain (residues 768-881). Approximately 25-30 million bait-containing haploid yeast PNY200 cells were mated with one of the prey libraries. Interacting bait-prey pairs were identified by selecting for the expression of two auxotrophic reporter genes, HIS3 and ADE2. Each interaction pair was confirmed by co-transforming purified bait and prey plasmid DNA into the naive yeast and assaying for expression of a third reporter gene lacZ. The specificity of the prey was investigated in a separate false positive test, where the prey was examined against a mixture of several heterologous baits.Plasmid Constructions—The CMV.BGH3′/BS+ vector (13Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) was modified with insertion of either FLAG or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tags downstream of the multiple cloning sites to create the pCMV-FLAG-BGH3′ or pCMV-HA-BGH3′ vectors, respectively. The full-length human RFX4_v3 cDNA was released from the RFX4_v3/MycHis vector (8Zhang D. Stumpo D.J. Graves J.P. DeGraff L.M. Grissom S.F. Collins J.B. Li L. Zeldin D.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 860-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pCMV-FLAG-BGH3′ or pCMV-HA-BGH3′ vectors. Six partial human RFX4_v3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers shown in Table 1 and subsequently cloned into the pCMV-HA-BGH3′ vector. To direct nuclear translocation of RFX4_v3-(250-574), three copies of the simian virus 40 large T-antigen nuclear localization signal from the pEYFP-Nuc vector (Clontech) was cloned into the corresponding plasmid. To enhance expression levels and to direct nuclear localization of RFX4_v3-(1-300), RFX4_v3-(250-735), and RFX4_v3-(1-300/575-735), the enhanced yellow-green fluorescent protein (EYFP) with three copies of nuclear localization signal was cloned into each of these three plasmids, respectively. The human GPS2 cDNA (clone ID IOH10241) was purchased from Invitrogen, and the full-length GPS2 cDNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification (primers 5′-GATGGATCCCCCGCACTCCT-3′ and 5′-TGGTCTAGACTTGTGGTAGA-3′), and ligated into the pCMV-FLAG-BGH3′ or pCMV-HA-BGH3′ vectors. Correct sequences for all constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing using the ABI/Prism dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit. The plasmids carrying HA-tagged RFX1, RFX2, RFX3, and RFX4_v2 were kind gifts from Dr. James Davenport and have been described previously (2Morotomi-Yano K. Yano K. Saito H. Sun Z. Iwama A. Miki Y.

TaqMan®PCRs were conducted in triplicate. The amplifications were performed as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles each at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s in the ABI/Prism 7900 HT sequence detector system. For Rfx4_v3, the following primers and probe were used for the assay: forward primer, 5′-TCTCGCTCTCTCCTTCAGCTCTA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGTGGGTGAGAGGGCAAAA-3′; probe, 5′-CGCTTCTTCGCCTCTTTTCTTTCCACTAGTT-3′. The assay ID of the predesigned ABI primer/probe set for Gps2 is Mm_00517238_g1; for Cx3cl1, it is Mm00436454_m1; and for Igf1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), it is Mm00439561_m1. Results were normalized to an internal control transcript that encodes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, using the TaqMan Rodent GAPDH control reagents (ABI/Prism).Transient Transfection and Histochemical Staining—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For immunostaining, COS-1 cells were plated on the glass coverslips (Ted Pella) and transfected with the FLAG- or HA-tagged constructs using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and stained with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody Y-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen). The stained cells were mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) to visualize the nuclei.Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Two days after transfection, cells were collected in cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was incubated with anti-HA F-7 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight and then with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted using the Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). The precipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with the mouse anti-HA F-7 horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG M2 horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) antibodies.Reporter Assays—For reporter assays, COS-1 cells were grown in 12-well plates at 60% confluence and then transiently transfected with the RFX4_v3 expression vector (0.5 μg) and/or the GPS2 expression vector (0.5 μg) and a Cx3cl1 promoter plasmid (0.5 μg), using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Plasmid pRL-SV40 (1 ng; Promega) was also co-transfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Transfection assays were performed in triplicate. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities in the lysates were measured with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—To examine the binding of RFX4_v3 and GPS2 to the Cx3cl1 promoter, cells were transfected as described in the reporter assays. ChIP experiments were performed using the ChIP-IT™ express enzymatic Kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations were conducted using anti-HA F-7 antibody, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, or the negative control IgG (Active Motif). Immunoprecipitated DNA was then amplified by real time PCR using the ABI/Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detector System and Power SYBR Green PCR master mix. The primers used to amplify the mouse Cx3cl1 promoter were 5′-CCTAGGTTCTCCAGGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGAGAGGAAGAGCCTGTA-3′. A small fraction of each lysate prior to the immunoprecipitation was saved as “input DNA” and also amplified by real time PCR.Statistics—Student's t test was used for all statistical analyses. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. A p value of <0.05 was taken as the level of significance for all tests.RESULTSIdentification of Proteins That Interact with RFX4_v3—To identify proteins that interact with RFX4_v3, we used partial human or mouse RFX4_v3 proteins (size range: 100-300 amino acids) fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as baits to screen three different human or mouse prey libraries that might contain potential RFX4_v3 interactors. After yeast two-hybrid screening, 11 positive clones that represented nine genes were identified (Table 2). These preys can be classified into three groups. The first group contains proteins that are known or predicted to be present in the nucleus and includes the nuclear protein GPS2, the putative nuclear protein ZBTB1 (zinc finger- and BTB domain-containing 1) (14Strausberg R.L.

We first examined the expression patterns of both genes. RFX4_v3 is the only RFX4 variant that is significantly expressed in the brain, and it is not present in other tissues (6Blackshear P.J. Graves J.P. Stumpo D.J. Cobos I. Rubenstein J.L. Zeldin D.C. Development. 2003; 130: 4539-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, GPS2 has a broad tissue distribution (21Jin D.Y. Teramoto H. Giam C.Z. Chun R.F. Gutkind J.S. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25816-25823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether RFX4_v3 and GPS2 are expressed in a similar temporal and spatial pattern within the brain. Specific antibodies are not currently available to detect the endogenous RFX4_v3 or GPS2 proteins; hence, real time PCR experiments were performed to examine the tissue distribution of the corresponding transcripts. In adult mouse brain, both Rfx4_v3 and Gps2 mRNAs were detectable in all brain sections examined, including the brain stem, mid-brain, cerebellum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, striatum, frontal lobe, and olfactory bulb (Fig. 1A). Both transcripts were also present in the brain throughout development, with expression levels being highest at embryonic day 18.5 (Fig. 1B). Mouse embryonic stem cells (J1 cells) can differentiate into relatively homogeneous neuronal cells in response to RA treatment (22Liour S.S. Yu R.K. Glia. 2003; 42: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Bibel M. Richter J. Schrenk K. Tucker K.L. Staiger V. Korte M. Goetz M. Barde Y.A. Nat.

We found that both Rfx4_v3 and Gps2 transcripts were up-regulated in J1 cells during neuronal differentiation (Fig. 1C), whereas the Rfx4_v3 message was induced to a much greater extent than the Gps2 message. Together, these results demonstrate that both Rfx4_v3 and Gps2 transcripts have similar temporal-spatial distribution patterns within the brain, and they are present in differentiated neuronal cells, suggesting that they could meet under physiological conditions.To further confirm that both RFX4_v3 and GPS2 proteins localized to overlapping cellular compartments, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed in COS-1 cells transiently transfected with HA- or FLAG-tagged constructs. The subcellular localizations of both RFX4_v3 and GPS2 proteins were predominantly nuclear with nucleolar exclusion (Fig. 2), which is consistent with their function as transcription factors. We also observed punctate staining of RFX4_v3 and GPS2 in the cytoplasm and in perinuclear regions in some transfected cells, although this signal was much weaker than the nuclear one (data not shown).FIGURE 2RFX4_v3 and GPS2 proteins are predominantly expressed in the nuclei.

https://openalex.org/W2052106588,"The nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1 affects the structure and function of chromatin; however, its role in regulating specific gene expression in living cells is not fully understood. Here we use embryonic fibroblasts from Hmgn1(+/+) and Hmgn1(-/-) mice to examine the effect of HMGN1 on the heat shock-induced transcriptional activation of Hsp70, a well characterized gene known to undergo a rapid chromatin re-structuring during transcriptional activation. We find that loss of HMGN1 decreases the levels of Hsp70 transcripts at the early stages of heat shock. HMGN1 enhances the rate of heat shockinduced changes in the Hsp70 chromatin but does not affect the chromatin structure before induction, an indication that it does not predispose the gene to rapid activation. Heat shock elevates the levels of H3K14 acetylation in the Hsp70 chromatin of wild type cells more efficiently than in the chromatin of Hmgn1(-/-) cells, whereas treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors abrogates the effects of HMGN1 on the heat shock response. We suggest that HMGN1 enhances the rate of heat shock-induced H3K14 acetylation in the Hsp70 promoter, thereby enhancing the rate of chromatin remodeling and the subsequent transcription during the early rounds of Hsp70 activation when the gene is still associated with histones in a nucleosomal conformation."

To identify novel factors that are involved in this process, we carried out mutagenesis of ATDC5 cells through retroviral insertion and isolated two mutant clones incapable of differentiation. Inverse PCR analysis of these clones revealed that the retroviral DNA was inserted into the promoter region of the Rab23 gene, resulting in increased Rab23 expression. To investigate whether an elevated level of Rab23 protein led to inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation, we characterized ATDC5 cells that either overexpress endogenous Rab23 or stably express ectopic Rab23. Our results revealed that up-regulation of Rab23 can indeed inhibit chondrogenic differentiation with a concomitant down-regulation of matrix genes such as type II collagen and aggrecan. In addition, stable small interfering RNA knockdown of Rab23 also resulted in inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation as well as down-regulation of Sox9, a master regulator of chondrogenesis. Interestingly, Sox9 expression has recently been linked to Gli1, and we found that Rab23 knockdown decreased Gli1 expression in chondrocytes. Because the phenotypes of Rab23 mutations in mice and humans include defects in cartilage and bone development, our study suggests that Rab23 is involved in the control of Sox9 expression via Gli1 protein.

Chondrogenesis is a multi-step process that coordinately controls differentiation of mesenchymal cells into mature chondrocytes marked by expression of Type II collagen (Col2) and other extracellular matrix proteins. These mature cells could in turn become hypertrophic chondrocytes marked by expression of Type X collagen. Hypertrophic chondrocytes then undergo apoptosis, leaving behind a scaffold for invasion by osteoblasts/osteoclasts during endochondral ossification. Differentiation of chondrocytes is controlled by a signaling pathway involving Indian hedgehog and by transcription factors such as Sox9 (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte differentiation can be mimicked in vitro by insulin treatment of the murine chondroprogenitor cell line ATDC5 (2Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). When cultured in insulin-containing medium over a period of 3–4 weeks, ATDC5 cells will condense to form nodules, and cells in these nodules will eventually differentiate into mature chondrocytes to produce a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that can be stained with Alcian blue. After prolonged culture in insulin medium, mature ATDC5 chondrocytes will enter into the hypertrophic phase characterized by the synthesis of Type X collagen and eventually die by apoptosis. Utilizing these properties of ATDC5 cells, we carried out a large scale screening of random retroviral insertions to identify novel regulators of chondrocyte differentiation. By random integration of a retroviral vector into the genome of ATDC5 cells, genes that are critical to chondrogenesis could potentially be disrupted or conversely activated. Alterations of these genes will lead to either spontaneous differentiation of ATDC5 cells or failure of ATDC5 cells to differentiate in insulin medium. ATDC5 cells harboring these activating or inactivating mutations can then be screened by Alcian blue staining. Amplification and sequencing of genomic DNAs from these mutant ATDC5 clones will then lead to identification of the exact retroviral integration sites within these ATDC5 clones and subsequently the affected genes. In this study we report the results of our random mutagenesis screening and describe the characterization of two mutant ATDC5 clones that were unable to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in insulin medium. Sequencing of retroviral integration sites in these two clones revealed that the retroviral DNA was inserted into the promoter region of Rab23 (Ras-related in brain 23), a gene encoding a member of the Rab family of small GTPases (3Olkkonen V.M. Peterson J.R. Dupree P. Lutcke A. Zerial M. Simons K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both overexpression and siRNA 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription. knockdown of Rab23 in ATDC5 cells lead to inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation as well as down-regulation of genes encoding type II collagen and aggrecan. In addition, we showed that a proper level of Rab23 protein is necessary for the expression of Sox9, a well known master regulator of chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, we also found that expression of the Gli1 transcription factor (a major downstream target of the hedgehog signaling pathway) is dependent on Rab23 in ATDC5 cells. Rab23 mutations have been identified both in mice and human, and the mutant phenotypes include defects in bone development and limb patterning. Our study provides evidence for the first time that these Rab23 mutations may exert their effects on the skeletal system through down-regulation of the essential transcription factor Sox9 via Gli1. Cell Culture and Alcian Blue Staining—ATDC5 cells, derived from mouse embryonal carcinoma (2Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (Cambrex Bio Science Inc, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 × 10-8 m sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Upon reaching confluence, the cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml of bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and the medium was changed every other day. Alcian blue (Sigma-Aldrich), which stains cartilage-like extracellular matrix produced by mature chondrocytes, was used to evaluate expression of extracellular matrix by ATDC5 cells. The staining was done after the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 0.1% Alcian blue solution in 0.1 n HCl (pH 1.0) overnight, and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline before macroscopic examination. Inverse PCR Analysis of Retroviral Integration Sites—The LXSN retrovirus-infected ATDC5 cells were selected for stable integration with G418 at 0.5 mg/ml. G418-resistant single clones were picked individually and expanded in triplicate 96-well plates. After reaching confluence, the cells in one plate were stimulated with insulin at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 3 weeks, 0.2% Alcian blue was used to stain cells in the insulin-stimulated plate as well as one unstimulated plate. Genomic DNAs were isolated from ATDC5 cells after expansion of interesting clones. 5 μg of genomic DNA was digested with SacII and circularized with T4 DNA ligase. DNA fragments containing the retroviral insertion sites were amplified using the long template PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) with primers NEO-U3 (5′-agc gca tcg cct tct atc-3′) and NEO-D3 (5′-cca gtc ata gcc gaa tag-3′). The amplified DNAs were isolated and sequenced using primer NEO-U5 (5′-aga gaa cca tca gat gtt-3′). The mouse genomic sequences identified at the sites of retroviral insertion were then used to query the mouse genome data base in the GenBank™ using BLAST for identification of the affected genes. Plasmid Construction and Retroviral Infection—Full-length mouse Rab23 cDNA was amplified from ATDC5 cells by RT-PCR. The amplified cDNA was then cloned into the XbaI-BamHI sites of the pCG vector (4Caceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), which tags the N-terminal end of Rab23 protein with a T7 epitope. For LXSN-T7-Rab23 retroviral construct, T7-Rab23 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pLXSN retroviral vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Retrovirus was generated by transfection of LXSN-T7-Rab23 into PT67 packaging cells with the calcium phosphate method. After retroviral infection and G418 selection, T7-Rab23 expressing ATDC5 clones were pooled and confirmed by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-T7 antibody. Lentivirus-mediated siRNA Knockdown—Lentiviral siRNA construct was obtained by annealing the predesigned primers and subsequent cloning into the HpaI-XhoI sites of the pLL3.7 lentiviral vector (5Rubinson D.A.

For generation of lentivirus, 293FT packaging cells were transfected with 6 μg of pLL3.7-siRNA construct plus 9 μg of ViraPower DNA Mixture (Invitrogen) by the Lipofectamine 2000 method according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, supernatants the containing lentivirus were collected and used to infect ATDC5 cells in the presences of 6 μg/ml polybrene. Infected green fluorescent protein-positive cells were first enriched through sorting by flow cytometry then expanded for further analysis. Western Blot Analysis—To examine changes in protein expression, 2 × 106 ATDC5 cells were collected and lysed with 75 μl of Buffer X (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 270 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and the membrane was blotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab23 antibody (6Guo A. Wang T. Ng E.L. Aulia S. Chong K.H. Teng F.Y. Wang Y. Tang B.L. J. Neurosci.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies used for detection of Sox9 (clone H-90), Gli1(clone H-300), and Gli2 (clone H-300) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The protein bands were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Extraction of RNA and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 105 ATDC5 cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 40 μl of H2O. For RT-PCR, 2 μl of RNA was analyzed in a total volume of 25 μl using the SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen).

Retroviral Insertion Leads to Failure of ATDC5 Cells to Differentiate in Response to Insulin—Mouse ATDC5 chondroprogenitor cells normally undergo rapid growth until reaching confluence. When stimulated with insulin, confluent ATDC5 cells will first condense to form nodules, and cells within these nodules then initiate chondrogenic differentiation. After 2–3 weeks, these cells can generate a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that stains positive with Alcian blue (Fig. 1A, left two panels). To identify novel regulators of chondrocyte differentiation, we infected ATDC5 cells with a LXSN retroviral stock that was sufficiently dilute to favor integration of a single copy of retroviral DNA per cell. Retroviral integration was then selected by culture in G418 medium, and G418-resistant colonies were isolated for screening in duplicate 96-well plates. Plates stimulated with insulin medium and those not stimulated were then stained with Alcian blue. We found that the majority of the 10 × 103 clones evaluated showed no change in their phenotype (Fig. 1A, left two panels). In contrast, two clones (H8-5 and H8-6) failed to undergo differentiation after 21 days of incubation with insulin and did not stain with Alcian blue (Fig. 1A, right two panels). We speculated that the retroviral infection had caused changes in the phenotype in these two clones either through inactivation of genes important for chondrogenic differentiation or through activation of genes critical for inhibition of chondrogenic pathways. Retroviral Insertion Increases Expression of Rab23 in Mutant ATDC5 Clones That Fail to Undergo Chondrogenic Differentiation—To determine the sites of retroviral insertion and the affected gene(s) in clones H8-5 and H8-6, we expanded these two clones for isolation of genomic DNA. After digestion with the restriction enzyme SacII that allows for only a single cut within the retroviral vector but will cut multiple sites in the surrounding genomic DNA, the digested genomic DNA fragments were circularized with T4 ligase. The resultant circular DNA containing the retroviral insertion site was amplified by PCR with specific Neo primers to produce a single band at 2.5 kb in size for both H8-5 and H8-6 (Fig. 1B). Sequencing of this band from H8-5 and H8-6 confirmed that they share an identical sequence at the retroviral integration site. BLAST search of this sequence within the GenBank™ mouse genome data base revealed that the retrovirus had inserted into the 5′ promoter region of Rab23 around 0.6 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 2A). To examine how the retroviral insertion affected Rab23 expression, we carried out Western blotting analysis with total lysates from H8-5 and H8-6 as well as from two other normal ATDC5 clones that were capable of chondrogenic differentiation. We noticed that the levels of Rab23 protein in the two normal ATDC5 clones were lower that those in clones H8-5 and H8-6 (Fig. 2B), indicating that retroviral insertion into its promoter activated the Rab23 gene in clones H8-5 and H8-6. Ectopic Expression of Rab23 Protein Inhibits Differentiation of ATDC5 Cells in the Presence of Insulin—To determine whether overexpression of Rab23 is responsible for the failure of clones H8-5 and H8-6 to differentiate in response to insulin treatment, we amplified the mouse Rab23 cDNA by RT-PCR and then cloned the full-length cDNA into LXSN retroviral vector for infection of ATDC5 cells. To differentiate ectopically expressed Rab23 protein from endogenous Rab23, the Rab23 cDNA in the retroviral vector was tagged with a T7 epitope that can be easily detected by Western blotting. After retroviral infection, individual clones were selected by G418 and pooled to avoid bias because of clonal variations. As a control for our analysis, ATDC5 cells harboring the empty retroviral vector LXSN were also prepared. As shown in Fig. 3A, the rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab23 antibody was able to detect both endogenous Rab23 and ectopic T7-tagged Rab23. In contrast, the mouse monoclonal anti-T7-antibody detected only T7-Rab23. After confirmation of retroviral T7-Rab23 expression, ATDC5 cells expressing T7-Rab23 were cultured for 21 days in medium with or without insulin. Cells harboring the empty LXSN retroviral vector were treated in a similar manner for use as a positive control. We found that in cells expressing ectopic T7-Rab23, insulin failed to produce a cartilage-like extracellular matrix (Fig. 3B), suggesting that ectopic expression of Rab23 inhibited insulin-induced chondrogenic differentiation. Rab23 Down-regulates Expression of Type II Collagen and Aggrecan in ATDC5 Cells—A hallmark of the chondrogenic differentiation is the production of Type II collagen, the major component of cartilage produced by mature chondrocytes (7Lefebvre V. Smits P. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2005; 75: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We have shown in the above experiments that ectopic Rab23 was able to inhibit production of a cartilage-like matrix in ATDC5 cells. To further investigate whether such inhibition is accompanied by down-regulation of the Col2 gene, we isolated total RNA from normal ATDC5 clones and from clones H8-5 and H8-6 for RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, insulin treatment of normal clones induced expression of Col2 with the splicing isoform Col2B as the major product (lanes 1–4). In contrast, insulin treatment of Rab23-overexpressing clones H8-5 and H8-6 did not induce Col2 expression (lanes 5–8). We also examined Col2 expression in ATDC5 cell harboring the empty LXSN retroviral vector or expressing T7-Rab23 after 21 days of insulin treatment. As shown in Fig. 4B, insulin was able to induce Col2 expression in ATDC5 cells harboring the empty retroviral vector (lanes 1 and 2) but failed to do so in cells expressing T7-tagged Rab23 (lanes 3 and 4). To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of Rab23 is Col2-specific or whether it can also down-regulate other genes encoding additional matrix proteins, we assessed the expression of aggrecan. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan expressed in mature cartilage (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After assembly into its supramolecular form, aggrecan contributes to resistance to compressive forces in cartilage through its osmotic resistance. Similar to type II collagen, expression of aggrecan is also thought to be the hallmark of chondrocyte maturation and chondrogenesis (9Schwartz N.B. Pirok 3rd, E.W. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M.S. Prog Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 177-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When analyzed by RT-PCR, insulin treatment of normal clones induced expression of aggrecan (Fig. 4C, lanes 1–4). In contrast, insulin treatment of Rab23-overexpressing clones H8-5 and H8-6 did not induce aggrecan expression (Fig. 4C, lanes 5–8). We also examined aggrecan expression in ATDC5 cells harboring the empty LXSN retroviral vector or expressing T7-Rab23 after 21 days of insulin treatment. Expression of aggrecan was also induced by insulin in ATDC5 cells harboring the empty retroviral vector (Fig. 4D, lanes 1 and 2) but was not inducible in cells expressing T7-tagged Rab23 (Fig. 4D, lanes 3 and 4). Insulin Down-regulates Sox9 Expression in Rab23-overexpressing ATDC5 Cells—The above observation that overexpression of Rab23 results in inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation prompted us to investigate the status of Sox9 expression in Rab23-overexpressing clones H8-5 and H8-6. We reasoned that a proper level of Rab23 might be critical for the functions of chondrocyte-regulatory genes such as Sox9, which is known to control Col2 and aggrecan expression and cartilage formation (10Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 11Sekiya I. Tsuji K. Koopman P. Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Shinomiya K. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10738-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Before insulin treatment, the levels of Sox9 protein in clones H8-5 and H8-6 were higher than in the two normal control clones (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4). After insulin treatment for 2 weeks, however, the levels of Sox9 protein in clones H8-5 and H8-6 were instead significantly lower than in the two normal control clones (Fig. 5, lanes 5–8). This insulin-dependent down-regulation of Sox9 in clones H8-5 and H8-6 helps to explain why expression of Col2 and aggrecan fails to be induced following insulin treatment in Rab23-overexpressing ATDC5 cells. It is possible that because of the lack of sufficient Sox9 protein after insulin treatment of clones H8-5 and H8-6, chondrogenic differentiation could not take place in these Rab23-overexpressing cells. siRNA Knockdown of Rab23 Inhibits Chondrocyte Differentiation and Down-regulates Sox9 Gene Expression—A concern with protein overexpression is that the phenotype change may be artificial and not physiologically relevant. If Rab23 indeed plays a critical role in the regulation of chondrogenesis, depletion of Rab23 protein from the cells should also exert some effects on chondrocyte differentiation. To this end, we constructed a lentiviral vector for delivery of siRNA to achieve stable and long term knockdown of Rab23 in ATDC5 cells. Because the lentiviral vector also co-expresses green fluorescence protein, infected cells can also be enriched first through fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting and then expanded for analysis. Although ATDC5 cells infected with a nonspecific siRNA had no effect on Rab23 expression when compared with mock infected cells, lentivirus-delivered siRNA against nucleotides 668–686 of Rab23 mRNA was able to significantly knock down Rab23 in ATDC5 cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3). Such knockdown of Rab23 appeared to be sustainable because similar effect was observed in cells after treatment with insulin for 12 days. To analyze the effects of Rab23 knockdown on type II collagen expression, total RNAs were prepared from lentivirus-infected ATDC5 cells before or after insulin treatment. RT-PCR analysis revealed that knockdown of Rab23 was accompanied by a significant inhibition of Col2 expression when compared with mock or nonspecific siRNA samples (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–6, top panel). This inhibitory effect on matrix genes was not limited to type II collagen because expression of aggrecan was also down-regulated following Rab23 knockdown. However, expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was not affected, suggesting a specific effect of Rab23 knockdown on genes encoding proteins involved in the production of the extracellular matrix. To further confirm that production of the cartilage-like extracellular matrix was negatively impacted by Rab23 knockdown, ATDC5 cells in a 24-well plate were first infected with lentivirus and then cultured in insulin medium for 12 days before staining with Alcian blue. The intensity of Alcian blue staining did not change between mock infected cells and cells with nonspecific siRNA. However, the intensity of Alcian blue staining was significantly diminished in cells with Rab23 knockdown (Fig. 7A), reflecting a reduced production of the cartilage-like extracellular matrix by these cells. How could a knockdown in Rab23 protein lead to down-regulation of matrix genes and reduction of cartilage-like extracellular matrix? We again examined the expression of Sox9 in these cells. As shown by Western blotting analysis, Sox9 protein is indeed abundant in uninfected ATDC5 cells. When cultured in insulin medium for a longer period of time, Sox9 level was increased in comparison with similarly cultured cells in medium without insulin (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the level of Sox9 protein decreased following Rab23 knockdown both in unstimulated ATDC5 cells (Fig. 7C, lanes 1–3) and in insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 7C, lanes 4–6). Because the level of Sox9 protein is critical to chondrogenesis (12Bi W. Huang W. Whitworth D.J. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6698-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effects of Rab23 knockdown on Col2 and aggrecan expression are therefore most likely to be mediated through a concomitant down-regulation of Sox9. To confirm that Rab23-dependent expression of Sox9 is a common phenomenon and not specific to ATDC5 cells, we also infected the mouse mesenchymal stem cell line C3H10T1/2 with lentivirus for delivery of siRNA. It is well known that, depending on both the concentration and continuous presence of BMP in the growth medium, these cells can undergo a sequential pattern of chondrogenic followed by osteogenic differentiation (13Shea C.M. Edgar C.M. Einhorn T.A. Gerstenfeld L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 1112-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Like in ATDC5 cells, Rab23 expression was knocked down by a specific siRNA against Rab23 (Fig. 8, top panel). Although cells with the specific Rab23 siRNA had a decreased level of Sox9 protein in comparison with mock infected cells or cells harboring the nonspecific siRNA (middle panel), the levels of β-actin were not affected by different treatments in these C3H10T1/2 cells (bottom panel). siRNA Knockdown of Rab23 Results in a Decrease in Gli1 Protein—How could a decrease in Rab23 lead to down-regulation of Sox9 in chondrogenic cells? In neuronal cells, Rab23 is known to antagonize signaling of the Sonic hedgehog pathways. Because Indian hedgehog pathway plays an important role in the differentiation of chondrocytes, we next examined in ATDC5 cells whether changes in Rab23 expression had any effect on the common targets of the hedgehog pathways such as Gli proteins. For this, the cells were again infected with lentivirus for delivery of siRNA. In cells expressing specific siRNA against Rab23, we observed knockdown of Rab23 and a concomitant decrease in Gli1 expression, whereas Gli2 was not affected (Fig. 9). Transcription of the Gli1 gene has been known to be under the control of hedgehog, and up-regulation of Gli1 is diagnostic of hedgehog signaling (14Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Because expression of Gli1 but not Gli2 is dependent on Rab23 in chondrogenic cells, our data suggest that Rab23 is able to selectively affect component(s) of the hedgehog pathway even in the absence of active hedgehog signaling. Mutations in Rab23 were originally found to be associated with the mouse open brain phenotype (opb) (15Gunther T. Struwe M. Aguzzi A. Schughart K. Development. 1994; 120: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kasarskis A. Manova K. Anderson K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7485-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These mutations are single-nucleotide substitutions in both mutant alleles that introduce early stop codons into the open reading frame. In addition to neural tube defects noted in opb, giving the phenotype its name, Rab23 mutations are also associated with malformations in axial skeleton and limbs. In opb embryos, the anlagen of the vertebral bodies were irregular in shape and appeared to be split in half. Defects in the developing ribs include fusions of ribs, split ribs, and holes in the rib anlagen. Limb malformations in opb mutant embryo include shortening of the fibula, greatly reduced tibia anlagen, and duplication of digit I or digit II (polydactyly) (15Gunther T. Struwe M. Aguzzi A. Schughart K. Development. 1994; 120: 3119-3130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human, homozygous nonsense mutations in Rab23 have been recently linked to Carpenter syndrome (17Jenkins D. Seelow D. Jehee F.S. Perlyn C.A. Alonso L.G. Bueno D.F. Donnai D. Josifiova D. Mathijssen I.M. Morton J.E. Orstavik K.H. Sweeney E. Wall S.A. Marsh J.L. Nurnberg P. Passos-Bueno M.R. Wilkie A.O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 80: 1162-1170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature closure of the fibrous joints (cranial sutures) between certain bones of the skull. Individuals with Carpenter syndrome may also have unusually short fingers and toes, partial fusion of the soft tissues between certain digits, the presence of extra toes or additional fingers, or physical abnormalities such as short stature. How does Rab23 exert its effects on development? The extracellular signaling protein Shh (Sonic hedgehog) is essential for many aspects of mammalian embryogenesis such as patterning of the neural tube and limbs. Mutations in Shh and Rab23 are known to cause opposing transformations in neural cell fate; Shh mutant embryos lack ventral cell types, whereas Rab23 mutants lack dorsal cell types. Because ventral cell types that are absent in Shh mutants can be partially restored in Shh Rab23 double mutants (18Eggenschwiler J.T. Espinoza E. Anderson K.V. Nature. 2001; 412: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), it has been thought that Rab23 acts down stream of Shh and functions as an essential negative regulator of the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. Shh signaling is mainly mediated through the Patched and Smoothened transmembrane proteins, and the information is eventually decoded in the nucleus by the action of three zinc finger transcription factors Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 (19Ruiz i Altaba A. Nguyen V. Palma V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In general, Gli1 and Gli2 are activators of Shh-responsive genes, whereas Gli3 functions as a repressor. Genetic studies have indicated that Rab23 inhibits the formation of activator Gli2 and that inappropriate activation of Gli2 is responsible for most neural patterning defects of the Rab23 mutant phenotype (20Eggenschwiler J.T. Bulgakov O.V. Qin J. Li T. Anderson K.V. Dev. Biol. 2006; 290: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, Rab23 has also been shown to promote the production of Gli3 repressor (20Eggenschwiler J.T. Bulgakov O.V. Qin J. Li T. Anderson K.V. Dev. Biol. 2006; 290: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that Gli2 is not affected by a decrease of Rab23 in chondrogenic cells, but expression of Gli1 appears to be dependent on Rab23. Ihh (Indian hedgehog), one of the three mammalian hedgehog proteins, coordinates proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes during endochondral bone development (21St-Jacques B. Hammerschmidt M. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2072-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Because Sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog share a similar signaling pathway, it is possible that Rab23 protein may affect chondrogenesis as an antagonist of Indian hedgehog signaling in chondrocytes. The role of Rab23 on chondrocyte differentiation revealed in this study may help to explain why mutations in Rab23 can negatively impact chondrogenesis and bone development but is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the antagonistic effects of Rab23 are cell autonomous and do not need Patched or Smoothened protein (20Eggenschwiler J.T. Bulgakov O.V. Qin J. Li T. Anderson K.V. Dev. Biol. 2006; 290: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is therefore more likely that Rab23 acts in a hedgehog-independent manner by regulating expression of a specific downstream component of the signaling pathway such as Gli1. In this study, we report that either overexpression or siRNA knockdown of Rab23 results in inhibition of chondrogenic differentiation and a loss of cartilage-like extracellular matrix by ATDC5 cells. In Rab23 overexpressing ATDC5 cells, we noticed that insulin failed to induce differentiation while causing a down-regulation of Sox9. It is not clear at the present time whether this effect of Rab23 overexpression on Sox9 is physiologically relevant. The major concern is that such an effect of Rab23 overexpression is insulin-dependent and may vary from cell type to cell type. On the other hand, siRNA knockdown of Rab23 was accompanied by a failure of differentiation and a decrease in Sox9 protein regardless of insulin treatment in ATDC5 cells. In addition, a similar effect of Rab23 knockdown on Sox9 was observed in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, it appears that normal differentiation of chondrogenic cells requires a certain level of Rab23 protein. Too little Rab23 protein can lead to down-regulation of Sox9 expression and subsequent failure of chondrogenic differentiation. Sox9 has essential, nonredundant roles in specifying the commitment and differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward the chondrogenic lineage in all developing skeletal elements (7Lefebvre V. Smits P. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2005; 75: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mutations in and around the Sox9 gene result in haploinsufficiency and cause campomelic dysplasia (22Foster J.W. Dominguez-Steglich M.A. Guioli S. Kowk G. Weller P.A. Stevanovic M. Weissenbach J. Mansour S. Young I.D. Goodfellow P.N. Brook J.D. Schafer A.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 23Wagner T. Wirth J. Meyer J. Zabel B. Held M. Zimmer J. Pasantes J. Bricarelli F.D. Keutel J. Hustert E. Wolf U. Tommerup N. Schempp W. Scherer G. Cell. 1994; 79: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar), a severe form of chondrodysplasia in human. Sox9, together with L-Sox5 and Sox6, constitutes a master chondrogenic regulatory trio (24Smits P. Dy P. Mitra S. Lefebvre V. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because a sufficient level of Sox9 protein is so important to normal chondrogenesis, we speculate that skeletal defects associated with Rab23 mutations in mice are caused by a down-regulation of the Sox9 protein and defective or incomplete cartilaginous anlagen. Formation of flat bones of the skull does not require a cartilage template but instead is mediated through intramembranous ossification. In this process, osteochondral progenitor cells bypass chondrocytes and directly differentiate into bone-forming osteoblasts. It is possible that in patients with Carpenter syndrome, Rab23 mutations result in decreased expression of Sox9 in osteochondral progenitor cells that eventually differentiate into flat bones of the skull. Sox9 expression normally favors chondrocyte lineage. A decreased level of Sox9 protein in these osteochondral progenitor cells may lessen the antagonistic effects of Sox9 and accelerate osteoblast differentiation, leading to premature closure of the cranial sutures. It is not clear at the present time why expression of Sox9 protein requires a proper level of Rab23 protein. We speculate that in Rab23-overexpressing ATDC5 cells, too much Rab23 some how blocks insulin signaling that is required for up-regulation of Sox9 and other chondrogenic factors. In chondrogenic cells with Rab23 knockdown, our study suggests that Rab23-dependent Sox9 expression could be mediated by Gli1. A recent study supports a direct link between the Shh signaling protein Gli1 and Sox9 regulation, wherein Shh stimulates Sox9 through Gli1 binding to an enhancer element 1.1 Mb upstream of the Sox9 gene (25Bien-Willner G.A. Stankiewicz P. Lupski J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this scenario, Gli1 expression itself may require Rab23 protein, and knockdown of Rab23 leads to less Gli1 and subsequent down-regulation of Sox9 (summarized in Fig. 10). Because Rab23 is also thought to be involved in intracellular protein trafficking (26Wang Y. Ng E.L. Tang B.L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Evans T.M. Ferguson C. Wainwright B.J. Parton R.G. Wicking C. Traffic. 2003; 4: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we cannot rule out the possibility that Sox9 expression may require the trafficking of a critical factor by Rab23, and loss of Rab23 will block the supply of such a factor therefore leading to Sox9 down-regulation."
