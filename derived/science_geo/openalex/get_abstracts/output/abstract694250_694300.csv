https://openalex.org/W4281561150,The dynamic interactions between noble metal particles and reducible metal-oxide supports can depend on redox reactions with ambient gases. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI)-induced encapsulation of platinum particles on titania observed under reducing conditions is lost once the system is exposed to a redox-reactive environment containing oxygen and hydrogen at a total pressure of ~1 bar. Destabilization of the metal-oxide interface and redox-mediated reconstructions of titania lead to particle dynamics and directed particle migration that depend on nanoparticle orientation. A static encapsulated SMSI state was reestablished when switching back to purely oxidizing conditions. This work highlights the difference between reactive and nonreactive states and demonstrates that manifestations of the metal-support interaction strongly depend on the chemical environment.

We examined P-tau181 and P-tau217 (n = 1,329, aged 30-98 years), in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. Continuous, unadjusted plasma P-tau181 and P-tau217 predicted abnormal amyloid positron-emission tomography (PET) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.81-0.86) and tau PET entorhinal cortex (AUROC > 0.80), but was less predictive of a tau PET temporal region of interest (AUROC < 0.70). Multiple comorbidities were associated with higher plasma P-tau181 and P-tau217 levels; the difference between participants with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) was similar to the difference between participants with and without elevated brain amyloid. The exclusion of participants with CKD and other comorbidities affected the establishment of a normal reference range and cutpoints. Understanding the effect of comorbidities on P-tau181 and P-tau217 levels is important for their future interpretation in the context of clinical screening, diagnosis or prognosis at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W4281569605,"The treatment landscape of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is evolving, with promising therapies entering clinical translation, yet patient responses remain heterogeneous, and biomarkers for tailoring treatment are lacking. To understand how disease heterogeneity links with therapy response, we determined the leukemia cell hierarchy makeup from bulk transcriptomes of more than 1,000 patients through deconvolution using single-cell reference profiles of leukemia stem, progenitor and mature cell types. Leukemia hierarchy composition was associated with functional, genomic and clinical properties and converged into four overall classes, spanning Primitive, Mature, GMP and Intermediate. Critically, variation in hierarchy composition along the Primitive versus GMP or Primitive versus Mature axes were associated with response to chemotherapy or drug sensitivity profiles of targeted therapies, respectively. A seven-gene biomarker derived from the Primitive versus Mature axis was associated with response to 105 investigational drugs. Cellular hierarchy composition constitutes a novel framework for understanding disease biology and advancing precision medicine in AML. A novel gene expression classifier of AML heterogeneity captures patient-specific variation in leukemia cell composition and predicts clinical responses to treatment."

https://openalex.org/W4281553981,"Temporary postoperative cardiac pacing requires devices with percutaneous leads and external wired power and control systems. This hardware introduces risks for infection, limitations on patient mobility, and requirements for surgical extraction procedures. Bioresorbable pacemakers mitigate some of these disadvantages, but they demand pairing with external, wired systems and secondary mechanisms for control. We present a transient closed-loop system that combines a time-synchronized, wireless network of skin-integrated devices with an advanced bioresorbable pacemaker to control cardiac rhythms, track cardiopulmonary status, provide multihaptic feedback, and enable transient operation with minimal patient burden. The result provides a range of autonomous, rate-adaptive cardiac pacing capabilities, as demonstrated in rat, canine, and human heart studies. This work establishes an engineering framework for closed-loop temporary electrotherapy using wirelessly linked, body-integrated bioelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W4281554825,"Two-dimensional materials with out-of-plane (OOP) ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties are highly desirable for the realization of ultrathin ferro- and piezoelectronic devices. We demonstrate unexpected OOP ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity in untwisted, commensurate, and epitaxial MoS2/WS2 heterobilayers synthesized by scalable one-step chemical vapor deposition. We show d33 piezoelectric constants of 1.95 to 2.09 picometers per volt that are larger than the natural OOP piezoelectric constant of monolayer In2Se3 by a factor of ~6. We demonstrate the modulation of tunneling current by about three orders of magnitude in ferroelectric tunnel junction devices by changing the polarization state of MoS2/WS2 heterobilayers. Our results are consistent with density functional theory, which shows that both symmetry breaking and interlayer sliding give rise to the unexpected properties without the need for invoking twist angles or moiré domains."
https://openalex.org/W4281561633,"The rate of adaptive evolution, the contribution of selection to genetic changes that increase mean fitness, is determined by the additive genetic variance in individual relative fitness. To date, there are few robust estimates of this parameter for natural populations, and it is therefore unclear whether adaptive evolution can play a meaningful role in short-term population dynamics. We developed and applied quantitative genetic methods to long-term datasets from 19 wild bird and mammal populations and found that, while estimates vary between populations, additive genetic variance in relative fitness is often substantial and, on average, twice that of previous estimates. We show that these rates of contemporary adaptive evolution can affect population dynamics and hence that natural selection has the potential to partly mitigate effects of current environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W4281564034,"In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the loss of androgen receptor (AR) dependence leads to clinically aggressive tumors with few therapeutic options. We used ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing), RNA-seq, and DNA sequencing to investigate 22 organoids, six patient-derived xenografts, and 12 cell lines. We identified the well-characterized AR-dependent and neuroendocrine subtypes, as well as two AR-negative/low groups: a Wnt-dependent subtype, and a stem cell-like (SCL) subtype driven by activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors. We used transcriptomic signatures to classify 366 patients, which showed that SCL is the second most common subtype of CRPC after AR-dependent. Our data suggest that AP-1 interacts with the YAP/TAZ and TEAD proteins to maintain subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic landscapes in this group. Together, this molecular classification reveals drug targets and can potentially guide therapeutic decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4281555558,"During activation, T cells undergo extensive gene expression changes that shape the properties of cells to exert their effector function. Understanding the regulation of this process could help explain how genetic variants predispose to immune diseases. Here, we mapped genetic effects on gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) using single-cell transcriptomics. We profiled 655,349 CD4+ T cells, capturing transcriptional states of unstimulated cells and three time points of cell activation in 119 healthy individuals. This identified 38 cell clusters, including transient clusters that were only present at individual time points of activation. We found 6,407 genes whose expression was correlated with genetic variation, of which 2,265 (35%) were dynamically regulated during activation. Furthermore, 127 genes were regulated by variants associated with immune-mediated diseases, with significant enrichment for dynamic effects. Our results emphasize the importance of studying context-specific gene expression regulation and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4281551743,"Catalyst-controlled site-selective activation of β- and γ-methylene carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bonds of free carboxylic acids is a long-standing challenge. Here we show that, with a pair of palladium catalysts assembled with quinoline-pyridone ligands of different chelate ring sizes, it is possible to perform highly site-selective monolactonization reactions with a wide range of dicarboxylic acids, generating structurally diverse and synthetically useful γ- and δ-lactones via site-selective β- or γ-methylene C–H activation. The remaining carboxyl group serves as a versatile linchpin for further synthetic applications, as demonstrated by the total synthesis of two natural products, myrotheciumone A and pedicellosine, from abundant dicarboxylic acids."

https://openalex.org/W4281569242,"Activation of microglia in the spinal cord dorsal horn after peripheral nerve injury contributes to the development of pain hypersensitivity. How activated microglia selectively enhance the activity of spinal nociceptive circuits is not well understood. We discovered that after peripheral nerve injury, microglia degrade extracellular matrix structures, perineuronal nets (PNNs), in lamina I of the spinal cord dorsal horn. Lamina I PNNs selectively enwrap spinoparabrachial projection neurons, which integrate nociceptive information in the spinal cord and convey it to supraspinal brain regions to induce pain sensation. Degradation of PNNs by microglia enhances the activity of projection neurons and induces pain-related behaviors. Thus, nerve injury–induced degradation of PNNs is a mechanism by which microglia selectively augment the output of spinal nociceptive circuits and cause pain hypersensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W4281564380,"Class 2 CRISPR effectors Cas9 and Cas12 may have evolved from nucleases in IS200/IS605 transposons. IscB is about two-fifths the size of Cas9 but shares a similar domain organization. The associated ωRNA plays the combined role of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA ( tracrRNA) to guide double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cleavage. Here we report a 2.78-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of IscB-ωRNA bound to a dsDNA target, revealing the architectural and mechanistic similarities between IscB and Cas9 ribonucleoproteins. Target-adjacent motif recognition, R-loop formation, and DNA cleavage mechanisms are explained at high resolution. ωRNA plays the equivalent function of REC domains in Cas9 and contacts the RNA-DNA heteroduplex. The IscB-specific PLMP domain is dispensable for RNA-guided DNA cleavage. The transition from ancestral IscB to Cas9 involved dwarfing the ωRNA and introducing protein domain replacements."
https://openalex.org/W4281567959,"Emerging resistance to currently used antibiotics is a global public health crisis. Because most of the biosynthetic capacity within the bacterial kingdom has remained silent in previous antibiotic discovery efforts, uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters found in bacterial genome-sequencing studies remain an appealing source of antibiotics with distinctive modes of action. Here, we report the discovery of a naturally inspired lipopeptide antibiotic called cilagicin, which we chemically synthesized on the basis of a detailed bioinformatic analysis of the cil biosynthetic gene cluster. Cilagicin's ability to sequester two distinct, indispensable undecaprenyl phosphates used in cell wall biosynthesis, together with the absence of detectable resistance in laboratory tests and among multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, makes it an appealing candidate for combating antibiotic-resistant pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4281482597,"Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene therapy (HSPC-GT) is proving successful to treat several genetic diseases. HSPCs are mobilized, harvested, genetically corrected ex vivo, and infused, after the administration of toxic myeloablative conditioning to deplete the bone marrow (BM) for the modified cells. We show that mobilizers create an opportunity for seamless engraftment of exogenous cells, which effectively outcompete those mobilized, to repopulate the depleted BM. The competitive advantage results from the rescue during ex vivo culture of a detrimental impact of mobilization on HSPCs and can be further enhanced by the transient overexpression of engraftment effectors exploiting optimized mRNA-based delivery. We show the therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of hyper IgM syndrome and further developed it in human hematochimeric mice, showing its applicability and versatility when coupled with gene transfer and editing strategies. Overall, our findings provide a potentially valuable strategy paving the way to broader and safer use of HSPC-GT."
https://openalex.org/W4281559259,"Rivers can abruptly shift pathways in rare events called avulsions, which cause devastating floods. The controls on avulsion locations are poorly understood as a result of sparse data on such features. We analyzed nearly 50 years of satellite imagery and documented 113 avulsions across the globe that indicate three distinct controls on avulsion location. Avulsions on fans coincide with valley-confinement change, whereas avulsions on deltas are primarily clustered within the backwater zone, indicating a control by spatial flow deceleration or acceleration during floods. However, 38% of avulsions on deltas occurred upstream of backwater effects. These events occurred in steep, sediment-rich rivers in tropical and desert environments. Our results indicate that avulsion location on deltas is set by the upstream extent of flood-driven erosion, which is typically limited to the backwater zone but can extend far upstream in steep, sediment-laden rivers. Our findings elucidate how avulsion hazards might respond to land use and climate change."

https://openalex.org/W4281550843,"Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is rare: about 10% of gastric cancer (GC) and 1% of colorectal cancer (CRC). SRCC is associated with poor prognosis, however the underlying molecular characteristics are unknown. SRCCs were analyzed using NGS, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated based on somatic nonsynonymous missense mutations, and microsatellite instability (MSI) was evaluated by NGS of known MSI loci. A total of 8500 CRC and 1100 GC were screened. Seventy-six SRCC were identified from the CRC cohort (<1%) and 98 from the GC cohort (9%). The most frequently mutated genes in CRC-SRCC were TP53 (47%), ARID1A (26%), APC (25%); in GC-SRCC were TP53 (42%), ARID1A (27%), CDH1 (11%). When compared to non-SRCC histology (N = 3522), CRC-SRCC (N = 37) more frequently had mutations in BRCA1 (11% vs 1%, P < 0.001) and less frequently mutations in APC (19% vs 78%, P < 0.001), KRAS (22% vs 51%, P = 0.001) and TP53 (47% vs 73%, P = 0.001). Among the GC cohort, SRCC (N = 54) had a higher frequency of mutations in CDH1, BAP1, and ERBB2, compared to non-SRCC (N = 540). Our data suggest that SRCCs harbor a similar molecular profile, regardless of the tumor location. Tailored therapy may become available for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4281552975,"Organic hydrotrioxides (ROOOH) are known to be strong oxidants used in organic synthesis. Previously, it has been speculated that they are formed in the atmosphere through the gas-phase reaction of organic peroxy radicals (RO2) with hydroxyl radicals (OH). Here, we report direct observation of ROOOH formation from several atmospherically relevant RO2 radicals. Kinetic analysis confirmed rapid RO2 + OH reactions forming ROOOH, with rate coefficients close to the collision limit. For the OH-initiated degradation of isoprene, global modeling predicts molar hydrotrioxide formation yields of up to 1%, which represents an annual ROOOH formation of about 10 million metric tons. The atmospheric lifetime of ROOOH is estimated to be minutes to hours. Hydrotrioxides represent a previously omitted substance class in the atmosphere, the impact of which needs to be examined."
https://openalex.org/W4281558684,"Prior to ~1 million years ago (Ma), variations in global ice volume were dominated by changes in obliquity; however, the role of precession remains unresolved. Using a record of North Atlantic ice rafting spanning the past 1.7 million years, we find that the onset of ice rafting within a given glacial cycle (reflecting ice sheet expansion) consistently occurred during times of decreasing obliquity whereas mass ice wasting (ablation) events were consistently tied to minima in precession. Furthermore, our results suggest that the ubiquitous association between precession-driven mass wasting events and glacial termination is a distinct feature of the mid to late Pleistocene. Before then (increasing), obliquity alone was sufficient to end a glacial cycle, before losing its dominant grip on deglaciation with the southward extension of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets since ~1 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W4281705810,"Integrated bioinformatics and statistical approaches are now playing the vital role in identifying potential molecular biomarkers more accurately in presence of huge number of alternatives for disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapies by reducing time and cost compared to the wet-lab based experimental procedures. Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths for women worldwide. Several dry-lab and wet-lab based studies have identified different sets of molecular biomarkers for BC. But they did not compare their results to each other so much either computationally or experimentally. In this study, an attempt was made to propose a set of molecular biomarkers that might be more effective for BC diagnosis, prognosis and therapies, by using the integrated bioinformatics and statistical approaches. At first, we identified 190 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BC and control samples by using the statistical LIMMA approach. Then we identified 13 DEGs (AKR1C1, IRF9, OAS1, OAS3, SLCO2A1, NT5E, NQO1, ANGPT1, FN1, ATF6B, HPGD, BCL11A, and TP53INP1) as the key genes (KGs) by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Then we investigated the pathogenetic processes of DEGs highlighting KGs by GO terms and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Moreover, we disclosed the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory factors of KGs by their interaction network analysis with the transcription factors (TFs) and micro-RNAs. Both supervised and unsupervised learning's including multivariate survival analysis results confirmed the strong prognostic power of the proposed KGs. Finally, we suggested KGs-guided computationally more effective seven candidate drugs (NVP-BHG712, Nilotinib, GSK2126458, YM201636, TG-02, CX-5461, AP-24534) compared to other published drugs by cross-validation with the state-of-the-art alternatives top-ranked independent receptor proteins. Thus, our findings might be played a vital role in breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapies."

https://openalex.org/W4281715961,"Abstract Most mammalian genes generate messenger RNAs with variable untranslated regions (UTRs) that are important post-transcriptional regulators. In cancer, shortening at 3′ UTR ends via alternative polyadenylation can activate oncogenes. However, internal 3′ UTR splicing remains poorly understood as splicing studies have traditionally focused on protein-coding alterations. Here we systematically map the pan-cancer landscape of 3′ UTR splicing and present this in SpUR ( http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/spur/home/ ). 3′ UTR splicing is widespread, upregulated in cancers, correlated with poor prognosis and more prevalent in oncogenes. We show that antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of 3′ UTR splicing efficiently reduces oncogene expression and impedes tumour progression. Notably, CTNNB1 3′ UTR splicing is the most consistently dysregulated event across cancers. We validate its upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, and show that the spliced 3′ UTR variant is the predominant contributor to its oncogenic functions. Overall, our study highlights the importance of 3′ UTR splicing in cancer and may launch new avenues for RNA-based anti-cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4281550335,"The mechanisms by which the fetal-type β-globin-like genes HBG1 and HBG2 are silenced in adult erythroid precursor cells remain a fundamental question in human biology and have therapeutic relevance to sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. Here, we identify via a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen two members of the NFI transcription factor family-NFIA and NFIX-as HBG1/2 repressors. NFIA and NFIX are expressed at elevated levels in adult erythroid cells compared with fetal cells, and function cooperatively to repress HBG1/2 in cultured cells and in human-to-mouse xenotransplants. Genomic profiling, genome editing and DNA binding assays demonstrate that the potent concerted activity of NFIA and NFIX is explained in part by their ability to stimulate the expression of BCL11A, a known silencer of the HBG1/2 genes, and in part by directly repressing the HBG1/2 genes. Thus, NFI factors emerge as versatile regulators of the fetal-to-adult switch in β-globin production."
https://openalex.org/W4281789474,"Considering the widespread use of rabbits in research that potentially causes pain and discomfort and the limited number of pain assessment validated tools in this species, we aimed to develop and validate a scale of acute postoperative pain in rabbits (RPBS). Footage of 58 rabbits from previous studies were used, recorded at 'baseline' (before orthopaedic and soft tissue surgeries), 'pain' (after surgery), 'analgesia' (after analgesic), and '24h post' (24 hours after surgery). The videos were randomised and assessed twice by four evaluators, within one-month interval between evaluations. After content validation, RBPS was further refined using the criteria from the validation. According to the principal component analysis, RPBS was considered unidimensional. The intra- and inter-observer reliability was excellent (ICC>0.80) for all evaluators. There was a high Spearman's correlation of the RPBS with unidimensional scales (>0.80) and a moderate correlation with the Rabbit Grimace Scale (0.68), confirming criterion validity. According to the mixed linear model, the scale was responsive, shown by the increase in pain scores after surgery. Construct validity was confirmed by known-group approach and internal relationships among items. Adequate item-total correlation (>0.3) was observed for all items, except for the attention to the affected area (0.04). The internal consistency was very good (Cronbach's α coefficient = 0.78; Mcdonald's ω coefficient = 0.83). The cut-off score for rescue analgesia was ≥3, with an area under the curve >0.95, demonstrating a high discriminatory capacity of the instrument. Scores 3 and 4 were within the uncertainty diagnostic zone. Specificity was 87% and sensitivity was 90%. It was concluded that the RPBS presented content, criterion, and construct validities, responsiveness, and reliability to assess acute pain in rabbits submitted to orthopaedic and soft tissue surgeries. The cut-off for rescue analgesia serves as a basis for the administration of analgesics to rabbits submitted to painful procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4281572047,"T cell quiescence is essential for maintaining a broad repertoire against a large pool of diverse antigens from microbes and tumors, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. We show here that CD8α is critical for the maintenance of CD8+ T cells in a physiologically quiescent state in peripheral lymphoid organs. Upon inducible deletion of CD8α, both naïve and memory CD8+ T cells spontaneously acquired activation phenotypes and subsequently died without exposure to specific antigens. PILRα was identified as a ligand for CD8α in both mice and humans, and disruption of this interaction was able to break CD8+ T cell quiescence. Thus, peripheral T cell pool size is actively maintained by the CD8α-PILRα interaction in the absence of antigen exposure."

However, novel therapeutics are lacking for the treatment of this cancer. Here, we developed a series of 2-aryl-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-benzoyl)-5-substituted-1,2,3-triazol analogs (6a-6x) as tubulin colchicine-binding site inhibitors, aiming to find a novel promising drug candidate for NSCLC treatment. We first identified 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-5-(3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazole (6h) as a hit compound, which inhibited angiogenesis induced by NSCLC cells both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, our data showed that 6h could tightly bind to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin and inhibit tubulin polymerization. We also found that 6h could effectively induce G2/M cell cycle arrest of A549 and H460 cells, inhibit cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed 6h had the potential to inhibit the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells, two basic characteristics of tumor metastasis. Finally, we found 6h could effectively inhibit tumor progression in A549 xenograft mouse models with minimal toxicity. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for the development of 6h as a promising microtubule colchicine-binding site inhibitor for NSCLC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4281654102,"MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) is a liver abundant microRNA that is released upon liver injury. In the present study, we investigated the circulating miR-122 profiles in a Pakistani patients´ cohort with HCV chronic liver disease that was mainly based on HCV genotype 3 infections. From 222 patients with chronic HCV liver disease, classified as mild, moderate, or severe, serum samples were collected. Cell-free RNA was isolated and used for miR-122 quantification by qPCR. More than 60% of 222 patients were infected with HCV genotype 3. ALT values and HCV viral load showed no correlation with the HCV genotype. Circulating miR-122 levels were significantly upregulated in patients with cirrhosis. Notably, HCV patients with mild cirrhosis showed the most marked increase in serum miR-122 levels (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, we proved a positive correlation (r = 0.46) of miR-122 with the ALT values in patients with mild cirrhosis. Importantly, our data of increased miR-122 levels in serum samples obtained from a patient cohort with a high prevalence of chronic genotype 3 HCV infection confirmed the previous findings collected from cohorts with a high prevalence of genotype 1. Therefore, we suggest that miR-122 increase after HCV infection does not depend on the HCV genotype. In conclusion, our findings confirm that serum miR-122 levels are significantly upregulated in the HCV cirrhotic patients serving in particular as a biomarker for the non-advanced stages of cirrhosis, independently of the HCV genotype."
https://openalex.org/W4281715146,"In commercial pig breeding farms, boars are often exposed to stressful situations, such as confined housing conditions, inadequate environmental temperature, food restriction, lameness, diseases, among other challenges. Confined housing conditions, such as crates, are reported as a major source of stress for pregnant sows, and were banned in the UK and in Europe, however there is limited information about the impact of this housing system for boars. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of three different housing conditions for boars and the consequence on the testicles. We studied 27 crossbred boars (F1 large white and landrace), housed in crates (n = 9), pens (n = 9), or enriched pens (n = 9), during 10 weeks. We collected data of scrotal superficies mean temperature (SSMT) with a thermal camera; we measured testicular parenchyma perfusion (ultrasound evaluation); and we measured sperm characteristics. We found that boars housed in crates had a higher SSMT (p < 0.05) and higher testicular parenchyma perfusion than boars housed in pens and enriched pens (p = 0.01). Regarding the semen features, we found that boars housed in crates showed more agglutinated semen, and higher values of linear curved linear velocity (VCL) than boars housed in pens and enriched pens, both indicators of reduced fertility. These results indicates that boars housed in pens and in enriched pens showed better indicators of testicular health, better sperm motility features (VCL, p = 0.046), and less agglutinated sperm (p < 0;05) than that observed in boars kept in crates."
https://openalex.org/W3201580128,"We solve the binary decision model of Brock and Durlauf (2001) in time using a method reliant on the resolvent of the master operator of the stochastic process. Our solution is valid when not at equilibrium and can be used to exemplify path-dependent behaviours of the binary decision model. The solution is computationally fast and is indistinguishable from Monte Carlo simulation. Well-known metastable effects are observed in regions of the model's parameter space where agent rationality is above a critical value, and we calculate the time scale at which equilibrium is reached using a highly accurate method based on first passage time theory. In addition to considering selfish agents, who only care to maximise their own utility, we consider altruistic agents who make decisions on the basis of maximising global utility. Curiously, we find that although altruistic agents coalesce more strongly on a particular decision, thereby increasing their utility in the short-term, they are also more prone to being subject to non-optimal metastable regimes as compared to selfish agents. The method used for this solution can be easily extended to other binary decision models, including Kirman's model of ant recruitment Kirman (1993), and under reinterpretation also provides a time-dependent solution to the mean-field Ising model. Finally, we use our time-dependent solution to construct a likelihood function that can be used on non-equilibrium data for model calibration. This is a rare finding, since often calibration in economic agent based models must be done without an explicit likelihood function. From simulated data, we show that even with a well-defined likelihood function, model calibration is difficult unless one has access to data representative of the underlying model."
https://openalex.org/W4281291173,"Congenital hypothyroidism with biallelic thyroglobulin (Tg protein, encoded by the TG gene) mutation is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) storage disease. Many patients (and animal models) grow an enlarged thyroid (goiter), yet some do not. In adulthood, hypothyroid TGcog/cog mice (bearing a Tg-L2263P mutation) exhibit a large goiter, whereas adult WIC rats bearing the TGrdw/rdw mutation (Tg-G2298R) exhibit a hypoplastic thyroid. Homozygous TG mutation has been linked to thyroid cell death, and cytotoxicity of the Tg-G2298R protein was previously thought to explain the lack of goiter in WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats. However, recent studies revealed that TGcog/cog mice also exhibit widespread ER stress–mediated thyrocyte death, yet under continuous feedback stimulation, thyroid cells proliferate in excess of their demise. Here, to examine the relative proteotoxicity of the Tg-G2298R protein, we have used CRISPR–CRISPR-associated protein 9 technology to generate homozygous TGrdw/rdw knock-in mice in a strain background identical to that of TGcog/cog mice. TGrdw/rdw mice exhibit similar phenotypes of defective Tg protein folding, thyroid histological abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and growth retardation. TGrdw/rdw mice do not show evidence of greater ER stress response or stress-mediated cell death than TGcog/cog mice, and both mouse models exhibit sustained thyrocyte proliferation, with comparable goiter growth. In contrast, in WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats, as a function of aging, the thyrocyte proliferation rate declines precipitously. We conclude that the mutant Tg-G2298R protein is not intrinsically more proteotoxic than Tg-L2263P; rather, aging-dependent difference in maintenance of cell proliferation is the limiting factor, which accounts for the absence of goiter in adult WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats.

TGrdw/rdw mice do not show evidence of greater ER stress response or stress-mediated cell death than TGcog/cog mice, and both mouse models exhibit sustained thyrocyte proliferation, with comparable goiter growth. In contrast, in WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats, as a function of aging, the thyrocyte proliferation rate declines precipitously. We conclude that the mutant Tg-G2298R protein is not intrinsically more proteotoxic than Tg-L2263P; rather, aging-dependent difference in maintenance of cell proliferation is the limiting factor, which accounts for the absence of goiter in adult WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats. The vertebrate thyroid gland supplies the entire supply of thyroxine (also known as T4) to the body (1Brix K. Qatato M. Szumska J. Venugopalan V. Rehders M. “Thyroglobulin storage, processing and degradation for thyroid hormone liberation”.in: Luster M. Duntas L.H. Wartofsky L. The Thyroid and its Diseases: A Comprehensive Guide for the Clinician. Springer International Publishing, Cham2019: 25-48Crossref Google Scholar). T4 biosynthesis normally occurs upon secretion of thyroglobulin (Tg protein, encoded by the TG gene) (2Holzer G. Morishita Y. Fini J.B. Lorin T. Gillet B.

Hundreds of different TG gene mutations altering the primary structure of the Tg protein have been linked to defective thyroid hormone biosynthesis (9Pio M.G. Siffo S. Scheps K.G. Molina M.F.

Tg is synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); most if not all mutant Tg is thought to misfold and become entrapped within the ER (3Di Jeso B. Arvan P.

On the one hand, primary hypothyroidism with reduced circulating thyroid hormone levels results in a compensatory upregulation of the pituitary secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to induce hyperplastic (i.e., proliferative) thyroid gland growth (16Marine D.

Cyclic-AMP production of goiter.Endocrinology. 1970; 87: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); on the other hand, the ER stress caused by misfolded mutant Tg has been found to be associated with thyroid cell death in both animal models and human patients (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar). Indeed, we recently demonstrated that, albeit inefficient, T4 can be synthesized on mutant Tg released in the follicle lumen from dead thyrocytes, and thyroid goiter growth (proliferation in excess of cell death) helps to provide the cells that sustain this mechanism (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar). It is not guaranteed that net goiter growth will occur in all individuals with hypothyroidism from biallelic TG mutations. Whereas TGcog/cog (congenital goiter) mice (bearing Tg-L2263P) are famous for their adult goiter (22Adkison L.R. Taylor S. Beamer W.G. Mutant gene-induced disorders of structure, function and thyroglobulin synthesis in congenital goitre (cog/cog) in mice.J. Endocrinol. 1990; 126: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats (bearing Tg-G2298R) do not develop a goiter (23Umezu M. Kagabu S. Jiang J. Sato E. Evaluation and characterization of congenital hypothyroidism in rdw dwarf rats.Lab. Anim. Sci. 1998; 48: 496-501PubMed Google Scholar); this was the first model of the disease in which thyrocyte cell death was noted (24Menon S. Lee J. Abplanalp W.A. Yoo S.E. Agui T. Furudate S. et al.Oxidoreductase interactions include a role for ERp72 engagement with mutant thyroglobulin from the rdw/rdw rat dwarf.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6183-6191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This absence of goiter has been attributed to increased rdw-Tg proteotoxicity (25Vono-Toniolo J. Rivolta C.M. Targovnik H.M. Medeiros-Neto G. Kopp P. Naturally occurring mutations in the thyroglobulin gene.Thyroid. 2005; 15: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, original descriptions of the thyroid phenotype of TGcog/cog mice and WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats were limited to the very different AKR/J mouse and Wistar–Imamichi rat strain backgrounds, respectively, in which species- and strain-specific genetic interactions might distinctly alter the balance of thyroid cell growth and death. JAX laboratories currently distribute the TGcog allele in the C57BL6J background, and here, we have used CRISPR/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology to generate homozygous TGrdw/rdw knock-in mice in the same strain background. Our analysis indicates that the gene product of the TGrdw allele is not intrinsically more proteotoxic than that of the TGcog allele, and our data suggest an alternative explanation for the incapacity of WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats to maintain their hypothyroid goiter in adulthood. Using CRISPR/Cas9 with a suitable guide RNA, we introduced within C57BL6J mouse TG exon 40, the point mutation that encodes Tg-G2298R (Fig. 1A; in the UniProt P01266 system, this numbering would need to add 19 to account for the signal peptide), just 35 residues from the site of the cog mutation in the ChEL domain of Tg (Fig. S1). After crossing with C57BL6J, animals were bred to homozygosity so that TGrdw/rdw mice could be compared with TGcog/cog mice in the identical genetic background. Resection of the thyroid gland of adult animals was followed by tissue homogenization in buffer lacking all denaturants, followed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (i.e., in the absence of SDS, mobility is dependent not on protein mass but rather on charge/mass ratio and hydrodynamic radius (26Gallagher S.R. One-dimensional electrophoresis using nondenaturing conditions.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2018; 94: e73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and this has been used to separate unfolded and folded Tg monomers from native Tg dimers (27Kim P.S. Arvan P. Folding and assembly of newly synthesized thyroglobulin occurs in a pre-Golgi compartment.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12412-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kim P. Bole D. Arvan P. Transient aggregation of nascent thyroglobulin in the endoplasmic reticulum: relationship to the molecular chaperone, BiP.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)). After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting with anti-Tg antibody, immunoreactive Tg in WT-control C57BL6J thyroids appeared primarily as two bands corresponding to folded Tg monomers (a smaller quantity) and dimers (a larger quantity, Fig. 1B marked “M” and “D”). However, mutant Tg protein from TGcog/cog and TGrdw/rdw mouse thyroids both appeared primarily as a monomer of slower electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B) indicating a less compact structure consistent with an unfolded state (28Kim P. Bole D. Arvan P. Transient aggregation of nascent thyroglobulin in the endoplasmic reticulum: relationship to the molecular chaperone, BiP.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). When the same samples were analyzed under denaturing conditions by nonreducing SDS-PAGE—although the molecular masses of cog-Tg-L2263P, rdw-Tg-G2298R, and WT-Tg are identical—the mobility of WT-Tg still appeared slightly faster (Fig. 1C), suggesting a more tightly disulfide-linked structure (29Kim K. Kopylov M. Bobe D. Kelley K. Eng E.T. Arvan P. et al.The structure of natively iodinated bovine thyroglobulin.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2021; 77: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 30Lee J. Di Jeso B. Arvan P. Maturation of thyroglobulin protein region I.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 33045-33052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, in WT thyroid glands, nearly all Tg proteins had migrated out of the ER so that most glycans on those Tg molecules were processed to complex sugars resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1D, marked as “R”), whereas all Tg proteins in TGcog/cog and TGrdw/rdw mouse thyroids remained fully endoglycosidase H-sensitive (Fig. 1D, “S”), indicating failure of the mutant Tg protein to arrive at the Golgi complex. Careful examination of the histology of TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mouse thyroid glands revealed important differences with that of the WT thyroid. While all three tissues exhibited prominent eosinophilic staining consistent with accumulation of Tg protein, in WT (TG+/+) thyroid, the Tg protein was primarily localized extracellularly in the follicle lumen, whereas in TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mouse thyroid glands, most Tg proteins were found in an expanded and a distorted cytoplasm within the thyrocytes (Fig. 2A), although there was some aberrant material in the follicle lumen (that we have recently established is comprised of the detritus of dead cells (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar)). From multiple images of thyroid sections derived from 3-month-old animals of each genotype, the cross-sectional area of individual thyrocytes was abnormally expanded approximately eightfold in TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mouse thyroid glands (Fig. S2A) with a fraction of total cellular area occupied by cytoplasm increased to >90% (Fig. S2B) plus an increase of cross-sectional nuclear area (Fig. S2C). With the huge expansion of cytoplasm, the number of thyrocytes actually accommodated within each follicle profile shrank nearly in half (Fig. S2D). To independently confirm whether Tg protein in mouse thyroid glands was primarily extracellular or intracellular, we coimmunostained these tissues for Tg and ezrin, which delimits the follicle lumen at the apical plasma membrane of thyrocytes. Whereas Tg in WT glands was contained within the ezrin ring (i.e., extracellular, in the follicle lumen), the mutant Tg protein in TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mice was largely excluded from within the ezrin ring, indicating that it had not been transported from thyrocytes to the follicle lumen (Figs. 2B and S3). Indeed, in WT (TG+/+) thyroid, the Tg protein distribution was largely nonoverlapping with the ER molecular chaperone, BiP (immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein); whereas in TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mouse thyroid glands, the Tg protein was essentially exclusively contained within the swollen ER, colocalized with BiP (Fig. 2C). As TGcog/cog mice have goiter from hypothyroidism (31Fogelfeld L. Harel G. Beamer W.G. Schneider A.B. Low-molecular-weight iodoproteins in the congenital goiters of cog/cog mice.Thyroid. 1992; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we wished to determine if TGrdw/rdw mice were even more hypothyroid by comparing them to TGcog/cog mice at 3 months of age and again at 11 months. At 3 months, both sets of mutant animals had >75% inhibition of circulating total T4 and >65% inhibition of circulating total triiodothyronine (T3), accompanied by dramatic elevation of murine TSH that averaged ∼25,000 mU/l (Fig. 3A). Accompanying the thyroid hormone defect was body growth retardation for both sets of mutant animals (Fig. 3B), which has been reported in other models of congenital hypothyroidism (32Wang Y. Shimizu H. Xiang Y.-Y. Sugihara J. Lu W.-Y. Liao X.-H. et al.XB130 deficiency causes congenital hypothyroidism in mice due to disorganized apical membrane structure and function of thyrocytes.Thyroid. 2021; 31: 1650-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In both TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mice, the highly elevated TSH levels tended to decline by more than 50% by 11 months (Fig. 3), either as an aging-related phenomenon or possibly consistent with a small improvement in thyroid hormone output by the mutant thyroid glands over time (which, in the case of TGcog/cog mice, is known to be accompanied by goiter growth (22Adkison L.R. Taylor S. Beamer W.G. Mutant gene-induced disorders of structure, function and thyroglobulin synthesis in congenital goitre (cog/cog) in mice.J. Endocrinol. 1990; 126: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). Notably, when compared with TGcog/cog mice, TGrdw/rdw mice never had more elevated TSH (or diminished T4 or T3) levels or more severe growth retardation, indicating that TGrdw/rdw mice did not have more severe hypothyroidism than TGcog/cog mice at any age examined (Fig. 3). In the thyroid gland at 3 months of age, TGrdw/rdw mice showed elevated levels of BiP (normalized to tubulin as a loading control), as was also the case in TGcog/cog mice (Fig. 4A)—indicative of ongoing ER stress. In addition, the BiP cochaperone p58ipk was also clearly elevated in the mutant thyroid glands compared with WT (Fig. 4A). The ratio of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (phospho-eIF2α) to total eIF2α, suggestive of activation of the ER stress sensor, PERK—was elevated in the thyroid glands of both mouse mutants. Importantly, none of these ER stress markers were more elevated in the thyroid glands of TGrdw/rdw mice than in TGcog/cog mice (Fig. 4A). Compared with WT mice, elevation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA level in the thyroid gland was increased in both TGrdw/rdw mice and TGcog/cog mice (Fig. 4B) but again was not more elevated in TGrdw/rdw mice (4.1 ± 2.2 fold) than in TGcog/cog mice (13.2 ± 8.7 fold). Moreover, because chronic continuous ER stress has been associated with subtle signs of dedifferentiation in thyrocytes (11Morishita Y. Kabil O. Young K.Z. Kellogg A.P. Chang A. Arvan P.

Endocrinol. 2020; 11: 588685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) as well as Ire1-mediated mRNA decay (in various cell types (34Hollien J. Weissman J.S.

Genet. 2014; 5: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)), we examined thyroidal TG mRNA levels and observed an average decrease of 56 ± 8% of WT levels in TGrdw/rdw mice and 62 ± 14% in TGcog/cog mice—both significantly different from WT but not different from each other (Fig. 4C). Finally, in conjunction with the chronically increased ER stress, cell death signaling as measured by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was apparent in the thyroid glands of both mutant animals—but with no evidence of greater PARP cleavage in TGrdw/rdw mice than in TGcog/cog mice (Fig. 4A). Because both TGcog/cog mice and WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats are known to exhibit intrathyroidal cell death (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar), we performed TUNEL staining on the newly engineered TGrdw/rdw mice. As expected, the thyroid glands of TGrdw/rdw mice revealed 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen)–positive nuclear material within the lumen of thyroid follicles, associated with positive TUNEL staining (Fig. 5A). While thyrocyte cell death in the mutant mice was significantly greater than background TUNEL staining seen in WT mouse thyroid glands, the TGrdw/rdw mice did not exhibit greater TUNEL staining than that found in TGcog/cog thyroid (Fig. 5B). Altogether from the results of Figs. 4 and 5, although homozygous expression of Tg-G2298R does indeed produce hypothyroidism, we found no evidence to suggest that this mutant Tg yields more ER stress or more proteotoxicity than the Tg-L2263P expressed in TGcog/cog mice. We recently reported that in WIC rats, TGrdw/rdw homozygotes do begin to develop thyroid enlargement within the first two postnatal months, but their absence of goiter in adulthood involves an inability to maintain the goiter as a function of aging (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar). As TGcog/cog mice exhibit thyroid cell death (Fig. 5) but nevertheless manage to grow a large goiter in adulthood, we turned attention to thyroid cell proliferation. By Ki-67 immunostaining of mouse thyroid glands, it was apparent that both TGrdw/rdw and TGcog/cog mutants exhibited sustained enhancement of thyroid cell proliferation well into adulthood (11 months, Fig. 6A). When quantified, TGrdw/rdw mice, on average, definitely did not exhibit less thyroid cell proliferation than that observed in TGcog/cog mice—and both exhibited significantly greater proliferation than that found in the thyroids of WT animals (Fig. 6B). As ER stress–mediated cell death was not increased (Figs. 4 and 5) and thyroid cell proliferation was not diminished (Fig. 6B), there was no reason why TGrdw/rdw mice would not grow a goiter as large as that found in TGcog/cog mice. Indeed, when allowed to survive over the first postnatal year of life, multinodular goiters in TGrdw/rdw mice at least as large as those found in TGcog/cog mice appeared (Fig. S4); vastly larger than the thyroid glands seen in WT animals (Fig. 6C). Because WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats have a dramatic loss of thyroid tissue mass during adulthood (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar), the goitrogenesis in TGrdw/rdw mice seemed perplexing. We therefore returned to WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats to examine thyroid cell proliferation as a function of postnatal age. As noted previously, it is established that WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats do exhibit exuberant thyroid gland growth during the first two postnatal months of life (21Zhang X. Kellogg A.P. Citterio C.E. Zhang H. Larkin D. Morishita Y. et al.Thyroid hormone synthesis continues despite biallelic thyroglobulin mutation with cell death.JCI insight. 2021; 6e148496Google Scholar); indeed, at 8 weeks of age, there was a dramatic increase of thyroidal Ki-67 immunostaining (Fig. 7, A and B). To our surprise, however, unlike in TGrdw/rdw mice (in the C57BL6J genetic background, Fig. 6, A and B), by early adulthood, the hypothyroid WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats no longer exhibited thyroid cell proliferation beyond control levels, and this feature persisted as the animals aged further (Fig. 7, A and B). It has been repeatedly reported that WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats during this period of life (18–40 weeks) do maintain markedly elevated circulating TSH levels (23Umezu M. Kagabu S. Jiang J. Sato E. Evaluation and characterization of congenital hypothyroidism in rdw dwarf rats.Lab. Anim. Sci. 1998; 48: 496-501PubMed Google Scholar, 37Furudate S. Ono M. Shibayama K. Ohyama Y. Kuwada M.

Hayashi H. et al.Altered cerebellum development and dopamine distribution in a rat genetic model with congenital hypothyroidism.J. Neuroendocrinol. 2014; 26: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and indeed, we found that older WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats (>30 weeks) exhibited a circulating TSH (32.7 ± 10.7 ng/ml; n = 10) that was 16.6-fold elevated over that of their WT counterparts (1.97 ± 0.11 ng/ml; n = 3). To confirm that the elevated TSH in adult WIC rats should be sufficiently bioactive to stimulate thyroid cell proliferation, we challenged 14-week-old WT WIC rats to induce hypothyroidism, by introducing propylthiouracil (PTU) continuously for 3 weeks before euthanasia and thyroid tissue analysis at 17 weeks. This treatment yielded a similar elevation of circulating TSH (35.8 ± 1.01 ng/ml; n = 3), and these older hypothyroid WT WIC rats exhibited exuberant thyroid cell proliferation well beyond control levels (Fig. 8, A and B). The data suggest that the WIC strain background is specifically deficient neither for a central nervous system response to hypothyroidism nor for the bioactivity of TSH in older animals. Thus, we conclude that the inability of WIC-TGrdw/rdw rats to expand thyroidal mass in adulthood is caused neither by a genetic deficiency of the central nervous system axis to provide adequate feedback stimulation nor solely by ER stress–mediated thyroid cell death, but rather by an inability of the adult WIC-TGrdw/rdw rat strain to maintain the TSH-driven thyroid cell proliferative response to hypothyroidism that is needed for net thyroid gland growth.Figure 8Thyroid cell proliferation in PTU-induced hypothyroid adult WT rats.

https://openalex.org/W4281297044,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important tissue-specific regulators of gene expression, and their dysregulation can induce aberrant gene expression leading to various pathological conditions, including cancer. Although many lncRNAs have been discovered by computational analysis, most of these are as yet unannotated. Herein, we describe the nature and function of a novel lncRNA detected downstream of the human parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene in both extremely rare ectopic PTH-producing retroperitoneal malignant fibrous histiocytoma and parathyroid tumors with PTH overproduction. This novel lncRNA, which we have named “PTH-AS,” has never been registered in a public database, and here, we investigated for the first time its exact locus, length, transcription direction, polyadenylation, and nuclear localization. Microarray and Gene Ontology analyses demonstrated that forced expression of PTH-AS in PTH–nonexpressing human breast cancer T47D cells did not induce the ectopic expression of the nearby PTH gene but did significantly upregulate Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway–related genes such as cancer-promoting interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) genes. Importantly, we show that PTH-AS expression not only enhanced T47D cell invasion and resistance to the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin but also promoted lung metastasis rather than tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. In addition, PTH-AS–expressing T47D tumors showed increased macrophage infiltration that promoted angiogenesis, similar to IRDS-associated cancer characteristics. Although the detailed molecular mechanism remains imperfectly understood, we conclude that PTH-AS may contribute to tumor development, possibly through IRDS gene upregulation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important tissue-specific regulators of gene expression, and their dysregulation can induce aberrant gene expression leading to various pathological conditions, including cancer. Although many lncRNAs have been discovered by computational analysis, most of these are as yet unannotated. Herein, we describe the nature and function of a novel lncRNA detected downstream of the human parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene in both extremely rare ectopic PTH-producing retroperitoneal malignant fibrous histiocytoma and parathyroid tumors with PTH overproduction. This novel lncRNA, which we have named “PTH-AS,” has never been registered in a public database, and here, we investigated for the first time its exact locus, length, transcription direction, polyadenylation, and nuclear localization. Microarray and Gene Ontology analyses demonstrated that forced expression of PTH-AS in PTH–nonexpressing human breast cancer T47D cells did not induce the ectopic expression of the nearby PTH gene but did significantly upregulate Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway–related genes such as cancer-promoting interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS) genes. Importantly, we show that PTH-AS expression not only enhanced T47D cell invasion and resistance to the DNA-damaging drug doxorubicin but also promoted lung metastasis rather than tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. In addition, PTH-AS–expressing T47D tumors showed increased macrophage infiltration that promoted angiogenesis, similar to IRDS-associated cancer characteristics. Although the detailed molecular mechanism remains imperfectly understood, we conclude that PTH-AS may contribute to tumor development, possibly through IRDS gene upregulation. Noncoding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides are classified as long coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the current release of the public database LNCipedia contains about 128,000 transcripts and about 57,000 genes (1Volders P.J. Anckaert J. Verheggen K. Nuytens J. Martens L. Mestdagh P. et al.Lncipedia 5: towards a reference set of human long non-coding rnas.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: D135-D139Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs regulate tissue-specific gene expression through interaction with DNA, proteins, and RNA, thereby driving vital processes, such as differentiation, development, and immunoregulation (2Batista P.J.

Usually, lncRNA expression is tightly controlled and fine tuned, but dysregulation causes a variety of diseases, including cancer. In fact, next-generation sequencing transcriptomes have revealed that thousands of lncRNAs are abnormally expressed in various cancers (6Huarte M. The emerging role of lncRNAs in cancer.Nat.

While lncRNAs are receiving increased attention, most are predicted only by computational analysis and very few are accurately annotated (11Cao H. Wahlestedt C. Kapranov P. Strategies to annotate and characterize long noncoding RNAs: advantages and Pitfalls.Trends Genet. 2018; 0: 1-18Google Scholar). Therefore, there is great interest not only in revealing the existence of predictive lncRNAs but also in further explaining their effects on cellular processes and phenotypes. We previously reported the possible existence of a new lncRNA located downstream of the human parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene in ectopic PTH-producing malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) (12Uchida K. Tanaka Y. Ichikawa H. Watanabe M. Mitani S. Morita K. et al.An excess of CYP24A1, lack of CaSR, and a novel lncRNA near the PTH gene characterize an ectopic PTH-producing tumor.J. Endocr. Soc. 2017; 1: 691-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same lncRNA was also detected in a PTH-overexpressing parathyroid adenoma (PA) from another patient, suggesting that its expression is closely related to the expression of the nearby PTH gene. However, the exact location and function of the lncRNA was not known. Herein, we describe the characteristics of this lncRNA and the effect of forced expression on PTH–nonexpressing human breast cancer T47D cells on global gene expression including the PTH gene by microarray analysis. Moreover, based on Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, the effects of expression of the lncRNA on cell function, especially cancer phenotype, are demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the lncRNA of interest was identified as an intergenic lncRNA, which we named “PTH-AS” because it is transcribed from the antisense strand downstream of the PTH gene. PTH-AS expression in T47D cells unexpectedly did not induce PTH expression but instead dramatically upregulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and its downstream genes, especially interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS). The IRDS genes belong to a subset of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and include IFI44, OAS1, OAS2, ISG15, MX1, IFIT1, and IFIT3. Unlike other Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT signaling–regulated genes, IRDS expression is induced via the unphosphorylated STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 complex (U-ISGF3) rather than the phosphorylated complex (ISGF3) (13Meissl K. Macho-Maschler S. Müller M. Strobl B. The good and the bad faces of STAT1 in solid tumours.Cytokine. 2017; 89: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Khodarev N.N. Roizman B.

Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). IRDS is strongly associated with resistance to radiation therapy and antitumor treatment with DNA-damaging agents, including doxorubicin (DXR) and cisplatin, because it induces resistance to DNA damage. Indeed, the expression of IRDS in tumor tissue correlates with poor prognosis and has recently attracted attention as a marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers, including breast cancer (15Weichselbaum R.R. Ishwaran H. Yoon T. Nuyten D.S.A. Baker S.W. Khodarev N. et al.An interferon-related gene signature for DNA damage resistance is a predictive marker for chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 18490-18495Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 16Widschwendter A. Tonko-Geymayer S. Welte T. Daxenbichler G. Marth C. Doppler W. Prognostic significance of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 activation in breast cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3065-3074PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, although the detailed mechanism has not been elucidated, IRDS in the tumor microenvironment acts on both tumor cells and stromal cells, promoting epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reducing T-cell cytotoxicity. Therefore, IRDS increases tumor aggressiveness in addition to anticancer drug resistance. The results of this study revealed that PTH-AS expression in T47D cells enhanced EMT-like alterations, invasiveness, and resistance to DXR, similar to the situation reported for IRDS. In a mouse xenograft model, PTH-AS expression promoted lung metastases rather than T47D tumor growth and simultaneously increased macrophage infiltration and associated angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that PTH-AS is involved in malignant transformation and anticancer drug resistance. A novel lncRNA previously discovered in ectopic PTH-producing MFH and PA with PTH hypersecretion was located approximately 3 kbp downstream of the PTH gene (Fig. 1A). Given that the 4-1 fragment was amplified only when reverse transcribed with the sense primer RT-4F1 rather than the antisense primer RT-4R, it was determined that the lncRNA of interest was encoded in the sense strand (Fig. 1B). Primer walking identified the lncRNA in the range 13,487,670 to 13,490,086 on human chromosome 11. In addition, 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends (RACE) determined the exact location and length of lncRNA transcripts and identified three transcripts with different lengths: 667 bp (13488037–13488703), 820 bp (13488037–13488856), and 826 bp (13488037–13488862) (Figs. 1C and S1). The starting points of these transcripts are identical, so they appear to be transcription variants. Taken together, a novel intergenic lncRNA encoded in the sense strand, which is the antisense of the PTH gene, was identified, and we named it “PTH-AS” according to Wright’s nomenclature (17Wright M.W. A short guide to long non-coding RNA gene nomenclature.Hum. Genomics. 2014; 8: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the intracellular distribution, which is a clue to lncRNA function. The amount of PTH-AS in nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA was quantified by real-time quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR). As shown in Figure 1D, 93.8% of PTH-AS was present in the nucleus, whereas only 6.2% was present in the cytoplasm, suggesting that PTH-AS is highly enriched in the nucleus. In addition, reverse transcription with oligo (dT)18 primers instead of random primers resulted in more efficient PCR amplification of the 4-1 fragment, indicating that PTH-AS was polyadenylated (Fig. 1E). PTH-AS expression was detected in one PA case with PTH overexpression in addition to ectopic PTH-producing MFH but not in PTH–nonexpressing cell lines, including some endocrine cancers (Fig. 1F). These data implied that PTH-AS was expressed only in tumors expressing PTH, so we suspected that PTH-AS might be involved in the regulation of PTH expression. Presently, there are no transfectable PTH-producing cell lines, so we attempted to elucidate the effect of exogenous PTH-AS on PTH expression using cells that do not express PTH. When an expression vector containing the PTH-AS coding region was transfected into PTH–nonexpressing human breast cancer T47D cells to transiently express PTH-AS, PTH expression was not induced (Fig. 1G). Similar results were obtained with other PTH–nonexpressing cells such as human breast cancer MCF7 and human lung cancer A549 (Fig. S2). Therefore, it was considered that PTH-AS expression alone does not induce ectopic PTH gene expression in nonparathyroid cells. In general, the majority of nuclear-localized lncRNAs contribute to chromatin remodeling and RNA processing and are involved in global gene regulation in a variety of ways (2Batista P.J. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNAs: cellular address codes in development and disease.Cell. 2013; 152: 1298-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 18Julia D.,R. Yuning W.

Cellular functions of long noncoding RNAs.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared T47D cells that stably express PTH-AS and comprehensively analyzed the effect of PTH-AS on gene expression. Because the sequence near the PTH-AS gene did not fit the design of the primer for vector construction, we adopted PA6 fragment (chromosome 11, 13487670–13488065, 2417 nt) that are longer than covering the transcriptional region determined by 5′- and 3′-RACE. The common site on the 5′ side of the three PTH-AS transcripts may be functionally important. Therefore, we decided to use a fragment lacking part of the 5′ end of the PTH-AS transcription region as a negative control for this experiment. Moreover, to prevent the fragment size from affecting subsequent experiments, we used PA5 fragment (chromosome 11, 13490086–13490592, 2528 nt) that is similar in size to the PA6 fragment (Fig. 2A). To eliminate artifacts from extracellular gene transfer, microarray analysis was performed on T47D cells expressing incomplete PTH-AS (T47D-PA5) in addition to full-length PTH-AS–expressing cells (T47D-PA6) or vector control (T47D-VC1) (Fig. 2B). According to our definition (see the Experimental procedures section), 1453 genes were differentially expressed in T47D-PA6 compared with T47D-VC1 (Fig. 2C). Excluding genes whose expression was altered in T47D-PA5 cells expressing incomplete PTH-AS, PTH-AS expression in T47D cells upregulated 914 genes and downregulated 600 genes (Fig. 2D). GO analysis using the public bioinformatics tool DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) classified many of the altered genes as immune-related bioprocesses, including “immune response” (p = 2.30E-09), “type I interferon signaling pathway” (p = 1.80E-27), and “signal transduction via interferon gamma pathway” (p = 7.00E-22) as well as “cell adhesion” (p = 7.30E-04) (Fig. 2E). Analysis by REVIGO (http://revigo.irb.hr/) revealed that these GO terms build clusters specifically associated with the immune response (Fig. S3). In addition, terms such as “integrin binding” (p = 1.00E-03) and “actin filament binding” (p = 1.80E-02) were listed as related molecular functions (Fig. 2F) as well as terms such as “pathways in cancer” (p = 4.10E-03), “cell adhesion molecules” (p = 1.20E-05), “extracellular matrix (ECM)–receptor interaction” (p = 2.20E-04), and “JAK–STAT signaling pathway” (p = 1.50E-03), which are listed as related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (Figs. 2G and S4–S7). Gene set enrichment analysis also strongly suggested a correlation between PTH-AS expression and JAK–STAT signaling (Fig. S8A). Supporting these data, the PScan database (http://159.149.160.88/pscan/) (20Zambelli F. Pesole G. Pavesi G. Pscan: finding over-represented transcription factor binding site motifs in sequences from co-regulated or co-expressed genes.Nucl. Acids Res. 2009; 37: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) listed STAT1 and IRF9 as potential transcription factors that bind to the promoters of genes whose expression levels were significantly affected by PTH-AS expression in T47D cells (Fig. S8B). In fact, our microarray analysis showed the expression of STAT1 and IRF9 as well as their target, ISGs was higher in T47D-PA6 cells than in T47D-VC1 and T47D-PA5 cells (Fig. S9). In particular, the expression levels of genes, such as IFI6, MX1, IFIT1, IFIT3, ISG15, OAS1, and OAS2, which belong to the cancer-promoting ISG subset IRDS, were markedly increased (Fig. S9B). To further clarify the correlation between expression levels of PTH-AS and IRDS, we designed PTH-AS–specific shRNAs and transfected them into T47D-PA6 cells to suppress exogenous PTH-AS expression (Figs. 3A and S10). Subsequent qRT–PCR analysis revealed that STAT1 and IRDS gene expression levels in T47D cells increased with PTH-AS overexpression but decreased with PTH-AS knockdown (Fig. 3, B and C). PTH-AS overexpression and knockdown experiments in MCF7 and A549 cells also confirmed a positive correlation between PTH-AS and IRDS expression levels (Figs. S11 and S12). These data suggest that PTH-AS is involved in the regulation of STAT1 and its downstream IRDS expression and that it is not limited to specific cells. Unlike common ISGs, IRDS expression is induced via the U-ISGF3 complex containing unphosphorylated STAT1, rather than the ISGF3 complex containing phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) (15Weichselbaum R.R. Ishwaran H. Yoon T. Nuyten D.S.A. Baker S.W. Khodarev N. et al.An interferon-related gene signature for DNA damage resistance is a predictive marker for chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 18490-18495Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis showed that total STAT1 (tSTAT1) protein increased with PTH-AS expression in T47D cells (Fig. 3, D and E). pSTAT1 showed a similar tendency to tSTAT1, but the pSTAT1/tSTAT1 ratio was not affected by PTH-AS expression, suggesting that STAT1 phosphorylation was not enhanced. STAT2 was unaffected by PTH-AS expression at either total or phosphorylated protein levels (Fig. 3E). Therefore, PTH-AS expression may be involved in inducing IRDS expression through increased levels of STAT1 protein rather than phosphorylation of STAT1. IRDS can promote tumor malignancy by causing cancer cells to increase EMT, metastatic potential, and resistance to DNA-damaging agents (14Khodarev N.N. Roizman B. Weichselbaum R.R.

Borden E.C. Stark G.R. Interferons and their stimulated genes in the tumor microenvironment.Semin. Oncol. 2014; 41: 156-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether the expression of PTH-AS, which upregulates IRDS, affects the malignant properties of cancer cells. There was no effect of PTH-AS expression on the proliferation of T47D cells (Fig. 4A). When treated with the DNA-damaging agent DXR, PTH-AS expression in T47D cells did not affect cell viability at low DXR concentrations (<1 μM) but did lead to a significant drug resistance at high DXR concentrations (≥1 μM) (Fig. 4, B and C). Of the EMT markers whose expression levels were examined, only the mesenchymal marker vimentin showed a positive correlation with PTH-AS expression (Figs. 4, D–F and S13). The morphology of T47D cells showed no apparent EMT-like changes with PTH-AS expression but tended to be slightly elongated (Fig. 4, G and H). Next, the effect of PTH-AS expression on the motility and invasion of T47D cells was investigated. The results showed that the two-dimensional motility by the wound healing assay was not affected by PTH-AS expression (Fig. S14), but transwell migration (Fig 4, I and J) and Matrigel invasion were significantly promoted (Fig. 4, K and L). However, matrix metalloproteinase expression, which is strongly associated with infiltration, was very low in all cells and did not correlate with PTH-AS expression (Fig. S15). The aforementioned GO analysis showed altered expression of genes related to “cell adhesion,” “integrin binding,” and “cell adhesion molecule” with PTH-AS expression in T47D cells (Fig. 2, E–G). These data suggest that PTH-AS expression affects T47D cell adhesion, but in vitro assays showed no effect of PTH-AS expression on ECM adhesion (Fig. S16). Taken together, PTH-AS expression did not affect proliferation, two-dimensional motility, or ECM adhesion but enhanced DNA damage agent resistance, as well as migration and invasion. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT1 in T47D-PA6 cells (Fig. 5, A and B) resulted in reduced expression of IRF9 (Fig. 5C), IRDS genes (Fig. 5D), and vimentin (Fig. 5E). Along with these gene expression changes, the enhancement of DXR resistance (Fig. 5F), transwell migration (Fig. 5G), and Matrigel invasion (Fig. 5H) exhibited by T47D-PA6 cells were canceled. Similar results were obtained in experiments using MCF7 cells and A549 cells as well as T47D cells (Figs. S17–S20). Those imply that PTH-AS expression in T47D cells, MCF7 cells, and A549 cells affects the expression of various genes and cancer properties via upregulation of STAT1. Next, we examined the effects of PTH-AS on tumorigenesis and malignant progression of T47D cells in vivo. When cells with different PTH-AS expression levels were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice and tumor growth was compared, there was no difference in tumor growth rate and tumor weight among them (Fig. 6, A and B). However, immunofluorescent staining of the vascular endothelial cell marker CD31 showed significantly higher vascular density in tumors derived from PTH-AS–expressing cells, suggesting that PTH-AS expression promoted tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 6, C and D). Lung metastases were also evaluated because increased tumor angiogenesis may lead to enhanced hematogenous metastases. Although no gross metastatic nodules were observed on the lung surface of any tumor-bearing mice, more micrometastatic nodules were detected in HE-stained sections of the lungs from mice bearing PTH-AS–expressing tumors (Fig. 6, E–G). Consistent with these data, the ratio of transplanted cell–derived human GAPDH to host-derived mouse Gapdh in lung tissue was significantly higher in mice with PTH-AS–expressing tumors (Fig. 6H). In our human breast cancer T47D xenograft model, tumorigenesis was observed in all cases regardless of the PTH-AS expression levels in the transplanted cells, but lung metastases were detected more frequently in mice with PTH-AS–expressing tumors (Fig. 6I). Overall, our results demonstrate that PTH-AS expression in T47D cells did not affect tumor formation and growth but did promote tumor angiogenesis and lung metastasis. Similar results were also shown by transplantation experiments using MCF7 cells and A549 cells with various PTH-AS expression levels (Figs. S21 and S22). Next, we examined the effect of PTH-AS expression in cancer cells on the tumor microenvironment. PTH-AS expression from transplanted tumor cells was reflected in xenografts (Fig. 7A). Tumors with high PTH-AS expression maintained high levels of human STAT1 mRNA and protein from transplanted cells (Fig. 7, B–D). Concomitantly, PTH-AS–expressing tumors also showed high expression of a series of IRDS genes (Fig. 7E). Recent reports have demonstrated that high STAT1 mRNA levels in breast cancer tissues are associated with macrophage infiltration and poor prognosis (23Tymoszuk P. Charoentong P. Hackl H. Spilka R. Müller-Holzner E. Trajanoski Z. et al.High STAT1 mRNA levels but not its tyrosine phosphorylation are associated with macrophage infiltration and bad prognosis in breast cancer.BMC Cancer. 2014; 14: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody against the macrophage marker F4/80 revealed that more macrophages were accumulated in PTH-AS–expressing tumors with high STAT1 expression (Fig. 8, A and B). Macrophages in tumor tissue, so-called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as well as tumor cells are the major sources of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and induce tumor angiogenesis. There was no correlation between VEGF expression and PTH-AS expression levels in cultured cells (Fig. S23A). In tumors, the expression level of human VEGF derived from transplanted cells was very low and was not affected by PTH-AS expression. In contrast, recipient-derived mouse VEGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in tumors with high PTH-AS expression (Fig. S23, B and C). These results suggest that VEGF produced primarily by recipient-derived tumor stromal cells, presumably TAM, rather than transplanted tumor cells, is involved in enhancing angiogenesis in high PTH-expressing tumors.Figure 8Effect of PTH-AS expression in T47D tumors on macrophage migration and inflammatory environment in xenografts.

PCA was performed for the original 15 indices of fruit diameter, fruit length, fruit shape, single-fruit weight, pericarp thickness, oil yield, fresh seed rate, dry seed rate, dry kernel rate and palmitic acid, stearic acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid contents. According to the requirements of a cumulative contribution rate ≥ 80% and an eigenvector value &gt; 1, six principle components were selected. These indices underwent weighted summation to establish a function model for comprehensive evaluation. Finally, the comprehensive rankings of the cultivars according to PCA were compared with those according to gray correlation analysis. The genetic variation coefficients of the 15 parameters ranged from 2.24% (oleic acid content) to 22.70% (single-fruit weight, with a range of 21.34 g). The top ten excellent cultivars with the highest comprehensive scores according to PCA and those according to gray correlation analysis were compared. According to PCA, oleic acid content, fruit diameter, fruit length, pericarp thickness, arachidonic acid content and dry seed rate can serve as representative evaluation indicators of C . weiningensis . The outcomes obtained based on PCA were basically consistent with those obtained based on gray correlation analysis. Finally, nine excellent cultivars were finally determined, i.e., WY-1, WY-6, WY-8, WY-25, WY-27, WY-30, WY-33, WY-35, WY-38 and WY-44. The results obtained in terms of crown yield were basically consistent with the outcomes of the comprehensive assessments, which indicates the reliability of the assessment methods used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W4281551751,"Incontinence is a major problem for people with dementia (PWD) and their family/friend caregivers, often causing substantial harm, including residential care admission. The incontinence needs of PWD are complex and different from those of people without dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate carer and nurse perceptions of continence service provision and potential improvements.A secondary analysis of qualitative data was undertaken. Semi-structured interviews (n = 45) were undertaken with PWD, family caregivers and healthcare professionals (continence or dementia nurses) in the UK. PWD and caregivers were recruited via www.joindementiaresearch.nihr.ac.uk and via dementia/carer groups. Nurses were recruited via their employers. Framework analysis was used. The COREQ Research guideline statement assists reporting.Four themes were found. Firstly, there was a lack of awareness of the service and waiting time. Many caregivers were unaware of continence services and dementia nurses often viewed it as a pad provision service. Caregivers reported long waits not meeting their urgent needs. Secondly, product provision was often inadequate. Most caregivers self-purchased all or many products and substantial variation in product provision was found. The number of products provided was often inadequate. Thirdly, a sense that ""nothing can be done"" was observed by some nurses and caregivers. Caregivers believed that, if nothing else, care information should be provided. Finally, suggestions for improvements were made, including proactive service signposting, joint clinics with dementia services, improved information before crisis point, dementia training for continence nurses and improved product provision.Continence service inadequacies for PWD and caregivers have been reported for many years. This study demonstrates service provision remains unsatisfactory in the UK. Stakeholders propose a range of service improvements. It highlights that listening to the voices of PWD, caregivers and nurses is crucial for services seeking to improve continence services for PWD living at home."
https://openalex.org/W4281554295,"In the German health care system, parents with an acutely ill child can visit an emergency room (ER) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. At the ER, the patient receives a medical consultation. Many parents use these facilities as they do not know how urgently their child requires medical attention. In recent years, paediatric departments in smaller hospitals have been closed, particularly in rural regions. As a result of this, the distances that patients must travel to paediatric care facilities in these regions are increasing, causing more children to visit an ER for adults. However, paediatric expertise is often required in order to assess how quickly the patient requires treatment and select an adequate treatment. This decision is made by a doctor in German ERs. We have examined whether remote paediatricians can perform a standardised urgency assessment (triage) using a video conferencing system.Only acutely ill patients who were brought to a paediatric emergency room (paedER) by their parents or carers, without prior medical consultation, have been included in this study. First, an on-site paediatrician assessed the urgency of each case using a standardised triage. In order to do this, the Paediatric Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (PaedCTAS) was translated into German and adapted for use in a standardised IT-based data collection tool. After the initial on-site triage, a telemedicine paediatrician, based in a different hospital, repeated the triage using a video conferencing system. Both paediatricians used the same triage procedure. The primary outcome was the degree of concordance and interobserver agreement, measured using Cohen's kappa, between the two paediatricians. We have also included patient and assessor demographics.A total of 266 patients were included in the study. Of these, 227 cases were eligible for the concordance analysis. In n = 154 cases (68%), there was concordance between the on-site paediatrician's and telemedicine paediatrician's urgency assessments. In n = 50 cases (22%), the telemedicine paediatrician rated the urgency of the patient's condition higher (overtriage); in 23 cases (10%), the assessment indicated a lower urgency (undertriage). Nineteen medical doctors were included in the study, mostly trained paediatric specialists. Some of them acted as an on-site doctor and telemedicine doctor. Cohen's weighted kappa was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49-0.79), indicating a substantial agreement between the specialists.Telemedical triage can assist in providing acute paediatric care in regions with a low density of paediatric care facilities. The next steps are further developing the triage tool and implementing telemedicine urgency assessment in a larger network of hospitals in order to improve the integration of telemedicine into hospitals' organisational processes. The processes should include intensive training for the doctors involved in telemedical triage.DRKS00013207."
https://openalex.org/W4281687821,"Tomography data of the cornea usually contain useful information for ophthalmologists. Zernike polynomials are often used to characterize and interpret these data. One of the major challenges facing researchers is finding the appropriate number of Zernike polynomials to model measured data from corneas. It is undeniable that a higher number of coefficients reduces the fit error. However, utilizing too many coefficients consumes computational power and time and bears the risk of overfitting as a result of including unnecessary components. The main objective of the current study is to analyse the accuracy of corneal surface data modelled with Zernike polynomials of various degrees in order to estimate a reasonable number of coefficients. The process of fitting the Zernike polynomials to height data for corneal anterior and posterior surfaces is presented and results are shown for normal and pathological corneas. These results indicate that polynomials of a higher degree are required for fitting corneas of patients with corneal ectasia than for normal corneas."

https://openalex.org/W4281554601,"Synthetic biology has successfully advanced our ability to design and implement complex, time-varying genetic circuits to control the expression of recombinant proteins. However, these circuits typically require the production of regulatory genes whose only purpose is to coordinate expression of other genes. When designing very small genetic constructs, such as viral genomes, we may want to avoid introducing such auxiliary gene products while nevertheless encoding complex expression dynamics. To this end, here we demonstrate that varying only the placement and strengths of promoters, terminators, and RNase cleavage sites in a computational model of a bacteriophage genome is sufficient to achieve solutions to a variety of basic gene expression patterns. We discover these genetic solutions by computationally evolving genomes to reproduce desired gene expression time-course data. Our approach shows that non-trivial patterns can be evolved, including patterns where the relative ordering of genes by abundance changes over time. We find that some patterns are easier to evolve than others, and comparable expression patterns can be achieved via different genetic architectures. Our work opens up a novel avenue to genome engineering via fine-tuning the balance of gene expression and gene degradation rates."
https://openalex.org/W4281557059,"Previously, we had demonstrated that Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157) strain 86-24 expresses proteins involved in survival rather than virulence in vitro in rumen fluid from dairy cattle limit fed a maintenance diet. Here, we verified if this observation would be true for different O157 strains grown in vitro in rumen fluid from, and in vivo in the rumen of, animals on contrasting maintenance (high fiber) and lactation (high energy-protein) diets usually limit fed to dairy cattle. For the in vivo studies, an economical, novel, reusable and non-terminal rumen-fistulated animal model permitting simultaneous evaluation of multiple bacterial strains in the bovine rumen was developed. All experiments were conducted in duplicate using different animals to account for host-related variations. The O157 strains included, 86-24, EDL933 and the super shed SS-17. E. coli NalR (#5735), derived from a bovine intestinal commensal E. coli, was included as a control. As expected, diet influenced ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid (VFA) composition. The pH ranged from 6.2-7.0 and total VFA concentrations from 109-141 μM/ml, in animals fed the maintenance diet. In comparison, animals fed the lactation diet had a ruminal pH ranging between 5.18-6.0, and total VFA of 125-219 μM/ml. Strain dependent differences in O157 recovery from the rumen fluid of cattle fed either diet was observed, both in vitro and in vivo, with O157 strains 86-24 and EDL933 demonstrating similar survival patterns. Analysis of the O157 proteomes expressed in the rumen fluid/rumen verified previous observations of adaptive responses. Any difference in the adaptive response was mainly influenced by the animal's diet and growth conditions (in vitro and in vivo) and not the O157 strain. These new insights into the O157 responses could help formulate modalities to control O157 across strains in cattle at all stages of husbandry."

https://openalex.org/W4281568248,"A caesarean section is a major obstetric procedure that can save the life of mother and child. Its purpose is to protect the mother's health from the complications of childbirth and to protect the baby's health. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there are major inequalities in access to caesarean sections and significant variations in practices to determine the indications for the procedure. Periodic analyses of maternal deaths have shown that more than half of maternal and new born deaths are due to suboptimal care and are therefore potentially preventable. The objective of our study is to assess the impact of health staff training under the PADISS project (to support the health system's integrated development) on the quality of CS procedures in North Kivu, by comparing two periods.The populations compared were recruited from the referral hospitals in North Kivu, DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo). The first (group 1) was made up of patient files studied retrospectively for the period from 01/11/2013 to 01/01/2016. The second group (group 2), studied prospectively, comprised patient files from June 2019 to January 2020. Obstetric, maternal and foetal data were compared. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/IC 15.0 for Windows. Univariate and multiple logistic regression was performed to determine which characteristics are associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.CS frequency was approximately 17% in both study periods. We observed a CS frequency of about 34% at North Kivu provincial hospital for the two populations studied. The main indications for CS were dystocia, foetal distress and scarred uterus for both populations. In the population studied prospectively, after the implementation of health staff training, there were fewer incidence rate of dystocia, foetal distress and neonatal death, a more complete patient record, shorter hospital stay, and fewer blood transfusions but more incidence rate of scarred uterus, post-operative complications and low birth weight. Intervention had no statistically significant impact on low birth weight (OR = 1.9, p = 0.13), on neonatal mortality (OR = 0.69, p = 0.21).Our study shows a decrease in neonatal deaths, dystocia and foetal distress, but an increase in post-operative complications, maternal deaths and cases of scarred uterus and low birth weight. However, multiple logistic regression did no support the conclusion."

https://openalex.org/W4281638164,"Guar meal (GM) can be considered as an alternative protein source for the livestock and has a potential value as a feed to animals with a high protein content ranging between 45-55%. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of partial replacement of groundnut cake (GNC) with guar meal (GM) on reproductive efficiency, hormone profile, antioxidant status in Deccani ewes fed sorghum stover based complete feed blocks (SSCFB). Twenty-one non-pregnant Deccani ewes (b. wt. 23.34 ±0.40 kg; 2-4 years old and body condition score 2.51±0.56) were randomly divided into three groups to contain 7 animals each in a completely randomized design. Three dietary treatments viz. S1: conventional feeding (sorghum stover and concentrate mixture fed separately in 50:50 ratios to meet the requirement), S2: SSCFB with GNC as protein supplement in concentrate mixture and S3: SSCFB with GM replacing GNC nitrogen of S2 at 50% level. The ewes were synchronised for estrus with progesterone impregnated intravaginal sponges and naturally mated. The ewes were fed at the rate of 3.1 and 3.7% of their body weight from 1st day of experiment-to 108th day of gestation and from 108th day of gestation to till lambing, respectively. The replacement of 50% of GNC nitrogen with GM and densification of diet had no effect (P>0.05) on average DMI (g), antioxidant status, progesterone concentration, conception rate, non return rate, no of matings per service, lambing rate, body weights of lambs at birth, 15 and 30 days of age. GNC can be partially replaced by GM in the ewes diet without any adverse effect on reproductive parameters, antioxidant status, progesterone concentration and weight of lambs."
