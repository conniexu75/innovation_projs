https://openalex.org/W2175118067,"Fermions--elementary particles such as electrons--are classified as Dirac, Majorana or Weyl. Majorana and Weyl fermions had not been observed experimentally until the recent discovery of condensed matter systems such as topological superconductors and semimetals, in which they arise as low-energy excitations. Here we propose the existence of a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion that emerges at the boundary between electron and hole pockets in a new phase of matter. This particle was missed by Weyl because it breaks the stringent Lorentz symmetry in high-energy physics. Lorentz invariance, however, is not present in condensed matter physics, and by generalizing the Dirac equation, we find the new type of Weyl fermion. In particular, whereas Weyl semimetals--materials hosting Weyl fermions--were previously thought to have standard Weyl points with a point-like Fermi surface (which we refer to as type-I), we discover a type-II Weyl point, which is still a protected crossing, but appears at the contact of electron and hole pockets in type-II Weyl semimetals. We predict that WTe2 is an example of a topological semimetal hosting the new particle as a low-energy excitation around such a type-II Weyl point. The existence of type-II Weyl points in WTe2 means that many of its physical properties are very different to those of standard Weyl semimetals with point-like Fermi surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2178784291,"Th17 cells play a critical role in host defense against extracellular pathogens and tissue homeostasis but can induce autoimmunity. The mechanisms implicated in balancing “pathogenic” and “non-pathogenic” Th17 cell states remain largely unknown. We used single-cell RNA-seq to identify CD5L/AIM as a regulator expressed in non-pathogenic, but not in pathogenic Th17 cells. Although CD5L does not affect Th17 differentiation, it is a functional switch that regulates the pathogenicity of Th17 cells. Loss of CD5L converts non-pathogenic Th17 cells into pathogenic cells that induce autoimmunity. CD5L mediates this effect by modulating the intracellular lipidome, altering fatty acid composition and restricting cholesterol biosynthesis and, thus, ligand availability for Rorγt, the master transcription factor of Th17 cells. Our study identifies CD5L as a critical regulator of the Th17 cell functional state and highlights the importance of lipid metabolism in balancing immune protection and disease induced by T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2179299570,"Recurrent mutations in cohesin complex proteins have been identified in pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells and during the early development of acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid malignancies. Although cohesins are involved in chromosome separation and DNA damage repair, cohesin complex functions during hematopoiesis and leukemic development are unclear. Here, we show that mutant cohesin proteins block differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro and in vivo and enforce stem cell programs. These effects are restricted to immature HSPC populations, where cohesin mutants show increased chromatin accessibility and likelihood of transcription factor binding site occupancy by HSPC regulators including ERG, GATA2, and RUNX1, as measured by ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq. Epistasis experiments show that silencing these transcription factors rescues the differentiation block caused by cohesin mutants. Together, these results show that mutant cohesins impair HSPC differentiation by controlling chromatin accessibility and transcription factor activity, possibly contributing to leukemic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2174420796,"Interphase chromatin is organized in distinct nuclear sub-compartments, reflecting its degree of compaction and transcriptional status. In Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, H3K9 methylation is necessary to silence and to anchor repeat-rich heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In a screen for perinuclear anchors of heterochromatin, we identified a previously uncharacterized C. elegans chromodomain protein, CEC-4. CEC-4 binds preferentially mono-, di-, or tri-methylated H3K9 and localizes at the nuclear envelope independently of H3K9 methylation and nuclear lamin. CEC-4 is necessary for endogenous heterochromatin anchoring, but not for transcriptional repression, in contrast to other known H3K9 methyl-binders in worms, which mediate gene repression but not perinuclear anchoring. When we ectopically induce a muscle differentiation program in embryos, cec-4 mutants fail to commit fully to muscle cell fate. This suggests that perinuclear sequestration of chromatin during development helps restrict cell differentiation programs by stabilizing commitment to a specific cell fate. PAPERCLIP."

https://openalex.org/W1811026913,"Multipotent and pluripotent stem cells are potential sources for cell and tissue replacement therapies. For example, stem cell-derived red blood cells (RBCs) are a potential alternative to donated blood, but yield and quality remain a challenge. Here, we show that application of insight from human population genetic studies can enhance RBC production from stem cells. The SH2B3 gene encodes a negative regulator of cytokine signaling and naturally occurring loss-of-function variants in this gene increase RBC counts in vivo. Targeted suppression of SH2B3 in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells enhanced the maturation and overall yield of in-vitro-derived RBCs. Moreover, inactivation of SH2B3 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells allowed enhanced erythroid cell expansion with preserved differentiation. Our findings therefore highlight the potential for combining human genome variation studies with genome editing approaches to improve cell and tissue production for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1822171334,"Adult stem cells may acquire mutations that modify cellular behavior, leading to functional declines in homeostasis or providing a competitive advantage resulting in premalignancy. However, the frequency, phenotypic impact, and mechanisms underlying spontaneous mutagenesis during aging are unclear. Here, we report two mechanisms of genome instability in adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that cause phenotypic alterations in the aging intestine. First, we found frequent loss of heterozygosity arising from mitotic homologous recombination in ISCs that results in genetic mosaicism. Second, somatic deletion of DNA sequences and large structural rearrangements, resembling those described in cancers and congenital diseases, frequently result in gene inactivation. Such modifications induced somatic inactivation of the X-linked tumor suppressor Notch in ISCs, leading to spontaneous neoplasias in wild-type males. Together, our findings reveal frequent genomic modification in adult stem cells and show that somatic genetic mosaicism has important functional consequences on aging tissues."

However, the prognostic value of urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 in neonatal and pediatric AKI for adverse outcome has not been investigated yet.The product of the urinary concentration of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 ([TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7]) was assessed by a commercially available immunoassay (NephroCheck™) in a prospective cohort study in 133 subjects aged 0-18 years including 46 patients with established AKI according to pRIFLE criteria, 27 patients without AKI (non-AKI group I) and 60 apparently healthy neonates and children (non-AKI group II). AKI etiologies were: dehydration/hypovolemia (n = 7), hemodynamic instability (n = 7), perinatal asphyxia (n = 9), septic shock (n = 7), typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS; n = 5), interstitial nephritis (n = 5), vasculitis (n = 4), nephrotoxic injury (n = 1) and renal vein thrombosis (n = 1).When AKI patients were classified into pRIFLE criteria, 6/46 (13%) patients fulfilled the criteria for the category ""Risk"", 13/46 (28%) for ""Injury"", 26/46 (57%) for ""Failure"" and 1/46 (2%) for ""Loss"". Patients in the ""Failure"" stage had a median 3.7-fold higher urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] compared to non-AKI subjects (P<0.001). When analyzed for AKI etiology, highest [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] values were found in patients with septic shock (P<0.001 vs. non-AKI I+II). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses in the AKI group revealed good performance of [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] in predicting 30-day (area under the curve (AUC) 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61-0.97) and 3-month mortality (AUC 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99) and moderate performance in predicting RRT (AUC 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.84).This study shows that urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] has a good diagnostic performance in predicting adverse outcomes in neonatal and pediatric AKI of heterogeneous etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2175231274,"Direct associations between hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis remain unclear. We investigated the association between the amelioration of glycemia by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and macrophage-driven atherosclerosis in diabetic mice. We administered dapagliflozin or ipragliflozin (1.0 mg/kg/day) for 4-weeks to apolipoprotein E-null (Apoe−/−) mice, streptozotocin-induced diabetic Apoe−/− mice, and diabetic db/db mice. We then determined aortic atherosclerosis, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-induced foam cell formation, and related gene expression in exudate peritoneal macrophages. Dapagliflozin substantially decreased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and glucose tolerance without affecting body weight, blood pressure, plasma insulin, and lipids in diabetic Apoe−/− mice. Aortic atherosclerotic lesions, atheromatous plaque size, and macrophage infiltration in the aortic root increased in diabetic Apoe−/− mice; dapagliflozin attenuated these changes by 33%, 27%, and 20%, respectively. Atherosclerotic lesions or foam cell formation highly correlated with HbA1c. Dapagliflozin did not affect atherosclerosis or plasma parameters in non-diabetic Apoe−/− mice. In db/db mice, foam cell formation increased by 4-fold compared with C57/BL6 mice, whereas ipragliflozin decreased it by 31%. Foam cell formation exhibited a strong correlation with HbA1c. Gene expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 and acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 was upregulated, whereas that of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 was downregulated in the peritoneal macrophages of both types of diabetic mice. SGLT2i normalized these gene expressions. Our study is the first to demonstrate that SGLT2i exerts anti-atherogenic effects by pure glucose lowering independent of insulin action in diabetic mice through suppressing macrophage foam cell formation, suggesting that foam cell formation is highly sensitive to glycemia ex vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2175108913,"What is the relationship between film viewers' eye movements and their film comprehension? Typical Hollywood movies induce strong attentional synchrony-most viewers look at the same things at the same time. Thus, we asked whether film viewers' eye movements would differ based on their understanding-the mental model hypothesis-or whether any such differences would be overwhelmed by viewers' attentional synchrony-the tyranny of film hypothesis. To investigate this question, we manipulated the presence/absence of prior film context and measured resulting differences in film comprehension and eye movements. Viewers watched a 12-second James Bond movie clip, ending just as a critical predictive inference should be drawn that Bond's nemesis, ""Jaws,"" would fall from the sky onto a circus tent. The No-context condition saw only the 12-second clip, but the Context condition also saw the preceding 2.5 minutes of the movie before seeing the critical 12-second portion. Importantly, the Context condition viewers were more likely to draw the critical inference and were more likely to perceive coherence across the entire 6 shot sequence (as shown by event segmentation), indicating greater comprehension. Viewers' eye movements showed strong attentional synchrony in both conditions as compared to a chance level baseline, but smaller differences between conditions. Specifically, the Context condition viewers showed slightly, but significantly, greater attentional synchrony and lower cognitive load (as shown by fixation probability) during the critical first circus tent shot. Thus, overall, the results were more consistent with the tyranny of film hypothesis than the mental model hypothesis. These results suggest the need for a theory that encompasses processes from the perception to the comprehension of film."

GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, acting in counterpoint to glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter. The delicate balance between GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation is essential for normal sensory processing, motor pattern generation, and cognitive function. Abnormalities in GABA-mediated inhibition have devastating consequences, contributing to pathological pain (Zeilhofer et al., 2012Zeilhofer H.U. Wildner H. Yévenes G.E.

GABA exerts its effects largely through ligand-gated Cl− channels known as GABAA receptors (Farrant and Nusser, 2005Farrant M. Nusser Z. Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABAA receptors.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). GABAA receptors are heteropentamers containing two α, two β, and one tertiary subunit. The α subunit contributes to GABA binding and determines gating kinetics and subcellular localization of the receptor (Olsen and Sieghart, 2009Olsen R.W. Sieghart W.

Möhler H. GABAA receptor subtypes: therapeutic potential in Down syndrome, affective disorders, schizophrenia, and autism.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2014; 54: 483-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). There are six α subunit isoforms expressed differentially during development (Laurie et al., 1992Laurie D.J. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. The distribution of thirteen GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. III. Embryonic and postnatal development.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4151-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and across brain regions (Wisden et al., 1992Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. The distribution of 13 GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. I. Telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the distinct functions of individual isoforms remain elusive. Pharmacological agents, including agonists, competitive antagonists, and allosteric modulators, have been the main instruments for elucidating the function of GABAA receptors. However, these tools are limited by the low spatial and temporal precision of drug application. Moreover, accurate manipulation of GABAA isoforms has been hindered by the lack of subtype-specific agonists or antagonists for the GABA-binding site. There are subtype-selective allosteric modulators for the benzodiazepine-binding site, but they have limited specificity and/or low efficacy (Rudolph and Möhler, 2014Rudolph U. Möhler H. GABAA receptor subtypes: therapeutic potential in Down syndrome, affective disorders, schizophrenia, and autism.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2014; 54: 483-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Gene knockout technology provides an alternative strategy for deducing the function of GABAA isoforms, but removal of one α subunit can lead to compensatory changes in the expression of other receptors and ion channels (Kralic et al., 2002Kralic J.E. Korpi E.R. O’Buckley T.K. Homanics G.E. Morrow A.L. Molecular and pharmacological characterization of GABAA receptor α1 subunit knockout mice.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Adaptive regulation of neuronal excitability by a voltage-independent potassium conductance.Nature. 2001; 409: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we have developed an optogenetic pharmacology strategy that enables isoform-specific photo-control of the entire GABAA receptor family and, by extension, all GABAA-mediated inhibition in the brain. We show that photo-control can be implemented at all levels, from investigating subcellular receptor distribution to regulating visual cortical activity in vivo. Finally, we introduce a transgenic mouse that allows, for the first time, photo-control of an endogenous neurotransmitter receptor. Instead of controlling an exogenous optogenetic tool that overpowers the native electrophysiology of neurons (e.g., NpHR or Arch; Zhang et al., 2011Zhang F. Vierock J. Yizhar O. Fenno L.E. Tsunoda S. Kianianmomeni A. Prigge M. Berndt A. Cushman J. Polle J. et al.The microbial opsin family of optogenetic tools.Cell. 2011; 147: 1446-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), our approach allows direct manipulation of the brain’s own GABAA receptors, a powerful strategy for understanding the roles they play in health and disease. The GABAA receptor has two GABA-binding sites, each at the interface of α and β subunits (Figure 1A). Light-regulated GABAA receptor (LiGABAR) is generated by conjugating a photoswitchable tethered ligand (PTL) onto a cysteine genetically engineered into the α subunit near the GABA-binding site. The PTL molecule has three chemical modules (Figure 1B): a cysteine-reactive maleimide group (for receptor conjugation), an azobenzene core (for photoswitching), and a GABA-site ligand (for competitive antagonism). The azobenzene adopts an extended trans configuration in darkness and a twisted cis configuration in 360- to 400-nm light. The cis isomer slowly reverts to the trans form in darkness, but this process can be accelerated with 460- to 560-nm light. Hence, photo-control is bidirectional. Depending on where the PTL is attached, either the cis or the trans isomer antagonizes the receptor, and photoswitching to the alternative configuration alleviates antagonism (Figure 1A). We previously developed PTLs with muscimol as the parent ligand (linked to azobenzene via N-acylation; Lin et al., 2014Lin W.-C. Davenport C.M. Mourot A. Vytla D. Smith C.M. Medeiros K.A. Chambers J.J. Kramer R.H. Engineering a light-regulated GABAA receptor for optical control of neural inhibition.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although these compounds do impart light sensitivity on GABAA receptors, their low efficacy limited the magnitude of photoswitching in vitro and their poor solubility (<50 μM) excluded their use in vivo. To improve efficacy, we made new PTLs with either GABA or its guanidinium analogs as the ligand (Figure 1B; Figure S1). We expected that these PTLs would be antagonists, like other ester or amide derivatives of GABA (Matsuzaki et al., 2010Matsuzaki M. Hayama T. Kasai H. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Two-photon uncaging of γ-aminobutyric acid in intact brain tissue.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The diffuse positive charge of the guanidinium group may enhance ionic, hydrogen-bond, and/or cation-π interactions with the receptor (Bergmann et al., 2013Bergmann R. Kongsbak K. Sørensen P.L. Sander T. Balle T. A unified model of the GABAA receptor comprising agonist and benzodiazepine binding sites.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e52323Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Miller and Aricescu, 2014Miller P.S. Aricescu A.R. Crystal structure of a human GABAA receptor.Nature. 2014; 512: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), and protonation of amino/guanidine groups at neutral pH should enhance water solubility of the PTLs. The new PTLs were conjugated onto a series of cysteine mutants of α1 (Figure S1), coexpressed with wild-type β2 and γ2 in HEK293 cells. The optimal combination of PTL and cysteine mutant was PAG-1C (Figure 1B) and α1T125C (Figures 1C–1F; Figure S1). As expected, the GABA-elicited current was strongly reduced in 500-nm light (trans-PTL) and completely restored in 380-nm light (cis-PTL; Figure 1C). Cis-to-trans photoisomerization reduced the response to half-saturating GABA by 78% ± 2% (10 μM, n = 6; Figure 1E) and to saturating GABA by 57% ± 2% (300 μM, n = 6). Dose-response curves showed that the EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) increased from 15.3 ± 6.0 μM (n = 6) to 583 ± 139 μM (n = 4) when the PTL was switched from cis to trans (Figure 1D), consistent with the induction of competitive antagonism. Receptor activation was indistinguishable from wild-type with the PTL in the cis configuration (wild-type EC50 = 9.5 ± 2.3 μM, n = 7, p > 0.1, two-tailed t test). Taken together, the discovery of PAG-1C for α1-LiGABAR validates the PTL design and establishes effective photo-control of this receptor isoform. We next applied the PTL strategy to all other α isoforms (α2–α6) to obtain the complete LiGABAR toolkit. We paired cysteine mutants of α subunits (focusing on loop E, where α1T125C is located) with a library of PTLs, and the resulting LiGABARs were evaluated in HEK293 cells. These PTLs varied in their ligands (GABA, guanidinylated GABA, and guanidine acetic acid; Figure S1) and spacer lengths between the ligand and the azobenzene. For each isoform, we selected the best PTL/mutant pair (Figures 1E and 1F; Figure S2) based on two criteria: (1) GABA-elicited currents are robustly photo-controlled (preferably ≥50% photo-antagonism at EC50), and (2) receptor function is unaffected by cysteine mutation and PTL conjugation. Notably, we found a homologous mutation site that enables the reversed polarity of photo-control (i.e., antagonizing the receptor by cis-PTL). When a longer PTL (e.g., PAG-2A, PAG-2B, or PAG-3C in Figure 1B) is conjugated onto this site, GABA-elicited current is reduced in 380-nm light by 45%–70% and is fully restored in 500-nm light (Figures 1E and 1F, α2–α6; 48% ± 5% reduction by PAG-3C on α1T121C, n = 3). Interestingly, some of the mutants enable either a cis or trans mode of photo-antagonism when conjugated with a longer or a shorter PTL, respectively (e.g., α2 and α5 LiGABARs in Figure 1E). This dual option adds flexibility in whether or not the receptor will be turned off in the ground state (i.e., in darkness), an important consideration for applications in neural circuits. Even though all of the receptors have a cysteine point mutation, this change appears to have minimal effects on receptor function, unless the PTL is conjugated and switched to the antagonizing configuration. None of the cysteine mutations, by themselves, alter receptor activation (Figure S2). Moreover, neither cysteine substitution nor PTL conjugation affects the characteristic properties of the parent receptor, such as allosteric modulation at the benzodiazepine site or anion permeability of the channel (Figure S2). Hence, LiGABARs function as their normal receptor counterparts until the moment they are photo-antagonized by a conjugated PTL. Wild-type GABAA receptors, which lack a properly positioned cysteine near the GABA-binding pocket, remain insensitive to light after PTL treatment (Figures S1 and S3). Moreover, PTL treatment does not confer light sensitivity onto GABAB receptors, glutamate receptors, or voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels (Figure S3), indicating there are few, if any, acute off-target effects on proteins that govern the electrophysiology of a neuron. Isoforms of GABAA receptors can be immunolocalized in distinct compartments of a dissociated neuron (Brünig et al., 2002Brünig I. Scotti E. Sidler C. Fritschy J.M. Intact sorting, targeting, and clustering of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor subtypes in hippocampal neurons in vitro.J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 443: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but subcellular localization can be problematic in intact neural tissue with intertwined cells. Moreover, antibody labeling cannot differentiate functional receptors from those that might be silent. Functional GABAA receptors can be mapped with pinpoint accuracy via two-photon photolysis of “caged GABA” (Matsuzaki et al., 2010Matsuzaki M. Hayama T. Kasai H. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Two-photon uncaging of γ-aminobutyric acid in intact brain tissue.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but this method cannot differentiate receptor isoforms. Optogenetic pharmacology with LiGABARs can overcome these limitations by allowing discrimination between functional receptor isoforms. To validate this idea, we mapped the functional distributions of α1- and α5-LiGABARs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The cysteine mutant of the α1 or α5 subunit (α1T125C or α5E125C) was virally coexpressed with GFP in a rat hippocampal slice. The transduced slice was then treated with PTL (PAG-1C), and fluorescent neurons were selected for whole-cell voltage-clamp recording. We monitored responses to uncaged GABA when LiGABARs were either antagonized (by 540 nm) or relieved from antagonism (by 390 nm). By measuring the ratio of responses in these two conditions, we reveal the contribution of a particular α isoform to the uncaging response and control for potential sources of variability. Other control experiments demonstrate that the two-photon uncaging response was unaltered by the conditioning light for receptor photo-control (Figure S4A; validated in the absence of the PTL), and that the two-photon light used for uncaging did not affect the state of the LiGABAR (Figure S4B). We first obtained a low-resolution view of where α1- and α5-LiGABARs are present (Figures 2A and 2B ). Two locations were examined: one at or close to the soma (proximal site), and one on the primary apical dendrite (70–80 μm from the soma; distal site). Each uncaging site spanned 7–10 μm. In cells expressing α1-LiGABAR, photoswitching (defined as the fraction of current antagonized by light) was more profound proximally than distally, with the effect decreasing from 0.47 ± 0.02 at the proximal site to 0.11 ± 0.07 at the distal site (p < 0.05, n = 5, paired t test; Figures 2A and 2C). In contrast, when α5-LiGABAR was expressed, photoswitching was not significantly different between the two sites (0.33 ± 0.09 at the proximal site and 0.50 ± 0.06 at the distal site; p > 0.1, n = 5, paired t test; Figures 2B and 2C). These results suggest that functionally active α1- and α5-GABAA receptors are differentially distributed, with α1 concentrated near the soma and α5 extending to more distal locations along the apical dendrite. We next obtained a higher-resolution map of dendritic α1- and α5-LiGABARs with smaller, more closely spaced uncaging spots (2.5 μm, ∼5 μm apart; Figures 2D and 2E). We found that the amplitude of GABA-elicited current varied between these spots in neurons expressing either α1 or α5. Independent of this, however, there was a striking difference in the spatial pattern of photoswitching between these two isoforms (Figures 2D–2G). Photosensitivity appeared to be localized to “hotspots” for α1 (Figures 2D and 2F) but distributed evenly along the dendrite for α5 (Figures 2E and 2F). Group data show higher spatial variability of photoswitching for neurons expressing α1-LiGABAR than for those expressing α5-LiGABAR, consistent with clustering of α1-containing receptors (coefficient of variation: 0.59 for α1 versus 0.18 for α5, p < 0.05, Levene’s test, n = 22 and 18 uncaging sites from five and six cells, respectively; Figure 2G). Immunolabeling studies showed that the α1 isoform is concentrated at inhibitory synapses (Brünig et al., 2002Brünig I. Scotti E. Sidler C. Fritschy J.M.

Neurosci. 2010; 32: 1868-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To verify that the photoswitching hotspots of α1-LiGABAR represent clusters of functional receptors at synapses, we targeted inhibitory synapses using a genetically encoded fluorescent intrabody for gephyrin (a scaffolding protein that tethers GABAA receptors at synapses; Gross et al., 2013Gross G.G. Junge J.A. Mora R.J. Kwon H.B. Olson C.A. Takahashi T.T. Liman E.R. Ellis-Davies G.C. McGee A.W. Sabatini B.L. et al.Recombinant probes for visualizing endogenous synaptic proteins in living neurons.Neuron. 2013; 78: 971-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Neurons expressing the gephyrin intrabody exhibit fluorescent puncta at postsynaptic sites. We found significant photoswitching of responses only when GABA was uncaged at gephyrin puncta (0.32 ± 0.07 at puncta versus −0.01 ± 0.03 at ∼4 μm outside of puncta, n = 7 and 5 sites from five cells, respectively, p < 0.001, paired t test; Figures 2H and 2I). Hence, by combining LiGABAR photo-control with two-photon uncaging, one can generate a functional map of a specific GABAA isoform on a neuron, resolved at the level of individual synaptic contacts. We next tested whether LiGABARs can enable photo-control of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Mutant α subunits were exogenously expressed by viral transduction in mouse cerebral cortex. Brain slices were treated with PTLs to generate LiGABARs. Monosynaptic IPSCs were evoked by electrical stimulation of local inhibitory inputs while blocking excitatory glutamate receptors. When we employed a LiGABAR that exhibits trans-antagonism (PAG-1C on α1), we found that IPSC amplitude was 63% ± 3% smaller in 500-nm light than in 380-nm light (p < 0.05, n = 6, paired t test; Figure 3A). When we used a LiGABAR that exhibits cis-antagonism (PAG-2A on α5), we observed the opposite effect: IPSC amplitude was 52% ± 2% smaller in 380-nm light than in 500-nm light (p < 0.05, n = 6, paired t test; Figure 3B). Hence, synaptic inhibition can be photo-controlled with either polarity. In principle, the amplitude of IPSCs can be changed by altering presynaptic GABA release or postsynaptic GABAA receptors. To verify that our observed effects are entirely postsynaptic, we compared the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) at the two photoswitching wavelengths. Changes in PPR would reflect changes in presynaptic release probability (Zucker and Regehr, 2002Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). We found that the PPR was the same under 380- and 500-nm illumination (0.9 ± 0.1 versus 0.9 ± 0.1, p > 0.05, n = 11, paired t test), indicating that photoswitching was entirely a postsynaptic phenomenon. Extrasynaptic GABAA receptors mediate tonic inhibition, important for setting the tone of excitability in the brain (Farrant and Nusser, 2005Farrant M. Nusser Z. Variations on an inhibitory theme: phasic and tonic activation of GABAA receptors.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). To test whether LiGABARs enable photo-control of tonic inhibition, we recorded from hippocampal pyramidal neurons expressing α5-LiGABAR (conjugated with PAG-1C). To magnify GABA-mediated currents, neurons were clamped at 0 mV, far from the ECl (chloride reversal potential; −70 mV), and a small volume of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; ∼30 ml) was recirculated to avoid washout of extracellular GABA. Under these conditions, a brief flash of 390-nm light caused an outward current increase of 52 ± 13 pA (n = 5) that was reversed by 540-nm light (Figure 3C). The effect of light was abolished after applying picrotoxin (100 μM), confirming that it was mediated by GABAA receptors. Our results suggest that viral expression of the LiGABAR mutant alone, in the absence of the photoswitch, did not significantly alter synaptic properties. We compared the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents (E/I ratio) in α1T125C-expressing versus nonexpressing neurons in cortical slices. The E/I ratio was the same in mutant-expressing neurons and in control neurons, and there was no difference in the kinetics of IPSCs between the two groups (Figure S5). Taken together, LiGABARs can be exogenously introduced into brain tissue without changing the balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition. Optogenetic tools allow rapid manipulations of neuronal activities with temporal precision. To test the speed of LiGABAR photo-control, we measured the minimal illumination time required for full IPSC photoswitching in CA1 pyramidal neurons with α1-LiGABAR. A flash of 540-nm (28 mW/mm2) or 390-nm (4.5 mW/mm2) light was applied 100 ms prior to presynaptic stimulation to antagonize or restore the receptor, respectively. We first fully antagonized LiGABAR with a fixed duration of 540-nm light (500 ms) and restored receptor activity with various durations of 390-nm light (ranging from 10 to 500 ms; Figure 4A). Photoswitching (relief of antagonism) increased with increasing duration of 390-nm light, and approached maximal (>95%) with a 100-ms flash. We next repeated the experiment with different durations of 540-nm light (and fixed 390-nm flashes; Figure 4A). In this case, photoswitching (induction of antagonism) approached maximal with a 200-ms flash of 540-nm light. We next tested whether rapid control of synaptic inhibition could change the spike output of a neuron in response to synaptic stimulation. Current-clamp recordings were carried out in CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing α1-LiGABAR. We electrically stimulated Shaffer collaterals, recruiting overlapping excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that have opposite effects on spiking. Each stimulus elicited a single spike when LiGABAR was photo-antagonized. The spike was eliminated when LiGABAR was relieved from antagonism. The spiking response could be gated with a flash of light as brief as 100 ms, delivered immediately before the presynaptic stimulus (Figure 4B). Collectively, our results (Figures 4A and 4B) suggest that inhibition can be photo-controlled at a timescale of 100–200 ms. Because the speed of photo-control is largely determined by light intensity, LiGABAR manipulation may be accelerated further with a brighter light source. LiGABARs can also be used as a bistable switch. To illustrate this feature, we monitored the IPSC amplitude after transient conditioning with 380- or 500-nm light (Figure 4C). The IPSC amplitude was elevated by 380-nm light, and slowly decreased upon returning to darkness with a time constant of 30 ± 6 min (95% confidence bounds: 26 ± 4 min and 38 ± 8 min; n = 4). Exposure to 500-nm light quickly reduced the IPSC back to the initial amplitude, where it remained steady over 10 min. Hence, LiGABAR can be stably toggled between antagonized and antagonism-relieved states with brief flashes of conditioning light. This feature minimizes phototoxicity and enables the use of other optical manipulations in the same experiment (e.g., GABA uncaging; Figure 2). Before implementing LiGABAR in vivo, we needed to define how far the PTL and the light can penetrate through brain tissue to enable photo-control. We first determined how deep into the cerebral cortex the PTL can penetrate to form LiGABAR (Figures 5A–5C). To evaluate this parameter, we first expressed the mutant α subunit by stereotactically injecting a virus (encoding α1T125C and eGFP) into mouse visual cortex. After 10–14 days, the mouse was anesthetized, and a craniotomy was performed to expose the cortex where neurons expressed the mutant receptor. Following the subsequent duratomy, a droplet of aCSF containing the PTL (250 μM PAG-1C) was applied onto the exposed brain surface (Figure 5A). After 1 hr of treatment, we prepared cortical slices and recorded from GFP-positive neurons at various depths beneath the craniotomy region. The degree of IPSC photoswitching was assessed as an index of LiGABAR formation. We found that the degree of IPSC photoswitching declined with the depth from the pia, decreasing from ∼40% near the surface to ∼0% at 400 μm away from the surface (Figure 5B). This decline in IPSC photosensitivity could be fit with a single exponential function with a depth constant of 371 μm (95% confidence bounds: 239 and 824 μm; n = 15 cells from three mice; Figure 5C). We next used a brain slice as a surrogate for intact brain tissue to evaluate how far the light can penetrate to photo-control LiGABAR (Figures 5D–5F). We prepared acute cortical slices from virally transduced mice, and incubated the slices in PTL-containing aCSF to allow uniform receptor conjugation. In each neuron, we measured the ratio of IPSC photoswitching under two different illumination conditions: first, with light projected directly into the slice axially from the pia surface and, second, with light projected directly onto the slice in cross-section (Figure 5D). Axial illumination should photo-control LiGABAR maximally near the pia surface, where light intensity is highest. Cross-sectional illumination should photo-control LiGABAR uniformly, with variability attributable to other factors, such as differences in the expression of the mutant subunit. Hence, the ratio of IPSC photoswitching by axial versus cross-sectional illumination reflects the efficiency of LiGABAR photo-control, calibrating for other factors that could cause cell-to-cell variation. We found that IPSC photoswitching by axial illumination decreased from ∼41% near the pia surface to ∼11% at ∼400 μm from the surface (Figure 5E). The depth-dependent decrease of photoswitching ratio (axial versus cross-sectional) could be fit with a single exponential function with a depth constant of 352 μm (95% confidence bounds: 255 and 568 μm; n = 12 cells from three mice; Figure 5F). These experiments utilized an unfocused light source for axial illumination, which emitted at ∼"
https://openalex.org/W2209413357,"The accurate formation of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and incorporation of their protein cargo during endocytosis is critical for the maintenance of neurotransmission. During intense neuronal activity, a transient and acute accumulation of SV cargo occurs at the plasma membrane. Activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) is the dominant SV endocytosis mode under these conditions; however, it is currently unknown how ADBE mediates cargo retrieval. We examined the retrieval of different SV cargo molecules during intense stimulation using a series of genetically encoded pH-sensitive reporters in neuronal cultures. The retrieval of only one reporter, VAMP4-pHluorin, was perturbed by inhibiting ADBE. This selective recovery was confirmed by the enrichment of endogenous VAMP4 in purified bulk endosomes formed by ADBE. VAMP4 was also essential for ADBE, with a cytoplasmic di-leucine motif being critical for this role. Therefore, VAMP4 is the first identified ADBE cargo and is essential for this endocytosis mode to proceed."

The purpose of this work was to assess anthropometry, body composition, and performance in sport-specific field tests in a national sample of Italian younger wheelchair basketball players as well as to evaluate the association of these variables with the players' functional ability classification and game-related statistics. Several anthropometric measurements were obtained for 52 out of 91 eligible players nationwide. Performance was assessed in seven sport-specific field tests (5m sprint, 20m sprint with ball, suicide, maximal pass, pass for accuracy, spot shot and lay-ups) and game-related statistics (free-throw points scored per match, two- and three-point field-goals scored per match, and their sum). Association between variables, and predictivity was assessed by correlation and regression analysis, respectively. Players were grouped into four Classes of increasing functional ability (A-D). One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons was used to assess differences between Classes. Sitting height and functional ability Class especially correlated with performance outcomes, but wheelchair basketball experience and skinfolds did not. Game-related statistics and sport-specific field-test scores all showed significant correlation with each other. Upper arm circumference and/or maximal pass and lay-ups test scores were able to explain 42 to 59% of variance in game-related statistics (P<0.001). A clear difference in performance was only found for functional ability Class A and D.In younger wheelchair basketball players, sitting height positively contributes to performance. The maximal pass and lay-ups test should be carefully considered in younger wheelchair basketball training plans. Functional ability Class reflects to a limited extent the actual differences in performance."
https://openalex.org/W2178377552,"The Moon is generally thought to have formed from the debris ejected by the impact of a planet-sized object with the proto-Earth towards the end of planetary accretion. Models of the impact process predict that the lunar material was disaggregated into a circumplanetary disk and that lunar accretion subsequently placed the Moon in a near-equatorial orbit. Forward integration of the lunar orbit from this initial state predicts a modern inclination at least an order of magnitude smaller than the lunar value--a long-standing discrepancy known as the lunar inclination problem. Here we show that the modern lunar orbit provides a sensitive record of gravitational interactions with Earth-crossing planetesimals that were not yet accreted at the time of the Moon-forming event. The currently observed lunar orbit can naturally be reproduced via interaction with a small quantity of mass (corresponding to 0.0075-0.015 Earth masses eventually accreted to the Earth) carried by a few bodies, consistent with the constraints and models of late accretion. Although the encounter process has a stochastic element, the observed value of the lunar inclination is among the most likely outcomes for a wide range of parameters. The excitation of the lunar orbit is most readily reproduced via collisionless encounters of planetesimals with the Earth-Moon system with strong dissipation of tidal energy on the early Earth. This mechanism obviates the need for previously proposed (but idealized) excitation mechanisms, places the Moon-forming event in the context of the formation of Earth, and constrains the pristineness of the dynamical state of the Earth-Moon system."

The in vivo effects of hESC-RPE cells were analyzed by subretinal suspension injection into Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats. Rat eyes were analyzed with electroretinography (ERG) and histology. After analyzing the surface and permeability properties of PI, subretinal PI membrane transplantations with and without hESC-RPE were performed in rabbits. The rabbits were followed for three months and eyes analyzed with fundus photography, ERG, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and histology. Animals were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine the entire follow-up time. In dystrophic RCS rats, ERG and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness showed some rescue after hESC-RPE injection. Cells positive for human antigen were found in clusters under the retina 41 days post-injection but not anymore after 105 days. In rabbits, OCT showed good placement of the PI. However, there was loss of pigmentation on the hESC-RPE-PI over time. In the eyes with PI alone, no obvious signs of inflammation or retinal atrophy were observed. In the presence of hESC-RPE, mononuclear cell infiltration and retinal atrophy were observed around the membranes. The porous ultrathin PI membrane was well-tolerated in the subretinal space and is a promising scaffold for RPE transplantation. However, the rejection of the transplanted cells seems to be a major problem and the given immunosuppression was insufficient for reduction of xenograft induced inflammation."

ROC-analysis was conducted to define FLC-assay characteristics and cut-off values. We also compared FLC-concentrations in CIS patients to determine their OCB-status. A correlation analysis was performed between FLC-concentrations and the expanded disability scale score (EDSS), annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI-activity (i.e., number of new and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions) in patients.The levels of kappa-FLC (k-FLCCSF) and lambda-FLC (λ-FLCCSF) as well as kappa- and lambda-quotients (Q-k and Q-λ) were elevated in CIS-MS compared to the CIS-nonMS and NIND groups. These levels did not differ significantly when compared with the IND group. We identified several patients with high k-FLCCSF and λ-FLCCSF in OCB-negative CIS and IND groups. The level of k-FLCCSF production was significantly higher in OCB-positive patients in the CIS-MS group compared to the CIS-nonMS group. The concentrations of k-FLCCSF and Q-k in the CIS-MS group showed significant correlation with the level of EDSS after 2 years (k-FLC: r = 0.4477,p = 0.0016; Q-k: r = 0.4621, p = 0.0016). λ-FLCCSF and Q-λ inversely correlated with the number of Gd+ lesions (CSF λ-FLC: r = -0.3698, p = 0.0223; Q-λ: r = -0.4527, p = 0.0056).The concentration of CSF FLC predicts conversion to MS within 2 years following CIS. OCB-positive patients with an early conversion have a higher concentration of CSF-FLC. We have also shown a prognostic significance of k-FLCCSF for future EDSS-progression."

https://openalex.org/W2175111412,"CDK (cyclin-dependent kinase) inhibitors have shown remarkable activity in CLL, where its efficacy has been linked to inhibition of the transcriptional CDKs (7 and 9) and deregulation of RNA polymerase and short-lived pro-survival proteins such as MCL1. Furthermore, ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress has been implicated in CDK inhibition in CLL. Here we conducted a pre-clinical study of a novel orally active kinase inhibitor P1446A in CLL B-cells. P1446A inhibited CDKs at nanomolar concentrations and induced rapid apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro, irrespective of chromosomal abnormalities or IGHV mutational status. Apoptosis preceded inactivation of RNA polymerase, and was accompanied by phosphorylation of stress kinases JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Pharmacologic inhibitors of JNK/p38 MAPK conferred protection from P1446A-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with P1446A led to a dramatic induction of NOXA in a JNK-dependent manner, and sensitized CLL cells to ABT-737, a BH3-mimetic. We observed concurrent activation of apoptosis stress-inducing kinase 1 (ASK1) and its interaction with inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) in CLL cells treated with P1446A, providing insights into upstream regulation of JNK in this setting. Consistent with previous reports on limited functionality of ER stress mechanism in CLL cells, treatment with P1446A failed to induce an extensive unfolded protein response. This study provides rationale for additional investigations of P1446A in CLL."

https://openalex.org/W2180083740,"Ubiquitination is a post-translation modification where ubiquitin is attached to a substrate. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) play a major role in the ubiquitin transfer pathway, as well as a variety of functions in plant biological processes. To date, no genome-wide characterization of this gene family has been conducted in maize (Zea mays).In the present study, a total of 75 putative ZmUBC genes have been identified and located in the maize genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ZmUBC proteins could be divided into 15 subfamilies, which include 13 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (ZmE2s) and two independent ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant (UEV) groups. The predicted ZmUBC genes were distributed across 10 chromosomes at different densities. In addition, analysis of exon-intron junctions and sequence motifs in each candidate gene has revealed high levels of conservation within and between phylogenetic groups. Tissue expression analysis indicated that most ZmUBC genes were expressed in at least one of the tissues, indicating that these are involved in various physiological and developmental processes in maize. Moreover, expression profile analyses of ZmUBC genes under different stress treatments (4°C, 20% PEG6000, and 200 mM NaCl) and various expression patterns indicated that these may play crucial roles in the response of plants to stress.Genome-wide identification, chromosome organization, gene structure, evolutionary and expression analyses of ZmUBC genes have facilitated in the characterization of this gene family, as well as determined its potential involvement in growth, development, and stress responses. This study provides valuable information for better understanding the classification and putative functions of the UBC-encoding genes of maize."
https://openalex.org/W2181016441,"Humans attend to social cues in order to understand and predict others' behavior. Facial expressions and gaze direction provide valuable information to infer others' mental states and intentions. The present study examined the mechanism of gaze following in the context of participants' expectations about successive action steps of an observed actor. We embedded a gaze-cueing manipulation within an action scenario consisting of a sequence of naturalistic photographs. Gaze-induced orienting of attention (gaze following) was analyzed with respect to whether the gaze behavior of the observed actor was in line or not with the action-related expectations of participants (i.e., whether the actor gazed at an object that was congruent or incongruent with an overarching action goal). In Experiment 1, participants followed the gaze of the observed agent, though the gaze-cueing effect was larger when the actor looked at an action-congruent object relative to an incongruent object. Experiment 2 examined whether the pattern of effects observed in Experiment 1 was due to covert, rather than overt, attentional orienting, by requiring participants to maintain eye fixation throughout the sequence of critical photographs (corroborated by monitoring eye movements). The essential pattern of results of Experiment 1 was replicated, with the gaze-cueing effect being completely eliminated when the observed agent gazed at an action-incongruent object. Thus, our findings show that covert gaze following can be modulated by expectations that humans hold regarding successive steps of the action performed by an observed agent."
https://openalex.org/W2263995572,"Splicing patterns in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are maintained through cis regulatory elements that recruit antagonistic host RNA-binding proteins. The activity of the 3′ acceptor site A7 is tightly regulated through a complex network of an intronic splicing silencer (ISS), a bipartite exonic splicing silencer (ESS3a/b), and an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE3). Because HIV-1 splicing depends on protein-RNA interactions, it is important to know the tertiary structures surrounding the splice sites. Herein, we present the NMR solution structure of the phylogenetically conserved ISS stem loop. ISS adopts a stable structure consisting of conserved UG wobble pairs, a folded 2X2 (GU/UA) internal loop, a UU bulge, and a flexible AGUGA apical loop. Calorimetric and biochemical titrations indicate that the UP1 domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 binds the ISS apical loop site-specifically and with nanomolar affinity. Collectively, this work provides additional insights into how HIV-1 uses a conserved RNA structure to commandeer a host RNA-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2175259778,"Dental biofilm development involves initial colonization of the tooth’s surface by pioneer colonizers, followed by cell-cell coaggregation between the pioneer and later colonizers. Streptococcus gordonii is one of the pioneer colonizers. In addition to its role in oral biofilm development, S. gordonii also is a pathogen in infective endocarditis in susceptible humans. A surface adhesin, Hsa, has been shown to play a critical role in colonization of S. gordonii on the heart tissue; however, its role in oral biofilm development has not been reported. In this study we demonstrate that Hsa is essential for coaggregation between S. gordonii and Veillonella sp., which are bridging species connecting the pioneer colonizers to the late colonizers. Interestingly, the same domains shown to be required for Hsa binding to sialic acid on the human cell surface are also required for coaggregation with Veillonella sp. However, sialic acid appeared not to be required for this intergeneric coaggregation. This result suggests that although the same domains of Hsa are involved in binding to eukaryotic as well as Veillonella cells, the binding mechanism is different. The gene expression pattern of hsa was also studied and shown not to be induced by coaggregation with Veillonella sp."
https://openalex.org/W2173199074,"The marine ecosystem has been severely disturbed by several transient paleoenvironmental events (<200 kyr duration) during the early Paleogene, of which the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~56 Ma) was the most prominent. Over the last decade a number of similar events of Paleocene and Eocene age have been discovered. However, relatively little attention has been paid to pre-PETM events, such as the ""Latest Danian Event"" (""LDE"", ~62.18 Ma), specifically from an open ocean perspective. Here we present new foraminiferal isotope (δ13C, δ18O) and faunal data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1210 at Shatsky Rise (Pacific Ocean) in order to reconstruct the prevailing paleoceanographic conditions. The studied five-meter-thick succession covers ~900 kyr and includes the 200-kyr-lasting LDE. All groups surface dwelling, subsurface dwelling and benthic foraminifera show a negative δ13C excursion of >0.6‰, similar in magnitude to the one previously reported from neighboring Site 1209 for benthic foraminifera. δ18O-inferred warming by 1.6 to 2.8°C (0.4-0.7‰ δ18O measured on benthic and planktic foraminiferal tests) of the entire water column accompanies the negative δ13C excursion. A well stratified upper ocean directly before and during the LDE is proposed based on the stable isotope gradients between surface and subsurface dwellers. The gradient is less well developed, but still enhanced after the event. Isotope data are supplemented by comprehensive planktic foraminiferal faunal analyses revealing a dominance of Morozovella species together with Parasubbotina species. Subsurface-dwelling Parasubbotina shows high abundances during the LDE tracing changes in the strength of the isotope gradients and, thus, may indicate optimal living conditions within a well stratified surface ocean for this taxon. In addition, distinct faunal changes are reported like the disappearance of Praemurica species right at the base of the LDE and the continuous replacement of M. praeangulata with M. angulata across the LDE."

In this study, we focus on the Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in northern Australia, particularly the carbonate banks and terraces of the Sahul Shelf and Van Diemen Rise which have been designated a Key Ecological Feature (KEF). We use a species-level inventory compiled from three marine surveys to the CMR to address several questions relevant to marine management: 1) Are carbonate banks and other raised geomorphic features associated with biodiversity hotspots? 2) Can environmental (depth, substrate hardness, slope) or biogeographic (east vs west) variables help explain local and regional differences in community structure? 3) Do sponge communities differ among individual raised geomorphic features? Approximately 750 sponge specimens were collected in the Oceanic Shoals CMR and assigned to 348 species, of which only 18% included taxonomically described species. Between eastern and western areas of the CMR, there was no difference between sponge species richness or assemblages on raised geomorphic features. Among individual raised geomorphic features, sponge assemblages were significantly different, but species richness was not. Species richness showed no linear relationships with measured environmental factors, but sponge assemblages were weakly associated with several environmental variables including mean depth and mean backscatter (east and west) and mean slope (east only). These patterns of sponge diversity are applied to support the future management and monitoring of this region, particularly noting the importance of spatial scale in biodiversity assessments and associated management strategies."

Experimental Design 262 consecutive SCLC patients were examined: of these, 24 with neurological disease were excluded from this study. The remaining 238 were tested for a broad array of Neur-Abs at the time of cancer diagnosis; survival time was established from follow-up clinical data. Results Median survival of the non-PND cohort (n = 238) was 9.5 months. 103 patients (43%) had one or more antigen-defined Neur-Abs. We found significantly longer median survival in 23 patients (10%) with HuD/anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1 (ANNA-1, 13.0 months P = 0.037), but not with any of the other antigen-defined antibodies, including the PND-related SOX2 (n = 56, 24%). An additional 28 patients (12%) had uncharacterised anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies (ANNA-U); their median survival time was longer still (15.0 months, P = 0.0048), contrasting with the survival time in patients with non-neuronal anti-nuclear antibodies (detected using HEp-2 cells, n = 23 (10%), 9.25 months). In multivariate analyses, both ANNA-1 and ANNA-U independently reduced the mortality hazard by a ratio of 0.532 (P = 0.01) and 0.430 (P<0.001) respectively. Conclusions ANNAs, including the newly described ANNA-U, may be key components of the SCLC immunome and have a potential role in predicting SCLC survival; screening for them could add prognostic value that is similar in magnitude to that of limited staging at diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2172916341,"Compared with many induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines generated using retrovirus and other non-integrating methods, the utilization of human protein-induced iPSC (piPSC) lines may provide a safer alternative for the generation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells for transplantation in retinal degenerative diseases. Here we assess the ability of piPSCs to differentiate into RPE cells, and to perform native RPE cell behavior. piPSCs were seeded in 6-well low-attachment plates to allow embryoid body formation, and then analyzed for pluripotent stem cell markers NANOG, SSEA4 and TRA-1-60 by immunofluorescence. Following colony formation, piPSCs were assessed for confirmation of RPE cell differentiation by staining for zonula occludens (ZO-1), bestrophin, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and retinal pigment epithelium specific protein-65 (RPE65). To evaluate piPSC-RPE cell phagocytic ability, adult bovine photoreceptor rod outer segments (ROS) were fed to piPSC-RPE cells, which were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Undifferentiated piPSCs expressed all pluripotent markers assessed and formed embryoid body aggregates after 7 days. Differentiated piPSC-RPE cells expressed ZO-1, bestrophin, MITF and RPE65, typical RPE cell markers. Flow cytometry revealed robust ingestion of fluorescently-labeled ROS by piPSC-RPE cells, which was over four-times greater than that of undifferentiated piPSCs and comparable to that of an immortalized RPE cell line. Phagocytosis activity by piPSC-RPE cells was significantly reduced after the addition of anti-integrin αVβ5. In conclusion, piPSCs can be differentiated toward an RPE cell fate, expressing RPE cell markers and resembling native RPE cells in behavior. These results demonstrate that piPSCs can be differentiated into RPE-like cells using a method that has an increased safety profile, a critical consideration for the development of better treatments for retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD)."
https://openalex.org/W2179099740,"Caulobacter crescentus is an oligotrophic bacterium that lives in dilute organic environments such as soil and freshwater. This bacterium represents an interesting model for cellular differentiation and regulation because daughter cells after division have different forms: one is motile while the other is non-motile and can adhere to surfaces. Interestingly, the known genome of C. crescentus does not contain genes predicted to code for outer membrane porins of the OmpF/C general diffusion type present in enteric bacteria or those coding for specific porins selective for classes of substrates. Instead, genes coding for 67 TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors have been identified, suggesting that active transport of specific nutrients may be the norm. Here, we report that high channel-forming activity was observed with crude outer membrane extracts of C. crescentus in lipid bilayer experiments, indicating that the outer membrane of C. crescentus contained an ion-permeable channel with a single-channel conductance of about 120 pS in 1M KCl. The channel-forming protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 20 kDa was purified to homogeneity. Partial protein sequencing of the protein indicated it was a member of the OmpW family of outer membrane proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. This channel was not observed in reconstitution experiments with crude outer membrane extracts of an OmpW deficient C. crescentus mutant. Biophysical analysis of the C. crescentus OmpW suggested that it has features that are special for general diffusion porins of Gram-negative outer membranes because it was not a wide aqueous channel. Furthermore, OmpW of C. crescentus seems to be different to known OmpW porins and has a preference for ions, in particular cations. A putative model for OmpW of C. crescentus was built on the basis of the known 3D-structures of OmpW of Escherichia coli and OprG of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using homology modeling. A comparison of the two known structures with the model of OmpW of C. crescentus suggested that it has a more hydrophilic interior and possibly a larger diameter."
https://openalex.org/W2172862902,"Increased understanding of immune responses influencing clinical severity during pandemic influenza infection is important for improved treatment and vaccine development. In this study we recruited 46 adult patients during the 2009 influenza pandemic and characterized humoral and cellular immune responses. Those included were either acute hospitalized or convalescent patients with different disease severities (mild, moderate or severe). In general, protective antibody responses increased with enhanced disease severity. In the acute patients, we found higher levels of TNF-α single-producing CD4+T-cells in the severely ill as compared to patients with moderate disease. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a subset of acute patients with peptide T-cell epitopes showed significantly lower frequencies of influenza specific CD8+ compared with CD4+ IFN-γ T-cells in acute patients. Both T-cell subsets were predominantly directed against the envelope antigens (HA and NA). However, in the convalescent patients we found high levels of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells directed against conserved core antigens (NP, PA, PB, and M). The results indicate that the antigen targets recognized by the T-cell subsets may vary according to the phase of infection. The apparent low levels of cross-reactive CD8+ T-cells recognizing internal antigens in acute hospitalized patients suggest an important role for this T-cell subset in protective immunity against influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2178094464,"Ethiopia has scaled up its community-based programs over the past decade by training and deploying health extension workers (HEWs) in rural communities throughout the country. Consequently, child mortality has declined substantially, placing Ethiopia among the few countries that have achieved the United Nations' fourth Millennium Development Goal. As Ethiopia continues its efforts, results must be assessed regularly to provide timely feedback for improvement and to generate further support for programs. More specifically the expansion of HEWs at the community level provides a unique opportunity to build a system for real-time monitoring of births and deaths, linked to a civil registration and vital statistics system that Ethiopia is also developing. We tested the accuracy and completeness of births and deaths reported by trained HEWs for monitoring child mortality over 15 -month periods.HEWs were trained in 93 randomly selected rural kebeles in Jimma and West Hararghe zones of the Oromia region to report births and deaths over a 15-month period from January, 2012 to March, 2013. Completeness of number of births and deaths, age distribution of deaths, and accuracy of resulting under-five, infant, and neonatal mortality rates were assessed against data from a large household survey with full birth history from women aged 15-49. Although, in general HEWs, were able to accurately report events that they identified, the completeness of number of births and deaths reported over twelve-month periods was very low and variable across the two zones. Compared to household survey estimates, HEWs reported only about 30% of births and 21% of under-five deaths occurring in their communities over a twelve-month period. The under-five mortality rate was under-estimated by around 30%, infant mortality rate by 23% and neonatal mortality by 17%. HEWs reported disproportionately higher number of deaths among the very young infants than among the older children.Birth and death data reported by HEWs are not complete enough to support the monitoring of changes in childhood mortality. HEWs can significantly contribute to the success of a CRVS in Ethiopia, but cannot be relied upon as the sole source for identification of vital events. Further studies are needed to understand how to increase the level of completeness."
https://openalex.org/W2180096279,"Genomic resources such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), insertions and deletions (InDels) and SSRs (simple sequence repeats) are essential for crop improvement and better utilization in genetic breeding. However, the resources for the sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) are still limited. In the present study, to dissect large-scale genomic molecular marker resources for sacred lotus, we re-sequenced a Thailand sacred lotus cultivar 'Chiang Mai wild lotus' and compared with the reported lotus genome 'Middle lake wild lotus'. A total of 3,180,059 SNPs, 328, 251 InDels and 14,191 SVs were found between the two genomes. The functional impact analyses of these SNPs indicated that they may be involved in metabolic processes, binding, catalytic activity, etc. Mining the genome sequences for SSRs showed that 191,657 SSRs were identified with a frequency of one SSR per 4.23 kb and 103,656 SSR primer pairs were designed. Furthermore, 14, 502 EST-SSRs were also indentified using the available RNA-seq data in the NCBI. A subset of 150 SSRs (genomic and EST-SSRs) was randomly selected for validation and genetic diversity analysis. The genotypes could be easily distinguished using these SSR markers and the 'Chiang Mai wild lotus' was obviously differentiated from the other Chinese accessions. This study provides considerable amounts of genomic resources and markers for the quantitative trait locus (QTL) identification and molecular selection of the species, which could have a potential role in various applications in sacred lotus breeding."

https://openalex.org/W2179596357,"Throughout the world, populations of scavenger birds are declining rapidly with some populations already on the brink of extinction. Much of the current research into the factors contributing to these declines has focused on exposure to drug residues, lead, and other toxins. Despite increased monitoring of these declining populations, little is known about infectious diseases affecting scavenger bird species. To assess potential infectious disease risks to both obligate and facultative scavenger bird species, we performed a serosurvey for eleven potential pathogens in three species of scavenging birds in California: the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). California condors were seropositive for avian adenovirus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian paramyxovirus-2, West Nile virus (WNV) and Toxoplasma gondii. Golden eagles were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci and Toxoplasma gondii, and turkey vultures were seropositive for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, avian paramyxovirus-1, Toxoplasma gondii and WNV. Risk factor analyses indicated that rearing site and original release location were significantly associated with a positive serologic titer to WNV among free-flying condors. This study provides preliminary baseline data on infectious disease exposure in these populations for aiding in early disease detection and provides potentially critical information for conservation of the endangered California condor as it continues to expand its range and encounter new infectious disease threats."
https://openalex.org/W2173465368,"New biomarkers for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may aid diagnosis, drug development or clinical treatment. Evidence is increasing for the adaptive immune system’s role in T2DM and suggests the presence of unidentified autoantibodies. While high-density protein microarrays have emerged as a useful technology to identify possible novel autoantigens in autoimmune diseases, its application in T2DM has lagged. In Pima Indians, the HLA haplotype (HLA-DRB1*02) is protective against T2DM and, when studied when they have normal glucose tolerance, subjects with this HLA haplotype have higher insulin secretion compared to those without the protective haplotype. Possible autoantibody biomarkers were identified using microarrays containing 9480 proteins in plasma from Pima Indians with T2DM without the protective haplotype (n = 7) compared with those with normal glucose regulation (NGR) with the protective haplotype (n = 11). A subsequent validation phase involving 45 cases and 45 controls, matched by age, sex and specimen storage time, evaluated 77 proteins. Eleven autoantigens had higher antibody signals among T2DM subjects with the lower insulin-secretion HLA background compared with NGR subjects with the higher insulin-secretion HLA background (p<0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons). PPARG2 and UBE2M had lowest p-values (adjusted p = 0.023) while PPARG2 and RGS17 had highest case-to-control antibody signal ratios (1.7). A multi-protein classifier involving the 11 autoantigens had sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.73, 0.80, and 0.83 (95% CI 0.74–0.91, p = 3.4x10-8), respectively. This study identified 11 novel autoantigens which were associated with T2DM and an HLA background associated with reduced insulin secretion. While further studies are needed to distinguish whether these antibodies are associated with insulin secretion via the HLA background, T2DM more broadly, or a combination of the two, this study may aid the search for autoantibody biomarkers by narrowing the list of protein targets."
https://openalex.org/W2176599749,"The ABCC transporter subfamily includes pumps, the long and short multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs), and an ATP-gated anion channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). We show that despite their thermodynamic differences, these ABCC transporter subtypes use broadly similar mechanisms to couple their extracellular gates to the ATP occupancies of their cytosolic nucleotide binding domains. A conserved extracellular phenylalanine at this gate was a prime location for producing gain of function (GOF) mutants of a long MRP in yeast (Ycf1p cadmium transporter), a short yeast MRP (Yor1p oligomycin exporter), and human CFTR channels. Extracellular gate mutations rescued ATP binding mutants of the yeast MRPs and CFTR by increasing ATP sensitivity. Control ATPase-defective MRP mutants could not be rescued by this mechanism. A CFTR double mutant with an extracellular gate mutation plus a cytosolic GOF mutation was highly active (single-channel open probability >0.3) in the absence of ATP and protein kinase A, each normally required for CFTR activity. We conclude that all 3 ABCC transporter subtypes use similar mechanisms to couple their extracellular gates to ATP occupancy, and highly active CFTR channels that bypass defects in ATP binding or phosphorylation can be produced.—Wei, S., Roessler, B.

https://openalex.org/W2181163396,"Membrane proteins play key roles in many biological processes, from acquisition of nutrients to neurotransmission, and are targets for more than 50% of current therapeutic drugs. However, their investigation is hampered by difficulties in their production and purification on a scale suitable for structural studies. In particular, the nature and location of affinity tags introduced for the purification of recombinant membrane proteins can greatly influence their expression levels by affecting their membrane insertion. The extent of such effects typically depends on the transmembrane topologies of the proteins, which for proteins of unknown structure are usually uncertain. For example, attachment of oligohistidine tags to the periplasmic termini of membrane proteins often interferes with folding and drastically impairs expression in Escherichia coli. To circumvent this problem we have employed a novel strategy to enable the rapid production of constructs bearing a range of different affinity tags compatible with either cytoplasmic or periplasmic attachment. Tags include conventional oligohistidine tags compatible with cytoplasmic attachment and, for attachment to proteins with a periplasmic terminus, either tandem Strep-tag II sequences or oligohistidine tags fused to maltose binding protein and a signal sequence. Inclusion of cleavage sites for TEV or HRV-3C protease enables tag removal prior to crystallisation trials or a second step of purification. Together with the use of bioinformatic approaches to identify members of membrane protein families with topologies favourable to cytoplasmic tagging, this has enabled us to express and purify multiple bacterial membrane transporters. To illustrate this strategy, we describe here its use to purify bacterial homologues of human membrane proteins from the Nramp and ZIP families of divalent metal cation transporters and from the concentrative nucleoside transporter family. The proteins are expressed in E. coli in a correctly folded, functional state and can be purified in amounts suitable for structural investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2180080094,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants that predispose individuals to a higher body mass index (BMI), an independent risk factor for endometrial cancer. Composite genotype risk scores (GRS) based on the joint effect of published BMI risk loci were used to explore whether endometrial cancer shares a genetic background with obesity. Genotype and risk factor data were available on 3,376 endometrial cancer case and 3,867 control participants of European ancestry from the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium GWAS. A BMI GRS was calculated by summing the number of BMI risk alleles at 97 independent loci. For exploratory analyses, additional GRSs were based on subsets of risk loci within putative etiologic BMI pathways. The BMI GRS was statistically significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk (P = 0.002). For every 10 BMI risk alleles a woman had a 13% increased endometrial cancer risk (95% CI: 4%, 22%). However, after adjusting for BMI, the BMI GRS was no longer associated with risk (per 10 BMI risk alleles OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.07; P = 0.78). Heterogeneity by BMI did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.06), and no effect modification was noted by age, GWAS Stage, study design or between studies (P≥0.58). In exploratory analyses, the GRS defined by variants at loci containing monogenic obesity syndrome genes was associated with reduced endometrial cancer risk independent of BMI (per BMI risk allele OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.96; P = 2.1 x 10−5). Possessing a large number of BMI risk alleles does not increase endometrial cancer risk above that conferred by excess body weight among women of European descent. Thus, the GRS based on all current established BMI loci does not provide added value independent of BMI. Future studies are required to validate the unexpected observed relation between monogenic obesity syndrome genetic variants and endometrial cancer risk."

https://openalex.org/W2174040158,"GPCRs catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαßγ) through displacement of the Gα C-terminal α5 helix, which directly connects the interface of the active receptor (R*) to the nucleotide binding pocket of G. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and kinetic analysis of R* catalysed G protein activation have suggested that displacement of α5 starts from an intermediate GDP bound complex (R*•GGDP). To elucidate the structural basis of receptor-catalysed displacement of α5, we modelled the structure of R*•GGDP. A flexible docking protocol yielded an intermediate R*•GGDP complex, with a similar overall arrangement as in the X-ray structure of the nucleotide free complex (R*•Gempty), however with the α5 C-terminus (GαCT) forming different polar contacts with R*. Starting molecular dynamics simulations of GαCT bound to R* in the intermediate position, we observe a screw-like motion, which restores the specific interactions of α5 with R* in R*•Gempty. The observed rotation of α5 by 60° is in line with experimental data. Reformation of hydrogen bonds, water expulsion and formation of hydrophobic interactions are driving forces of the α5 displacement. We conclude that the identified interactions between R* and G protein define a structural framework in which the α5 displacement promotes direct transmission of the signal from R* to the GDP binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W30683393,"Underwater blasts propagate further and injure more readily than equivalent air blasts. Development of effective personal protection and countermeasures, however, requires knowledge of the currently unknown human tolerance to underwater blast. Current guidelines for prevention of underwater blast injury are not based on any organized injury risk assessment, human data or experimental data. The goal of this study was to derive injury risk assessments for underwater blast using well-characterized human underwater blast exposures in the open literature. The human injury dataset was compiled using 34 case reports on underwater blast exposure to 475 personnel, dating as early as 1916. Using severity ratings, computational reconstructions of the blasts, and survival information from a final set of 262 human exposures, injury risk models were developed for both injury severity and risk of fatality as functions of blast impulse and blast peak overpressure. Based on these human data, we found that the 50% risk of fatality from underwater blast occurred at 302±16 kPa-ms impulse. Conservatively, there is a 20% risk of pulmonary injury at a kilometer from a 20 kg charge. From a clinical point of view, this new injury risk model emphasizes the large distances possible for potential pulmonary and gut injuries in water compared with air. This risk value is the first impulse-based fatality risk calculated from human data. The large-scale inconsistency between the blast exposures in the case reports and the guidelines available in the literature prior to this study further underscored the need for this new guideline derived from the unique dataset of actual injuries in this study."

All isolates were biotype El Tor and positive for cholera toxin. All isolates showed multidrug resistance but lacked ciprofloxacin resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of isolates varied between countries. In particular, the susceptibility profile of isolates from Mozambique (East-Africa) included resistance to ceftriaxone and was distinctly different to the susceptibility profiles of isolates from countries located in West- and Central-Africa. Molecular subtyping of isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed a complex relationship among isolates. Some PFGE patterns were unique to particular countries and clustered by country; while other PFGE patterns were shared by isolates from multiple countries, indicating that the same genetic lineage is present in multiple countries.

https://openalex.org/W2177970055,"Antifungal drugs acting via new mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat the increasing numbers of severe fungal infections caused by pathogens such as Candida albicans. The phosphopantetheinyl transferase of Aspergillus fumigatus, encoded by the essential gene pptB, has previously been identified as a potential antifungal target. This study investigated the function of its orthologue in C. albicans, PPT2/C1_09480W by placing one allele under the control of the regulatable MET3 promoter, and deleting the remaining allele. The phenotypes of this conditional null mutant showed that, as in A. fumigatus, the gene PPT2 is essential for growth in C. albicans, thus fulfilling one aspect of an efficient antifungal target. The catalytic activity of Ppt2 as a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and the acyl carrier protein Acp1 as a substrate were demonstrated in a fluorescence transfer assay, using recombinant Ppt2 and Acp1 produced and purified from E.coli. A fluorescence polarisation assay amenable to high-throughput screening was also developed. Therefore we have identified Ppt2 as a broad-spectrum novel antifungal target and developed tools to identify inhibitors as potentially new antifungal compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2174073119,"Background Diurnal emotional experiences seem to affect several characteristics of sleep architecture. However, this influence remains unclear, especially for positive emotions. In addition, electrodermal activity (EDA), a sympathetic robust indicator of emotional arousal, differs depending on the sleep stage. The present research has a double aim: to identify the specific effects of pre-sleep emotional states on the architecture of the subsequent sleep period; to relate such states to the sympathetic activation during the same sleep period. Methods Twelve healthy volunteers (20.1 ± 1.0 yo.) participated in the experiment and each one slept 9 nights at the laboratory, divided into 3 sessions, one per week. Each session was organized over three nights. A reference night, allowing baseline pre-sleep and sleep recordings, preceded an experimental night before which participants watched a negative, neutral, or positive movie. The third and last night was devoted to analyzing the potential recovery or persistence of emotional effects induced before the experimental night. Standard polysomnography and EDA were recorded during all the nights. Results Firstly, we found that experimental pre-sleep emotional induction increased the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep rate following both negative and positive movies. While this increase was spread over the whole night for positive induction, it was limited to the second half of the sleep period for negative induction. Secondly, the valence of the pre-sleep movie also impacted the sympathetic activation during Non-REM stage 3 sleep, which increased after negative induction and decreased after positive induction. Conclusion Pre-sleep controlled emotional states impacted the subsequent REM sleep rate and modulated the sympathetic activity during the sleep period. The outcomes of this study offer interesting perspectives related to the effect of diurnal emotional influences on sleep regulation and open new avenues for potential practices designed to alleviate sleep disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2173133404,"Genetic polymorphisms in the region of the interferon-λ genes (IFNL) associate with clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. One of these polymorphisms, IFNL4 rs368234815, determines loss or gain of function of the IFNL4 gene by frameshift variation. The very same and a second one, IFNL3 rs4803217, are supposed to impact the expression of IFNL3: while IFNL4 rs368234815 is suggested to modulate IFNL3 transcription, IFNL3 rs4803217 is thought to alter IFNL3 mRNA stability. The latter process is believed to be partially driven by an HCV-induced ectopic expression of myosin heavy chain genes 7B and 7 and their co-expressed microRNAs mir499 and mir208B. These ideas are evidenced by functional investigations on peripheral blood mononuclear and hepatoma cells in culture. Our study aimed at exploring IFNL3 gene expression in clinical samples, i.e., in ex vivo derived liver tissue from patients with chronic hepatitis C (n = 57) and various other diseases (n = 56). By applying an assay designed to specifically quantify IFNL3 and discriminating paralogous IFNL2 transcripts, IFNL3 mRNA expression was not found to differ significantly between chronic hepatitis C and control samples. Among patients with chronic HCV infection, moreover, IFNL3 rs4803217 or IFNL4 rs368234815 minor alleles did not associate with reduced IFNL3 gene expression. Finally, myosin heavy chain genes 7B and 7 and corresponding microRNAs mir499 and mir208B were not found activated in liver in chronic HCV infection. Of note, detectability of MYH7 mRNA related to the procedure of liver biopsy sampling, as tissue obtained by direct punctation of the liver during laparoscopic inspection was less likely to contain MYH7 transcripts than samples acquired by percutaneous punctation. In conclusion, data on ex vivo derived liver tissue samples argue against an attenuating impact of IFNL3 rs4803217 or IFNL4 rs368234815 minor alleles on hepatic IFNL3 gene expression in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2188278728,"The present study investigated how ease of imagery influences source monitoring accuracy. Two experiments were conducted in order to examine how ease of imagery influences the probability of source confusions of perceived and imagined completions of natural symmetric shapes. The stimuli consisted of binary pictures of natural objects, namely symmetric pictures of birds, butterflies, insects, and leaves. The ease of imagery (indicating the similarity of the sources) and the discriminability (indicating the similarity of the items) of each stimulus were estimated in a pretest and included as predictors of the memory performance for these stimuli. It was found that confusion of the sources becomes more likely when the imagery process was relatively easy. However, if the different processes of source monitoring-item memory, source memory and guessing biases-are disentangled, both experiments support the assumption that the effect of decreased source memory for easily imagined stimuli is due to decision processes and misinformation at retrieval rather than encoding processes and memory retention. The data were modeled with a Bayesian hierarchical implementation of the one high threshold source monitoring model."
