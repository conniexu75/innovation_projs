https://openalex.org/W1907116357,"Sex differences in behaviour extend to cognitive-like processes such as learning, but the underlying dimorphisms in neural circuit development and organization that generate these behavioural differences are largely unknown. Here we define at the single-cell level-from development, through neural circuit connectivity, to function-the neural basis of a sex-specific learning in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that sexual conditioning, a form of associative learning, requires a pair of male-specific interneurons whose progenitors are fully differentiated glia. These neurons are generated during sexual maturation and incorporated into pre-exisiting sex-shared circuits to couple chemotactic responses to reproductive priorities. Our findings reveal a general role for glia as neural progenitors across metazoan taxa and demonstrate that the addition of sex-specific neuron types to brain circuits during sexual maturation is an important mechanism for the generation of sexually dimorphic plasticity in learning."
https://openalex.org/W2271740409,"FYCO1 (FYVE and coiled-coil protein 1) is a transport adaptor that binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, to Rab7, and to LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) to mediate transport of late endosomes and autophagosomes along microtubules in the plus end direction. We have previously shown that FYCO1 binds to LC3B via a 19-amino acid sequence containing a putative core LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif. Here, we show that FYCO1 preferentially binds to LC3A and -B. By peptide array-based two-dimensional mutational scans of the binding to LC3B, we found FYCO1 to contain a C-terminally extended LIR domain. We determined the crystal structure of a complex between a 13-amino acid LIR peptide from FYCO1 and LC3B at 1.53 Å resolution. By combining the structural information with mutational analyses, both the basis for the C-terminally extended LIR and the specificity for LC3A/B binding were revealed. FYCO1 contains a 9-amino acid-long F-type LIR motif. In addition to the canonical aromatic residue at position 1 and the hydrophobic residue at position 3, an acidic residue and a hydrophobic residue at positions 8 and 9, respectively, are important for efficient binding to LC3B explaining the C-terminal extension. The specificity for binding to LC3A/B is due to the interaction between Asp1285 in FYCO1 and His57 in LC3B. To address the functional significance of the LIR motif of FYCO1, we generated FYCO1 knock-out cells that subsequently were reconstituted with GFP-FYCO1 WT and LIR mutant constructs. Our data show that FYCO1 requires a functional LIR motif to facilitate efficient maturation of autophagosomes under basal conditions, whereas starvation-induced autophagy was unaffected.

https://openalex.org/W2257487915,"In motor development literature fundamental movement skills are divided into three constructs: locomotive, object control and stability skills. Most fundamental movement skills research has focused on children's competency in locomotor and object control skills. The first aim of this study was to validate a test battery to assess the construct of stability skills, in children aged 6 to 10 (M age = 8.2, SD = 1.2). Secondly we assessed how the stability skills construct fitted into a model of fundamental movement skill.The Delphi method was used to select the stability skill battery. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess if the skills loaded onto the same construct and a new model of FMS was developed using structural equation modelling.Three postural control tasks were selected (the log roll, rock and back support) because they had good face and content validity. These skills also demonstrated good predictive validity with gymnasts scoring significantly better than children without gymnastic training and children from a high SES school performing better than those from a mid and low SES schools and the mid SES children scored better than the low SES children (all p < .05). Inter rater reliability tests were excellent for all three skills (ICC = 0.81, 0.87, 0.87) as was test re-test reliability (ICC 0.87-0.95). CFA provided good construct validity, and structural equation modelling revealed stability skills to be an independent factor in an overall FMS model which included locomotor (r = .88), object control (r = .76) and stability skills (r = .81).This study provides a rationale for the inclusion of stability skills in FMS assessment. The stability skills could be used alongside other FMS assessment tools to provide a holistic assessment of children's fundamental movement skills."
https://openalex.org/W2341429650,"Among many sources of natural bioactive substances, mushrooms constitute a huge and almost unexplored group. Fungal compounds have been repeatedly reported to exert biological effects which have prompted their use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of chemical composition and biological activity of 31 wild growing mushroom species (including saprophytic and parasitic) from Poland.Qualitative and quantitative LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of fourteen phenolic acids in the mushrooms analysed was performed. Moreover, total phenolic content was determined by the modified Folin-Ciocalteau method. Antioxidative activity of ethanolic extracts towards DPPH• free radical was examined. Antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (S. epidermidis, S. aureus, B. subtilis, M. luteus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis) microbial strains was analyzed.As a result, the first such broad report on polyphenolic composition, antiradical and antimicrobial potential of wild growing Polish mushrooms was developed. Mushroom extracts were found to contain both benzoic (protocatechuic, 4-OH-benzoic, vanillic, syringic) and cinnamic acid derivatives (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic). Total phenolic content in mushrooms ranged between 2.79 and 53.13 mg gallic acid equivalent /g of dried extract in Trichaptum fuscoviolaceum and Fomes fomentarius, respectively. Fungi showed much differentiated antiradical activity, from highly active F. fomentarius to poorly effective Russula fragilis (IC50 1.39 to 120.54 mg per mg DPPH•, respectively). A quite considerable relationship between phenolic content and antiradical activity has been demonstrated. Mushrooms varied widely in antimicrobial potential (MIC from 0.156 to 5 mg/ml). Generally, a slightly higher activity against Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains was observed. This is the first study concerning the chemical composition and biological activity of the majority of investigated species."
https://openalex.org/W2182226868,"Inflammasomes mediate inflammatory and cell death responses to pathogens and cellular stress signals via activation of procaspases-1 and -8. During inflammasome assembly, activated receptors of the NLR or PYHIN family recruit the adaptor protein ASC and initiate polymerization of its pyrin domain (PYD) into filaments. We show that ASC filaments in turn nucleate procaspase-8 death effector domain (DED) filaments in vitro and in vivo. Interaction between ASC PYD and procaspase-8 tandem DEDs optimally required both DEDs and represents an unusual heterotypic interaction between domains of the death fold superfamily. Analysis of ASC PYD mutants showed that interaction surfaces that mediate procaspase-8 interaction overlap with those required for ASC self-association and interaction with the PYDs of inflammasome initiators. Our data indicate that multiple types of death fold domain filaments form at inflammasomes and that PYD/DED and homotypic PYD interaction modes are similar. Interestingly, we observed condensation of procaspase-8 filaments containing the catalytic domain, suggesting that procaspase-8 interactions within and/or between filaments may be involved in caspase-8 activation. Procaspase-8 filaments may also be relevant to apoptosis induced by death receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2239908578,"The matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) has a critical role in the expansion of the cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC), a process that is necessary for ovulation and fertilization in most mammals. Hyaluronan is organized into a cross-linked network by the cooperative action of three proteins, inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), pentraxin-3, and TNF-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), driving the expansion of the COC and providing the cumulus matrix with its required viscoelastic properties. Although it is known that matrix stabilization involves the TSG-6-mediated transfer of IαI heavy chains (HCs) onto hyaluronan (to form covalent HC·HA complexes that are cross-linked by pentraxin-3) and that this occurs via the formation of covalent HC·TSG-6 intermediates, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we have determined the tertiary structure of the CUB module from human TSG-6, identifying a calcium ion-binding site and chelating glutamic acid residue that mediate the formation of HC·TSG-6. This occurs via an initial metal ion-dependent, non-covalent, interaction between TSG-6 and HCs that also requires the presence of an HC-associated magnesium ion. In addition, we have found that the well characterized hyaluronan-binding site in the TSG-6 Link module is not used for recognition during transfer of HCs onto HA. Analysis of TSG-6 mutants (with impaired transferase and/or hyaluronan-binding functions) revealed that although the TSG-6-mediated formation of HC·HA complexes is essential for the expansion of mouse COCs in vitro, the hyaluronan-binding function of TSG-6 does not play a major role in the stabilization of the murine cumulus matrix.

https://openalex.org/W2255198892,"Diabetes mellitus causes cardiac dysfunction and heart failure that is associated with metabolic abnormalities and autonomic impairment. Autonomic control of ventricular function occurs through regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The diabetic heart has suppressed β-adrenergic responsiveness, partly attributable to receptor changes, yet little is known about how PKA signaling is directly affected. Control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were therefore administered 8-bromo-cAMP (8Br-cAMP) acutely to activate PKA in a receptor-independent manner, and cardiac hemodynamic function and PKA signaling were evaluated. In response to 8Br-cAMP treatment, diabetic mice had impaired inotropic and lusitropic responses, thus demonstrating postreceptor defects. This impaired signaling was mediated by reduced PKA activity and PKA catalytic subunit content in the cytoplasm and myofilaments. Compartment-specific loss of PKA was reflected by reduced phosphorylation of discrete substrates. In response to 8Br-cAMP treatment, the glycolytic activator PFK-2 was robustly phosphorylated in control animals but not diabetics. Control adult cardiomyocytes cultured in lipid-supplemented media developed similar changes in PKA signaling, suggesting that lipotoxicity is a contributor to diabetes-induced β-adrenergic signaling dysfunction. This work demonstrates that PKA signaling is impaired in diabetes and suggests that treating hyperlipidemia is vital for proper cardiac signaling and function."

GCN5 (KAT2A) is a member of the GNAT (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase) family of HATs. In metazoans this enzyme is found in two functionally distinct coactivator complexes, SAGA (Spt Ada Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and ATAC (Ada Two A-containing).

To better understand how the activity of human (h) hGCN5 is regulated in the two related, but different, HAT complexes we carried out in vitro HAT assays. We compared the activity of hGCN5 alone with its activity when it was part of purified recombinant hATAC or hSAGA HAT modules or endogenous hATAC or hSAGA complexes using histone tail peptides and full-length histones as substrates. We demonstrated that the subunit environment of the HAT complexes into which GCN5 incorporates determines the enhancement of GCN5 activity. On histone peptides we show that all the tested GCN5-containing complexes acetylate mainly histone H3K14. Our results suggest a stronger influence of ADA2b as compared with ADA2a on the activity of GCN5. However, the lysine acetylation specificity of GCN5 on histone tails or full-length histones was not changed when incorporated in the HAT modules of ATAC or SAGA complexes. Our results thus demonstrate that the catalytic activity of GCN5 is stimulated by subunits of the ADA2a- or ADA2b-containing HAT modules and is further increased by incorporation of the distinct HAT modules in the ATAC or SAGA holo-complexes.

Post-translational modifications of histones regulate transcription activation or repression. Nucleosomes composed of a (H3-H4)2 tetramer flanked by two H2A-H2B dimers wrapped by 147 base pairs of DNA play a key role in chromatin compaction (1.Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Twenty-five years of the nucleosome, fundamental particle of the eukaryote chromosome.Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). To loosen chromatin structure and activate gene expression, transcription activators first bind to their cognate DNA binding sites and subsequently recruit multisubunit coactivator complexes. Around enhancers and promoter elements, coactivator complexes can then either reorganize the nucleosomes by using ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors or modify histones covalently. Chromatin-modifying coactivator complexes dynamically deposit and remove post-translational modifications on histones, thus creating or erasing docking surfaces for proteins that recognize histone modifications (2.Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8036) Google Scholar). One of the first histone modifications discovered was acetylation of lysine residues. This modification is thought to activate gene expression by loosening the chromatin structure but also by creating docking surfaces for other proteins and protein complexes (2.Kouzarides T.

Biol. 2011; 7: 503Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) discovered that ySgf29 is also part of this HAT module. Thus, yGcn5 and hGCN5 are subunits of the HAT modules of the respective SAGA complexes, together with yAda2/hADA2b, yAda3/hADA3, and ySgf29/hSGF29. A study combining in vitro acid-urea gel and quantitative mass spectrometry approach to measure the activity of yeast Gcn5 incorporated in the partial HAT module of the ySAGA and Ada complexes containing Gcn5-Ada2-Ada3 showed that Gcn5 acetylated free histone H3 with the following efficiency: H3K14 > H3K23 > H3K9 ≈ H3K18 > H3K27 > H3K36 (23.Cieniewicz A.M.

Purified yeast and human SAGA complexes were shown in vitro to acetylate H3 mainly at position Lys-14, but also Lys-9, Lys-18, and Lys-23 to some extent when using different pre-acetylated H3 tail peptides (24.Grant P.A.

Metazoan GCN5 was identified also as a subunit of a second coactivator HAT complex in Drosophila (26.Guelman S. Suganuma T. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Kiesecker C.L. Kusch T. Anderson S. Yates 3rd, J.R.

Interestingly, the yAda2 protein has two paralogues in metazoans: ADA2a and ADA2b (28.Kusch T. Guelman S. Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L.

In addition to the diversity of GCN5-containing HAT complexes in metazoans, a second level of complexity exists in vertebrate organisms. In vertebrates, another HAT protein called PCAF (p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP)-associated factor, or KAT2B) is present that is 70% identical to GCN5 (30.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V.

Similarly to GCN5, PCAF can acetylate histones H3 and H4 (31.Trievel R.C. Li F.Y. Marmorstein R.

Biochem. 2000; 287: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells no free GCN5 or PCAF is found. Both proteins are always integrated into either the ATAC or SAGA complexes. The presence of GCN5 or PCAF in SAGA or ATAC is mutually exclusive (27.Nagy Z. Riss A. Fujiyama S. Krebs A. Orpinell M. Jansen P. Cohen A. Stunnenberg H.G. Kato S. Tora L.

In contrast, analyses of changes in histone tail acetylation patterns upon knock-out or knockdown of specific ATAC subunits in mammalian cells suggested that ATAC preferentially acetylates histone H3 rather than H4 (27.Nagy Z.

A recent mass spectrometry-based strategy to precisely and accurately quantify histone mark modifications in Drosophila KC cells after RNAi ablation of GCN5 (present in ATAC and SAGA) demonstrated H3 acetylation marks decrease in the following order: H3K9+K14> H3K9 > H3K14 > H3K27 = H3K36 (34.Feller C.

Cell. 2015; 57: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Note that in this study no changes in H4 acetylation were reported after GCN5 knockdown, suggesting potentially redundant action of several other HATs on H4. Interestingly, this compensatory activity in vivo did not occur on H3. Furthermore, knock-out of yeast Gcn5 or knockdown of the ATAC and SAGA HAT module activity in mammalian cells resulted in a significant genome-wide reduction of H3K9ac mark at all active gene promoters (33.Bonnet J. Wang C.Y. Baptista T. Vincent S.D. Hsiao W.C. Stierle M. Kao C.F. Tora L. Devys D. The SAGA coactivator complex acts on the whole transcribed genome and is required for RNA polymerase II transcription.Gene Dev. 2014; 28: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In agreement, deletion of GCN5 and PCAF in mammalian cells specifically and dramatically reduced acetylation on histone H3K9 (40.Jin Q. Yu L.R. Wang L. Zhang Z. Kasper L.H. Lee J.E. Wang C. Brindle P.K. Dent S.Y. Ge K.

In this study we set out to determine how the subunits of ATAC or SAGA HAT complexes regulate the activity of the GCN5 enzyme. To this end we compared the activities of the recombinant GCN5 enzyme in isolation, the GCN5-containing HAT modules of ATAC and SAGA, and the corresponding endogenous holo-complexes. In vitro acetylation assays performed on histone tail peptides, H3/H4 tetramers, and histone octamers as substrates show that GCN5 alone is less active when compared with its activity in the HAT modules or to the endogenous ATAC or SAGA complexes. Thus, the protein partners of GCN5 enhance its activity. The His6-FLAG-hGCN5-expressing construct was described in Demény et al. (41.Demény M.A. Soutoglou E. Nagy Z. Scheer E. Jànoshàzi A.

Recombinant ATAC and SAGA HAT modules were produced using the MultiBac system (42.Berger I. Fitzgerald D.J. Richmond T.J. Baculovirus expression system for heterologous multiprotein complexes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Coding sequences for human GCN5, human ADA2a/b, mouse ADA3, and human SGF29 were inserted by sequence and ligation-independent cloning into the vectors pFL, pIDC, pIDK, and pIDS, respectively (43.Li M.Z. Elledge S.J. Harnessing homologous recombination in vitro to generate recombinant DNA via SLIC.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The 5′ region of the GCN5 gene was engineered to code for a decahistidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site.

Infected insect cells were harvested 72 h post cell arrest by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until further use. Preparation of HeLa cell nuclear extract was described in Demény et al.

His6-FLAG-hGCN5 was purified using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). Antibody-protein G-Sepharose- or M2-agarose-bound protein complexes were washed 3 times with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5 m KCl and twice with IP buffer containing 100 mm KCl. After washing, proteins were eluted by a 1000× excess of the corresponding epitope peptide (for the anti-GCN5 5GC2A6 monoclonal antibody (mAb), MAEPSQAPTPAPAAQPRPLC; for anti-ADA3 pAb 2678, LEGKTGHGPGPGRPKSKN; for anti-ADA2a 2AD2A1 mAb, MDRLGSFSNDPSDKPPC; for anti-TAF10 23TA1H8 mAb, MSCSGSGADPEAAPASAASAC) (see also Fig. 1). Proteins were then visualized by staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the indicated primary antibodies. Chemiluminescence detection was performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).

https://openalex.org/W2289005142,"Satellite cells are muscle-resident stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation to repair injured muscles. However, muscle injury often leads to an ischemic hypoxia environment that impedes satellite cell differentiation and reduces the efficiency of muscle regeneration. Here we performed microarray analyses and identified the basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor Bhlhe40 as a candidate mediator of the myogenic inhibitory effect of hypoxia. Bhlhe40 is strongly induced by hypoxia in satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Overexpression of Bhlhe40 inhibits Myog expression and mimics the effect of hypoxia on myogenesis. Inhibition of Bhlhe40, conversely, up-regulates Myog expression and promotes myogenic differentiation. Importantly, Bhlhe40 knockdown rescues myogenic differentiation under hypoxia. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 binds to the proximal E-boxes of the Myog promoter and reduces the binding affinity and transcriptional activity of MyoD on Myog. Interestingly, hypoxia induces Bhlhe40 expression independent of HIF1α but through a novel p53-dependent signaling pathway. Our study establishes a crucial role of Bhlhe40 in mediating the repressive effect of hypoxia on myogenic differentiation and suggests that inhibition of Bhlhe40 or p53 may facilitate muscle regeneration after ischemic injuries. Satellite cells are muscle-resident stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation to repair injured muscles. However, muscle injury often leads to an ischemic hypoxia environment that impedes satellite cell differentiation and reduces the efficiency of muscle regeneration. Here we performed microarray analyses and identified the basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor Bhlhe40 as a candidate mediator of the myogenic inhibitory effect of hypoxia. Bhlhe40 is strongly induced by hypoxia in satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Overexpression of Bhlhe40 inhibits Myog expression and mimics the effect of hypoxia on myogenesis. Inhibition of Bhlhe40, conversely, up-regulates Myog expression and promotes myogenic differentiation. Importantly, Bhlhe40 knockdown rescues myogenic differentiation under hypoxia. Mechanistically, Bhlhe40 binds to the proximal E-boxes of the Myog promoter and reduces the binding affinity and transcriptional activity of MyoD on Myog. Interestingly, hypoxia induces Bhlhe40 expression independent of HIF1α but through a novel p53-dependent signaling pathway. Our study establishes a crucial role of Bhlhe40 in mediating the repressive effect of hypoxia on myogenic differentiation and suggests that inhibition of Bhlhe40 or p53 may facilitate muscle regeneration after ischemic injuries. Satellite cells reside between the sarcolemma and basement membrane of myofibers (1Mauro A. Satellite cell of skeletal muscle fibers.J. Biophys. Biochem.

Postnatal myogenesis involves activation of quiescent satellite cells, proliferation of the activated satellite cells (called myoblasts), and differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into multinuclear myofibers. This process is orchestrated by several basic helix-loop-helix family myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), 2The abbreviations used are:MRFmyogenic regulatory factorqPCRquantitative PCRKDknockdownPFTPifithrin-α. including Myf5, Myf6, MyoD, and Myog (2Kuang S.

By contrast, knocking out any of these factors impedes postnatal myogenesis (7Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E.

Because of the crucial role of MRFs in myogenesis, physiological stresses that inhibit their expression also impede myogenesis (10Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Adaptive myogenesis under hypoxia.Mol.

Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is one of the physiological stresses repressing myogenesis. A hypoxic microenvironment could result from ischemic insults, cachexia, or acute exposure to high altitude (10Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Adaptive myogenesis under hypoxia.Mol.

A hypoxic culture condition (1% O2) has been shown to repress myogenesis through various mechanisms, such as activating the Notch signaling pathway, inhibiting the PI3K pathway, or accelerating MyoD degradation (16Liu W.

Although hypoxia has been reported to trigger multiple signaling pathways to repress myogenesis, ectopic expression of MyoD or Myog only partly rescues myogenesis (10Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Adaptive myogenesis under hypoxia.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3040-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional factors that modulate the activity of MyoD, Myog, and other MRFs may also have been involved in repressing myogenesis under hypoxia. Bhlhe40 (also called DEC1, STRA13, SHARP2, and Bhlhe2) belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix family and acts as a transcriptional repressor involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, adipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and circadian rhythms (20Liu Y.

Although Bhlhe40 is recognized as a transcriptional repressor in multiple biological processes, its role in myogenesis is controversial. It has been reported that Bhlhe40 is required for postnatal myogenesis through promoting myogenic differentiation (27Sun H. Li L. Vercherat C. Gulbagci N.T. Acharjee S. Li J. Chung T.-K. Thin T.H. Taneja R. Stra13 regulates satellite cell activation by antagonizing notch signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Bhlhe40 has been reported to inhibit myogenic differentiation in other studies (10Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Adaptive myogenesis under hypoxia.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3040-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 28Lecomte V. Meugnier E. Euthine V. Durand C. Freyssenet D. Nemoz G. Rome S. Vidal H. Lefai E. A new role for sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 transcription factors in the regulation of muscle mass and muscle cell differentiation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 30: 1182-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we report Bhlhe40 as a hypoxic responsive transcription repressor that mediates the repression of Myog expression through decreasing the transcriptional activity of MyoD, leading to inhibition of myogenic differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate that hypoxia induces Bhlhe40 through the p53 pathway independent of HIF1α. These data together suggest that, other than the classical MRFs, Bhlhe40 also plays a key role in myogenesis, especially under hypoxic conditions. Mice were from The Jackson Laboratory (HIF1αfl/fl, stock no. 007561; Myf5Cre, stock no. 007893; MyoDiCre, stock no. 014140), and PCR genotyping was carried out using protocols described by the supplier. Mice were housed in the animal facility with free access to water and standard rodent chow. All procedures involving the use of animals were performed in accordance with the guidelines presented by the Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee. Primary myoblasts were isolated from hind limb skeletal muscles that were minced and digested in type I collagenase and dispase B mixture (Roche Applied Science). The digestion was stopped with F-10 Ham's medium containing 17% FBS, and the cells were filtered from debris, centrifuged, and cultured in growth medium (F-10 Ham's medium supplemented with 17% FBS, 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) on uncoated dishes for 3 days, and 5 ml of growth medium was added each day. Then the supernatant was collected, centrifuged, and trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin. After washing off the trypsin using growth medium and centrifugation, primary myoblasts were seeded on collagen-coated dishes, and the growth medium was changed every 2 days. Myoblasts were induced to differentiate on Matrigel-coated dishes and cultured in differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Unless indicated otherwise, primary myoblasts were cultured in normal humidified tissue culture incubators with 5% CO2. For hypoxia treatment (∼1% O2), primary myoblasts were put into gas-tight modular incubator chambers (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) that were flushed with a custom gas mixture containing 5% air, 5% CO2, and 90% N2, 30 p.s.i./min, for 2.5 min each day. The p53 inhibitor Pifithrin-α was purchased from Sigma and used to treat satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts at 5 μm concentration. Three replicates of total RNA extracted from myoblasts cultured under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) or normoxic conditions (21% O2) for 2 days were shipped to Miltenyi Biotec, where the quality of RNA was checked via the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent Technologies). Two replicates of high-quality (RNA integrity number > 8.2) RNA from the normoxic control group or hypoxia-treated group were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 and hybridized to Agilent whole mouse genome oligo microarrays 8 × 60,000 (two-color). Fluorescence signals of the hybridized Agilent oligo microarrays were detected using a DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). Agilent feature extraction software was used to read out and process the microarray image files and to determine feature intensities and ratios. Only spots on both replicates that had the same trend (both up or down) were selected for further analysis using DAVID 6.7 (29Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25331) Google Scholar). The adenovirus with Bhlhe40 insertion was generated using the AdEasy system (30Luo J. Deng Z.-L. Luo X. Tang N. Song W.-X. Chen J. Sharff K.A. Luu H.H. Haydon R.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. He T.-C. A protocol for rapid generation of recombinant adenoviruses using the AdEasy system.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Bhlhe40 ORF was cloned using a pair of primers (5′-CAGCGGCCGCATGGAACGGATCCCCAG and 5′-TTCTCGTGTTAGTCTTTGGTTTCTAAGTTT) and inserted into the pAdTrack-CMV plasmid. The formed pAdTrack-CMV-Bhlhe40 (pAdTrack-CMV as the control) plasmid was digested by PmeI, and then we transfected the DH5a-competent cell with pAdEasy-1. The positive recombinant plasmid was detected by PacI digestion. Then 293A cells (60–70% confluent) in 10-cm culture dishes were transfected with 4 μg of PacI-digested recombinant plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. After 14 days of incubation, the recombinant adenovirus was released by four freeze-thaw-vortex cycles. Two more rounds of infection were adapted to amplify the recombinant virus, and the titers were determined by the expression of GFP. To analyze the influence of Bhlhe40 on myoblasts, myoblasts were treated with adenovirus for 1 day and cultured in virus-free medium for at least one more day. Myoblasts or myotubes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 2% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) for at least 1 h. Then the samples were incubated with primary antibodies (MF20 was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) in blocking buffer overnight. After washing with PBS, the samples were incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 45 min at room temperature. Fluorescent images were captured using a Leica DM 6000B fluorescence microscope. As the adenoviral vector contains the green fluorescence protein gene, cells transduced with adenoviral vectors show green fluorescence. We calculated the number of different stainings only in cells with green fluorescence. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent according to the protocols of the manufacturer. RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove contaminating genomic DNA. The purity and concentration of total RNA were measured by Nanodrop 3000 (Thermo Fisher). Random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were used to convert RNA into cDNA. Real-time PCR was performed using a Roche Lightcycler 480 PCR system with SYBR Green Master Mix and gene-specific primers (18S, 5′-AACGGTCTAGACAACAAGCTG and 5′-AGTGGTCTTGGTGTGCTGAC; MyoD, 5′-GGCTACGACACCGCCTACTA and 5′-CGACTCTGGTGGTGCATCTG; Myog, 5′-TGCCCAGTGAATGCAACTCC and 5′-TTGGGCATGGTTTCGTCTGG; p53, 5′-ACTCAGACTGACTGCCTCTG and 5′-TCTCAGCCCTGAAGTCATAA; and Bhlhe40, 5′-CCCACATGTACCAAGTGTAC and 5′-CCTTCAGCTGGGCAATGCAC). The Ct value of 18S rRNA was used as an internal control, and the 2−ΔΔCT method was used to analyze the relative mRNA expression of various genes (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2 (t) (−ΔΔ c) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123336) Google Scholar). Cultured myoblasts were washed with PBS and homogenized with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce BCA protein assay reagent. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and incubated with specific primary antibodies. MyoD (catalog no. M318), Myog (catalog no. F5D), and GAPDH (catalog no. 6C5) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Bhlhe40/Sharp2 (catalog no. ab23794) was from Abcam, FLAG (catalog no. 2368) was from Cell Signaling Technology, and p53 (catalog no. bs-0033R) was from Bioss. Immunodetection was performed using ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce) and detected with a FluoChem R imaging system (ProteinSimple). To deplete endogenous Bhlhe40, the shRNA target 5′-GCGAGGTTACAGTGTTTATA corresponding to the 3′ UTR of Bhlhe40 was chosen according to the description in Ref. 32Hu G. Chen J. A genome-wide regulatory network identifies key transcription factors for memory CD8(+) T-cell development.Nat. Comms. 2013; 4: 2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar. The Plko.1-Bhlhe40 shRNA was purchased from Thermo Scientific (catalog no. TRCN0000081853). The protocol to generate lentivirus was modified on the basis of Ref. 33Liu X. Lei M. Erikson R.L. Normal cells, but not cancer cells, survive severe PLK1 depletion.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2093-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar. Briefly, 293T cells (80–90% confluent) in collagen-coated 10-cm culture dishes were co-transfected with 4 μg of pLKO.1-Bhlhe40shRNA or pLKO.1 (as the control), 4 μg of pHR′-CMV-ΔR8.20vpr, and 2 μg of pHR′-CMV-VSV-G using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Viruses were harvested 4 times every 12 h from 24 h post-transfection and filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter. Then the viruses were concentrated at 22,000 rpm for 2 h in a Sorvall T 647.5 rotor. The viral pellets were suspended in 100 μl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 130 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Along with transduction of Bhlhe40shRNA to myoblast, Polybrene (10 μg/ml) and HEPES (10 mm) were added to increase the transduction efficiency. Puromycin (1 μg/ml) was used to select the infected myoblasts 1 day post-infection. C2C12 cells were electroporated with pLKO.1-Bhlhe40shRNA or pLKO.1 (1 μg/106 cells). Two days after electroporation, puromycin (1 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. Seven to ten days after puromycin selection, a single cell clone was detached by trypsin (0.25×) and transferred to 12-well plates. When the cell confluency was over 70%, cells were passaged, and some of them were used to do RNA extraction and Bhlhe40 expression detection. The commercial Bhlhe40 antibody was not suitable for chromatin immunoprecipitation, so we generated the Bhlhe40-FLAG plasmid by cloning the Bhlhe40 gene into the pCMV-FLAG-2b plasmid and electroporated Bhlhe40-FLAG into primary myoblasts. As a control, 1 day after electroporation, we added Bhlhe40 shRNA lentivirus to the electroporated primary myoblasts. The treated primary myoblasts were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in Ham's F-10 medium for 10 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min at room temperature, after which cells were scraped into SDS lysis buffer. The cells were further sonicated and diluted for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were eluted and reverse-cross-linked overnight at 65 °C. DNA fragments were purified using the Cycle Pure kit (Omega), and the Myog promoter E1/E2 region (5′-GAATCACATGTAATCCACTGGA and 5′-ACGCCAACTGCTGGGTGCCA) was quantified by qPCR. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. p values were calculated using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. p <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To identify hypoxia-regulated genes in an unbiased manner, we performed a microarray analysis of primary myoblasts cultured under hypoxia (1% O2) or normoxia. This analysis identified 865 genes that were up- or down-regulated at least 2-fold (-fold change ≥ 2 and p ≤ 0.01) by hypoxia in both replicates (Fig. 1A). Of these, 641 genes (515 protein-coding genes and 126 lncRNAs or non-annotated genes) were up-regulated, and 224 genes (173 protein-coding genes and 51 long non-coding RNAs or non-annotated genes) were down-regulated (Fig. 1A). Gene ontology analysis shows that the top two categories of up-regulated genes are related to the cell cycle and metabolic process and that the top two categories of down-regulated genes are related to the protein catabolic process and muscle organ development (data not shown). Selective cohorts of genes that were up- or down-regulated by hypoxia are listed in the heat map in Fig. 1B. Particularly, many genes related to glycolysis and HIF1α signaling were up-regulated, whereas many genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and muscle organ development were down-regulated (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with the important role of O2 in oxidative phosphorylation and the known function of hypoxia in activating HIF1α signaling and inhibiting myogenesis. Interestingly, we found that hypoxia also activated the p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 1B), presumably to protect myoblasts from oxidative stress-induced cell death. These results demonstrate the validity of our microarray analysis. We next focused on transcriptional factors that are activated by hypoxia to mediate its effect on myogenesis. Among the top 50 hypoxia up-regulated genes, we identified Bhlhe40, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix family transcriptional factors, whose expression was up-regulated 7.7-fold (Fig. 1C). Western blotting confirmed that the protein level of Bhlhe40 was also increased by hypoxia (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, another closely related member of this family, Bhlhe41, was also up-regulated 5.3-fold (data not shown). Because basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factors such as Myf5, MyoD, and Myog are important regulators of myogenesis, we decided to focus the rest of our study on Bhlhe40, whose expression is induced more robustly than Bhlhe41 by hypoxia (Fig. 1C). We and others have reported previously that hypoxia inhibits the expression of Myog and myogenic differentiation (10Yun Z. Lin Q. Giaccia A.J. Adaptive myogenesis under hypoxia.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3040-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Liu W. Wen Y. Bi P. Lai X. Liu X.S. Liu X. Kuang S. Hypoxia promotes satellite cell self-renewal and enhances the efficiency of myoblast transplantation.Development. 2012; 139: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this effect is mediated by Bhlhe40, we first used adenovirus to overexpress Bhlhe40 in primary myoblasts. To examine whether Bhlhe40 affects myogenic differentiation, myoblasts transduced with GFP-expressing (as a control) or Bhlhe40-expressing adenovirus were induced to differentiate by serum withdrawal. Within 1 day after induced differentiation, the control myoblasts had already displayed an obviously elongated morphology, a hallmark of differentiation (Fig. 2A, top panels). In contrast, the Bhlhe40-overexpressing (BhlheOE) myoblasts were mostly still spherical (Fig. 2A, bottom panels), indicative of a differentiation defect. On day 3 after induced differentiation, more than 70% of the control myoblasts formed uniformly aligned multinucleated myotubes, whereas the BhlheOE myoblasts formed only few poorly aligned myotubes (Fig. 2B). We further quantified the differentiation index, which measures the fraction of myonuclei that are located in myosin heavy chain (MF20+)-expressing cells. Although more than 40% of nuclei in the control group were located in MF20+ cells, only 15% of nuclei in the BhlheOE group were MF20+ (Fig. 2C). At the molecular level, Bhlhe40 mRNA and its protein expression were both elevated in BhlheOE myoblasts compared with control myoblasts (Fig. 2, D and E). Importantly, BhlheOE led to a 30% reduction in Myog mRNA (Fig. 2D) and nearly abolished the expression of Myog at the protein level (Fig. 2E), consistent with the observed defects in myogenic differentiation. Interestingly, the mRNA and protein expression of MyoD was not affected by BhlheOE (Fig. 2, D and E). These results indicate that Bhlhe40 inhibits the Myog-driven terminal differentiation process without altering the expression of MyoD. We next performed a Bhlhe40 loss-of-function study using lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown. Primary myoblasts were treated with lentivirus for 2 days and selected in puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 2 additional days. The expression of Bhlhe40 in the shRNA knockdown (BhlheKD) group was only 40% of that in the GFP shRNA control group (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis confirmed that the increased Myog expression was associated with a reduction in Bhlhe40 protein (Fig. 3B). We further selected two clones of single cell-derived C2C12 myoblasts (KD1 and KD2) after transfection with the pLKO.1-Bhlhe40 shRNA plasmid. The mRNA level of Bhlhe40 in the two clones of KD myoblasts was only 20–40% of that in control myoblasts (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the results obtained with a mixture of satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts, Myog expression was increased five to seven times in the Bhlhe40 KD cell clones (Fig. 3D). Myog protein levels were also increased robustly in the two clones of KD myoblasts compared with the control myoblasts (Fig. 3E). The abundance of Myog+ cells under proliferation conditions was 5–21 times higher in the two KD clones than in the control myoblasts (Fig. 3, F and G). In addition, MF20+ cells emerged in the two KD clones but were absent in the control myoblasts (Fig. 3F). We further induced the BhlheKD primary myoblasts to differentiate after treatment with lentivirus for 2 days and selection in puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 2 additional days. 24 h (day 1) after induced differentiation, BhlheKD myoblasts and control myoblasts showed a comparable morphology and differentiation index (Fig. 3, H, top panels, and I). 72 h (day 3) after induced differentiation, although 93% of nuclei in the control group were located in MF20+ cells, only 65% of nuclei in the BhlheKD group were in MF20+ cells (Fig. 3, H, top panels, and I). The fusion index was also lower in BhlheKD than in control myoblasts (Fig. 3J). Interestingly, the protein levels of Bhlhe40 increased gradually during normal differentiation (Fig. 3K). These data suggest that Bhlhe40 is dynamically regulated during myogenesis and that blockage of its expression leads to precocious myogenic differentiation, resu"

The intrinsic processivity (P(Intr)) of cellulases has been shown to be governed by the rate constant of dissociation from polymer chain (koff). However, the reported koff values of cellulases are strongly dependent on the method used for their measurement. Here, we developed a new method for determining koff, based on measuring the exchange rate of the enzyme between a non-labeled and a (14)C-labeled polymeric substrate. The method was applied to the study of the processive chitinase ChiA from Serratia marcescens. In parallel, ChiA variants with weaker binding of the N-acetylglucosamine unit either in substrate-binding site -3 (ChiA-W167A) or the product-binding site +1 (ChiA-W275A) were studied. Both ChiA variants showed increased off-rates and lower apparent processivity on α-chitin. The rate of the production of insoluble reducing groups on the reduced α-chitin was an order of magnitude higher than koff, suggesting that the enzyme can initiate several processive runs without leaving the substrate. On crystalline chitin, the general activity of the wild type enzyme was higher, and the difference was magnifying with hydrolysis time. On amorphous chitin, the variants clearly outperformed the wild type. A model is proposed whereby strong interactions with polymer in the substrate-binding sites (low off-rates) and strong binding of the product in the product-binding sites (high pushing potential) are required for the removal of obstacles, like disintegration of chitin microfibrils."

However, the mechanism(s) through which glucosamine modulates different T cell subsets and diseases remain unclear. We demonstrate that glucosamine impedes Th1, Th2, and iTreg but promotes Th17 differentiation through down-regulating N-linked glycosylation of CD25 and subsequently inhibiting its downstream Stat5 signaling in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of glucosamine on T helper cell differentiation was similar to that induced by anti-IL-2 treatment, further supporting an IL-2 signaling-dependent modulation. Interestingly, excess glucose rescued this glucosamine-mediated regulation, suggesting a functional competition between glucose and glucosamine. High-dose glucosamine significantly decreased Glut1 N-glycosylation in Th1-polarized cells. This finding suggests that both down-regulated IL-2 signaling and Glut1-dependent glycolytic metabolism contribute to the inhibition of Th1 differentiation by glucosamine. Finally, glucosamine treatment inhibited Th1 cells in vivo, prolonged the survival of islet grafts in diabetic recipients, and exacerbated the severity of EAE. Taken together, our results indicate that glucosamine interferes with N-glycosylation of CD25, and thereby attenuates IL-2 downstream signaling. These effects suggest that glucosamine may be an important modulator of T cell differentiation and immune homeostasis. Glucosamine has immunomodulatory effects on autoimmune diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2287386619,"The alternative pathway of complement is an important part of the innate immunity response against foreign particles invading the human body. To avoid damage to host cells, it needs to be efficiently down-regulated by plasma factor H (FH) as exemplified by various diseases caused by mutations in its domains 19–20 (FH19–20) and 5–7 (FH5–7). These regions are also the main interaction sites for microbial pathogens that bind host FH to evade complement attack. We previously showed that inhibition of FH binding by a recombinant FH5–7 construct impairs survival of FH binding pathogens in human blood. In this study we found that upon exposure to full blood, the addition of FH5–7 reduces survival of, surprisingly, also those microbes that are not able to bind FH. This effect was mediated by inhibition of complement regulation and subsequently enhanced neutrophil phagocytosis by FH5–7. We found that although FH5–7 does not reduce complement regulation in the actual fluid phase of plasma, it reduces regulation on HDL particles in plasma. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry we revealed that FH interacts with serum apolipoprotein E (apoE) via FH5–7 domains. Furthermore, binding of FH5–7 to HDL was dependent on the concentration of apoE on the HDL particles. These findings explain why the addition of FH5–7 to plasma leads to excessive complement activation and phagocytosis of microbes in full anticoagulated blood.

A key player in the humoral innate immune response is the complement system that quickly attacks microbes and foreign particles invading the human body. The complement cascade can be activated through three pathways, the classical, alternative (AP), 2The abbreviations used are: APalternative pathway of complementiC3binactive C3bAMDage related macular degenerationDDDdense deposit diseaseFHfactor HGAGglycosaminoglycanHISheat-inactivated serumNHSnormal human serumMFmultiplication factor. and lectin pathways. Activation of any of the three pathways leads to cleavage of C3 and covalent surface deposition of the C3b fragment capable of forming an enzyme with factor B. C3b and its degradation fragments, inactive C3b (iC3b) and C3dg, act as important opsonins recognized by specific complement receptors on phagocytes.

AP is constantly active in plasma, leading to low grade challenge to all plasma-exposed particles. Activation proceeds rapidly through amplification on surfaces that are missing efficient regulators. Factor H (FH) is the main AP regulator in plasma. It is an elongated molecule composed of 20 domains. The N-terminal domains 1–4 are responsible for FH regulatory activity, whereas domains 19–20 on the C-terminal end are responsible for the self-surface recognition (1.Pangburn M.K. Cutting edge: localization of the host recognition functions of complement factor H at the carboxyl-terminal: implications for hemolytic uremic syndrome.J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4702-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Domain FH19 binds to surface-attached C3b, whereas FH20 interacts with sialic acids and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present on self-surfaces (2.Kajander T. Lehtinen M.J. Hyvärinen S. Bhattacharjee A.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2897-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this way, FH discriminates host self-surfaces from non-self ones. Another important surface recognition site of FH is located within domains 6–7, and it mediates the interaction with ligands such as sulfated GAGs, heparin, and C-reactive protein (3.Blackmore T.K. Sadlon T.A. Ward H.M. Lublin D.M. Gordon D.L. Identification of a heparin binding domain in the seventh short consensus repeat of complement factor H.J.

When bound on C3b, FH acts as a cofactor for factor I in the inactivation of C3b to iC3b. Simultaneously, it inhibits binding of factor B to C3b (5.Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Human complement C3b inactivator: isolation, characterization, and demonstration of an absolute requirement for the serum protein β1H for cleavage of C3b and C4b in solution.J. Exp.

Activation of AP in serum or plasma is spontaneous due to hydrolysis or mechanical activation of C3. FH is the main regulator keeping this spontaneous activation in check (8.Pangburn M.K. Schreiber R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Formation of the initial C3 convertase of the alternative complement pathway. Acquisition of C3b-like activities by spontaneous hydrolysis of the putative thioester in native C3.J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This is obvious as depletion of plasma/serum from FH or blockage of FH by autoantibodies causes dysregulation of AP leading to loss of active complement by overconsumption within <30 min (9.Meri S. Koistinen V. Miettinen A. Törnroth T. Seppälä I.J. Activation of the alternative pathway of complement by monoclonal lambda light chains in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.J. Exp.

Nephritogenic lambda light chain dimer: a unique human miniautoantibody against complement factor H.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4590-4596PubMed Google Scholar). Although the AP activation is based on spontaneous low grade process without a need for a trigger, the activation can be enhanced by an imbalance between activation and regulation, e.g. by numerous C3b deposits on protein complexes in serum/plasma (11.Ramadass M. Ghebrehiwet B. Smith R.J. Kew R.R. Generation of multiple fluid-phase C3b:plasma protein complexes during complement activation: possible implications in C3 glomerulopathies.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 1220-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become clear that AP dysregulation is a central event in development of several complement-related diseases caused by mutations or polymorphisms in domains FH5–7 and FH19–20. Although mutations in FH19–20 are associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome the Y402H polymorphism in domain 7 is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (12.Richards A.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several other microbial pathogens have also been shown to use FH for immune evasion via two regions, FH6–7 and FH19–20 (17.Ferreira V.P. Pangburn M.K. Cortés C. Complement control protein factor H: the good, the bad, and the inadequate.Mol. Immunol. 2010; 47: 2187-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). At least Neisseria meningitidis and most of the pathogenic S. pyogenes strains interact only with the FH5–7 region on FH, thereby increasing their immune evasion and survival in serum (18.Haapasalo K. Vuopio J. Syrjänen J. Suvilehto J. Massinen S. Karppelin M. Järvelä I. Meri S. Kere J. Jokiranta T.S. Acquisition of complement factor H is important for pathogenesis of Streptococcus pyogenes infections: evidence from bacterial in vitro survival and human genetic association.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reasons why several microbes acquire FH particularly via FH5–7 or why mutations or polymorphisms in this region lead to complement related inflammatory diseases are not fully understood. We started the current study by analyzing the importance of FH5–7 for microbial immune evasion. In those analyses we surprisingly found out that the addition of FH5–7 to anticoagulated full blood or plasma led to impaired survival of both the microbes that bind FH and those that do not. This led us to find that FH interacts via domains 5–7 with apoE (apolipoprotein E)-associated HDL particles. Incubation of FH5–7 in human plasma led to excessive AP activation and significant reduction in iC3b formation, suggesting that FH binding on HDL-associated apoE via domains 5–7 has an important regulatory role. We show that binding of FH to apoE on HDL particles prevents excessive AP activation on those particles and, therefore, in plasma in general. Therefore, it seems that binding of FH via FH5–7 to microbes mimics acquisition of FH onto the host HDL particles present in plasma. Cloning and Pichia pastoris expression of the recombinant fragments FH5–7, histidine-tagged FH5–7, and FH19–20 has been described earlier (16.Haapasalo K. Jarva H. Siljander T. Tewodros W.

FH5–7 fragments were further purified by passing through HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep-grade gel filtration column (GE healthcare) in 300 mm PBS, pH 7.0, and concentrated using heparin affinity chromatography. FH and C3 proteins were isolated from human plasma as described earlier (16.Haapasalo K. Jarva H. Siljander T. Tewodros W. Vuopio-Varkila J. Jokiranta T.S.

Weisgraber (Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA). The cloning, expression of apoE3 in the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bacterial system, and purification is described elsewhere (19.Morrow J.A. Arnold K.S. Weisgraber K.H.

Thrombin digestion was performed at 22 °C for 30 min at a ratio of 1:500 (thrombin:apoE, w/w). Delipidation of apoE3 was carried out as described (20.Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Isolation and characterization of apolipoprotein E.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). HDL with and without apoE was purified by heparin-affinity chromatography. A HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with 5 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Solid MnCl2 was added to the HDL solution just before application to the column, to give a final Mn2+ concentration of 25 mm. The column was equilibrated, and 25 mm MnCl2 and HDL were applied to the column. Non-bound fractions to heparin represented the apoE-free HDL particles. The heparin-bound apoE-containing HDL was detached via elution with 5 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. ApoE was analyzed in isolated HDL pools by ELISA (21.Siggins S. Jauhiainen M. Olkkonen V.M.

To estimate the amount of HDL particles in the fluorometric HDL binding assay, the concentrations of HDL samples are expressed as the equivalent concentration of cholesterol in μg/ml. Total cholesterol concentrations were determined by using Infinity™ cholesterol reagent (Sigma). The samples were stored at +4 °C before use. All plasmids and recombinant adenoviruses containing the wild-type apoE4, apoE2 and mutated human apoE4 genes were constructed as described previously (22.Li X. Kypreos K. Zanni E.E. Zannis V.

Biochem. 1981; 117: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the labeled proteins were 1–2 × 107 cpm/μg. Each bacterial strain (3 × 107 log phase bacteria/reaction) and/or neutrophils (1 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with 30,000 cpm of radiolabeled protein in 100 μl of veronal-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin at 37 °C for 30 min in a shaking incubator (800 rpm). For preopsonization, bacteria were incubated with 20% normal human serum (NHS) pool obtained from six-eight healthy donors and washed three times with PBS before the assay. Non-opsonized S. pyogenes strains were used as a negative (emm8) and positive (st369) controls for FH/FH5–7 binding. After incubation the reaction mixtures were centrifuged 10,000 × g for 3 min through 20% sucrose, and the radioactivity of each pellet and supernatant was measured with a gamma counter. The ratios of bound (pellet) to total activity (pellet + supernatant) were calculated. The relative binding was counted as the percentage of the cpm obtained using the positive control strain (st369). For the radio ligand binding assay (16.Haapasalo K. Jarva H. Siljander T. Tewodros W.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 96-well polysorp (Nunc, Thermo Scientific) plates were coated with 7 μg/ml FH5–7 or full-length FH and incubated with 0.9, 0.3, and 0.1 μm apoE, FH, and FH5–7 or BSA and 75,000 cpm of 125I-labeled apoE protein. The 96-well maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated with 7 μg/ml apoE4 fragments or BSA and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS-T. Wells were incubated with 10 μg/ml FH5–7 at room temperature for 60 min. Thereafter wells were incubated with goat anti-FH (Calbiochem) and with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Between each step the wells were washed with PBS-T. After incubations TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate was added, and the reaction was stopped with 1 m H2SO4. The absorbance A450 was measured. Full-length FH and the recombinant FH5–7 was labeled with FITC (Sigma) by incubating 10 μm concentrations of the protein with 10 μg/ml FITC in 1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.6, for 2 h at 4 °C followed with 1 h of incubation with 50 mm NH4Cl. Labeled proteins were separated from unbound FITC using a desalting column. 50 μg of FITC-labeled FH or FH5–7 was incubated with 250 μl of lipoprotein particles for 1 h at 37 °C before loading the samples into a Superdex 200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare). FITC-FH only was loaded to the column to separate the elution profile of the 155-kDa molecule from HDL. Protein contents of the eluted samples were analyzed at A280 using ÄKTA explorer (Amersham Biosciences), and the fluorescence of the collected fractions were measured in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Fluostar Omega, BMG). Overnight-grown bacterial culture diluted to a concentration of A600 = 1.0 (1 × 109 cfu/ml) were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimide-fluorescein (Thermo scientific) in 0.1 m Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.6, for 2 h at 4 °C in the dark, where after the labeled bacteria were washed twice. 1 × 106 cfu bacteria were incubated in 1 ml of lepirudin anticoagulated blood or in lepirudin anticoagulated blood cells where the plasma was replaced with heat-inactivated serum (HIS) by centrifugation. Each sample contained either PBS, 1.9 μm FH5–7, or FH19–20. For analyzing the dose dependence, FH5–7 concentrations were 0–15 μm. The samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in polystyrene round-bottom tubes (Falcon, BD Biosciences) under vigorous shaking. Phagocytosis was stopped on ice, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 × g. The erythrocytes were lysed twice with 900 μl of ice cold water for 45 s after which 100 μl of 1.5 m PBS was added. Thereafter, the cells were washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS before counting the fluorescence of 2,000–10,000 neutrophils in each sample using FACS. Cells were gated by their characteristic forward and side scatter profiles. Neutrophils were isolated from hirudin-anticoagulated peripheral blood samples (MP 0600 Hirudin Blood tubes Multiplate; Verum Diagnostica GmbH) by using a histopaque gradient as described previously (25.Troelstra A. Giepmans B.N. Van Kessel K.P. Lichenstein H.S. Verhoef J. Van Strijp J.A. Dual effects of soluble CD14 on LPS priming of neutrophils.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cfu/ml of N-hydroxysuccinimide-fluorescein-labeled bacteria were mixed with 2–4 × 104 neutrophils in 0.05% human serum albumin, RPMI with or without 20% NHS containing either PBS, 0.9 μm FH5–7, FH19–20, or FH. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in polystyrene round-bottom tubes under vigorous shaking. The samples were washed and fixed similarly as in the ex vivo assay before counting the fluorescence of 2000 neutrophils in each sample. C3b deposition assay was done as previously described (16.Haapasalo K. Jarva H. Siljander T. Tewodros W. Vuopio-Varkila J. Jokiranta T.S. Complement factor H allotype 402H is associated with increased C3b opsonization and phagocytosis of Streptococcus pyogenes.Mol.

The reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and the radioactivity of both the pellet and supernatant was counted with a gamma counter (Wallac). PBS or various concentrations of FH5–7, FH19–20, or BSA were incubated with 65% hirudin-anticoagulated blood obtained from healthy volunteers for 30 min at 37 °C under continuous rotation, where after the reactions were stopped with 10 mm EDTA. The samples were centrifuged, and the plasma was separated from the pellet. Plasma samples were analyzed immediately or stored at −70 °C before the assays. The formation of soluble C5b-9 was analyzed by ELISA as described earlier (18.Haapasalo K. Vuopio J. Syrjänen J. Suvilehto J. Massinen S. Karppelin M. Järvelä I. Meri S. Kere J. Jokiranta T.S.

The 96-well plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated with 2 μg/ml anti-C9 neoepitope antibody WU13-15 (Hycult Biotech) in 100 μl of 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 10.6. After blocking with 0.5% BSA, the 1:400-diluted plasma samples were added. After incubation the wells were incubated with goat anti-C7 (Organon Teknika) and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Wells were washed with PBS-T between each step. Finally, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (Dako) was added, the reaction was stopped with 0.5 m H2SO4, and absorbance of each sample was detected at 490 nm. Formation of C3a was analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1:2500 diluted plasma samples (MicroVue C3a Plus EIA, Quidel). The amount of iC3b was analyzed by ELISA. The 96-well maxisorp plates were coated with 3 μg/ml goat anti-C3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the plasma samples. iC3b was detected with iC3b neoantigen (Serotech) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The experiments were performed two or three times using two or three parallel samples, and the relative formation of complement activation marker in each sample was counted as the percentage of the highest value obtained in the assay. 0.2 mg of purified histidine-tagged FH5–7 was immobilized on HisTrap HP 1-ml column (GE Healthcare). After washing the column with 5 ml of 75 mm PBS, 10 ml of 10% NHS was run through the column. The column was then washed with 5 ml of 75 mm PBS and eluted with a 75 mm PBS, 75 mm PBS/2 m NaCl gradient. An assay without FH5–7 coupling was used to control nonspecific binding of serum proteins to the column. Next the column was equilibrated with 5 ml of 50 mm imidazole followed by elution with a 50–300 mm imidazole gradient. The collected fractions were run into SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, and the eluted proteins were detected by silver staining. The band was cut off the gel and reduced, alkylated, and in-gel trypsin-digested (PMID: 17406544). The resulting peptides were purified by reversed-phase chromatography columns (C18 material, eluted with 50% CH3CN, 0.1% TFA) (PMID: 23602568). The dried peptides were reconstituted (1% CH3CN, 0.1% TFA), and the MS analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Elite ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using Xcalibur Version 2.7.1 coupled to a Thermo Scientific nLCII nanoflow HPLC system.

https://openalex.org/W1876042610,"We report new examples of Cenozoic cold-seep communities from Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad, and Venezuela, and attempt to improve the stratigraphic dating of Cenozoic Caribbean seep communities using strontium isotope stratigraphy. Two seep faunas are distinguished in Barbados: the late Eocene mudstone-hosted 'Joes River fauna' consists mainly of large lucinid bivalves and tall abyssochrysoid gastropods, and the early Miocene carbonate-hosted 'Bath Cliffs fauna' containing the vesicomyid Pleurophopsis, the mytilid Bathymodiolus and small gastropods. Two new Oligocene seep communities from the Sinú River basin in Colombia consist of lucinid bivalves including Elongatolucina, thyasirid and solemyid bivalves, and Pleurophopsis. A new early Miocene seep community from Cuba includes Pleurophopsis and the large lucinid Meganodontia. Strontium isotope stratigraphy suggests an Eocene age for the Cuban Elmira asphalt mine seep community, making it the oldest in the Caribbean region. A new basal Pliocene seep fauna from the Dominican Republic is characterized by the large lucinid Anodontia (Pegophysema). In Trinidad we distinguish two types of seep faunas: the mudstone-hosted Godineau River fauna consisting mainly of lucinid bivalves, and the limestone-hosted Freeman's Bay fauna consisting chiefly of Pleurophopsis, Bathymodiolus, and small gastropods; they are all dated as late Miocene. Four new seep communities of Oligocene to Miocene age are reported from Venezuela. They consist mainly of large globular lucinid bivalves including Meganodontia, and moderately sized vesicomyid bivalves. After the late Miocene many large and typical 'Cenozoic' lucinid genera disappeared from the Caribbean seeps and are today known only from the central Indo-Pacific Ocean. We speculate that the increasingly oligotrophic conditions in the Caribbean Sea after the closure of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene may have been unfavorable for such large lucinids because they are only facultative chemosymbiotic and need to derive a significant proportion of their nutrition from suspended organic matter."
https://openalex.org/W2193533210,"MageB2 belongs to the melanoma antigen gene (MAGE-I) family of tumor-specific antigens. Expression of this gene has been detected in human tumors of different origins. However, little is known about the protein function and how its expression affects tumor cell phenotypes. In this work, we found that human MageB2 protein promotes tumor cell proliferation in a p53-independent fashion, as observed both in cultured cells and growing tumors in mice. Gene expression analysis showed that MageB2 enhances the activity of E2F transcription factors. Mechanistically, the activation of E2Fs is related to the ability of MageB2 to interact with the E2F inhibitor HDAC1. Cellular distribution of MageB2 protein includes the nucleoli. Nevertheless, ribotoxic drugs rapidly promote its nucleolar exit. We show that MageB2 counteracts E2F inhibition by ribosomal proteins independently of Mdm2 expression. Importantly, MageB2 plays a critical role in impairing cell cycle arrest in response to Actinomycin D. The data presented here support a relevant function for human MageB2 in cancer cells both under cycling and stressed conditions, presenting a distinct functional feature with respect to other characterized MAGE-I proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2195371949,"Depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ stores activates store-operated channels (SOCs) composed of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) 1 proteins in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which contribute to important cellular functions. We have previously shown that PKC is obligatory for activation of TRPC1 SOCs in VSMCs, and the present study investigates if the classic phosphoinositol signaling pathway involving Gαq-mediated PLC activity is responsible for driving PKC-dependent channel gating. The G-protein inhibitor GDP-β-S, anti-Gαq antibodies, the PLC inhibitor U73122, and the PKC inhibitor GF109203X all inhibited activation of TRPC 1 SOCs, and U73122 and GF109203X also reduced store-operated PKC-dependent phosphorylation of TRPC1 proteins. Three distinct SR Ca2+ store-depleting agents, 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, cyclopiazonic acid, and N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamineed, induced trans-locations of the fluorescent biosensor GFP-PLCδ1-PH from the cell membrane to the cytosol, which were inhibited by U73122. Knockdown of PLCβ1 with small hairpin RNA reduced both store-operated PLC activity and stimulation of TRPC1 SOCs. Immunoprecipitation studies and proximity ligation assays revealed that store depletion induced interactions between TRPC 1 and Gαq, and TRPC 1 andPLCβ1. We propose a novel activation mechanism for TRPC 1 SOCs in VSMCs, in which store depletion induces formation of TRPC1-Gαq-PLCβ1 complexes that lead to PKC stimulation and channel gating.—Shi, J., Miralles, F., Birnbaumer, L., Large, W.

https://openalex.org/W2262598668,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is well-known for inducing vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease after vaccination of young children with formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) in alum formulation. Here, we investigated alum adjuvant effects on protection and disease after FI-RSV immunization with or without alum in comparison with live RSV reinfections. Despite viral clearance, live RSV reinfections caused weight loss and substantial pulmonary inflammation probably due to high levels of RSV specific IFN-γ+IL4-, IFN-γ-TNF-α+, IFN-γ+TNF-α- effector CD4 and CD8 T cells. Alum adjuvant significantly improved protection as evidenced by effective viral clearance compared to unadjuvanted FI-RSV. However, in contrast to unadjuvanted FI-RSV, alum-adjuvanted FI-RSV (FI-RSV-A) induced severe vaccine-enhanced RSV disease including weight loss, eosinophilia, and lung histopathology. Alum adjuvant in the FI-RSV-A was found to be mainly responsible for inducing high levels of RSV-specific IFN-γ-IL4+, IFN-γ-TNF-α+ CD4+ T cells, and proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-4 as well as B220+ plasmacytoid and CD4+ dendritic cells, and inhibiting the induction of IFN-γ+CD8 T cells. This study suggests that alum adjuvant in FI-RSV vaccines increases immunogenicity and viral clearance but also induces atypical T helper CD4+ T cells and multiple inflammatory dendritic cell subsets responsible for vaccine-enhanced severe RSV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2253645635,"Germline mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) induce mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, depletion, and decrease oxidative phosphorylation. Earlier, we identified somatic mutations in POLG1 and the contribution of these mutations in human cancer. However, a role for germline variations in POLG1 in human cancers is unknown. In this study, we examined a role for disease associated germline variants of POLG1, POLG1 gene expression, copy number variation and regulation in human cancers. We analyzed the mutations, expression and copy number variation in POLG1 in several cancer databases and validated the analyses in primary breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines. We discovered 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine led epigenetic regulation of POLG1, mtDNA-encoded genes and increased mitochondrial respiration. We conducted comprehensive race based bioinformatics analyses of POLG1 gene in more than 33,000 European-Americans and 5,000 African-Americans. We identified a mitochondrial disease causing missense variation in polymerase domain of POLG1 protein at amino acid 1143 (E1143G) to be 25 times more prevalent in European-Americans (allele frequency 0.03777) when compared to African-American (allele frequency 0.00151) population. We identified T251I and P587L missense variations in exonuclease and linker region of POLG1 also to be more prevalent in European-Americans. Expression of these variants increased glucose consumption, decreased ATP production and increased matrigel invasion. Interestingly, conditional expression of these variants revealed that matrigel invasion properties conferred by these germline variants were reversible suggesting a role of epigenetic regulators. Indeed, we identified a set of miRNA whose expression was reversible after variant expression was turned off. Together, our studies demonstrate altered genetic and epigenetic regulation of POLG1 in human cancers and suggest a role for POLG1 germline variants in promoting tumorigenic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2264490550,"In cellular membranes, different lipid species are heterogeneously distributed forming domains with different characteristics. Ordered domains are tightly packed with cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and saturated fatty acids, whereas disordered domains contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. Our laboratory has shown that membrane heterogeneity affects the organization of cytochrome P450s and their cognate redox partner, the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Despite the high degree of sequence similarity, CYP1A1 was found to localize to disordered regions, whereas CYP1A2 resided in ordered domains. We hypothesized that regions of amino acid sequence variability may contain signal motifs that direct CYP1A proteins into ordered or disordered domains. Thus, chimeric constructs of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were created, and their localization was tested in HEK293T cells. CYP1A2, containing the N-terminal regions from CYP1A1, no longer localized in ordered domains, whereas the N terminus of CYP1A2 partially directed CYP1A1 into ordered regions. In addition, intact CYP1A2 containing a 206-302-residue peptide segment of CYP1A1 had less affinity to bind to ordered microdomains. After expression, the catalytic activity of CYP1A2 was higher than that of the CYP1A1-CYP1A2 chimera containing the N-terminal end of CYP1A1 with subsaturating CPR concentrations, but it was approximately equal with excess CPR suggesting that the localization of the CYP1A enzyme in ordered domains favored its interaction with CPR. These data demonstrate that both the N-terminal end and an internal region of CYP1A2 play roles in targeting CYP1A2 to ordered domains, and domain localization may influence P450 function under conditions that resemble those found in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2228214547,"To describe barriers to physical activity (PA) in type 2 diabetes patients and their general practitioners (GPs), looking for practitioner's influence on PA practice of their patients.We conducted a cross-sectional study on GPs (n = 48) and their type 2 diabetes patients (n = 369) measuring respectively barriers to prescribe and practice PA using a self-assessment questionnaire: barriers to physical activity in diabetes (BAPAD). Statistical analysis was performed accounting hierarchical data structure. Similar practitioner's patients were considered a cluster sharing common patterns.The higher the patient's BAPAD score, the higher the barriers to PA, the higher the risk to declare practicing no PA (p<0.001), low frequency and low duration of PA (p<0.001). A high patient's BAPAD score was also associated with a higher risk to have HbA1c ≥7% (53 mmol/mol) (p = 0.001). The intra-class correlation coefficient between type 2 diabetes patients and GPs was 34%, indicating a high cluster effect. A high GP's BAPAD score, regarding the PA prescription, is predictive of a high BAPAD score with their patients, regarding their practice (p = 0.03).Type 2 diabetes patients with lower BAPAD score, thus lower barriers to physical activity, have a higher PA level and a better glycemic control. An important and deleterious cluster effect between GPs and their patients is demonstrated: the higher the GP's BAPAD score, the higher the type 2 diabetes patients' BAPAD score. This important cluster effect might designate GPs as a relevant lever for future interventions regarding patient's education towards PA and type 2 diabetes management."
https://openalex.org/W2298276101,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are chronic myeloid cancers thought to arise at the level of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. They include essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). All can progress to acute leukemia, but PMF carries the worst prognosis. Increasing evidences indicate that deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) might plays an important role in hematologic malignancies, including MPN. To attain deeper knowledge of short RNAs (sRNAs) expression pattern in CD34+ cells and of their possible role in mediating post-transcriptional regulation in PMF, we sequenced with Illumina HiSeq2000 technology CD34+ cells from healthy subjects and PMF patients. We detected the expression of 784 known miRNAs, with a prevalence of miRNA up-regulation in PMF samples, and discovered 34 new miRNAs and 99 new miRNA-offset RNAs (moRNAs), in CD34+ cells. Thirty-seven small RNAs were differentially expressed in PMF patients compared with healthy subjects, according to microRNA sequencing data. Five miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-19b-3p, miR-29a-3p, miR-379-5p, and miR-543) were deregulated also in PMF granulocytes. Moreover, 3'-moR-128-2 resulted consistently downregulated in PMF according to RNA-seq and qRT-PCR data both in CD34+ cells and granulocytes. Target predictions of these validated small RNAs de-regulated in PMF and functional enrichment analyses highlighted many interesting pathways involved in tumor development and progression, such as signaling by FGFR and DAP12 and Oncogene Induced Senescence. As a whole, data obtained in this study deepened the knowledge of miRNAs and moRNAs altered expression in PMF CD34+ cells and allowed to identify and validate a specific small RNA profile that distinguishes PMF granulocytes from those of normal subjects. We thus provided new information regarding the possible role of miRNAs and, specifically, of new moRNAs in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2339421059,"Robust models for predicting soil salinity that use visible and near-infrared (vis–NIR) reflectance spectroscopy are needed to better quantify soil salinity in agricultural fields. Currently available models are not sufficiently robust for variable soil moisture contents. Thus, we used external parameter orthogonalization (EPO), which effectively projects spectra onto the subspace orthogonal to unwanted variation, to remove the variations caused by an external factor, e.g., the influences of soil moisture on spectral reflectance. In this study, 570 spectra between 380 and 2400 nm were obtained from soils with various soil moisture contents and salt concentrations in the laboratory; 3 soil types × 10 salt concentrations × 19 soil moisture levels were used. To examine the effectiveness of EPO, we compared the partial least squares regression (PLSR) results established from spectra with and without EPO correction. The EPO method effectively removed the effects of moisture, and the accuracy and robustness of the soil salt contents (SSCs) prediction model, which was built using the EPO-corrected spectra under various soil moisture conditions, were significantly improved relative to the spectra without EPO correction. This study contributes to the removal of soil moisture effects from soil salinity estimations when using vis–NIR reflectance spectroscopy and can assist others in quantifying soil salinity in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2197668725,"Background Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4Is) are drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is increasing evidence that DPP4Is may result in suppression of the immune system and may increase the risk of infections such as pneumonia. Aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the use of DPP4Is and the risk of pneumonia in a population-based study. Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the world’s largest primary care database, the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). We selected all users of non-insulin antidiabetic drugs (NIADs), including DPP4Is, between 2007 and 2012. To each NIAD user, we matched randomly selected non-users. The NIAD user’s first prescription defined the index date, which was then assigned to the matched non-users. Patients were followed from their first prescription until end of data collection or the first event of pneumonia, whichever came first. Cox regression analysis estimated the association between pneumonia and current use of DPP4Is versus 1) current use of other NIADs and 2) non-users. DPP4I use was then stratified to daily and cumulative dose. Analyses were statistically adjusted for age, sex, lifestyle factors and comorbidities and concomitant use of various other drugs. Results Risk of pneumonia was not increased with current DPP4I use versus use of other NIADs, adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.70; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.55–0.91. Also higher cumulative doses or daily doses did not further increase risk of pneumonia. Conclusion We found no increased risk of pneumonia in T2DM patients using DPP4Is compared to T2DM patients using other NIADs. Our finding is in line with direct and indirect evidence from observational studies and RCTs. There is probably no need to avoid prescribing of DPP4Is to elderly patients who are at risk of pneumonia."

There is, therefore, interest in the use of non-invasive methods to diagnose and grade the disease. Although positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorethyltyrosine (18F-FET) can be used to differentiate between low-grade (LGG) and high-grade (HGG) gliomas, the optimal parameters to measure and their cut-points have yet to be established. We therefore assessed the value of single and dual time-point acquisition of 18F-FET PET parameters to differentiate between primary LGGs (n = 22) and HGGs (n = 24). PET examination was considered positive for glioma if the metabolic activity was 1.6-times higher than that of background (contralateral) brain, and maximum tissue-brain ratios (TBRmax) were calculated 10 and 60 min after isotope administration with their sums and differences calculated from individual time-point values. Using a threshold-based method, the overall sensitivity of PET was 97%. Several analysed parameters were significantly different between LGGs and HGGs. However, in a receiver operating characteristics analysis, TBR sum had the best diagnostic accuracy of 87% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, 72.7%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. 18F-FET PET is valuable for the non-invasive determination of glioma grade, especially when dual time-point metrics are used. TBR sum shows the greatest accuracy, sensitivity, and negative predictive value for tumour grade differentiation and is a simple method to implement. However, the cut-off may differ between institutions and calibration strategies would be useful."

We investigated the combined predictive value of RDW and GRACE risk score for cardiovascular events in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the first time. We enrolled 480 ACS patients. During a median follow-up time of 37.2 months, 70 (14.58%) patients experienced MACEs. Patients were divided into tertiles according to the baseline RDW content (11.30–12.90, 13.00–13.50, 13.60–16.40). GRACE score was positively correlated with RDW content. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that both GRACE score and RDW content were independent predictors of MACEs (hazard ratio 1.039; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.024–1.055; p < 0.001; 1.699; 1.294–2.232; p < 0.001; respectively). Furthermore, Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that the risk of MACEs increased with increasing RDW content (p < 0.001). For GRACE score alone, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for MACEs was 0.749 (95% CI: 0.707–0.787). The area under the ROC curve for MACEs increased to 0.805 (0.766–0.839, p = 0.034) after adding RDW content. The incremental predictive value of combining RDW content and GRACE risk score was significantly improved, also shown by the net reclassification improvement (NRI = 0.352, p < 0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI = 0.023, p = 0.002). Combining the predictive value of RDW and GRACE risk score yielded a more accurate predictive value for long-term cardiovascular events in ACS patients who underwent PCI as compared to each measure alone."
https://openalex.org/W2195806069,"Bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of transition metals are essential for acquisition of necessary elements from the environment. A large number of Gram-negative bacteria, including human pathogens, have a fourth conserved gene of unknown function adjacent to the canonical permease, ATPase, and solute-binding protein (SBP) genes of the AztABC zinc transporter system. To assess the function of this putative accessory factor (AztD) from Paracoccus denitrificans, we have analyzed its transcriptional regulation, metal binding properties, and interaction with the SBP (AztC). Transcription of the aztD gene is significantly up-regulated under conditions of zinc starvation. Recombinantly expressed AztD purifies with slightly substoichiometric zinc from the periplasm of Escherichia coli and is capable of binding up to three zinc ions with high affinity. Size exclusion chromatography and a simple intrinsic fluorescence assay were used to determine that AztD as isolated is able to transfer bound zinc nearly quantitatively to apo-AztC. Transfer occurs through a direct, associative mechanism that prevents loss of metal to the solvent. These results indicate that AztD is a zinc chaperone to AztC and likely functions to maintain zinc homeostasis through interaction with the AztABC system. This work extends our understanding of periplasmic zinc trafficking and the function of chaperones in this process.

This work extends our understanding of periplasmic zinc trafficking and the function of chaperones in this process. Zinc is an essential element required for a large number of biological processes with roles as a cofactor in enzyme catalysis and in the maintenance of protein structures (1Coleman J.E. Zinc proteins: enzymes, storage proteins, transcription factors, and replication proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 897-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Therefore, its acquisition from the environment is essential for cell survival. However, zinc levels must also be tightly regulated to prevent metal ion toxicity and misincorporation into off-target proteins. Zinc homeostasis is achieved in part by the transcriptional regulation of import (2Hantke K. Bacterial zinc uptake and regulators.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and efflux systems (3Nies D.H. Efflux-mediated heavy metal resistance in prokaryotes.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 313-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) in response to changing intracellular zinc concentrations. Proteins involved in both processes have been identified as virulence factors in human pathogens as they enable bacteria to survive conditions of zinc starvation and intoxication, either of which may be employed by the innate host immune system (4Braymer J.J. Giedroc D.P. Recent developments in copper and zinc homeostasis in bacterial pathogens.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2014; 19: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Djoko K.Y. Ong C.L.

Microbiol. 2012; 10: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is significant interest in targeting prokaryotic mechanisms of zinc homeostasis for the development of novel antibiotics against resistant bacteria. The intracellular concentration of “free” zinc in Escherichia coli is estimated to be maintained in the femtomolar to nanomolar range, whereas total intracellular zinc approaches millimolar concentrations (7Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Femtomolar sensitivity of metalloregulatory proteins controlling zinc homeostasis.Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, 8Wang D. Hosteen O. Fierke C.A. ZntR-mediated transcription of zntA responds to nanomolar intracellular free zinc.J. Inorg. Biochem. 2012; 111: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The vast majority of zinc is bound to high affinity sites on proteins and nucleic acids that buffer the available zinc concentration to virtually zero. As such, there is a strong implication for the presence of cytosolic zinc chaperones that can sequester metal during excess metal stress and deliver it to appropriate targets under metal starvation. Although none have been conclusively identified to date, there is evidence that members of the COG0523 (9Haas C.E. Rodionov D.A. Kropat J. Malasarn D. Merchant S.S. de Crécy-Lagard V.

The situation in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria is markedly different as metal ions are allowed to diffuse more or less freely across the outer membrane. However, even here there is evidence that the concentration of zinc is managed by protein binding. Under severe zinc limitation, high affinity solute-binding proteins (SBPs) 3The abbreviations used are:SBPsolute-binding proteinABCATP-binding cassetteICP-OESinductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopyMF-2mag fura-2SECsize exclusion chromatographyTPENN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamineIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosidebis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolCVcolumn volumeFT-ICRFourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance. such as ZnuA compete effectively for zinc (15Berducci G.

Zinc stress, however, induces the expression of ZraP, a small periplasmic zinc-binding protein that has been suggested to chelate excess zinc and modulate its specific efflux or prevent its import by low affinity transporters (16Noll M. Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. Identification of a novel transcription regulator from Proteus mirabilis, PMTR, revealed a possible role of YJAI protein in balancing zinc in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21393-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The periplasmic protein ZinT has also been implicated in maintaining zinc homeostasis in the periplasm, although its precise role is still unclear. The most recent results suggest that ZinT functions in conjunction with ZnuABC to import zinc, perhaps by maximizing efficient transfer of zinc to ZnuA (17Gabbianelli R. Scotti R. Ammendola S.

We have recently described the structure, transcriptional regulation, and metal binding properties of an SBP from another zinc-specific ABC transporter system in Paracoccus denitrificans called AztC (21Handali M. Neupane D.P. Roychowdhury H. Yukl E.T. Transcriptional regulation, metal binding properties and structure of Pden1597, an unusual zinc transport protein from Paracoccus denitrificans.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 11878-11889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This protein differs from ZnuA by having an abbreviated His-rich loop and unusual C-terminal Asp ligand. These features are conserved among a number of bacterial species, identifying a subclass of zinc transporters within the cluster 9 family of SBPs. Also conserved among many species harboring this subclass is a fourth gene adjacent to the canonical ABC transporter genes, which codes for an ∼40-kDa hypothetical periplasmic protein (AztD, Fig. 1). Although relatively abundant among Gram-negative bacteria, no homologues have yet been characterized. As such, virtually nothing is known about the structure or function of this family of proteins. They have very weak homology to certain quinoproteins and WD40 proteins, both of which adopt β-propeller folds. There is precedence for divalent metals binding to β-propeller domains (22Zhang K. Chen J. The regulation of integrin function by divalent cations.Cell Adh. Migr. 2012; 6: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the WD40 proteins frequently act as scaffolds for the assembly of protein complexes (23Stirnimann C.U. Petsalaki E. Russell R.B. Müller C.W. WD40 proteins propel cellular networks.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Considering these properties in conjunction with the conserved location of these genes adjacent to those of ABC transporters, there is reason to believe that these uncharacterized proteins function in zinc homeostasis, analogous to the proposed function of ZinT. They may act as adaptors and/or metal chaperones between the SBP and the permease or to periplasmic enzymes that require zinc. Consistent with this assignment is the observation that genes encoding the hypothetical protein and the putative membrane permease are present as a fusion in the Corynebacterium Nocardia farcinica (Fig. 1). Here, we describe the transcriptional regulation, heterologous expression, purification, and metal binding properties of AztD from P. denitrificans. This protein has attributes consistent with a metallochaperone function to the AztABC system, including the specific binding of multiple zinc ions and the direct transfer of zinc to apo-AztC. As such, this work identifies a new family of periplasmic zinc chaperones with confirmed zinc transfer activity. Given the widespread distribution of AztD homologues, this protein likely plays an important role in the management of periplasmic zinc by many Gram-negative species. A minimal media composition using an organic phosphate source and succinate as a carbon source was developed based on Graham et al. (18Graham A.I. Hunt S. Stokes S.L. Bramall N. Bunch J. Cox A.G.

The details of zinc-replete (50 μm zinc), -depleted (0 μm zinc), and -chelated (0 μm zinc, 50 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (TPEN)) media compositions are given in a previous publication (21Handali M. Neupane D.P. Roychowdhury H. Yukl E.T. Transcriptional regulation, metal binding properties and structure of Pden1597, an unusual zinc transport protein from Paracoccus denitrificans.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 11878-11889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of P. denitrificans PD1222 cells grown in replete media was washed once with zinc-depleted media and used to inoculate three replicates of each of the different media types described above. The growth of cells in all three conditions was monitored at 600 nm using an Agilent Cary 60 UV-visible spectrophotometer, and 5 ml of cells at midexponential phase (A600 nm 0.4–0.6) were harvested from each condition. To preserve RNA, 2 ml of ice-cold 5% v/v phenol in ethanol were added and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to centrifugation and storage at −80 °C until RNA was isolated. RNA was extracted and purified from the replicate samples described above using a PureLink® RNA mini kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Contaminating DNA was removed by an on-column DNase digestion protocol (Invitrogen). RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (ND 1000). Purified RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNATM kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was diluted 5-fold in H2O before use in quantitative PCR experiments. Primers were designed to amplify 100–150-bp regions of each gene with a Tm of ∼60 °C and used at a final concentration of 0.3 μm. Quantitative real time PCR was done using Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) CFX96 RT-PCR real time system combined with a C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). Relative transcript abundance was normalized to dnaN, encoding the β-subunit of DNA-polymerase III (Pden_0970), a housekeeping gene previously used for P. denitrificans RT-PCR experiments (25Sullivan M.J. Gates A.J. Appia-Ayme C. Rowley G. Richardson D.J. Copper control of bacterial nitrous oxide emission and its impact on vitamin B12-dependent metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19926-19931Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Standard PCR was performed using the forward RT-PCR primer for aztC and the reverse primer for aztD to amplify a 1157-bp product spanning the intergenic region. Genomic DNA (gDNA) or complementary DNA (cDNA) from RT-PCR experiments were used as templates. AztC was expressed and purified as described previously (21Handali M. Neupane D.P. Roychowdhury H. Yukl E.T. Transcriptional regulation, metal binding properties and structure of Pden1597, an unusual zinc transport protein from Paracoccus denitrificans.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 11878-11889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The entire pden1598 gene encoding AztD was amplified by PCR from P. denitrificans genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-ACTATCATATGATGCTCAGACATCTCGCG-3′ forward and 5′-ACTATGGTACCTCAGTGCGTCACGCCGCT-3′ reverse. The PCR product was cloned into a pCDFDuetTM-1 vector (Novagen) using NdeI and Acc65I restriction sites, resulting in a translated protein lacking any affinity tags and containing the N-terminal periplasmic targeting sequence. Plasmid was transformed into BL21 DE3 E. coli cells, which were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 250 rpm to an A600 = 0.8–1.0. Overexpression was then induced by addition of IPTG to 1.0 mm, the temperature decreased to 20 °C, and cells were grown with shaking overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The periplasmic fraction was obtained using an osmotic shock protocol adapted from Wang et al. (24Wang Y. Graichen M.E. Liu A. Pearson A.R. Wilmot C.M. Davidson V.L. MauG, a novel diheme protein required for tryptophan tryptophylquinone biogenesis.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7318-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) Briefly, the cell pellet was resuspended at 5 ml/g of wet weight cells in 50 mm phosphate, pH 8, 0.5 m sucrose, 0.67 mm EDTA, and 7.5 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. An equal volume of deionized water was added and incubated a further 45 min at 30 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min, leaving the periplasmic fraction in the supernatant. Polyethyleneimine was added to 0.5% by volume to precipitate nucleic acids, which were removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Finally, protein was precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 70% and centrifuged as above. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove any remaining particulates. The supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The buffer was gradually changed to 20 mm bis-tris, pH 6.5, over 3 column volumes. NaCl was stepped to 100 mm followed by elution of the protein on a linear gradient of NaCl. The peak containing AztD eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing AztD were combined and concentrated and applied to a HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm, 0.1 mm DTT. SDS-PAGE was used to qualitatively assess protein purity. Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 33,666 m−1 cm−1 calculated as described previously (26Edelhoch H. Spectroscopic determination of tryptophan and tyrosine in proteins.Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). Purified AztD was reduced and denatured in 3 m urea, 10 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C. Iodoacetamide was added to 20 mm and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. A further 16 mm DTT was added to quench the reaction. Urea was diluted to <1.2 mm in trypsin digest buffer (final concentration 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm CaCl2) prior to addition of proteomics grade trypsin (New England Biolabs) to a ratio of 1:20 by mass. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, peptides were desalted/exchanged into 75:25 (v/v) acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid using C18 resin ZipTip® pipette tips (Millipore) prior to introduction into the mass spectrometer. Peptide solutions were analyzed by direct-infusion electrospray ionization FT-ICR mass spectrometry (Thermo LTQ FT) in positive ion mode. Nanoelectrospray was performed with an Advion NanoMate, and resultant peptide ions were measured in a parent-ion FT-ICR scan at a resolving power of m/Δm50% = 100,000 at m/z 400. Fragment ion spectra were generated in the linear ion trap. Parent ions were picked from the FT-ICR spectrum with dynamic exclusion enabled. Parent ion and MS/MS data were manually inspected using Xcalibur software version 2.1.0 to identify and confirm peptides of interest. AztD at 200 μm was incubated with 0–4 molar eq of ZnSO4 for 15 min at room temperature. A control sample at the highest zinc concentration but lacking protein was used to confirm exogenous zinc removal. Samples were then desalted using ZebaTM desalting spin columns (Thermo Scientific) equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol treated with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove trace metal contaminants). Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm, and samples were diluted to 10 μm in 4 m HNO3 for overnight digestion at 70 °C. Prior to metal analysis, samples were diluted 2.5-fold with MilliQ water. Samples were analyzed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2100 DV inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), calibrated with a multielement standard (Ricca Chemical). The wavelengths for measuring manganese and zinc were 257.610 and 206.200 nm, respectively, and samples were run in triplicate. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with a cuvette chamber regulated by a PTC-4235 Peltier device (Jasco). AztD as isolated was diluted to 5 μm in 5 mm HK2PO4, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl in a 1-mm quartz cuvette. Spectra were acquired from 190 to 260 nm at 1 nm bandwidth, 2 s response time, 0.5-nm data pitch, and 10 nm/min scan speed. Each spectrum is the average of three accumulations and has been converted to mean residue ellipticity. Spectra were fitted through the DICHROWEB interface (27Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. DICHROWEB, an online server for protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopic data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar) using the CDSSTR algorithm and associated reference sets (28Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Estimation of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism spectra: comparison of CONTIN, SELCON, and CDSSTR methods with an expanded reference set.Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar). For thermal stability experiments, the ellipticity at 215 nm was monitored from 25 to 90 °C every 0.2 °C with a constant heating rate of 1.0 °C/min. After thermal denaturation experiments, the spectra from 190 to 260 nm were again collected after returning to 25 °C to determine reversibility. Apo-AztC was generated as described previously (21Handali M. Neupane D.P. Roychowdhury H. Yukl E.T. Transcriptional regulation, metal binding properties and structure of Pden1597, an unusual zinc transport protein from Paracoccus denitrificans.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 11878-11889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Apo-AztD was generated by heating in the presence of Chelex. Circular dichroism (CD) demonstrated no significant loss of secondary structure up to 90 °C. Therefore, 55 mg of Chelex was added to AztD in a microcentrifuge tube, and the suspension was incubated for 15 min at 90 °C with occasional mixing. Resin was subsequently removed by centrifugation, and the metal content was determined as described above. All of the metal binding affinity experiments were performed in Chelex-treated binding buffer using proteins that had been desalted/exchanged into binding buffer. The fluorescent dye mag-fura-2 (MF-2) (Invitrogen) was used to analyze the metal binding affinities of AztD for manganese and zinc as described previously (29Golynskiy M.V. Gunderson W.A. Hendrich M.P. Cohen S.M. Metal binding studies and EPR spectroscopy of the manganese transport regulator MntR.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15359-15372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were made using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with entrance and exit slits set to 10 nm. Protein concentration was measured before each experiment, and MF-2 concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient at 369 nm of 22,000 m−1 cm−1 (29Golynskiy M.V. Gunderson W.A. Hendrich M.P. Cohen S.M. Metal binding studies and EPR spectroscopy of the manganese transport regulator MntR.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15359-15372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In each experiment, 15.0 μm apo-AztD and 0.5 μm MF-2 were titrated with increasing concentrations of MnCl2 or ZnSO2, keeping the total volume of titrant added to less than 10%. Fluorescence excitation spectra were scanned from 250 to 450 nm while monitoring emission at 505 nm. The fluorescence intensities at λex = 330 nm for zinc titrations were fit using the program DYNAFIT (30Kuzmic P. Program DYNAFIT for the analysis of enzyme kinetic data: application to HIV proteinase.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 31Kuzmic P.

Hendrich M.P. Cohen S.M. Metal binding studies and EPR spectroscopy of the manganese transport regulator MntR.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15359-15372Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature in a fluorescence microcuvette containing 200 μl of binding buffer with or without 1 mm EDTA. All proteins were desalted/exchanged into binding buffer prior to use. Apo- or holo-AztC at 10 μm was titrated with ZnSO4, apo-AztD, or holo-AztD. Fluorescence emission intensity was monitored from 290 to 450 nm with an excitation wavelength of 278 nm using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with entrance and exit slits set to 5 nm. In titrations of apo-AztC with apo- and holo-AztD, 15 min of equilibration was allowed between measurements. After addition of apo- or holo-AztD to 12 μm, 20 μm of ZnSO4 was added to determine saturation. A HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 HR column (GE Healthcare) was prepared by washing with 0.5 column volumes (CV) 0.2 m NaOH followed by 2 CV of 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and finally equilibrated with 2 CV of Chelex-treated binding buffer. This same washing protocol was performed between each sample run. In control experiments, 500 μl of apo-AztC or holo-AztD at 100–135 μm in binding buffer was loaded onto the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For zinc transfer experiments, apo-AztC and holo-AztD at 160 μm each were incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to loading onto the column. The elution profile was fitted with two Gaussian curves representing AztC and AztD using the program MagicPlot (St. Petersburg, Russia). These were then converted to protein concentration using the respective extinction coefficients. SDS-PAGE was used to confirm the identity of protein found in each chromatographic fraction. Fractions were collected and digested in 4 m HNO3 for zinc content analysis by ICP-OES. The expressions of aztC and aztD were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR of P. denitrificans cells grown in zinc-replete (50 μm added zinc), zinc-depleted (0 μm added zinc), and zinc-chelated (0 μm added zinc, 50 μm TPEN) conditions (Fig. 2A). Expression of aztC was increased ∼5-fold in zinc-depleted and zinc-chelated conditions consistent with previous results (21Handali M. Neupane D.P. Roychowdhury H. Yukl E.T. Transcrip"
https://openalex.org/W2268953488,"Explosive growth in our understanding of genomics and molecular biology have fueled calls for the pursuit of personalized medicine, the notion of harnessing biologic variability to provide patient-specific care. This vision will necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying pathophysiology in each patient. Medical journals play a pivotal role in the education of trainees and clinicians, yet we suspected that the amount of basic science in the top medical journals has been in decline. We conducted an automated search strategy in PubMed to identify basic science articles and calculated the proportion of articles dealing with basic science in the highest impact journals for 8 different medical specialties from 1994 to 2013. We observed a steep decline (40-60%) in such articles over time in almost all of the journals examined. This rapid decline in basic science from medical journals is likely to affect practitioners' understanding of and interest in the basic mechanisms of disease and therapy. In this Life Sciences Forum, we discuss why this decline may be occurring and what it means for the future of science and medicine."

Methods A total of 660 IVF-ET/ICSI cycles were retrospectively identified. The inclusion criterion was age ≤ 30 years. Cycles were divided into two groups: a GnRHa group and a GnRHant group. In the GnRHa group, the patients received one single injection of 1.0mg-1.3mg Triptorelin in previous mid-luteal phase. In the GnRHant group, a daily dose of 0.25 mg Cetrotide was initiated when a lead follicle obtained a mean diameter of 14 mm, continued up until the day of hCG administration. The duration of stimulation, total dose of Gn, implantation rate, pregnancy rate, and OHSS rate were compared. Results The duration of stimulation, E2 level on hCG day, numbers of oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes, and high-quality embryos in the GnRHa group were all significantly more than those in the GnRHant group. In the GnRHa group, 83.53% of cancelled fresh-transferred cycles were cancelled because of high risk of OHSS, which was significantly higher than that in the GnRHant group (43.55%, P<0.05). The incidence of OHSS in the GnRHa group was slightly higher than that in the GnRHant group. The implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in the GnRHa group were significantly higher than those in the GnRHant group (37.36% VS 19.25%, 62.78% VS 31.06%; P<0.05). Conclusions Our study demonstrated that for potentially high responders, the GnRHant protocol can, to some extent, lower the cancellation and incidence rates of OHSS. The GnRHa protocol was superior to the GnRHant protocol in terms of implantation and clinical pregnancy rates."
https://openalex.org/W2236579797,"High levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are necessary for achieving and maintaining optimal virological suppression, as suboptimal adherence leads to therapy failure and disease progression. It is well known that adherence to ART predicts therapy response, but it is unclear whether clinical outcomes of ART predict adherence. To examine the predictive power of current CD4+ T cell count for adherence of HIV-infected individuals to ART, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 133 Dutch HIV patients with electronically measured adherence. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for a number of sociodemographic and clinical variables, high current CD4+ T cell count (>660 cells/mm3) was most strongly associated with lower adherence to ART (assessed as a continuous variable) during a two-month period immediately following the measurements of variables (P = 0.008). The twice-per-day (versus once-per-day) dosing regimen was also significantly associated with lower adherence (P = 0.014). In a second multivariate analysis aimed at determining the predictors of suboptimal (<100% of the doses taken) adherence, high current CD4+ T cell count was again the strongest independent predictor of suboptimal adherence to ART (P = 0.015), and the twice-per-day dosing regimen remained associated with suboptimal adherence (P = 0.025). The association between suboptimal adherence and virological suppression was significant in patients with high CD4+ T cell counts, but not in patients with low or intermediate CD4+ T cell counts (P = 0.036 and P = 0.52, respectively; P = 0.047 for comparison of the effects of adherence on virological suppression between patients with high vs. low or intermediate CD4+ T cell counts), suggesting that apart from promoting suboptimal adherence, high CD4+ T cell count also strengthens the effect of adherence on virological suppression. Therefore, sustained efforts to emphasize continued adherence are necessary, especially for patients with high CD4+ T cell counts."

Ten well-trained, male endurance athletes (25.3±4.1 yrs; 179.2±4.5 cm; 74.2±3.4 kg) performed four test trials, each involving three 3-min sessions on a double-poling ergometer with 3-min intervals of recovery. One trial was conducted entirely under normoxic (No) and another under hypoxic conditions (Ho; FiO2 = 0.165). In the third and fourth trials, the exercise was performed in normoxia and hypoxia, respectively, with hyperoxic recovery (HOX; FiO2 = 1.00) in both cases. Arterial hemoglobin saturation was higher under the two HOX conditions than without HOX (p<0.05). Integrated muscle electrical activity was not influenced by the oxygen content (best d = 0.51). Furthermore, the only difference in tissue saturation index measured via near-infrared spectroscopy observed was between the recovery periods during the NoNo and HoHOX interventions (P<0.05, d = 0.93). In the case of HoHo the athletes' Pmean declined from the first to the third interval (P < 0.05), whereas Pmean was unaltered under the HoHOX, NoHOX and NoNo conditions. We conclude that the less pronounced decline in Pmean during 3 x 3-min double-poling sprints in normoxia and hypoxia with hyperoxic recovery is not related to changes in muscle activity or oxygenation. Moreover, we conclude that hyperoxia (FiO2 = 1.00) used in conjunction with hypoxic or normoxic work intervals may serve as an effective aid when inhaled during the subsequent recovery intervals."

https://openalex.org/W2291300445,"High throughput screenings of single chain Fv (scFv) antibody phage display libraries are currently done as soluble scFvs produced in E.coli. Due to endotoxin contaminations from bacterial cells these preparations cannot be reliably used in mammalian cell based assays. The monovalent nature and lack of Fc in soluble scFvs prevent functional assays that are dependent on target cross linking and/or Fc functions. A convenient approach is to convert scFvs into scFv.Fc fusion proteins and express them in mammalian cell lines for screening. This approach is low throughput and is only taken after primary screening of monovalent scFvs that are expressed in bacteria. There is no platform at present that combines the benefits of both bacterial and mammalian expression system for screening phage library output. We have, therefore, developed a novel dual expression vector, called pSplice, which can be used to express scFv.Fc fusion proteins both in E.coli and mammalian cell lines. The hallmark of the vector is an engineered intron which houses the bacterial promoter and signal peptide for expression and secretion of scFv.Fc in E.coli. When the vector is transfected into a mammalian cell line, the intron is efficiently spliced out resulting in a functional operon for expression and secretion of the scFv.Fc fusion protein into the culture medium. By applying basic knowledge of mammalian introns and splisosome, we designed this vector to enable screening of phage libraries in a product like format. Like IgG, the scFv.Fc fusion protein is bi-valent for the antigen and possesses Fc effector functions. Expression in E.coli maintains the speed of the bacterial expression platform and is used to triage clones based on binding and other assays that are not sensitive to endotoxin. Triaged clones are then expressed in a mammalian cell line without the need for any additional cloning steps. Conditioned media from the mammalian cell line containing the fusion proteins are then used for different types of cell based assays. Thus this system retains the speed of the current screening system for phage libraries and adds additional functionality to it."

A low-shear modelled microgravity was used to mimic the conditions similar to space. The results indicated that the α-aminophosphonate chitosan inhibited the fungal growth significantly under microgravity. In addition, the inhibition mechanism of the modified chitosan was studied by UV-Visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. This work highlighted the role of a bio-based chitosan derivative to act as a disinfectant in space stations to remove fungal contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W2336897925,"The ribonucleoprotein Male Specific Lethal (MSL) complex is required for X chromosome dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster males. Beginning at 3 h of development the MSL complex binds transcribed X-linked genes and modifies chromatin. A subset of MSL complex proteins, including MSL1 and MSL3, is also necessary for full expression of autosomal heterochromatic genes in males, but not females. Loss of the non-coding roX RNAs, essential components of the MSL complex, lowers the expression of heterochromatic genes and suppresses position effect variegation (PEV) only in males, revealing a sex-limited disruption of heterochromatin. To explore the molecular basis of this observation we examined additional proteins that participate in compensation and found that MLE, but not Jil-1 kinase, contributes to heterochromatic gene expression. To determine if identical regions of roX RNA are required for dosage compensation and heterochromatic silencing, we tested a panel of roX1 transgenes and deletions and find that the X chromosome and heterochromatin functions are separable by some mutations. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of staged embryos revealed widespread autosomal binding of MSL3 before and after localization of the MSL complex to the X chromosome at 3 h AEL. Autosomal MSL3 binding was dependent on MSL1, supporting the idea that a subset of MSL proteins associates with chromatin throughout the genome during early development. The broad localization of these proteins early in embryogenesis supports the idea of direct action at autosomal sites. We postulate that this may contribute to the sex-specific differences in heterochromatin that we, and others, have noted."
https://openalex.org/W2279133683,"Variation in presumably neutral genetic markers can inform us about evolvability, historical effective population sizes and phylogeographic history of contemporary populations. We studied genetic variability in 15 microsatellite loci in six native landlocked Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) populations in northern Fennoscandia, where this species is considered near threatened. We discovered that all populations were genetically highly (mean FST ≈ 0.26) differentiated and isolated from each other. Evidence was found for historical, but not for recent population size bottlenecks. Estimates of contemporary effective population size (Ne) ranged from seven to 228 and were significantly correlated with those of historical Ne but not with lake size. A census size (NC) was estimated to be approximately 300 individuals in a pond (0.14 ha), which exhibited the smallest Ne (i.e. Ne/NC = 0.02). Genetic variability in this pond and a connected lake is severely reduced, and both genetic and empirical estimates of migration rates indicate a lack of gene flow between them. Hence, albeit currently thriving, some northern Fennoscandian populations appear to be vulnerable to further loss of genetic variability and are likely to have limited capacity to adapt if selection pressures change."

The FOXK1 domain mutants (I, II, and III) were constructed by subcloning PCR-amplified fragments of the FLAG-FOXK1 cDNA into the parental vector. The JLP-specific antibody has been described previously (3Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P.

Antibodies against PLK1, GAPDH, HA tag, FLAG tag, Cyclin E, S tag, Myc tag, and p21 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against FOXK1, FOXK2, BubR1, and T7 tag were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and Abcam. On-Target plus Smart pool siPlk1, siFOXK1, siFOXK2, and siScramble were purchased from GE Dharmacon. Stock solutions of BI2536 (Selleckchem), RO3306 (Tocris), and nocodazole (Sigma) were prepared in tissue culture grade DMSO. HEK293T, HeLa, and U2OS cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections of exponentially growing cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 36–48 h post-transfection. For siRNA experiments, the cells were transfected with 30 nmol of siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen), and the cells were harvested 24–36 h post-transfection. To identify novel interaction partners through mass spectrometry, exponentially growing HEK293T cells were transfected with S-tagged JLP or vector control plasmid and harvested 36 h post-transfection. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 35 mm sodium chloride, 0.2% β-d-maltoside, supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche), 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate), and 5 mg of protein lysate was incubated with S-protein-agarose (69704; Millipore) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and bands that were detected specifically in JLP-S sample were excised and subjected to microcapillary LC-MS/MS at the Taplin Mass Spectrometry facility at Harvard Medical School. For interaction studies, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 35 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min. FLAG- and HA-tagged proteins were precipitated from 1 mg of protein lysate using FLAG-M2 beads (Sigma) or HA beads (Piercenet) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed well with the immunoprecipitation buffer. For immunoprecipitation using antibodies, 1 mg of precleared lysate was incubated with 2 μg of antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and the protein complexes were precipitated using protein G or protein A-Sepharose (GE healthcare) for 2 h. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blot analysis. Proteins were analyzed using the Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system. HeLa cells were grown on an 8-well chamber slide and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS containing glycine and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. The cells were then blocked in blocking solution (PBS, 10% FBS, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated with anti-JLP and anti-PLK1 antibodies diluted in blocking solution. The subsequent steps of the assay were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (DUO92101; Sigma). Coverslips were mounted on the slide using DUOLINK in situ mounting medium with DAPI. Images were obtained using a Carl Zeiss AxioImager Z1 and processed with Zen pro 2012 imaging software (Zeiss). Kinase assays were performed as described previously (22Jatiani S.S. Cosenza S.C.

A non-ATP-competitive dual inhibitor of JAK2 and BCR-ABL kinases: elucidation of a novel therapeutic spectrum based on substrate competitive inhibition.Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ng of His-PLK1 (PV3501; Invitrogen) or GST-PLK2 (PV4204; Invitrogen) was incubated with 2 μg of purified substrate, and ATP mix (10 μm cold ATP, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Where required, kinase was preincubated with indicated concentration of inhibitor for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of substrate and ATP mix. The reactions were terminated by the addition of sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were Coomassie-stained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. To synchronize cells in the G1 phase, cells grown to 60% confluence were washed with PBS and released in medium containing 0.1% serum for 24 h. Where indicated, the cells were treated with 2 μg/ml aphidicolin (A0781; Sigma) or 1 μm nocodazole overnight to synchronize cells in the S and G2/M phases, respectively. For double thymidine block, HeLa cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h and released into complete medium for 9 h followed by a second round of treatment with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h. Cells were released into complete medium and harvested at the indicated time points. For flow cytometric analysis, cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed for 15 min using 0.5% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Fixed cells were resuspended in ice-cold 90% methanol added dropwise. Cells were then blocked in 2% BSA in PBS and stained with anti-pHis H3 antibody (Millipore) overnight at room temperature. The cells were then stained for 2 h using an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody prior to staining with propidium iodide to quantitate DNA. DNA content was measured using a BD-FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar). HEK293T cells were grown for six generations in heavy and light amino acid medium prior to transfection with FLAG-JLP plasmid. Cells were subjected to treatment as indicated and lysed in a maltoside-based lysis buffer. 2 mg of cell lysate was incubated with FLAG-conjugated beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and bound proteins were eluted through treatment with 10 m urea. The eluted protein was digested for 4 h with 0.2 μg of Lys-C (Wako) and then for 14 h with 0.2 μg of Trypsin (Promega). The samples were desalted using Vivapure C18 microspin columns and lyophilized. Mass spectrometric analysis of the lyophilized peptides was performed by the Proteome Exploration Laboratory, California Institute of Technology as described previously (23Kalli A. Smith G.T.

Protein ratios were normalized to equalize bait (JLP) levels. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated from 0.5 μg of total RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantitative PCR (qPCR), cDNA was mixed with 1× Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (4367659; Applied Biosystems) and gene-specific primers. Amplification was performed using the ABI Step One Plus system. qPCR values were analyzed using the comparative Ct method to obtain relative gene expression levels. Normalization was performed using β-actin. Sequences of primer pairs used for qPCR analysis are as follows: ACTB, 5′-ACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGATAGCAACGTACATGG-3′; JLP, 5′-TCACGAGAAAATCCAGCCATG-3′ and 5′-GAGTAACATGAGACGTGGGTG-3′; CDKN1A, 5′-TGTCACTGTCTTGTACCCTTG-3′ and 5′-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAA-3′; FOXK1, 5′-ACATCACCAAGCATTACCCC-3′ and 5′-TCTATTCGCCAAAAGGACCC-3′; and FOXK2, 5′-ACCATCAACATTCCAGACACC-3′ and 5′-CCACCTTGTACCCTGAAGAC-3′. We undertook a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify novel JLP interaction partners. To that end, pulldown assays were performed from cells transfected with an expression vector encoding S-tagged JLP or a parental control plasmid. The protein complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue. As shown in Fig. 1A, there were a number of bands specifically detected in the JLP S-tagged precipitates. These bands were excised, and protein constituents were determined by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1A). The predominant peptides identified in bands labeled 1, 2, and 4 were JLP itself, likely because of proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein. However, band 3 was made up of peptides derived from the mitotic serine/threonine kinase PLK1. To validate the novel JLP-PLK1 interaction, we subjected the S tag pulldown precipitates to immunoblotting using a PLK1-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, PLK1 was specifically precipitated by JLP but not in the vector control sample. To determine whether endogenous JLP associates with PLK1, HeLa cell extracts were incubated with either JLP or PLK1-specific antisera, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis. The results of this study (Fig. 1C) show that both proteins associate in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays, thereby confirming that endogenous JLP and PLK1 associate in cells. The JIP family of scaffolding proteins contains four members, JIP1, JIP2, JIP3, and JLP. Of these, JIP3 is highly homologous to JLP in its sequence and domain structure (3Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. JLP: a scaffolding protein that tethers JNK/p38MAPK signaling modules and transcription factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which suggests that it might interact with PLK1. We therefore performed FLAG pulldown assays from cells overexpressing either FLAG-tagged JIP3 or JLP and subjected the precipitates to Western blot analysis using PLK1-specific antiserum. Although JLP readily precipitated PLK1, we failed to detect any associated PLK1 protein in the JIP3 sample (Fig. 1D). To determine whether JLP interacts with PLK1 during mitosis, HeLa cells were synchronized in S phase using a double thymidine block and released into the cell cycle in the presence of DMSO or nocodazole. Cells were then harvested at the indicated time points to determine the level of JLP-PLK1 complexes as a function of cell cycle progression. The results of this study showed that interaction of JLP with PLK1 increases significantly as cells enter the mitotic phase (Fig. 2, A and B). To further demonstrate that JLP and PLK1 associate during mitosis, we also performed an in situ proximity ligation assay, which detects protein-protein interactions with high degrees of specificity and sensitivity. HeLa cells incubated with JLP and PLK1 antisera that recognize the endogenous proteins emitted a strong proximity ligation assay signal only in mitotic cells (Fig. 2C). Background signals observed in interphase cells were comparable with the negative control (Fig. 2C), suggesting that JLP and PLK1 proteins interact predominantly during mitosis. The JLP protein has several functional domains, including two leucine zipper domains, a JNK binding domain, and a C-terminal domain, which mediate protein-protein interactions (3Lee C.M. Onésime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. JLP: a scaffolding protein that tethers JNK/p38MAPK signaling modules and transcription factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Role of the JIP4 scaffold protein in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To map the region of JLP that interacts with PLK1, HEK293T cells were transfected with S-tagged WT and domain mutants of JLP (Fig. 1E). Pulldown experiments showed that in addition to the full-length (WT) protein, PLK1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of JLP, which spans two leucine zipper domains and the JNK binding domain (amino acids 1–463), but not with any of the individual domains within the N-terminal region of JLP or with the C terminus of the protein (domain III and CTD) (Fig. 1, E and F). To map the region of PLK1 that interacts with JLP, cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type and domain mutants of PLK1 (Fig. 1G) were subjected to pulldown assays using HA-agarose and subsequent immunoblotting with JLP-specific antisera. Our results show that JLP interacts with the full-length (WT) PLK1 protein and the domain mutant expressing the PLK1 Polo box domain (PBD amino acids 306–603) (Fig. 1, G and H), but not with the kinase domain (protein kinase domain amino acids 1–316). To confirm that the JLP N-terminal domain and the PLK1 Polo box domain interact, we performed additional immunoprecipitation assays using extracts derived from cells overexpressing a S-tagged version of the JLP N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–463) and a HA-tagged PLK1 Polo box domain mutant (amino acids 306–603). As shown in Fig. 1 (I and J), reciprocal pulldown experiments followed by Western blot analyses confirmed the association between the two domains. It has previously been established that the PBD of PLK1 is involved in recognizing and interacting with phospho-primed substrates (15Elia A.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Proteomic screen finds pSer/pThr-binding domain localizing Plk1 to mitotic substrates.Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because we determined that JLP binds to the PLK1 PBD (Fig. 1H), we performed experiments to determine whether the interaction is phosphorylation-dependent. JLP was immunoprecipitated from asynchronous cell lysates and the immunocomplex was treated with λ-phosphatase to dephosphorylate the proteins. Following treatment with phosphatase, the precipitate was washed rigorously to remove any unbound proteins, and the level of associated PLK1 was determined by Western blot analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, treatment with λ-phosphatase greatly reduced the interaction between JLP and PLK1, suggesting that the interaction is dependent on phosphorylation. We next performed additional interaction studies using HA-tagged WT PLK1 and a PBD mutant in which two residues that are critical for recognizing phospho-primed substrates, His-538 and Lys-540, were mutated to Ala and Met, respectively. Fig. 3B shows that although WT PLK1 readily associated with JLP, the H538A/K540M PBD mutant (H/K) failed to do so. These experiments provide additional evidence that the JLP-PLK1 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent. The Polo box domain of PLK1 is known to initiate interactions by recognizing phospho-primed sites on its substrates with a consensus binding motif of Ser-[Ser(P)/Thr(P)]-Pro (15Elia A.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Proteomic screen finds pSer/pThr-binding domain localizing Plk1 to mitotic substrates.Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 16Elia A.E. Rellos P.

The protein sequence of JLP was analyzed for the presence of this consensus site, and a corresponding motif was identified at amino acid residues Thr-334 and Thr-351 within the JLP N-terminal region. To test whether this motif functions as a PLK1 docking site, these two residues were mutated to Ala either individually (T334A and T351A) or in combination (2TA) in the JLP N-terminal domain plasmid and tested for their ability to bind to PLK1 in pulldown assays. The results of this study showed that although mutation of JLP at residue Thr-334 di"

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a central lysine deacetylase involved in a variety of cellular processes including metabolism, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Here we characterize the lysine acetylome in mouse liver, and by using a model of Sirt1-/-knockout mouse, show that SIRT1 regulates the deacetylation of 70 proteins in the liver in-vivo. Amongst these SIRT1-regulated proteins, we find that four RNA-processing proteins and a chromatin-remodeling protein can be deacetylated by SIRT1 directly in-vitro. The discovery that SIRT1 has a potential role in RNA-processing suggests a new layer of regulation in the variety of functions performed by SIRT1."

As a typical rhizome clonal plant in China's northern grasslands, Leymus chinensis usually dominates the steppe communities and grows in clonal patches. In order to clarify the sexual reproductive allocation of L. chinensis in the process of the growth and expansion, we selected L. chinensis clonal patches of a range of sizes to examine the reproductive allocation and allometric growth of the plants. Moreover, the effects of position of L. chinensis ramets within the patch on their reproductive allocation were also examined. Clonal patch size and position both significantly affected spike biomass, reproductive tiller biomass and SPIKE/TILLER biomass ratio. From the central to the marginal zone, both the spike biomass and reproductive tiller biomass displayed an increasing trend in all the five patch size categories except for reproductive tiller biomass in 15–40m2 category. L. chinensis had significantly larger SPIKE/TILLER biomass ratio in marginal zone than in central zone of clonal patches that are larger than 15 m2 in area. Regression analysis showed that the spike biomass and SPIKE/TILLER biomass ratio were negatively correlated with clonal patch size while patch size showed significantly positive effect on SEED/SPIKE biomass ratio, but the reproductive tiller biomass and SEED/TILLER biomass ratio were not dependent on clonal patch size. The relationships between biomass of spike and reproductive tiller, between mature seed biomass and spike biomass and between mature seed biomass and reproductive tiller biomass were significant allometric for all or some of patch size categories, respectively. The slopes of all these allometric relationships were significantly different from 1. The allometric growth of L. chinensis is patch size-dependent. This finding will be helpful for developing appropriate practices for the management of L. chinensis-dominant grasslands."

https://openalex.org/W2223133537,"Lectin-like molecules and their receptors are cell surface molecules that have been shown to play a role in either facilitating infection or serving as transporters of HIV/SIV in vivo. The role of these lectin-like molecules in the pathogenesis of HIV/SIV infection continues to be defined. In efforts to gain further insight on the potential role of these lectin-like molecules, our laboratory generated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the human analogs of rhesus macaque CD200, CD200R and Mincle, since the rhesus macaques are accepted as the most reliable animal model to study human HIV infection. The characterization of the cell lineages from the blood and various tissues of rhesus macaques that express these lectin-like molecules are described herein. Among the mononuclear cells, the cells of the myeloid lineage of rhesus macaques are the predominant cell lineages that express readily detectable levels of CD200, CD200R and Mincle that is similar to the expression of Siglec-1 and Siglec-3 reported by our laboratory earlier. Subset analysis revealed that a higher frequency of the CD14+/CD16- subset from normal rhesus macaques express CD200, CD200R and Mincle. Differences in the frequencies and density of expression of these molecules by the gated population of CD14+ cells from various tissues are noted with PBMC and bone marrow expressing the highest and the mononuclear cells isolated from the colon and ileum expressing the lowest levels. While a significant frequency of pDCs and mDCs express Siglec-1/Siglec-3, a much lower frequency expresses CD200, CD200R and Mincle in PBMCs from rhesus macaques. The mAb against CD200 and CD200R but not Mincle appear to inhibit the infection of macrophage tropic SIV/SHIV in vitro. We conclude that these mAbs may have potential to be used as adjunctive therapeutic agents to control/inhibit SIV/HIV infection."

https://openalex.org/W2202315113,"Ambiguous causal evidence in which the covariance of the cause and effect is partially known is pervasive in real life situations. Little is known about how people reason about causal associations with ambiguous information and the underlying cognitive mechanisms. This paper presents three experiments exploring the cognitive mechanisms of causal reasoning with ambiguous observations. Results revealed that the influence of ambiguous observations manifested by missing information on causal reasoning depended on the availability of cognitive resources, suggesting that processing ambiguous information may involve deliberative cognitive processes. Experiment 1 demonstrated that subjects did not ignore the ambiguous observations in causal reasoning. They also had a general tendency to treat the ambiguous observations as negative evidence against the causal association. Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 included a causal learning task requiring a high cognitive demand in which paired stimuli were presented to subjects sequentially. Both experiments revealed that processing ambiguous or missing observations can depend on the availability of cognitive resources. Experiment 2 suggested that the contribution of working memory capacity to the comprehensiveness of evidence retention was reduced when there were ambiguous or missing observations. Experiment 3 demonstrated that an increase in cognitive demand due to a change in the task format reduced subjects' tendency to treat ambiguous-missing observations as negative cues."
https://openalex.org/W1836767912,"The asymmetrical inheritance of plasmid DNA, as well as other cellular components, has been shown to be involved in replicative aging. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is an ongoing debate regarding the mechanisms underlying this important asymmetry. Currently proposed models suggest it is established via diffusion, but differ on whether a diffusion barrier is necessary or not. However, no study so far incorporated key aspects to segregation, such as dynamic morphology changes throughout anaphase or plasmids size. Here, we determine the distinct effects and contributions of individual cellular variability, plasmid volume and moving boundaries in the asymmetric segregation of plasmids. We do this by measuring cellular nuclear geometries and plasmid diffusion rates with confocal microscopy, subsequently incorporating this data into a growing domain stochastic spatial simulator. Our modelling and simulations confirms that plasmid asymmetrical inheritance does not require an active barrier to diffusion, and provides a full analysis on plasmid size effects."
