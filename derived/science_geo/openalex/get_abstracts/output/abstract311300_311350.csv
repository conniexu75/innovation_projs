https://openalex.org/W2069437907,"Inexperienced hand-reared motmots avoided a pattern of red and yellow rings but readily attacked a pattern of green and blue rings and also one of red and yellow stripes. The motmots' avoidance of the ""coral snake%"" pattern indicates that mimic snake species can derive protection from some potential predators."
https://openalex.org/W1966767682,"A troop of olive baboons, Papio anubis, has developed systematic predation, which includes hunting and sharing of meat. Although meat-eating among nonhuman primates-baboons and chimpanzees especially-had been discovered in earlier field studies, systematic predation had been reported for chimpanzees and humans only. Starting as an adult male activity in the olive baboon troop, this tradition rapidly expanded to include capture and consumption of prey by adult females and juveniles of all ages and both sexes. Infants eat but have not been observed to capture prey."
https://openalex.org/W2081595324,"Three potassium-argon age determinations on sanidine from crystalrich pantellerite and volcanic ash in the Main Rift Valley of central Ethiopia indicate that the Middle Stone Age of East Africa began prior to 180,000 years ago. This suggests that the technological developments which characterize the Middle Stone Age have a far greater antiquity than previously estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2043499249,"In a sequel to Project Washoe, chimpanzees are being taught American Sign Language from birth by humans who are fluent in the language, including persons who are themselves deaf or whose parents were deaf. The first two subjects began to use signs when they were 3 months old, and these early results indicate that the new conditions are significantly superior to the conditions of Project Washoe. More valid comparisons can now be made between the acquisition of language by children and by chimpanzees."
https://openalex.org/W2022565480,"Evidence is presented showing that intensity of light emission in dikaryotic cultures of Panus stipticus, Armillaria mellea, and Mycena polygramma follows a diurnal pattern. The lowest values appear between 6 and 9 A.M. and the peak intensities occur between 6 and 9 P.M. This pattern is consistent regardless of whether the cultures are grown in total darkness, under constant illumination, or exposed to a normal day-night cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1988523312,The action spectrum for phototropism of Conidiobolus conidiophores was determined crudely with glass filters and by projecting a spectrum on cultures of the fungus. The active wavelengths (about 400 to 650 mmicro) corresponded in general with those absorbed by extracts containing a pigment with an absorption spectrum characteristic of a porphyrin.
https://openalex.org/W2073081013,"An Indian ploceid finch, Amandava amandava, develops brilliant nuptial plumage in males during the breeding season. The females and males outside of the breeding season have modest brown hen plumages. The fact that castrates, whether originally of male or of female sex, assume nuptial plumages during the breeding season of the species indicates that plumage character is under the control of hypophyseal hormones and that hypophyses are passing through an activity cycle which is independent of presence or absence of gonads."
https://openalex.org/W2001926573,"Puromycin stimulates substrate consumption and initiates an accumulation of amino acids in uredospores of the corn rust fungus. The results indicate that under suitable conditions uredospores should be able to synthesize appreciable quantities of amino acids, but must be stimulated to do so."

https://openalex.org/W2027829696,"A very close relationship has been found between hue discrimination thresholds and the differences in wavelength necessary to produce ""full color"" from two monochromatic light sources. This finding suggests a need for certain research in the area of color induction."

https://openalex.org/W2006907386,"In its recent Jupiter flyby Pioneer 10 passed through a belt of intense particulate radiation. The radiation dose on the outer surface of the spacecraft was at least 4.9 x 10(5) rads from electrons plus 2.9 x 10(6) rads from protons, sufficient to cause significant microbial decontamination. The radiation dose inside Pioneer 10, approximately 2.8 x 10(5) rads, was less likely to cause microbial decontamination but would be lethal to man and to most multicellular biological organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2063563258,"A method of rooting cuttings from white pine trees is described. Approximately equal numbers of cuttings from diseased and healthy trees were rooted by this method. After the rooted cuttings were planted in the field, they were closely watched for root growth and the development of foliar injuries."
