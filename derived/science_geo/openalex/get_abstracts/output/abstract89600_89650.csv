https://openalex.org/W2094657382,"A mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), pMOV-psi-, was constructed by deletion of about 350 nucleotides from an infectious proviral DNA clone between the putative env mRNA 5' splice site and the AUG that initiates the coding sequence for Pr65gag. Although the parent wild-type proviral clone, pMOV-psi+, quickly causes a high level of reverse-transcriptase-containing virus particles to be released from transfected NIH/3T3 cells, transfection of pMOV-psi- into these cells initially results in very little release. By 9 to 10 days after transfection, however, pMOV-psi- -transfected cells produce infectious virus. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect that can be repaired in transfected NIH/3T3 cells, presumably by recombination with a sequence normally present in the cells. Cell lines with pMOV-psi- stably integrated into chromosomal DNA produce reverse-transcriptase-containing particles that lack detectable M-MuLV RNA but the cells efficiently complement replication-defective, packagable retroviruses. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect in the packaging of genomic RNA into virions but can provide in trans the products necessary for virion production. The deletion in pMOV-psi- appears to define a site required in cis for packaging of MuLV RNA into virions. Cell lines carrying pMOV-psi- can be used to produce helper-free stocks of natural or synthetic defective retroviruses."

The effects of these toxins on cultured mouse neuroblastoma and fibroblast cells have been evaluated. In both types of cells, submicromolar toxin concentrations rapidly induce striking changes in cell morphology that are reversible upon removal of the toxin. Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies specific for cytoskeletal proteins reveal that the toxins cause major alterations in the organization of microfilaments without obvious effects on the organization of the microtubular system."

https://openalex.org/W1970869731,"The defensive siphon and gill withdrawal reflex of Aplysia is a simple reflex mediated by a well-defined neural circuit. This reflex exhibits classical conditioning when a weak tactile stimulus to the siphon is used as a conditioned stimulus and a strong shock to the tail is used as an unconditioned stimulus. The siphon withdrawal component of this reflex can be differentially conditioned when stimuli applied to two different sites on the mantle skin (the mantle shelf and the siphon) are used as discriminative stimuli. The differential conditioning can be acquired in a single trial, is retained for more than 24 hours, and increases in strength with increased trials. Differential conditioning can also be produced within the field of innervation of a single cluster of sensory neurons (the LE cluster) since two separate sites on the siphon skin can serve as discriminative stimuli. The finding that two independent afferent inputs that activate a common set of interneurons and motor neurons can be differentially conditioned restricts the possible cellular loci involved in the associative learning."

https://openalex.org/W2026742692,"Fluorescence microscopy with 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-3-diazole phallacidin was used to survey vertebrate tissues for actin filament bundles comparable to the stress fibers of cultured cells. Such bundles were found only in vascular endothelial cells. Like the stress fibers of cultured cells, these actin filament bundles were stained in a punctate pattern by fluorescent antibodies to both alpha-actinin and myosin. The stress fibers were oriented parallel to the direction of blood flow and were prominent in endothelial cells from regions exposed to high-velocity flow, such as the left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta. Actin bundles may help the endothelial cell to withstand hemodynamic stress."

https://openalex.org/W2007106421,"It has been shown that stressed rats display increased stereotypy in response to a subsequent amphetamine challenge. Evidence is presented showing that stress potentiates cocaine stereotypy as well. These effects of stress were found to be particular to stress that could not be controlled in that rats receiving an identical amount of stress from footshock, but allowed to control its duration, displayed no more stereotypy than did nonstressed rats. These findings have implications for the role of stress and coping in amphetamine and cocaine psychoses, endogenous psychoses, and some forms of schizophrenia."

https://openalex.org/W2059737190,"Vascular smooth muscle is characterized by a high rate of aerobic lactate production, which may be altered independently of oxidative phosphorylation. This finding suggested a cytoplasmic compartmentation of metabolism. Exogenous glucose was found to be the sole precursor of aerobic glycolysis under unstimulated conditions. Although tissue depolarization with high K+ resulted in a substantial reduction of endogenous glycogen, exogenous glucose remained the sole precursor of aerobic lactate production. These data showed unequivocally that carbohydrate metabolism is compartmentalized in vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2122243255,"Subfreezing temperatures, low light levels, and high doses of ionizing and ultraviolet radiation extending for many months after a large-scale nuclear war could destroy the biological support systems of civilization, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. Productivity in natural and agricultural ecosystems could be severely restricted for a year or more. Postwar survivors would face starvation as well as freezing conditions in the dark and be exposed to near-lethal doses of radiation. If, as now seems possible, the Southern Hemisphere were affected also, global disruption of the biosphere could ensue. In any event, there would be severe consequences, even in the areas not affected directly, because of the interdependence of the world economy. In either case the extinction of a large fraction of the Earth's animals, plants, and microorganisms seems possible. The population size of Homo sapiens conceivably could be reduced to prehistoric levels or below, and extinction of the human species itself cannot be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W2015671207,"When treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells show changes in morphology, adhesion, and the extracellular matrix. Dexamethasone treatment results in a tenfold increase in the rate of fibronectin biosynthesis in HT1080 cells and a twofold increase in untransformed, normal human fibroblasts. Maximal induction levels are attained within one cell generation, while decay of the response requires several cell cycles. Pulse-chase studies showed that most of the newly synthesized fibronectin is secreted into the medium. The glucocorticoid antagonist, RU-486, blocks the dexamethasone-induced changes but does not alter the basal rate of fibronectin production. Therefore, fibronectin biosynthesis appears to be controlled by two distinct mechanisms—one, regulating basal rates of fibronectin production, which is transformation-sensitive and glucocorticoid-independent; and another, which is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in elevated rates of fibronectin biosynthesis upon dexamethasone treatment both in normal fibroblasts and in HT1080 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082958138,"The mammalian major histocompatibility complex (MHC; H–2 complex in mouse) is a large multigene complex which encodes cell-surface antigens involved in the cellular immune response to foreign antigens1. Class I polypeptides expressed at the H–2K and H–2D (Fig. 1) loci of numerous mouse strains exhibit an unusually high degree of genetic polymorphism, which is assumed to be related to their function as primary recognition elements in the immune response. We suggested that this H–2 polymorphism may arise by gene conversion-like events between non-allelic class I genes. This is supported by our recent comparison of the DNA sequences of the normal H–2Kb gene sequence, from the C57BL/10 mouse, and a mutant2,3 form of this gene called H–2Kbm1 (ref. 4): the mutant allele differs from the H–2Kb gene in seven bases out of a region of 13 bases in exon 3 of the class I gene (which encodes α2 (C1) the second highly polymorphic protein domain), suggesting that this region of new sequence had been introduced into the H–2Kb sequence following unequal pairing of two class I genes in the genome of the C57BL mouse. Schulze et al. have obtained similar results5. Here we report work identifying a potential donor gene in our library of 26 class I genes cloned from the C57BL/10 mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2047501334,"We have employed gene transfer to generate cell lines in which a chromosomal region consisting solely of defined DNA sequences has undergone gene amplification. We have analyzed recombinant clones from the amplified array to determine the physical structure of amplified DNA in the cell lines. The amplified DNA we have analyzed consists of a tandem array of at least 20 individual repeating units. The individual units are contiguous, and are joined to one another by homologous recombination between repeated sequences. At first approximation, all homologous recombinations are permitted such that crossing-over may occur between any two repeated sequences. Since individual units contain multiple repeated elements, the array is not a regularly repeating structure. The individual units within the array are heterogeneous, both in size and in sequence content. These observations suggest models of gene amplification which involve multiple cycles of unscheduled DNA replication at a single locus, followed by multiple recombination events which serve to link individual units to one another and ultimately to the chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2024974193,"We have examined the role of DNA modification in X chromosome inactivation of fetal tissues of the mouse using DNA-mediated gene transfer for the gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Two types of tissues have been examined with respect to randomness of inactivation in 14-day mouse conceptuses: 1) fetal tissue, which under-goes random inactivation of either the maternal or paternal X; and 2) yolk sac endoderm tissue, an extraembryonic membrane, which normally undergoes nonrandom inactivation of the paternal X. Exploiting an electrophoretic variant of HPRT as a means to mark the active and inactive HPRT alleles we provide evidence that: 1) inactive X DNA of the fetus at 14 days behaves like that of both adult tissue and cell lines in that the inactive X DNA is not efficient in gene transfer; and 2) in contrast, inactive X DNA from yolk sac endoderm is functional in gene transfer. Thus, despite the similarity in single active X chromosome expression in yolk sac endoderm and somatic tissues, there appears to be a difference at the level of DNA modification between these two tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2059370797,"Three-month-old infants learned to activate an overhead crib mobile by operant footkicking and received a visual reminder of the event (a ""reactivation treatment"") 2 weeks later, after forgetting had occurred. Subsequent manifestation of the association was a monotonic increasing function of time since the reactivation treatment, and performance of infants tested 8 hours after the remainder was related to the time spent sleeping in the interim (r = 0.75). These data demonstrate that normal retrieval is time-dependent. Moreover, individual data suggest that retrieval may be continuous rather than discontinuous."
https://openalex.org/W1979101609,"Following transection of a giant axon, the nerve membrane at the cut end is resealed within 5 to 30 minutes. This membrane resealing process is highly dependent upon temperature and extracellular calcium ions. The membrane resealing is triggered by excess calcium entering the axoplasm at the site of transection but is prevented by the application of phospholipase A2 inhibitors. We propose that calcium activated phospholipase A2 plays a central role in resealing of the ruptured nerve membrane."

One of the phosphate-acceptor sites is tyrosine 8 in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the Band 3 protein. Seven out of 11 residues in the sequence surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine are Asp or Glu. It is concluded that the erythrocyte, like other cells, contains a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates highly anionic peptide acceptor sites."

https://openalex.org/W2009797260,"Sexual agglutinins located on the flagellar membranes of Chlamydomonas gametes mediate a mating-type-specific adhesion reaction that brings complementary gametes together for zygotic cell fusion. We identify the mating-type plus agglutinin, using a combination of biochemical and genetic analysis, as a glycopolypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of greater than 10(6) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its core polypeptide migrates as a approximately 480-kd species, and it is estimated to be present in approximately 30 copies per gametic flagellum. The agglutinin is present in the wild type, in a mutant that agglutinates but cannot fuse, and in a complementing diploid, whereas it is absent from four nonagglutinating mutants and from a noncomplementing diploid. Electron microscopy shows the purified agglutinin to be a highly asymmetric molecule, 220 X 4 nm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported purification and visualization of a membrane-associated cell-cell recognition protein."

https://openalex.org/W84361437,"The interaction of forskolin with adenylate cyclase was studied by evaluating its effect on metal and metalATP kinetics and by measuring its protective effect when the enzyme was subjected to denaturation conditions. The solubilized calmodulinand forskolin-sensitive adenylate cyclase from brain and the particulate enzyme from platelets were inactivated upon preincubation with N-ethylmaleimide. Forskolin protected against this inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner and demonstrated Kd values of 6.3 and 7.6 PM for the brain and platelet adenylate cyclases, respectively. Protection against N-ethylmaleimide inactivation of the brain enzyme was also afforded by calmodulin, but not to the extent seen with forskolin. Forskolin also protected against thermal inactivation of the adenylate cyclases from brain, platelets, erythrocytes, and 549 lymphoma wild type and cycvariants. The adenylate cyclase of bovine sperm, which is insensitive to activation by forskolin, was not protected by forskolin against inactivation by either N-ethylmaleimide or heat. Half-maximal activation of the platelet adenylate cyclase was seen with 3 to 10 ~ C M forskolin, and the Kd for forskolin, determined from heat inactivation kinetics, was 9 to 11 PM. Activation of the platelet adenylate cyclase by forskolin was negatively cooperative (n = 0.59) with respect to forskolin. This activation occurred without change in Michaelis or dissociation constants for free M&’, but coincided with a &fold increase in the corresponding constants for MgATP and a 2-fold increase in the K , for MnATP. However, forskolin did not affect the K , app for MnATP of the solubilized adenylate cyclase from brain. These results imply binding of forskolin by adenylate cyclase. The data suggest that the same binding site for forskolin is involved in both protection and activation and that this binding site is distinct from those to which the substrates bind."

https://openalex.org/W1963609496,"The recombinant (MCF) class of murine leukemia virus appears to play an important role in lymphomagenesis in AKR and other mice. Although much effort has been extended in characterizing MCF viruses, relatively little is known about the cells they infect. I examined what cells were targets in AKR mice for both lymphomagenic and nonlymphomagenic MCF viruses. Lymphomagenic MCF viruses of thymic origin (AKR-247 and C58L1) were found to infect and replicate selectively in immature lymphocytes only present in thymic cortex, whereas nonlymphomagenic MCF viruses of splenic origin (C58v-1-C77 and C58v-2-C45) selectively infected and replicated in cells that appeared to B lymphocytes. Virus-binding studies suggested that neither T- nor B-lymphocyte tropisms were determined by selective attachment of virus to the respective cells. These findings demonstrate that in contrast with ecotropic viruses, which can infect many types of cells in the mouse, specific cellular tropisms can exist for MCF viruses, and that MCF infection, and therefore oncogenicity, is closely linked to cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1639145419,"Chick progesterone receptor subunits A and B have been photoaffinity-labeled using [3H]R5020 ([17 alpha-methyl-3H]17,21-dimethyl-19-nor-pregn-4,9-diene-3,20-dione) by a modification of the procedures previously reported by our laboratory (Dure, L. S., IV, Schrader, W. T., and O'Malley, B. W. (1980) Nature (Lond.) 283, 784-786). [3H]R5020 binds to the same receptor sites as authentic progesterone, and has an apparent Kdiss of 2.0 nM. Use of a CuSO4 filter raised the coupling efficiency to 5% and labeled exclusively the receptor proteins. Smaller labeled macromolecules were found to be proteolytic fragments of receptors. The protease(s) could not be inhibited by any of the commonly used protease inhibitors. However, the proteolytic activity was completely removed by passage of crude receptor preparations through phosphocellulose columns. Receptor preparations, photoaffinity-labeled after this procedure, showed exclusively one radioactive band at Mr = 79,000 (subunit A) or Mr = 108,000 (subunit B) with no detectable side-reaction products. Labeled receptors A and B were digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease to yield smaller [3H]R5020-protein fragments derived from both. Molecular weight estimates (Mr = 9,500) and apparent isoelectric points indicate similarities of these regions of both A and B. The photoaffinity protocol described here thus provides a method for study of the hormone-binding domain of progesterone receptors and of receptor proteolysis in crude extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1571161951,"A plasminogen activator, previously designated as rat urinary esterase A (Nustad, K., and Pierce, J. V. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 2312-2319), was separated from kallikrein of rat urine and purified to homogeneity. In polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme showed three closely migrating protein bands which were labeled with [14C]diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and stained on a zymogram using the chromogenic substrate methionine-alpha-naphthyl ester. Two chains, heavy chain(s) (Mr approximately 15,800, 14,200) and light chain(s) (Mr approximately 8,850, 8,550), were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, while two bands (Mr approximately 24,500 and 23,000) were seen under nonreducing conditions. The active site of the enzyme was associated with the heavy chain. The purified enzyme was stained for carbohydrate by the periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Five bands were distinguished in slab gel electrofocusing with isoelectric points ranging from 5.05 to 5.45. The purified enzyme lysed fibrin clots containing plasminogen but not plasminogen-free fibrin. It hydrolyzed benzyloxylcarbonyl-Gly-Gly-Arg-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, and a Km of 53 microM and a Vmax of 63 mumol/min/mg of enzyme were obtained at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C. The enzyme cleaved kininogen substrates to produce kinin which was measured by bioassay or radioimmunoassay. The enzyme was inhibited by soybean or lima bean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, D-Phe-Phe-ArgCH2Cl, antipain, leupeptin, benzamidine, and pentamidine. Its pH optimum was 8.5 to 9.0; it was unstable on dilution and on heating. On immunoelectrophoresis, an antiserum to the esterase formed precipitin arcs with rat plasma and this enzyme at identical positions, which in turn were different from those formed with kallikrein. This urinary enzyme belongs to the family of serine proteinases and is immunologically related to urinary kallikrein."
https://openalex.org/W1987509459,Selective pharmacological inhibition of thromboxane A2 synthesis did not prevent arachidonate-induced aggregation of human platelets in vitro. Prevention was instead achieved by a combination of thromboxane A2 inhibitors with low concentrations of aspirin. The latter partially reduced the proaggregatory cyclooxygenase products that accumulated when thromboxane A2 synthesis was blocked. The aspirin concentrations did not affect per se either platelet aggregation or prostacyclin synthesis in cultured human endothelial cells. The combination of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors with low doses of aspirin may offer greater antithrombotic potential than either drug alone.

https://openalex.org/W1983514512,"The kidney, and to a slight extent the liver, of human fetuses were found to synthesize and secrete the alpha subunit common to glycoprotein hormones. Fetal lung and muscle did not synthesize this protein. Since fetal kidney and liver were previously found to synthesize beta chorionic gonadotropin, their ability to synthesize bioactive chorionic gonadotropin was also determined. The newly synthesized hormone bound to mouse Leydig cells and elicited a biological response: namely, the synthesis of testosterone. These results suggest that the human fetus may participate in metabolic homeostasis during its development."

Administration of gonadotropin leads to a similar increase in the capacity of the ovary to metabolize xenobiotics. This variation in the activity of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene hydroxylase during the estrous cycle may be related to the marked changes in the incidence of ovarian cancer during menopause and in women taking contraceptive pills."
https://openalex.org/W2031297816,"Observations that cytoskeletal proteins assemble in vivo close to the time and site of synthesis have been confirmed and extended by an in vitro translation system. HeLa cytoskeletons prepared with Triton in a translation-extraction buffer without reticulocyte or wheat germ lysate efficiently incorporate 35S-methionine into polypeptides, and are stable during this translation. Cytoskeletal proteins translated in this way associate with the HeLa cytoskeleton independent of the concentration of soluble proteins. These associations are puromycin-resistant before the proteins are complete; the protein associations made in vitro show only minor differences from those made in vivo. The protein associations are not simply a consequence of protein solubility in the buffers used, as the associations require initiation in vivo. These results indicate that many cytoskeletal proteins associate with the cytoskeleton during translation."
https://openalex.org/W1634501573,"The effects of the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol on the renal outer cortical brushborder membrane D-glucose transporter are studied. Two apparently independent results of dithiothreitol treatment are observed. The first is a completely reversible increase in the affinity of the carrier for the nontransported competitive inhibitor phlorizin. The second is a partially reversible loss of phlorizin binding sites. Similar results are observed with the monothiol disulfide reducing agent beta-mercaptoethanol. Reversal of both effects of dithiothreitol could be prevented by exposing the membranes to an excess of N-ethylmaleimide following treatment with the reducing agent. When transported sugars are included with dithiothreitol treatment, the magnitude of both of its effects on the carrier are influenced; more specifically, the affinity for phlorizin is further increased and the loss of phlorizin binding sites is reduced. Nontransported sugars are without effect. These observations provide strong evidence for the existence of (at least) two disulfide bonds important to the functioning of this transporter."

https://openalex.org/W2080525046,"Behavior of squirrel monkeys, maintained by the termination of stimuli associated with electric shock, was suppressed by response-dependent shock delivery. The effects of pentobarbital on this behavior depended on whether monkeys had previously received morphine. In monkeys without experience with drugs, pentobarbital increased responding. In monkeys with recent experience with morphine, however, pentobarbital resulted in a smaller increase or decrease in responding. The rate-decreasing effects of pentobarbital after a history of morphine administration could be reversed by the administration of d-amphetamine. These findings suggest that the behavioral effects of abused drugs may depend on previous experience with other drugs, even when those drugs are from a different pharmacological class."
https://openalex.org/W1565455875,"Xenopus oocytes were injected with several heterologous mRNAs to investigate specific message recruitment onto polysomes. When large amounts of mRNA such as ovalbumin, which is translated on membrane-bound polysomes, are injected, most of the stable message accumulates in a postpolysomal supernatant. Conversely, when similar amounts of nonmembrane-bound mRNAs such as those which code for adenovirus protein are injected, most of the messages are found in a polysome pellet. Nonpolysomal mRNAs such as zein, ovalbumin, and lysozyme can be recruited onto membrane-bound polysomes by injected rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Only RER, but not Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, or salt-washed RER has such recruiting ability. In addition, the nontranslating messengers can be recruited by injecting the salt wash of the RER. Since most nontranslating mRNAs sediment to regions less than the 80 S monosome, the step at which translational regulation takes place is probably initiation rather than elongation. The mechanism by which recruitment might occur is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1487725324,"The distance between a pair of fluorophores attached to Cys-36 of beta-tropomyosin and Cys-373 of actin in reconstituted muscle thin filaments was measured by fluorescence energy transfer. Two pairs of donor/acceptor fluorophores, N-(iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid/5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and N-(1-pyrene)maleimide/dimethylamino-4-maleimidostilbene, were covalently attached to tropomyosin and actin. The energy transfer efficiencies in various reconstituted systems were determined from decrease in donor lifetime using nanosecond pulse fluorimetry. Based on the 8 to 13% energy transfer efficiency observed for the first donor/acceptor pair labeled on tropomyosin and actin, respectively, and a calculated critical distance of 45 A (assumed kappa 2 = 2/3) the distance between Cys-373 of actin and Cys-36 of beta-tropomyosin was estimated to be 65 A. Fluorescence energy transfer experiments using other donor/acceptor pairs gave similar results. Since Cys-373 of actin is thought to be in the myosin head-binding sites, the minimal distance between tropomyosin and the myosin-binding site on actin is estimated to be about 34.5 A. These results place some constraints on possible spatial arrangements of thin filament proteins."

When exchange with the bulk solvent is slow on the T1 time scale, comparison of the intrinsic T1 values for the exchangeable protons and the heme methyl resonances has provided the assignment of the proximal histidyl imidazole N1H proton resonance. Transfer of saturation experiments and linewidth data as a function of pH at 25 degrees C permitted the determination of the proximal histidyl imidazole N1H exchange rates in various protein oxidation/ligation states. The exchange rates were found to be base-catalyzed in the deoxy- as well as the met-cyano-, met-nicotinate-, and met-azide- complexes. The exchange rates are taken as measures of the magnitude of the fluctuations of the protein conformation near the heme cavity. The unligated deoxy-protein exhibited a greater kinetic stability than ligated forms of the protein, and the bulky nicotinate ligand resulted in the lowest kinetic stability for the ligated protein forms. In contrast to met-cyanomyoglobin, no resonance which could be attributed to the distal histidyl imidazole NH was observed for any of the low spin complexes of leghemoglobin. Comparison between the same form of leghemoglobin and myoglobin reveals that the former exhibits exchange rates an order of magnitude faster than the latter protein in both ligated and unligated states, confirming the greater flexibility of the heme pocket in leghemoglobin."
