https://openalex.org/W1589619983,"The interaction of insulin with its receptor was studied in purified liver plasma membranes and isolated hepatocytes of the obese hyperglycemic mouse (ob/ob) and its thin litter mate. The ob/ob mouse is a genetic mutant characterized by marked obesity, hyperinsulinism, and resistance to both endogenous and exogenous insulin. Under identical conditions of preparation and incubation, the membranes of the ob/ob mouse bind only 20 to 25% as much insulin per mg of protein as those of their thin litter mates. Scatchard analysis suggests that this decrease in binding is due to a decrease in the number of receptor sites in the membrane of the obese mouse, especially those of higher affinity. The result with isolated hepatocytes was qualitatively the same. In contrast to the marked decrease in insulin receptors, the membranes of the obese mouse were similar to those of their thin litter mates in activity of membrane marker enzymes, protein subunit structure, and binding of 125I-human growth hormone and isoproterenol. There was a decrease in 125I-glucagon binding but to a much smaller extent than that observed in insulin binding. The decrease in insulin receptors in the ob/ob mouse correlates well with the insulin resistance which they exhibit."
https://openalex.org/W1553542610,"Abstract Insulin interactions with human lymphocytes in established cultures and with isolated peripheral lymphocytes have been studied using 125I-insulin. Receptors in circulating lymphocytes are indistinguishable from those found in cultured cells, and the lymphocyte receptors show striking similarities to those structures described in fat cell and liver preparations. In lymphocytes, the ability of insulin or insulin analogues to inhibit binding of 125I-insulin is directly proportional to the ability of that preparation to inhibit binding of labeled hormone to purified liver membranes or to stimulate glucose oxidation in the fat cell. Binding of 125I-insulin to lymphocytes is a rapid and reversible process. Binding is maximal at 15°. Dissociation rate studies revealed a biphasic curve and the constants obtained were 8.3 x 10-5 s-1 and 8.3 x 10-4 s-1. The apparent affinity constants of the two orders of binding sites in the cultured lymphocytes were 1.2 x 1010 m-1 and 1.1 x 109 m-1, whereas in the normal circulating lymphocytes the values were 2.0 x 109 m-1 and 1.4 x 108 m-1. At 30° there is very little degradation of labeled insulin by lymphocytes, and at 15° there is no detectable degradation with cultured or circulating cells. Binding of 125I-insulin to cultured lymphocytes is unaffected by Ca++, Mg++, or EDTA. The optimum pH for binding occurs at about 7.8. Insulin binding to cells is unaffected by digestion with DNase, RNase, or neuraminidase. However, tryptic digestion destroys the capacity of the cells to bind insulin."

https://openalex.org/W1976298722,"The 1alpha-hydroxy derivative of vitamin D(3) has been chemically synthesized and tested for its biological activity. This analog has comparable biological activity on a weight basis to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in the stimulation of intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization in normnal and anephric rats. Because the 1alpha-hydroxy derivative is synthesized from cholesterol, it is easier and less expensive to prepare than 1alpha,25-dihydroxy derivative, making it attractive as a drug in the treatment of renal osteodystrophy and hypopara-thyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W1543504034,"Abstract Two adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinases, with sedimentation coefficients of 5.4 S (mol wt 84,000) and 7.7 S (mol wt 140,000), respectively, have been purified from bovine brain. Each enzyme migrated as a single band at three different pH values on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The enzymes had similar properties. Catalytic subunits of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases from bovine brain, and of cyclic AMP-dependent and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP)-dependent protein kinases from lobster muscle were prepared by means of Enzite CM-cellulose-protamine affinity chromatography, and their properties were studied. The catalytic subunits of the two bovine brain enzymes and of the lobster muscle cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme each had a sedimentation coefficient of 3.6 S (mol wt 40,000), whereas that of the lobster muscle cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme sedimented at 4.5 S (mol wt 60,000). These results agree with kinetic studies, indicating that cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases of arthropods have certain similarities to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases of vertebrates. Histone and cyclic AMP caused the dissociation of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase from lobster muscle (5.7 S; mol wt 90,000) and those from bovine brain into subunits; histone and cyclic GMP caused the dissociation of the lobster muscle cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (7.7 S; mol wt 140,000) into subunits. The dissociation of the enzymes by histone was accompanied by a concomitant increase in cyclic nucleotide-independent activity. Iso-electric points of catalytic and regulatory subunits of the 7.7 S component of the brain enzyme were about pH 7.8 and 3.8, respectively. Addition of isolated regulatory subunit, derived from bovine brain cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme, inhibited the activity of catalytic subunits obtained from bovine brain enzymes. Interestingly, the regulatory subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme from mammalian brain also inhibited the activity of the catalytic subunit prepared from the lobster muscle cyclic GMP-dependent enzyme, converting it into a cyclic AMP-dependent form. Thus, an interaction between catalytic and regulatory subunits occurred, although the subunits were from different tissues, different phyla, and different classes (with respect to cyclic nucleotide specificity) of protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1986919226,"Norepinephrine-containing neurons of the locus coeruleus of the cat were recorded with microelectrodes during unrestrained sleeping and waking. The recorded neurons were subsequently defined by combined fluorescence histochemistry of catecholamines and production of microlesions at recording sites. These pontine units show homogeneous changes in discharge patterns with respect to sleep stages, firing slowly during drowsy periods and slow wave sleep and firing in rapid bursts during paradoxical sleep. These data provide a direct correlation between the activity of defined catecholamine-containing neurons and the spontaneous occurrence of sleep stages."
https://openalex.org/W1515469702,"Abstract Human glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (PP-ribose-P amidotransferase; EC 2.4.2.14) has been purified 40-fold from placenta. The enzyme is located in the cytosol. The partially purified preparation is stable and free of glutaminase and nucleotidase activity, permitting study of the substrate kinetics and regulatory properties. Michaelis-Menten substrate kinetics were observed with apparent Km values of 0.48 mm for PP-ribose-P and 1.6 mm for glutamine. Human PP-ribose-P amidotransferase has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, with the order of relative effectiveness Mg2+ = Mn2+ g Co2+ g Ca2+. Other divalent cations tested did not support catalytic activity. Orthophosphate has complex effects upon human PP-ribose-P amidotransferase; these include enzyme stabilization, competitive inhibition with PP-ribose-P and sensitization to nucleotide feedback inhibition. Human PP-ribose-P amidotransferase was inhibited by a wide variety of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides; the corresponding nucleosides and bases were ineffective. Inhibitory effectiveness decreased with the series mono- g di- g triphosphonucleotide. Certain preparations of PP-ribose-P amidotransferase lost the property of feedback inhibition, yet retained catalytic activity suggesting that the catalytic and regulatory sites were topologically distinct. Kinetic studies revealed that AMP produced a qualitative change in PP-ribose-P substrate curves, from hyperbolic to sigmoidal, with an attendent change in Hill coefficient from 1.1 to 2.7 at 3.0 mm AMP. AMP was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to glutamine and AMP did not qualitatively alter glutamine substrate curves. Combinations of 6-OH- and 6-NH2-purine nucleotides resulted in synergistic inhibition. This suggests separate but interacting binding sites for these end products. The pyrimidine nucleotides methyl-dCMP and TMP were also found to exhibit synergistic inhibition with AMP. The kinetic and regulatory properties of human PP-ribose-P amidotransferase are in accord with a postulated role for this enzyme in the in vivo regulation of prime biosynthesis de novo."
https://openalex.org/W1556314487,"Abstract Epinephrine caused rapid release of intracellular K+ by acting on an α-adrenergic receptor in rat parotid gland slices. Continuous measurement by a K+-selective electrode served as an assay for the α-adrenergic response. The reaction reached a plateau 3 to 5 min after epinephrine addition when 30 to 50% of the K+ which had been in the slices was released. Isoproterenol, which is specific for β-adrenergic receptors and causes amylase secretion from the slices, did not induce K+ release. The concentration of epinephrine which caused a half-maximal K+ release was 15 µm, whereas the concentration which caused a half-maximal rate of amylase secretion in the same system was almost two orders of magnitude lower (0.2 µm). The hypothesis that the α-adrenergic response is mediated by a reduction in the intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) level was tested. Preincubation with isoproterenol which activated the adenyl cyclase did not inhibit K+ release induced by subsequent addition of epinephrine. There was also no inhibition of K+ release when the slices were preincubated with N6-monobutyryl cAMP which acted as an efficient inducer of enzyme secretion in this system. Furthermore, the initial rise in the intracellular cAMP level caused by epinephrine was found to be the same whether or not the α-receptor was blocked by phentolamine. A subsequent more rapid decline of the cAMP level in absence of phentolamine seemed to be due to indirect effects of the α-receptor which causes extensive vacuolation in addition to K+ release. The experiments suggest that the α-adrenergic response is not mediated by changes in the concentration of cAMP in the cell. Electron microscopy showed that phenylephrine which activates the α-adrenergic receptor causes extensive vacuolation of the acinar gland cells. Isoproterenol and N6-monobutyryl cAMP cause fusion of the secretory granules with the cell membrane facing the lumen but no vacuolation. The findings substantiate and extend our previous evidence that both α- and β-adrenergic receptors reside in the same acinar cells. Injection of tyramine and phenylephrine into rats produced larger volumes of saliva than injection of isoproterenol. It is therefore suggested that K+ release mediated by the α-receptor is associated with water transport which sweeps the secretory protein from the acinar lumen into the gland ducts."
https://openalex.org/W1513879319,"Abstract 5-Fluorouracil, at 10-4 m concentrations, inhibited ribosomal RNA maturation only slightly in Novikoff hepatoma cells growing in suspension culture. On a molar basis, 5-fluorouridine was a much more potent inhibitor of the maturation process. The difference between the effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorouridine is probably a result of the greater transport and incorporation of the latter into RNA. The nucleoside analogue strongly inhibited the production of mature 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA, while apparently only slightly inhibiting the formation of the initial 45 S ribosomal precursor RNA or the 38 S ribosomal RNA intermediate. Inhibition of 32 S ribosomal precursor RNA production was greater than that of the larger precursor molecules, but less than that of the mature ribosomal RNA molecules. 5-Fluorouridine did not affect the methylation of 45 S ribosomal precursor RNA, indicating that the analogue exerts its inhibitory effect on some other aspect of the ribosomal RNA maturation process."
https://openalex.org/W1485466973,"Abstract Enzyme secretion caused by epinephrine in rat parotid slices is accelerated by addition of inosine and adenine to the medium. The purines apparently aid in maintaining the ATP supply. Epinephrine causes a decrease of the intracellular ATP concentration within 1 min after its addition to the slices. Ouabain which inhibits the Na+,K+-activated ATPase, thus conserving ATP, accelerates enzyme secretion induced by epinephrine. Therefore, it is tentatively concluded that the Na+,K+-activated ATPase is not involved in enzyme secretion. Conditions which produce a high extent of enzyme secretion (g80% of the total amylase secreted in 90 min) are defined and analyzed. In the presence of epinephrine, a high extent of enzyme secretion is obtained when calcium is omitted from the medium or when the potassium in the medium is raised from 5 to 50 mm. When epinephrine is replaced by isoproterenol or by N6-monobutyryl 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate, a high extent of enzyme secretion is obtained also in the regular Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium which contains 5 mm potassium and 2.5 mm calcium. The reagents which produce a high extent of enzyme secretion are those which activate the process without concomitantly activating the release of potassium from the slices. It is shown in the accompanying papers that the potassium release is specifically induced by an epinephrine α-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1505789163,"Abstract A heat-stable protein which modulates the activity of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases was purified from lobster tail muscle, and its properties were studied. The modulator is similar in several respects to the inhibitory factor reported by others (Appleman et al. (1969) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 116, 39; Walsh et al. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1977) to be present in rat and rabbit skeletal muscle. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested the presence of aggregate forms of the modulator, each of which possessed both stimulatory and inhibitory activities. A minimum molecular weight of 34,000 for the modulator was estimated by using either sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or amino acid analysis. The protein kinase modulator was shown to be a highly charged, acidic protein containing a low level of aromatic amino acid residues. p-Chloromercuribenzoate-treatment of the protein kinase modulator from lobster tail muscle caused a dramatic change in its actions on adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent but not on guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP)-dependent protein kinase. Modulator activity was demonstrated in preparations from a wide variety of sources. However, the various preparations demonstrated considerable differences in the ratio of stimulatory to inhibitory activity. The modulator acts to alter the substrate specificity both of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases, increasing the phosphorylation of some protein substrates and decreasing that of others. It is possible that the modulator may function in vivo by regulating the activity of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases through modification of their substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1517770822,"Abstract A cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated protein kinase and a substrate have been demonstrated in a morphologically and enzymatically defined sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation from canine heart. The self-phosphorylation of these vesicles was stimulated 2.5- to 3-fold by cAMP with half-maximal stimulation at 8.5 x 10-8 m. The kinase activity phosphorylated histones and required a divalent cation, magnesium. With an optimal concentration of MgCl2 (15 mm), millimolar concentrations of calcium inhibited the enzyme. The apparent Km values for ATP in the presence and in the absence of cAMP were 2.0 x 10-5 m and 3.3 x 10-5 m, respectively. The self-phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum was not inhibited by the specific heat-stable protein inhibitor of cAMP-stimulated protein kinases and not maximally activated by cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The phosphorylated membrane substrate had the characteristics of a protein with a phosphoester bond. The reported cAMP-stimulated calcium uptake of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum may be mediated by this kinase and its phosphorylated substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1525798607,"Abstract Isolated hepatocytes have been prepared from the livers of neonatal chicks by an enzymatic technique. The cells were 80 to 95% viable as judged by trypan blue exclusion. Less than 5% of the lactate dehydrogenase appeared in the medium during a 1-hour incubation. The cells had a high rate of endogenous respiration, synthesized glucose from lactate, and exhibited many of the metabolic properties characteristic of liver slices prepared from neonatal chicks. The de novo synthesis of fatty acids was stimulated by fructose, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, lactate, and pyruvate. The stimulatory effects of fructose and dihydroxyacetone required the concomitant presence of acetate in the medium; the stimulatory effects of pyruvate and lactate were independent of a supplementary substrate. Free fatty acids (albumin-bound) and glucagon inhibited the effects of lactate and fructose. Theophylline and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate mimicked the effects of glucagon. Insulin stimulated fatty acid synthesis slightly whether or not glucagon was present. The results support the hypothesis that fatty acid synthesis is regulated by the intracellular concentration of a metabolite derived from free fatty acids, probably long chain fatty acyl-CoA. The sugars may modulate the concentration of the free fatty acid metabolite or they may be metabolized to an intermediate which stimulates fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1515207454,"Abstract Human erythrocyte membrane protein components have been phosphorylated by an endogenous protein kinase. This transfer of phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was stimulated by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and inhibited by calcium. The formation of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine bonds and the negligible effect of large changes in sodium and potassium concentrations clearly differentiate this phosphorylation from Na,K-ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1981924786,"In hemolyzates from red cells of two brothers with purine overproduction and gout, activity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase is more than twofold greater than that measured in normal or other gouty individuals. The increased enzyme activity, which is also demonstrable in fibroblasts of the one patient tested, is associated with increased production of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate by intact cells, an indication that the enzyme abnormality is the basis for the purine overproduction. This genetic abnormality is an example of an increased enzyme activity producing a disease state."
https://openalex.org/W1589654194,"Abstract Under conditions where both glucagon and hormonal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity increase with increasing concentrations of glucagon, it was found that hormonal stimulation was complete when occupation of the glucagon-specific binding sites was only 10 to 20% of that achieved upon prolonged incubation; thus, under these conditions, 80 to 90% of the glucagon which binds to liver plasma membranes does so without affecting adenylyl cyclase activity. Des-1-histidine glucagon, a competitive inhibitor of glucagon binding, when added 5 min after glucagon, completely inhibited hormonal stimulation, while at the same time only displacing 10 to 20% of glucagon from its binding sites; thus, under these conditions, there is glucagon bound to liver membranes which does not lead to hormonal stimulation, although bound labeled glucagon is in its biologically active form and the assay conditions used are optimal for determination of hormonal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. More labeled glucagon was found to dissociate from liver membranes after 5 to 10 min of incubation in the presence of excess native unlabeled glucagon than in that of excess des-1-histidine glucagon, suggesting the existence of cooperative interactions between glucagon-specific binding sites. GTP stimulated dissociation of bound labeled glucagon from liver membranes under conditions which do not selectively affect the glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, suggesting that previously discovered effects of purine nucleotides on hormone binding and on hormonal stimulation may be unrelated phenomena. It was concluded that a large proportion (at least 80 to 90%) of the glucagon-specific sites in liver plasma membranes do not participate in the activation of adenylyl cyclase system by glucagon and that these sites cannot be called receptors until it is demonstrated that they produce an effect on cellular function. Their possible biological importance is discussed in the light of the above findings."
https://openalex.org/W1538049753,"Abstract Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is one of the major protein components associated with the erythrocyte membrane. This has been shown by activity studies of specific membrane extracts and by the specificity of iodoacetate inactivation and labeling of the enzyme. Studies on the association of the enzyme with the membrane are complicated by the tendency of the ghosts to seal under certain conditions, thus rendering the enzyme inaccessible to its substrates. This crypticity of the enzyme activity can be eliminated by detergent treatment. Sodium dodecyl sulfate is preferred, since at low concentrations it causes only minor decreases in the enzyme activity, while Triton X-100 gives more extensive inactivation at all concentrations tested. Trypsin digestion can release glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the membrane, but it also causes a fraction of the ghosts to seal. The fraction which reseals is somewhat variable between different membrane preparations and is related to the prior treatments of the membranes. Under standard hypotonic hemolysis conditions (10 mm Tris), 60 to 80% of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase remains associated with the membrane. Aldolase exhibits similar behavior, while lactic dehydrogenase and hemoglobin are almost completely released. In the presence of ATP (1 mm) the amount of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase associated with the membrane is reduced to 5 to 20%. EDTA, Ca++, Mg++, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate show little effect at concentrations of 1 mm, although release of the enzyme is promoted by these agents at higher concentrations. At 0°, solubilized glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is inactivated by ATP, a process that can be prevented if the enzyme is preincubated with NAD or if the incubation with ATP is performed at 25°. The ATP-promoted release of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase during hemolysis is not altered by preincubation with NAD or by raising the temperature to 25°. Therefore, the two phenomena (enzyme inactivation and release from the membrane) appear to be unrelated. It is postulated that the effect of ATP on enzyme release is due to a direct action of ATP on the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W177651300,"Poly(A) sequences are covalently bound to the 3′ termini of mRNA and many heterogeneous nuclear RNA molecules of HeLa cells. Localization of the poly(A) sequences has been established in these experiments by the observation that a large fraction of the label introduced in the oxidized 2′,3′-cis-glycol groups of these RNAs by sodium borohydride reduction, is recovered in the poly(A) sequences released from these RNAs by ribonucleases A and T1. Similar conclusions were reached by analyses of the 3′ ends of the poly(A) sequences released by these ribonucleases from adenosine-labeled RNAs. These same 3′ end group-labeling techniques have shown that a short poly(A) sequence of about 20 nucleotides found in heterogeneous nuclear RNA is not at the 3′ end."
https://openalex.org/W2092539344,"An angiotensin II antagonist, [1-sarcosine, 8-alanine]-angiotensin II, was given intravenously to anesthetized dogs with thoracic caval constriction and ascites to investigate the role of angiotensin II in the control of arterial pressure. The antagonist produced a striking fall in arterial pressure and in aldosterone secretion and an accompanying increase in plasma renin activity. In a control experiment, normal anesthetized dogs were given the angiotensin analog, but it failed to reduce arterial pressure or to influence plasma renin activity. In conscious dogs with caval constriction, the antagonist produced essentially the same drop in arterial pressure as observed in anesthetized animals. These results suggest an important role for angiotensin II in the maintenance of arterial pressure by its action on specific receptor sites in arteriolar smooth muscle and in the adrenal cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1505799941,"The ω-hydroxylation enzyme system of Pseudomonas oleovorans has been shown by others to catalyze the methyl group hydroxylation of alkanes and fatty acids. We have recently reported that this same enzyme system also catalyzes the epoxidation of alkenes. In the present study, a comparison of the hydroxylation and epoxidation reactions revealed that both require the three protein components (reductase, rubredoxin, and hydroxylase) of the ω-hydroxylation system. The substrate 1,7-octadiene is converted to both 7,8-epoxy-1-octene and 1,2–7,8-diepoxyoctane, whereas 1-octene is oxidized to both 7-octene-1-ol and 1,2-epoxyoctane. In addition, both 7,8-epoxy-1-octene and 1,2-epoxyoctane are oxidized by the enzyme system. Epoxidation, as found previously for hydroxylation, requires molecular oxygen, and NADPH does not substitute for NADH in either reaction. Both reactions are inhibited by cyanide and exhibit a similar pH dependence. A 1:1 molar stoichiometry was found between the amount of NADH oxidized and the amount of 7,8-epoxy-1-octene produced from 1,7-octadiene. In another experiment a 1:1 stoichiometry also was observed when the disappearance of the substrate 7,8-epoxy-1-octene was correlated with the amount of NADH oxidized. In the presence of excess O2, NADH, reductase, and rubredoxin, a competition was observed between octane and 1,7-octadiene for the hydroxylase component. Although it has not been possible so far to purify the hydroxylase to homogeneity, this study indicates that epoxidation and hydroxylation are mechanistically similar and thus may involve the same species of activated oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1572111459,"Two of the four antibody populations elicited in rabbits by human cytochrome c were isolated in relatively pure form. One is the antibody population which is present in considerable excess over the other three; it was found to block the reaction of human cytochrome c with bovine cytochrome c oxidase, one combining site blocking the oxidation of 1 molecule of cytochrome c. The reaction of cytochrome c with the succinate-cytochrome c reductase is not blocked by this antibody. The other antibody population which has been purified is that controlled by the presence of isoleucyl residue 58 in human cytochrome c, which is replaced by a threonine in the otherwise identical Macaca mulatta protein. This antibody does not block the reactions with either the cytochrome c oxidase or the cytochrome c reductase. Mixtures of Fab fragments derived from all four antibody populations block both enzymic reactions. Thus, separate areas on the surface of cytochrome c are involved in its interaction with the oxidase and reductase segments of the respiratory chain. Antibodies or Fab fragments bound at sites other than those which completely prevent the enzymic reactions cause decreases in rate, probably due to the increase in the size of the reactant from a molecular weight of 12,500 for free cytochrome c to 5 to about 13 times that much for different cytochrome c-Fab fragment or antibody complexes. In addition, in the presence of low molar ratios of unfractionated total Fab fragments to cytochrome c, increases in the rate constant for the oxidase reaction were observed. These may be due to the blockage by an antibody population of an area on the cytochrome c surface which would otherwise bind to the oxidase in a nonreactive combination. No such rate increases were detected in the reductase reaction, which followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, contrary to the complex situation with the oxidase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1599144093,"Abstract 5-Phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase was assayed in human lymphoblasts maintained in tissue culture, and some of the properties of this enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of de novo purine biosynthesis were determined. Cell-free preparations of the enzyme catalyze the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate-dependent conversion of 75 to 85 nmoles of the cosubstrate glutamine to glutamic acid per hour per mg of protein. The enzyme exhibits a dependence for magnesium ion, is stable to heating at 60° for 15 min, and exhibits a pH optimum from 6.8 to 7.4. Substrate velocity curves for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate are sigmoidal, whereas glutamine shows hyperbolic kinetics. Analysis of the data for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate by the Hill equation yields an interaction coefficient of 2, and a half-maximal velocity, S0.5, of 0.25 mm. The Km for glutamine at saturating phosphoribosylpyrophosphate concentrations is 1.6 mm. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase is subject to feedback inhibition by adenylic and guanylic acids, the ultimate products of de novo purine biosynthesis. The concentrations of AMP and GMP which inhibit enzyme activity by 50% are 1.8 and 0.5 mm, respectively. Mixtures of the two nucleotides show additive inhibition, and it is proposed that only one type of inhibitory site exists on the enzyme. Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots show GMP to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate. Presence of the nucleotide abolishes the cooperative interaction of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1498048579,"Abstract The genetically controlled expression of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]pyrene) hydroxylase induction in inbred and hybrid mice by aromatic hydrocarbons in vivo is associated, in freshly prepared oxidized microsomes, with increases in high spin cytochrome P450 having a set of electron paramagnetic resonance signals at g = 8.0, 3.7, and 1.7. Phenobarbital causes similar rises (2- to 3-fold) in both high (g = 8.0, 3.7, and 1.7) and low spin (g = 2.4, 2.3, and 1.9) hepatic P450 from any of the inbred or hybrid mice examined. Acetone treatment of microsomes in vitro destroys the g = 8.0, 3.7, 1.7 signals without affecting the hydroxylase activity, whereas Triton X-100 or sodium dodecyl sulfate affects the enzyme activity more so than the high spin signals. Substrate binding produces interconversion between high and low spin P450. In vitro treatment of microsomes with sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium deoxycholate or at 55° for 5 min causes the irreversible loss of high and low spin signals concomitant with a rise in the g = 5.95 signal. Induction of the hydroxylase activity is associated with the increased g = 8.0, 3.7, and 1.7 signal heights in the kidney from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rabbit and in the liver or kidney from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rat, but not in liver from aromatic hydrocarbon-treated rabbit. Hence, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction by polycyclic hydrocarbons and the increase in high-spin cytochrome P450 are not always necessarily related. These results indicate that aromatic hydrocarbon treatment of the genetically responsive animal, rather than treatment of any animal with aromatic hydrocarbons per se, causes an increase in a P450 species which has iron in a preferred high spin configuration. This preferred spin state may reflect a change near the P450 active site, such as the presence of new apoenzyme(s) or a different configuration. There is another high spin protein iron having a g = 5.95 signal; this most likely represents a denatured form of P450."
https://openalex.org/W1544826192,"Abstract Several factors were found which determine whether the effect of the modulator on protein kinase activity is stimulatory or inhibitory in nature. These include the kind and concentration of substrate protein, the kind and concentration of divalent metal ions, the kind and concentration of cyclic nucleotide, the source and concentration of the modulator, and the nature of the enzyme. The effects of the modulator on guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase holoenzymes were reproduced by using isolated catalytic subunits prepared from the respective holoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1534225882,"Abstract In contrast to all prokaryotic organisms previously studied, the fructose-P2 cleavage activity of crude Micrococcus aerogenes extracts was found to be insensitive to high levels of EDTA and o-phenanthroline. This observation suggested that M. aerogenes contained a Class I (Schiff base) fructose-P2 aldolase instead of the metallo (Class II)-aldolase typically found in other prokaryotes. The enzyme was purified about 1000-fold with 70% recovery. The purified aldolase, which appears essentially homogeneous by electrophoretic and gel filtration criteria, was completely active in the presence of 0.01 m EDTA and o-phenanthroline. In addition, direct Zn++ analysis on a metal-free preparation showed that a fully active enzyme sample contained only 0.01 g atom of Zn++ per mole. In contrast to Class II aldolases, the M. aerogenes enzyme lost activity on incubation with the substrate dihydroxyacetone-P in the presence of NaBH4. The degree of enzyme inactivation was directly correlated with the amount of [3H]dihydroxyacetone-P covalently bound to enzyme after treatment with NaBH4 and a stoichiometry of one dihydroxyacetone-P binding site per enzyme subunit was calculated. Identification of the substrate binding site as a lysyl residue by amino acid analysis establishes that this fructose-P2 aldolase is a Class I enzyme. The general catalytic features of the M. aerogenes enzyme resemble those of other Class I aldolases. (a) Its activity is not enhanced by the presence of K+. (b) It cleaves fructose-1-P at a significant rate (fructose-P2 to fructose-1-P activity ratio = 3.3). (c) It has a broad pH optima for fructose-P2 cleavage and a narrow optima for fructose-1-P cleavage; both pH profiles are similar to those of rabbit aldolases A and C. (d) The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for the two substrates are very similar to those of rabbit aldolases. Km (fructose-P2) = 1 x 10-6 m; Km (fructose-1-P) = 1 x 10-2 m; Vmax (fructose-P2) = 8.2 units per mg; Vmax (fructose-1-P) = 2.4 units per mg. The enzyme, however, differs from other Class I aldolases in that its fructose-P2 cleavage activity is completely insensitive to digestion with carboxypeptidase A and its activity is unaffected by treatment with sulfhydryl reagents. M. aerogenes aldolase is distinct from all aldolases previously studied in that it is composed of a single polypeptide chain. The detection of only Class II aldolase activity in other micrococcus strains (Micrococcus lactilyticus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, and Acidaminococcus fermentans) as well as all previous studies on the fructose-P2 aldolases of prokaryotic cells, suggest that the Class I aldolase described here has a very restricted distribution among the bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2041913245,"The apparent enhancement of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake by mouse 3T3 cells accompanying transformation by SV40 virus is not due primarily to an effect on the transport process but to enhanced phosphorylation of the sugar by intracellular kinases. Moreover, the effect is not specifically a function of the presence of the viral genome, but is a reflection of the overall growth rate and physiological state of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1533861596,"Abstract The presence of phenylalanine hydroxylase as a constitutive enzyme in two clonal cell lines (H4-II-E-C3 and MH1C1) derived from rat hepatomas and cultured in vitro is described; eight other clonal cell strains originating from rat or rabbit liver did not contain detectable amounts of this enzyme. The levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase in the two hepatoma cell lines were stimulated by hydrocortisone, corticosterone, dexamethasone or N6-O2'-dibutyryl-3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The stimulation of the levels of the enzyme by hydrocortisone in the H4-II-E-C3 line was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis as it was inhibited by cycloheximide. It is postulated that the hepatoma cell lines are probably good models for studying the factors regulating the expression of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1498986592,"Abstract The influence of the sodium salts of various anions on the spectral properties of acid ferricytochrome c was investigated. It was found that chaotropic anions convert the high spin form of the enzyme into a mixed spin spectral type. The following order of efficiency was established: TBA- g TCA- g ClO4- g SCN- g NO3- g Br- g Cl- (where TBA- and TCA- represent tribromoacetate and trichloroacetate ions, respectively). A correlation was shown between the action of the anions and their partial molar entropies."

https://openalex.org/W2076605248,"After intravenous injection, cytochrome c does not enter the cerebrospinal fluid. In most areas of the brain, the marker is prevented from leaving cerebral vessels by the capillary endothelium. In the choroid plexus, the marker passes freely out of capillaries into the extracellular space. However, it does not traverse tight junctions between epithelial cells and is rapidly incorporated into membrane-bound vesicles within the cell cytoplasm. Thereafter, cytochrome c is apparently removed by lysosomal degradation. These data suggest that there are at least two morphologically distinct blood-brain barriers to cytochrome c and that pinocytosis may be a mechanism for intracellular degradation rather than transcellular transport."
https://openalex.org/W1524241346,"Abstract Esherichia coli UDP-galactose 4-epimerase is inactivated by NaBH4 in a substrate-dependent reaction. Experiments with NaB3H4 show that this reaction produces enzyme-bound tritiated DPNH but little or no tritiated nucleotide sugars, which could be expected if a nucleotide ketosugar intermediate had been reduced. Upon prolonged incubation of this enzyme with substrates the catalytic activity decreases and the amount of enzymebound DPNH increases, both at the same rate. This process approaches equilibrium in about 2 hours in the presence of 3.5 x 10-3 m UDP-glucose + UDP-galactose at pH 8.5 and 27°. Under these conditions the catalytic activity has decreased by about 67% and the system exhibits the following two properties not characteristic of native enzyme. Reduction with NaB3H4 produces tritiated UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose, and intermolecular hydrogen transfer between substrates can be detected. The data establish that under these special conditions a detectable part of substrate epimerization proceeds via free UDP-4-ketosugar intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W1508773173,"Glycogen synthase phosphatase from rat heart has been partially purified by ultrafiltration techniques, and the properties of this enzyme have been examined by using an assay based on the conversion of glycogen synthase D into I. As observed in other tissues, the phosphatase from heart was activated by both Mg2+ and glucose-6-P. The specificity of this activation was examined and it was shown to be virtually identical with the specificity for activation of glycogen synthase D. In addition, Mg2+ decreased the requirement for glucose-6-P approximately 10-fold in both the phosphatase reaction and in the synthase D reaction, and both inorganic sulfate and phosphate inhibited the glucose-6-P activation of both reactions. These results were interpreted as evidence for the regulation of the phosphatase reaction by the conformational state of the substrate, glycogen synthase D. Glycogen was shown to be an inhibitor of the phosphatase and this inhibition was independent of the activation of this reaction by Mg2+ and glucose-6-P. These results indicate a complex pattern of interaction between various cellular metabolites in the regulation of glycogen synthase D dephosphorylation in heart tissue."

However, the development of metastatic tumors is markedly enhanced by prior immunization with HSV-1. Immunization with SV40, ultraviolet-irradiated tumor cells, or ultraviolet-irradiated normal hamster embryo cells inhibits the development of metastases. The HSV-hamster system appears a good one for the study of development, prevention, and control of metastases by mammalian cells transformed by a common human virus."
https://openalex.org/W2107709008,"Abstract Cycloheximide (3 to 5mm) caused a decrease in the rate of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate, lactate, or glycerol in the perfused rat and guinea pig liver. In these experiments, oxygen consumption was reduced by 30% with pyruvate but was unaltered with lactate or glycerol as substrates. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis caused by cycloheximide was rapid in onset (100% of maximal inhibition in 1 to 2 min) and immediately reversible upon cessation of cycloheximide infusion. Perfused livers were freeze-clamped in situ before and during cycloheximide infusion and the mitochondrial NAD:NADH ratio was calculated by a measurement of intermediates of the β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase couplet. There was a marked shift toward reduction of the intramitochondrial pool of nicotinamide coenzymes after cycloheximide infusion. Under these conditions, the hepatic levels of ATP, ADP, and AMP were not significantly altered by cycloheximide in livers of rats perfused with lactate. With pyruvate as substrate, the ratio of ATP:ADP was decreased although no change in AMP levels was observed. Our findings indicate that the metabolic effects of cycloheximide are rapidly reversed, with the inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis not evident after 10 min of recycling of the perfusate through the liver. Previous studies with cycloheximide have shown this compound to block mitochondrial energy transfer at Site I of the respiratory chain. It is suggested that cycloheximide decreases the rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis by an inhibition of mitochondrial energy transfer at Site I."

https://openalex.org/W1481805127,"It has been previously shown that the fructose-P2 aldolase isolated from Micrococcus aerogenes is a Class I (Schiff base) enzyme. All other prokaryotic organisms so far studied contain Class II (metallo) aldolases. Studies were undertaken to investigate whether or not this bacterial aldolase is structurally related to the Class I aldolases of higher organisms. 1. A comparison of amino acid compositions gives no indication of homology between M. aerogenes and mammalian aldolases. 2. The NH2-terminal residue of this enzyme was found to be methionine in contrast to proline which is found at the NH2 terminus of the rabbit enzymes. 3. The M. aerogenes enzyme contains lysine rather than tyrosine at the COOH terminus. 4. The tryptic peptide containing the active site lysyl residue of M. aerogenes aldolase was isolated and partially characterized. The peptide contains 28 amino acids as do the peptides of rabbit aldolases A and B. The amino acids of the M. aerogenes peptide may be aligned to obtain the maximum of 48% homology with the corresponding rabbit aldolase peptides. 5. Several of the structural distinctions between M. aerogenes and rabbit aldolases are discussed in relation to the proposed functions of tyrosine, and cysteine in the catalytic process of Class I fructose-P2 aldolases. Our results suggest extensive and perhaps fundamental differences between the M. aerogenes enzyme and the Class I aldolases of mammals. The extent of relationship between this prokaryotic enzyme and the fructose-P2 aldolases of higher organisms must await more thorough structural analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1488842538,"Abstract Analogs of PPi in which the bridge oxygen is replaced by imido, methylene, or α,ω-glycol linkages are not substrates for crystalline yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase. Apparent competitive inhibition of Mg2+-activated PPi hydrolysis is observed with imidodiphosphate and with the C1 and C2 members of the α,ω-glycol diphosphate series, methanediol diphosphate and 1,2-ethanediol diphosphate. Methylene diphosphonate, two of its C-substituted derivatives, and the C3 and C4 members of the α,ω-glycol diphosphate series are not inhibitory under the conditions employed, which are near optimal for PPi hydrolysis. Specificity for inhibitors is not markedly broader than specificity for substrate, and, like substrate specificity, is maximal in the presence of Mg2+ as activating ion. No evidence could be obtained for phosphoryl transfer to any acceptor other than water. Using 32PPi in a variety of conditions, several types of assays failed to detect formation of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate in the reaction. The results are interpreted as favoring a concerted mechanism for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1505580423,"The effects of various dietary and hormonal treatments on mitochondrial and cytosol histidine-pyruvate aminotransferases have been compared. In rats injected for 3 days with glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), mitochondrial histidine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity increased 70-fold and 48-fold, respectively, compared with 16- and 9-fold increases in the cytosol activity. Both mitochondrial and cytosol activities increased slightly in response to epinephrine, or alloxan, but neither enzyme was influenced significantly by the feeding of a high protein diet. The administration of insulin resulted in a slight decrease in both activities. In rats injected with cortisol, the activity of the cytosol enzyme doubled; a synergistic response was observed when cortisol was administered with glucagon. Cortisol had no effect at all on the mitochondrial activity. Adrenalectomy decreased the cytosol activity, but did not influence the mitochondrial one. Adrenalectomized or diabetic rats were still responsive to glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Although they have not been purified, the differential response of the two activities to hormones, along with reports that the enzymes exhibit different pH activity profiles and different Km values for both substrates, suggest that the mitochondrial and cytosol histidine-pyruvate aminotransferases are different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2120009518,"Abstract The effect of fatty acids and ketones on 35SO4 incorporation into the chondromucoproteins of embryonic chicken cartilage was studied in vitro. Both the nonstimulated incorporation (that occurring in media without added serum) and sulfation factor stimulated incorporation (that occurring in media with 5.0% rat serum added) were investigated. Butyrate and octanoate, from 0.01 mm to 1.0 mm, had minimal effects on nonstimulated 35SO4 incorporation. At 5.0 mm both caused moderate inhibition of 35SO4 incorporation into the cartilage. In the serum stimulated state, butyrate and octanoate, at 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, and 5.0 mm, resulted in striking dose-related inhibition of 35SO4 incorporation. Palmitate and oleate from 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm had no effect on nonstimulated 35SO4 incorporation, but did cause marked inhibition of the serum-stimulated component of 35SO4 incorporation. β-Hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetate, from 0.1 mm to 5.0 mm, had no effect on either nonstimulated or serum-stimulated 35SO4 incorporation. 35SO4 incorporation into cartilage chondromucoproteins was independent of glucose over a concentration range of 2.5 mm to 15.0 mm. In the absence of glucose in the medium, nonstimulated 35SO4 incorporation was markedly inhibited, but the incremental increase stimulated by rat serum was unaffected. The inhibitory effect of butyrate on serum-stimulated 35SO4 incorporation is reversible and this indicates that the fatty acid effect is not a nonspecific toxic action. The data suggest that fatty acids may regulate the synthesis of chondromucoproteins in cartilage and in this way dissociate the lipolytic and glucose mobilizing effects of growth hormone from its stimulation of growth. Though the locus of action of fatty acids on 35SO4 incorporation is unknown, it may be at the site of the action of sulfation factor."

https://openalex.org/W1533850030,"Abstract Incubation of UDP-galactose with substrate amounts of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) from Escherichia coli for different times between 2 and 120 min, followed by reduction with NaB3H4 invariably yields a mixture of labeled UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. Chemical degradation of tritiated hexoses, isolated after NaB3H4 reduction of 2-min incubation mixtures, shows all of the tritium associated with carbon 4, in agreement with the results presented earlier using longer incubation times (Maitra, U. S., and Ankel, H. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 68, 2660). The total amount of label introduced after 2 min of incubation, when enzyme activity is practically unchanged, is considerably less than that after 120 min of incubation, when enzyme activity is reduced to about 50%. The excess of labeled UDP-hexoses after 120 min of incubation can be quantitatively related to the amount of inactive enzyme formed, assuming that during inactivation additional UDP-4-ketohexose is produced in amounts equivalent to the amounts of inactive enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1529718868,"Abstract A mechanism for regulating the rate of NAD-linked substrate oxidation in isolated liver mitochondria was investigated. Addition of oligomycin and α-ketoglutarate to isolated uncoupled rat liver mitochondria oxidizing an NAD-linked substrate such as l(-)-palmitylcarnitine plus l-malate caused an abrupt inhibition of oxygen consumption and of citrate, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate synthesis. This respiratory inhibition was nonspecific for NAD-linked substrates and was not observed with flavin-linked substrates such as succinate. The molecular species which was responsible for the inhibition of NAD-linked substrate oxidation was established as guanosine triphosphate by four types of experiments: (a) the intramitochondrial GTP level increased coincident with the establishment of the inhibited state; (b) the induction of the inhibitory state was prevented, or released, or both, upon the inclusion of exogenous ADP in the mitochondrial incubation, presumably due to the reaction of ADP and GTP with the nucleoside diphosphokinase forming ATP and GDP; (c) the establishment of the respiratory inhibition was not observed in guinea pig liver mitochondria in the presence of a source of oxalacetate for phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis by the GTP-requiring phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; and (d) addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to reverse the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase reaction resulted in the synthesis of GTP and caused an abrupt inhibition of l(-)-palmitylcarnitine oxidation in isolated guinea pig liver mitochondria. This respiratory inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate addition was prevented by including l-malate or ADP in the incubation mixture. The experiments described in this communication suggest that the intramitochondrial GTP level may be a potent regulator of the flux of reducing equivalents derived from the primary NAD-linked dehydrogenases into the electron transfer chain and the consequential generation of ATP in the oxidative phosphorylation sequence of the mitochondrion."
