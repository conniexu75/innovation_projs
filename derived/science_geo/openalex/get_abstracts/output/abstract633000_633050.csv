https://openalex.org/W2945583287,"Identifying people at risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is a cornerstone of preventative cardiology. Risk prediction models currently recommended by clinical guidelines are typically based on a limited number of predictors with sub-optimal performance across all patient groups. Data-driven techniques based on machine learning (ML) might improve the performance of risk predictions by agnostically discovering novel risk predictors and learning the complex interactions between them. We tested (1) whether ML techniques based on a state-of-the-art automated ML framework (AutoPrognosis) could improve CVD risk prediction compared to traditional approaches, and (2) whether considering non-traditional variables could increase the accuracy of CVD risk predictions.Using data on 423,604 participants without CVD at baseline in UK Biobank, we developed a ML-based model for predicting CVD risk based on 473 available variables. Our ML-based model was derived using AutoPrognosis, an algorithmic tool that automatically selects and tunes ensembles of ML modeling pipelines (comprising data imputation, feature processing, classification and calibration algorithms). We compared our model with a well-established risk prediction algorithm based on conventional CVD risk factors (Framingham score), a Cox proportional hazards (PH) model based on familiar risk factors (i.e, age, gender, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes, reception of treatments for hypertension and body mass index), and a Cox PH model based on all of the 473 available variables. Predictive performances were assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Overall, our AutoPrognosis model improved risk prediction (AUC-ROC: 0.774, 95% CI: 0.768-0.780) compared to Framingham score (AUC-ROC: 0.724, 95% CI: 0.720-0.728, p < 0.001), Cox PH model with conventional risk factors (AUC-ROC: 0.734, 95% CI: 0.729-0.739, p < 0.001), and Cox PH model with all UK Biobank variables (AUC-ROC: 0.758, 95% CI: 0.753-0.763, p < 0.001). Out of 4,801 CVD cases recorded within 5 years of baseline, AutoPrognosis was able to correctly predict 368 more cases compared to the Framingham score. Our AutoPrognosis model included predictors that are not usually considered in existing risk prediction models, such as the individuals' usual walking pace and their self-reported overall health rating. Furthermore, our model improved risk prediction in potentially relevant sub-populations, such as in individuals with history of diabetes. We also highlight the relative benefits accrued from including more information into a predictive model (information gain) as compared to the benefits of using more complex models (modeling gain).Our AutoPrognosis model improves the accuracy of CVD risk prediction in the UK Biobank population. This approach performs well in traditionally poorly served patient subgroups. Additionally, AutoPrognosis uncovered novel predictors for CVD disease that may now be tested in prospective studies. We found that the ""information gain"" achieved by considering more risk factors in the predictive model was significantly higher than the ""modeling gain"" achieved by adopting complex predictive models."
https://openalex.org/W2946240926,"The adsorption of rhodamine B (RhB) using acid modified banana peels has been examined. Chemical characteristics of the adsorbents were observed in order to determine active functional groups. The major functional groups on the surface were OH, C = O, C = C and C-O-C. Interactions between operational parameters were studied using the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The predictions of the model output indicated that operational factors influenced responses at a confidence level of 95% (P<0.05). The optimum conditions for adsorption were pH 2 at a 0.2 g/L dose within 60 minutes of contact time. Isotherm studies were carried out using the optimized process variables. The data revealed that RhB adsorption fitted the Langmuir isotherm equation while the reduction of COD followed the Freundlich isotherm. Kinetic experiments fitted the pseudo second order model for RhB removal and COD reduction. The adsorption mechanism was not the only rate controlling step. Diffusion through the boundary layer described the pattern of adsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2946653329,"Aligned collagen architecture is a characteristic feature of the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) and has been shown to facilitate cancer metastasis using 3D in vitro models. Additional features of the ECM, such as pore size and stiffness, have also been shown to influence cellular behavior and are implicated in cancer progression. While there are several methods to produce aligned matrices to study the effect on cell behavior in vitro, it is unclear how the alignment itself may alter these other important features of the matrix. In this study, we have generated aligned collagen matrices and characterized their pore sizes and mechanical properties at the micro- and macro-scale. Our results indicate that collagen alignment can alter pore-size of matrices depending on the polymerization temperature of the collagen. Furthermore, alignment does not affect the macro-scale stiffness but alters the micro-scale stiffness in a temperature independent manner. Overall, these results describe the manifestation of confounding variables that arise due to alignment and the importance of fully characterizing biomaterials at both micro- and macro-scales."
https://openalex.org/W2945105471,"Student evaluations of teaching are widely believed to contain gender bias. In this study, we conduct a randomized experiment with the student evaluations of teaching in four classes with large enrollments, two taught by male instructors and two taught by female instructors. In each of the courses, students were randomly assigned to either receive the standard evaluation instrument or the same instrument with language intended to reduce gender bias. Students in the anti-bias language condition had significantly higher rankings of female instructors than students in the standard treatment. There were no differences between treatment groups for male instructors. These results indicate that a relatively simple intervention in language can potentially mitigate gender bias in student evaluation of teaching."
https://openalex.org/W2945221663,"In this study, the photocatalytic treatment of an organic wastewater with/without phenolic compounds by means of ultraviolet irradiation, titanium dioxide and hydrogen peroxide was examined in an annular photoreactor. Specifically, the effect of initial total carbon concentration, catalyst loading and H2O2 amount on the removal of total carbon was first examined in the case of a synthetic organic wastewater. The influence of partial carbon substitution by phenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-discholophenol, trichlorophenol, and 4-nitrophenol on total carbon removal and target compounds' conversion was studied keeping constant the initial organic carbon load. It was shown that the process applied was effective in treating the wastewater for initial total carbon 32 mg L-1, 0.5 g L-1 TiO2, and 66.6 mg L-1 H2O2. Applying UV/TiO2 and UV/H2O2, 58% and 53% total carbon removals were achieved, respectively, but combining TiO2 and H2O2 did not result in a better performance in the case of the synthetic wastewater without any phenolic compounds. In contrast, when a phenolic compound was added, the addition of H2O2 was beneficial, eliminating the differences observed from one phenolic compound to another. The total carbon removals observed were lower than the corresponding final conversions of the target phenolic compounds. Finally, the electric energy per order values were calculated and found to range in 52-248 kWh/m3/order, being dependent from the process applied and the phenolic compound present in the wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2945134012,"Gastroretentive (GR) systems are designed to prolong gastric residence time to allow sustained absorption and improve the oral bioavailability of drugs with a narrow absorption window in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. The present study aimed to develop a GR system for acyclovir using 3D printing technology and evaluate its in vivo pharmacokinetics after oral administration in Beagle dogs. The system consisted of a gastro-floating device, which can float in the gastric fluid, prepared by a fused deposition modeling 3D printer and conventional acyclovir sustained-release (SR) tablet. The acyclovir SR tablet was inserted to the floating device to allow sustained release of the drug in the stomach. The buoyancy and sustained-release property of the developed GR system were determined using an in vitro dissolution test, in vivo pharmacokinetic study, and abdominal X-ray imaging in Beagle dogs. The in vivo dissolution profiles of the GR system were also predicted based on the in vivo pharmacokinetic data using a population pharmacokinetic (POP-PK) model. In the dissolution test, the sustained-release characteristic of the GR system was identified with a time corresponding to 80% dissolution (T80) of 2.52 h. Following oral administration of the GR system, the time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) of acyclovir was significantly prolonged, whereas the maximum concentration (Cmax) decreased and the area under the curve increased compared with those obtained after the administration of immediate-release and SR tablets, indicating prolonged absorption. By X-ray imaging, we showed that the developed GR system stayed in the stomach for more than 12 h. The POP-PK model successfully described the observed plasma concentration-time data and predicted the in vivo biphasic dissolution profiles of the GR system, which was significantly different from the in vitro dissolution. The developed GR system could be applied to various drugs and had great prospects in the design and development of novel controlled-release formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2946474118,"Aims We analysed the changes in force-velocity-power variables and jump performance in response to an individualized training program based on the force-velocity imbalance (FVimb). In particular, we investigated (i) the individual adaptation kinetics to reach the optimal profile and (ii) de-training kinetics over the three weeks following the end of the training program. Methods Sixty subjects were assigned to four sub-groups according to their initial FVimb: high or low force-deficit (FD) and high or low velocity-deficit (VD). The duration of training intervention was set so that each individual reached their “Optimal force-velocity (F-v) profile”. Mechanical and performance variables were measured every 3 weeks during the program, and every week after the end of the individualized program. Results All subjects in the FD sub-groups showed extremely large increases in maximal theoretical force output (+30±16.6% Mean±SD; ES = 2.23±0.28), FVimb reduction (-74.3±54.7%; ES = 2.17±0.27) and large increases in jump height (+12.4±7.6%; ES = 1.45±0.23). For the VD sub-groups, we observed moderate to extremely large increases in maximal theoretical velocity (+15.8±5.1%; ES = 2.72±0.29), FVimb reduction (-19.2±6.9%; ES = 2.36±0.35) and increases in jump height (+10.1±2.7%; ES = 0.93±0.09). The number of weeks needed to reach the optimal F-v profile (12.6 ± 4.6) was correlated to the magnitude of initial FVimb (r = 0.82, p<0.01) for all participants regardless of their initial subgroup. No significant change in mechanical variables or jump performance was observed over the 3-week de-training period. Conclusions Collectively, these results provide useful insights into a more specific, individualized (i.e. based on the type and magnitude of FVimb) and accurate training prescription for jumping performance. Considering both training content and training duration together with FVimb may enable more individualized, specific and effective training monitoring and periodization."
https://openalex.org/W2921898618,"Consistent confirmations obtained independently of each other lend credibility to a scientific result. We refer to results satisfying this consistency as reproducible and assume that reproducibility is a desirable property of scientific discovery. Yet seemingly science also progresses despite irreproducible results, indicating that the relationship between reproducibility and other desirable properties of scientific discovery is not well understood. These properties include early discovery of truth, persistence on truth once it is discovered, and time spent on truth in a long-term scientific inquiry. We build a mathematical model of scientific discovery that presents a viable framework to study its desirable properties including reproducibility. In this framework, we assume that scientists adopt a model-centric approach to discover the true model generating data in a stochastic process of scientific discovery. We analyze the properties of this process using Markov chain theory, Monte Carlo methods, and agent-based modeling. We show that the scientific process may not converge to truth even if scientific results are reproducible and that irreproducible results do not necessarily imply untrue results. The proportion of different research strategies represented in the scientific population, scientists’ choice of methodology, the complexity of truth, and the strength of signal contribute to this counter-intuitive finding. Important insights include that innovative research speeds up the discovery of scientific truth by facilitating the exploration of model space and epistemic diversity optimizes across desirable properties of scientific discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2945668793,"The rare ginsenoside Rk3 is a bioactive component derived from ginseng and Panax notoginseng that has been proven to possess anti-lung cancer activity. However, the effect of Rk3 on human esophageal cancer has not yet been reported. In this study, we aimed to explore its anticancer curative effect and potential molecular mechanisms in the Eca109 and KYSE150 cell lines. We found that Rk3 was able to significantly repress cell proliferation and colony formation in both Eca109 and KYSE150 cells in vitro. In the KYSE150 xenograft model, Rk3 obviously inhibited tumor growth and exhibited little toxicity in organs. Moreover, Rk3 could trigger G1 phase arrest and induce apoptosis and autophagy. Interestingly, apoptosis induced by Rk3 could be partly abrogated by 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor), implying that autophagy could enhance apoptosis. Further studies indicated that pretreatment with the Akt inhibitor GSK690693 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin promoted Rk3-induced apoptosis and autophagy, demonstrating that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is related to Rk3-induced apoptosis and autophagy. In conclusion, the present study is the first to clarify that Rk3 can inhibit Eca109 and KYSE150 cell proliferation through activating apoptosis and autophagy by blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, suggesting that Rk3 may be a promising antitumor agent for esophageal cancer. In addition, this study provides ideas and an experimental basis for further research on the anti-esophageal cancer effects of the ginsenoside Rk3 and its mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2945086285,"Political trust is a perennially important concern and the events of the last few years have, in many ways, heightened this importance. The relevant scholarship has done much to meet this challenge but continues to struggle with definitional unclarities and an inability to provide accounts that consistently operate as expected. The current research seeks to test the potential of a classic model of trust from the organizational sciences that makes specific arguments regarding the psychological nature and mechanisms of the construct in helping to address these concerns. Using data from a national convenience sample, we provide preliminary evidence which suggests that measures and models addressing this theoretical account of psychological trust form unidimensional and reliable measures that may more precisely explain the process of political trust and outperform current measures in predicting relevant correlates. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of our work and, in so doing, lay a foundation for a new research agenda for political trust."
https://openalex.org/W2946628383,"To demonstrate and describe fetal head molding and brain shape changes during delivery, we used three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3D finite element mesh reconstructions to compare the fetal head between prelabor and the second stage of labor. A total of 27 pregnant women were examined with 3D MRI sequences before going into labor using a 1 Tesla open field MRI. Seven of these patients subsequently had another set of 3D MRI sequences during the second stage of labor. Volumes of 2D images were transformed into finite element 3D reconstructions. Polygonal meshes for each part of the fetal body were used to study fetal head molding and brain shape changes. Varying degrees of fetal head molding were present in the infants of all seven patients studied during the second phase of labor compared with the images acquired before birth. The cranial deformation, however, was no longer observed after birth in five out of the seven newborns, whose post-natal cranial parameters were identical to those measured before delivery. The changing shape of the fetal brain following the molding process and constraints on the brain tissue were observed in all the fetuses. Of the three fetuses presenting the greatest molding of the skull bones and brain shape deformation, two were delivered by cesarean-section (one after a forceps failure and one for engagement default), while the fetus presenting with the greatest skull molding and brain shape deformation was born physiologically. This study demonstrates the value of 3D MRI study with 3D finite element mesh reconstruction during the second stage of labor to reveal how the fetal brain is impacted by the molding of the cranial bones. Fetal head molding was systematically observed when the fetal head was engaged between the superior pelvic strait and the middle brim."
https://openalex.org/W2946616145,"Originally, online public engagement with science tended to be one directional—from experts to the general population via news media. Such an arrangement allowed for little to no direct interaction between the public and scientists. However, the emergence of social media has opened the door to meaningful engagement between scientists and the general public. The current study examines scientists’ perspectives on the interactions between laypeople and scientists by asking questions and sharing information on social media platforms, specifically, through Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions on Reddit’s “Science” subreddit (r/science). By analyzing the content of six different r/science AMAs and surveying scientists who participated as r/science AMA hosts, our research attempts to gain a richer understanding of direct communication between scientists and lay audiences online. We had three main questions: (1) who are the participant scientists hosting r/science AMAs, (2) what are their experiences like as hosts, and (3) what type of discussions do they have on this platform? Survey results suggested that these scientists recognize the promising interactive nature of Reddit and are interested in continuing to use this platform as a tool for public engagement. Survey respondents generally had positive experiences as AMA hosts, but further research is needed to examine negative experiences. Overall, this study has significant implications for how scientists can engage public audiences online and more effectively communicate scientific findings to the general populace."
https://openalex.org/W2946570840,"The major histocompatibility complex region has been suggested to play an important role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). In this study, we investigated the associations of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and amino acid variants of HLA with early-onset AITD. HLA class I and class II genes were analyzed in 116 Korean children with AITDs (Graves’ disease [GD]: 71, Hashimoto’s disease [HD]: 45) and 142 healthy controls. HLA-B*46:01 (OR = 3.96, Pc = 0.008), -C*01:02 (OR = 2.51 Pc = 0.04), -DPB1*02:02 (OR = 3.99, Pc = 0.04), and -DPB1*05:01 (OR = 4.6, Pc = 0.003) were significantly associated with GD, and HLA-A*02:07 (OR = 4.68, Pc = 0.045) and -DPB1*02:02 (OR = 6.57, Pc = 0.0001) with HD. The frequency of HLA-DPB1*05:01 was significantly higher in GD patients than in HD patients (Pc = 0.0005). Furthermore, differences were found between patients with Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and those without TAO in the distribution of HLA-B*54:01 (8.6% vs. 30.6%, P = 0.04) and -C*03:03 (37.1% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.02). In the analysis of amino acid variants of HLA molecules, both Leu35 (OR = 23.38, P = 0.0002) and Glu55 (OR = 23.38, P = 0.0002) of HLA-DPB1 were strongly associated with GD and showed different distributions between GD and HD (P = 0.001). Our results suggest that HLA alleles, especially amino-acid signatures of the HLA-DP β chain, might contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of early-onset AITD."
https://openalex.org/W2945998151,"Should females alter their reproductive strategy when attacked by pathogens? Two hypotheses provide opposite predictions. Terminal reproductive investment theory predicts that reproduction should increase when the risk of death increases. However, physiological trade-offs between reproduction and immune function might be expected to produce a decrease in reproduction during a robust immune response. There is evidence for both hypotheses. We examine whether age determines the effect of an immune challenge on reproductive strategy in long-winged females of the Texas field cricket, Gryllus texensis, when fed an ecologically valid (i.e. limited) diet. The limited diet reduced reproductive output. However, even under resource-limited conditions, immune challenge had no effect on the reproductive output of young or middle-aged females. Both reproductive output and immune function (lysozyme-like activity and phenoloxidase (PO) activity) increased with age, which is contrary to both hypotheses. We hypothesize that PO activity is pleiotropic and represents an investment in both reproduction and immune function. Three proPO genes (identified in a published RNA-seq dataset (transcriptome)) were expressed either in the fat body or the ovaries (supporting the hypothesis that PO is bifunctional). The possible bifunctionality of PO suggests that it may not be an appropriate immune measure for studies on immune/reproductive trade-offs. This study also suggests that the threshold for terminal reproductive investment may not decrease prior to senescence in some species."
https://openalex.org/W2946005816,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section, and identify the critical period in which pregnancy-specific anxiety will affect the elective cesarean section. Primiparous women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy were invited to participate in the cohort. General information on maternal socio-demographic characteristics and environmental exposure were collected using questionnaires. Pregnancy-specific anxiety was assessed by using pregnancy-specific anxiety questionnaire in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively. Delivery modes and pregnancy complications were abstracted from medical notes. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to examine the relationship between pregnancy-specific anxiety and elective cesarean section. Results indicated the overall elective cesarean section rate in this study was 45%. Among 1 874 pregnant women, 30.9% women experienced anxiety at least once during pregnancy, and 6.9% women suffered from anxiety in all three trimesters. Anxiety in the 2nd trimester was a significant predictor for elective cesarean section. Young maternal age and low educational level had indirect effects on women’s choice of elective caesarean section through affecting pregnancy-specific anxiety. More attention should be paid to maternal psychological problems, and professional counseling needs to be strengthened to protect women from pregnancy-specific anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2952503294,"Background Being born small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) has short and long term metabolic consequences. There is a growing interest in the extent to which body composition, both in the short and the long term, differs in infants born at the extremes of these birth weights. Methods Body composition in 25 SGA and 25 LGA infants were assessed during the first days of life and at 3–4 months of age using air displacement plethysmography. Results SGA infants had significantly lower body fat (%) at birth compared to LGA infants. SGA infants increased their body weight and length at a significantly higher rate between birth and 3–4 months than LGA infants. Fat mass (g) in SGA infants increased 23 times between birth and 3–4 months of age compared to 2.8 times for LGA infants. At 3–4 months of age LGA infants reached a threshold in body fat (%) while SGA infants were still gaining body fat (%). Conclusion Several significant differences have been identified between SGA and LGA infants, indicating that the effects of intrauterine life continues to play an important role in body composition and growth during the first 3–4 months of life."
https://openalex.org/W2946187295,"It is hypothesized that tool-assisted excavation of plant underground storage organs (USOs) played an adaptive role in hominin evolution and was also once considered a uniquely human behavior. Recent data indicate that savanna chimpanzees also use tools to excavate edible USOs. However, those chimpanzees remain largely unhabituated and we lack direct observations of this behavior in the wild. To fill this gap in our knowledge of hominoid USO extractive foraging, we conducted tool-mediated excavation experiments with captive chimpanzees naïve to this behavior. We presented the chimpanzees with the opportunity to use tools in order to excavate artificially-placed underground foods in their naturally forested outdoor enclosure. No guidance or demonstration was given to the chimpanzees at any time. The chimpanzees used tools spontaneously in order to excavate the underground foods. They exhibited six different tool use behaviors in the context of excavation: probe, perforate, dig, pound, enlarge and shovel. However, they still excavated manually more often than they did with tools. Chimpanzees were selective in their choice of tools that we provided, preferring longer tools for excavation. They also obtained their own tools mainly from naturally occurring vegetation and transported them to the excavation site. They reused some tools throughout the study. Our new data provide a direction for the study of variables relevant to modeling USO extractive foraging by early hominins."
https://openalex.org/W2946474461,"Early determination of the severity of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is essential for better disease prognosis. Current predictors are suboptimal, and their clinical utility remains to be defined, highlighting the need for developing biomarkers with efficacious prognostic value. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with a documented regulatory role in immune defense and maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity. For early diagnose of CAP and recognition of severe CAP patients, we conduct this pilot study to access the potential utility of the circulating S1P in an Emergency department setting. In the prospective study, plasma S1P levels were quantified in healthy controls and patients with CAP. Also, their discriminating power was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. The association between S1P levels and disease severity indices was assessed by Spearman correlation and logistic regression tests. Patients with CAP had significantly higher plasma S1P levels than healthy individuals (CAP: 27.54 ng/ml, IQR = 14.37-49.99 ng/ml; Controls: 10.58 ng/ml, IQR = 4.781-18.91 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). S1P levels were inversely correlated with disease severity in patients with CAP. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, the plasma S1P concentrations showed significant predicting power for mortality (OR: 0.909; CI: 0.801-0.985; p < 0.05), intensive care unit admission (OR: 0.89; CI: 0.812-0.953; p < 0.005) and long hospital stay (OR: 0.978; CI: 0.961-0.992; p < 0.005). Interestingly, significantly elevated levels of S1P were noted in patients who received methylprednisolone treatment during hospitalization. These results suggest that S1P may be associated with the pathogenesis of CAP and may have prognostic utility in CAP and its therapy, especially in the Emergency Department setting."
https://openalex.org/W2946706915,"In many salmonid species, age and size at maturation is plastic and influenced by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Hatchery reared salmon often mature at an earlier age and smaller size than wild fish. Modern salmon conservation efforts have focused on managing the level of gene flow between hatchery and natural origin fish to minimize potential genotypic and phenotypic change. In salmonids, maturation probability is dependent on exceeding a genetically set threshold in growth rate and energetic status (and by association, body size) referred to as the probabalisitic maturation reaction norm (PMRN). Over fourteen years, we monitored the frequency of age-2 precocious male maturation (common term: age-2 minijack rate) and the PMRN of natural founder (FNDR), integrated natural-hatchery (INT), and segregated hatchery (SEG) broodlines of spring Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. The average age-2 minijack rate (± SEM) of the FNDR, INT and SEG broodlines was 48.2 ± 5.2%, 41.9 ± 3.6% and 30.9 ± 4.7%, respectively. Additionally, the PMRN WP50 (predicted weight at 50% maturation) of the SEG broodline was significantly greater (20.5 g) than that of the FNDR/INT broodlines (18.2 g). We also conducted a common garden experiment exploring the effects of less than one [INT (0-1)], one [SEG (1)] or two [SEG (2)] generations of hatchery culture on the age-2 minijack rate and PMRN WP50. Growth was not significantly different among broodlines, but age-2 minijack rates were significantly lower following two consecutive generations of hatchery culture: [INT (0-1): 68.3 ± 1.7%], [SEG (1): 70.3 ± 1.8%] and [SEG (2): 58.6 ± 0.4%] and the PMRN WP50 was significantly higher by 6.1 g after two generations of SEG culture. These results indicate that managed gene flow reduces phenotypic divergence, but may serve to maintain potentially undesirably high age-2 minijack rates in salmon conservation hatchery programs."
https://openalex.org/W2950356076,"Ulva prolifera, a type of marine macroalgae, is the causative species behind green tides mainly in the Yellow Sea and adjacent regions. Nevertheless, it can be used as food or animal feed in South China. The vegetative fragments of U. prolifera are an important seed source for successive green tide blooms. Fragmentation shortens the transition time from the vegetative state to the reproductive state. However, the translation of the algal metabolites during gametogenesis is far from well understood. In this study, the dynamic metabolic profiles of U. prolifera thallus during fragmentation-induced proliferation were investigated using non-targeted metabolomics approach via a series of time course experiments in June 2017. After a 30 min low temperature shock, fragmentation induced a reproductive response of 91.57% of U. prolifera in 48 h, whereas the value was only 21.43% in the control group. A total of 156 chromatographic peaks were detected, and 63 metabolites were significantly changed in U. prolifera during reproduction. Aanlysis of the kinetic metabolic pattern showed that the fragments not only induced the formation of sporangia, but also led to complex metabolite accumulation. During fragmentation-induced proliferation, U. prolifera consumed different sugars at different time points. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid, gallic acid, and malic acid may play important roles in germ cell formation and in the release of U. prolifera, whereas n-hexanol, 2-methyl-3-phenylindole, and 3-indoleacetonitrile may be beneficial for biotic stress resistance. Compared with the control group, in the treatment group, metabolites such as alcohols and organic acids also showed significant difference with the photoperiod at the initial stage of proliferation (before 60 h). In conclusion, changes in the levels of metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, and alcohol with photoperiod may be the strategy adopted by U. prolifera to cope with fragmentation in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2945504903,"Mucins and their glycosylation have been suggested to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. We examined potentially functional genetic variants in the mucin genes or genes involved in their glycosylation with respect to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and clinical outcome. We genotyped 23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 123 SNPs through pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.80) in the MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, and B3GNT6 genes in a hospital-based case-control study of 1532 CRC cases and 1108 healthy controls from the Czech Republic. We also analyzed these SNPs in relation to overall survival and event-free survival in a subgroup of 672 patients. Among patients without distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis, two MUC4 SNPs, rs3107764 and rs842225, showed association with overall survival (HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.08-1.82, additive model, log-rank p = 0.004 and HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.42-0.99, recessive model, log-rank p = 0.01, respectively) and event-free survival (HR 1.31, 95%CI 1.03-1.68, log-rank p = 0.004 and HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.42-0.96, log-rank p = 0.006, respectively) after adjustment for age, sex and TNM stage. Our data suggest that genetic variation especially in the transmembrane mucin gene MUC4 may play a role in the survival of CRC and further studies are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2946100213,"Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic system. It delivers cellular components to lysosomes for degradation and supplies nutrients that promote cell survival under stress conditions. Although much is known regarding starvation-induced autophagy, the regulation of autophagy by cellular energy level is less clear. BRUCE is an ubiquitin conjugase and ligase with multi-functionality. It has been reported that depletion of BRUCE inhibits starvation-induced autophagy by blockage of the fusion step. Herein we report a new function for BRUCE in the dual regulation of autophagy and cellular energy. Depletion of BRUCE alone (without starvation) in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells elevated autophagic activity as indicted by the increased LC3B-II protein and its autophagic puncta as well as further increase of both by chloroquine treatment. Such elevation results from enhanced induction of autophagy since the numbers of both autophagosomes and autolysosomes were increased, and recruitment of ATG16L onto the initiating membrane structure phagophores was increased. This concept is further supported by elevated lysosomal enzyme activities. In contrast to starvation-induced autophagy, BRUCE depletion did not block fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes as indicated by increased lysosomal cleavage of the GFP-LC3 fusion protein. Mechanistically, BRUCE depletion lowered the cellular energy level as indicated by both a higher ratio of AMP/ATP and the subsequent activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK (pThr-172). The lower energy status co-occurred with AMPK-specific phosphorylation and activation of the autophagy initiating kinase ULK1 (pSer-555). Interestingly, the higher autophagic activity by BRUCE depletion is coupled with enhanced cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer PEO4 cells. Taken together, BRUCE depletion promotes induction of autophagy by lowering cellular energy and activating the AMPK-ULK1-autophagy axis, which could contribute to ovarian cancer chemo-resistance. This study establishes a BRUCE-AMPK-ULK1 axis in the regulation of energy metabolism and autophagy, as well as provides insights into cancer chemo-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2945118024,"The importance of planktonic microbial communities is well acknowledged, since they are fundamental for several natural processes of aquatic ecosystems. Microorganisms naturally control the flux of nutrients, and also degrade and recycle anthropogenic organic and inorganic contaminants. Nevertheless, climate change effects and/or the runoff of nutrients/pollutants can affect the equilibrium of natural microbial communities influencing the occurrence of microbial pathogens and/or microbial toxin producers, which can compromise ecosystem environmental status. Therefore, improved microbial plankton monitoring is essential to better understand how these communities respond to environmental shifts. The study of marine microbial communities typically involves highly cost and time-consuming sampling procedures, which can limit the frequency of sampling and data availability. In this context, we developed and validated an in situ autonomous biosampler (IS-ABS) able to collect/concentrate in situ planktonic communities of different size fractions (targeting prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes) for posterior genomic, metagenomic, and/or transcriptomic analysis at a home laboratory. The IS-ABS field prototype is a small size and compact system able to operate up to 150 m depth. Water is pumped by a micropump (TCS MG2000) through a hydraulic circuit that allows in situ filtration of environmental water in one or more Sterivex filters placed in a filter cartridge. The IS-ABS also includes an application to program sampling definitions, allowing pre-setting configuration of the sampling. The efficiency of the IS-ABS was tested against traditional laboratory filtration standardized protocols. Results showed a good performance in terms of DNA recovery, as well as prokaryotic (16S rDNA) and eukaryotic (18S rDNA) community diversity analysis, using either methodologies. The IS-ABS automates the process of collecting environmental DNA, and is suitable for integration in water observation systems, what will contribute to substantially increase biological surveillances. Also, the use of highly sensitive genomic approaches allows a further study of the diversity and functions of whole or specific microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2946509800,"Aims were to investigate sensitivity of various human and canine cancer cell lines to hyperthermia and the influence of particular treatment conditions, and to analyze the DNA-damage response and mode of cell death in cell line radiosensitized by hyperthermia. Additionally, we were interested in the involvement of HSP70 in radiosensitization.Radiosensitization by hyperthermia was determined in a panel of human and canine cancer cell lines using clonogenic cell survival assay, as well as levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs) using immunoblotting. The influence of the hyperthermia-radiotherapy time gap, different temperatures and the order of treatments on clonogenicity of hyperthermia-sensitive A549 cells was investigated. Additionally, DNA damage and cell death were assessed by Comet assay and an apoptosis/necrosis assay. Further we induced transient knockdown in A549 cells to test HSP70's involvement in radiosensitization.Out of eight cell lines tested, only two (A549 and Abrams) showed significant decrease in clonogenic cell survival when pre-treated with hyperthermia at 42°C. Strong induction of HSP70 upon thermoradiotherapy (HT-RT) treatment was found in all cell lines. Transient knockdown of HSP70 in A549 cells did not result in decrease of clonogenic cell survival in response to HT-RT.Tumor cell-type, temperature and order of treatment play an important role in radiosensitization by hyperthermia. However, hyperthermia has limited potency to radiosensitize canine cancer cells grown in a 2D cell culture setting presented here. DNA damage and apoptosis/necrosis did not increase upon combined treatment and cytosolic levels of HSP70 appear not to play critical role in the radiosensitization of A549 cells."

Secondly, we correlated ASP derived form a pre-therapeutic OctreoScan (ASP[In]) and an intra-therapeutic [177Lu]-SPECT/CT (ASP[Lu]). Materials and methods Data from first therapy cycle [177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3]octreotate ([177Lu]-DOTATATE)-PRRT was retrospectively analyzed in 33 patients (m = 20; w = 13; median age, 72 [46–88] years). The evaluation of response to PRRT was performed according to RECIST 1.1 in responding lesions [RL (SD, PR, CR), n = 104] and non-responding lesions [NRL (PD), n = 27]. The association of SSR tumor heterogeneity with morphological response was evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The optimal threshold for separation (RL vs. NRL) was calculated using the Youden-index. Relationship between pre- and intra-therapeutic ASP was determined with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) and Bland-Altman plots. Results A total of 131 lesions (liver: n = 59, lymph nodes: n = 48, bone: n = 19, pancreas: n = 5) were analyzed. Lesions with higher ASP values showed a significantly poorer response to PRRT (PD, median: 11.3, IQR: 8.5–15.5; SD, median: 3.4, IQR: 2.1–4.5; PR, median 1.7, IQR: 0.9–2.8; CR, median: 0.5, IQR: 0.0–1.3); Kruskal-Wallis, p<0.001). ROC analyses revealed a significant separation between RL and NRL for ASP after 4 months (AUC 0.85, p<0.001) and after 12 months (AUC 0.94, p<0.001). The optimal threshold for ASP was >5.45% (sensitivity 96% and specificity 82%). The correlation coefficient of pre- and intra-therapeutic ASP revealed ρ = 0.72 (p <0.01). The mean absolute difference between ASP[In] and ASP[Lu] was -0.04 (95% Limits of Agreement, -6.1–6.0). Conclusion Pre- and intra-therapeutic ASP shows a strong correlation and might be an useful tool for therapy monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2945353448,"Purpose To investigate whether hyperreflective foci (HRF) exhibit flow projection artifact on OCTA, and study the efficacy of commercial projection artifact removal software (PAR-OCTA, Optovue, Inc), and a custom projection resolved OCTA (PR-OCTA) in distinguishing artifacts from true flow in retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP). Methods The study included five eyes with HRF representing pigment migration in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), five eyes with leaking treatment-naïve RAP, and ten eyes with diabetic hard exudates. We examined flow signal on OCTA cross-sections using PAR, and performed PR-OCTA to study the effect of increasingly stringent projection removal thresholds. Flow signal intensity was analyzed and quantified using imageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), by calculating the percentage of red pixels (R) representing flow, compared to green (G) and blue (B) pixels. Results PAR-OCTA cross sections revealed persistent flow signal in all HRF, including RAP, hard exudates and pigment migration. In RAP, PR-OCTA detected intransigent flow, irrespective of the flow removal threshold. Mean R in the five RAP lesions remained higher than mean G and B at the most stringent PR-OCTA threshold (40.96% vs 29.52 and 29.52%, respectively), denoting persistence of flow. In contrast, increasing the PR-OCTA threshold in pigment migration and hard exudates removed the flow signal, with a statistically significant decrease in mean R with increasing threshold. (p = 0.017 and 0.0029, respectively) Conclusion Commercial PAR-OCTA is not completely effective at removing artifactual flow in hard exudates and HRF related to pigment migration. Custom built PR-OCTA, using a sliding scale of threshold, allowed us to distinguish true flow in RAP from artifactual flow in avascular HRF. Further studies are needed to validate the optimum threshold for projection artifact removal, which would preserve true flow in RAP and the small intraretinal capillaries."

This study aims to explore the socio-psychological factors underlying drivers' motivation for lane change violation behavior at urban intersections and examines how these factors predict this violation behavior. A self-reported questionnaire is designed by applying the construct of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to collect data. Five hundred-six valid responses are received from the questionnaire survey conducted on the Internet in China. The data are then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the analysis show that behavioral intention is the strongest predictor of self-reported lane change violation behavior at urban intersections. Perceived behavioral control has both direct and indirect effects on self-reported lane change violation behavior. Furthermore, attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control are found to have significant correlations with drivers' intention of lane change violations at urban intersections. The results of this study could provide a reference for designing more effective interventions to modify drivers' lane change violation behavior at urban intersections."

We report the recombinant production and biochemical characterization of an AA5_2 oxidase from Penicillium rubens Wisconsin 54–1255 (PruAA5_2A), which groups within an unmapped clade phylogenetically distant from those comprising AA5_2 members characterized to date. PruAA5_2 preferentially oxidized raffinose over galactose; however, its catalytic efficiency was 6.5 times higher on glycolaldehyde dimer compared to raffinose. Deep sequence analysis of characterized AA5_2 members highlighted amino acid pairs correlated to substrate range and conserved within the family. Moreover, PruAA5_2 activity spans substrate preferences previously reported for AA5 subfamily 1 and 2 members, identifying possible functional overlap across the AA5 family."
https://openalex.org/W2946758816,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are zoonotic pathogens relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health. Many avian IAVs are transmitted among waterfowl via a faecal-oral-route. Therefore, environmental water where waterfowl congregate may play an important role in the ecology and epidemiology of avian IAV. Water and sediment may sustain and transmit virus among individuals or species. It is unclear at what concentrations waterborne viruses are infectious or remain detectable. To address this, we performed lake water and sediment dilution experiments with varying concentrations or infectious doses of four IAV strains from seal, turkey, duck and gull. To test for infectivity of the IAV strains in a concentration dependent manner, we applied cultivation to specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. IAV recovery was more effective from embryonated chicken eggs than MDCK cells for freshwater lake dilutions, whereas, MDCK cells were more effective for viral recovery from sediment samples. Low infectious dose (1 PFU/200 μL) was sufficient in most cases to detect and recover IAV from lake water dilutions. Sediment required higher initial infectious doses (≥ 100 PFU/200 μL)."
https://openalex.org/W2944949296,"Bacteria of the genus Campylobacter are an important cause of human illness worldwide. Campylobacter infections are expressed as gastroenteritis and can lead to severe sequelae like reactive arthritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. In Germany, Campylobacter-associated gastroenteritis cases are notifiable but there is no reporting obligation for the sequelaes and the disease burden is clearly underestimated. The aim of our study was to quantify reliably the current disease burden of all Campylobacter spp.-associated diseases for Germany with the method of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs combine mortality and morbidity in a single summary measure, whereby one DALY represents the loss of one year in full health. For acute gastroenteritis, we estimated 967 DALYs of which only 484 DALYs were detected within the reporting system. Overall, we estimated that 8811 DALYs were caused by the campylobacter-related diseases known so far. 98% of the DALYs were associated with morbidity and 2% with mortality. Mortality was caused by the health outcomes Gastroenteritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome exclusively."
https://openalex.org/W2945058784,"Background Body shape can be both a consequence and cause of a species’ evolution and ecology. There are many examples of phenotypes associated with specific ecological niches, likely as a result of specific selective regimes. A classic example of this is the phenotypic change associated with colonization of caves, including body and limb elongation. However, studies explicitly testing for differences in body shape between cave-dwelling and non-cave-dwelling lineages have been limited and so the role of the cave environment in determining morphological characteristics is still not completely understood. Here we examine variation in body shape among 405 individuals representing 20 species in the salamander genus Eurycea (Plethodontidae) and select outgroups exhibiting great diversity in morphology, ecological niche, and life history. Results After analyzing morphometric data in a phylogenetic context using phylogenetic MANOVA and examination of the phylomorphospace, we found significant differences in body shape among cave-dwelling and non-cave-dwelling species and between aquatic and terrestrial species. Notably, limb elongation and reduced body and tail size characterized cave-dwelling species. Terrestrial species also exhibited elongation of the limbs and digits. We also observed differences in shape variance among paedomorphic and biphasic species. Our results suggest that the functional limitations imposed by habitat and life history played a key role in the evolution of body shape in this group in the context of their phylogenetic history."
https://openalex.org/W2945075705,"Agriculture is a primary driver of biodiversity loss worldwide, and several expensive schemes have been designed to make modern farming landscapes more hospitable for wildlife. One such market-based mechanisms is the agri-environment-climate schemes (AES) in the European Union (EU). AES compensate farmers for reducing land-use intensity and maintaining or introducing biodiversity-rich habitats. Despite their high costs, impacts of AES vary by measure, region and taxonomic group considered, and have rarely been studied over large areas covering an entire country. Here we assess the country-wide impact of several AES measures on bird abundance using citizen science data on birds and detailed information on AES take up from across Finland. We report a positive impact of organic animal farming on abundance of all farmland associated birds. This effect was particularly strong for insectivorous species, species that are associated to farmyards and long-distance species. None of the other AES measures considered for study did show any relationship with bird abundance. Overall, these findings highlight the potential positive impact that some compensatory measures, such as organic animal farming, may have on wildlife. Traditional animal husbandry is based on grazing of animals and restriction on external inputs, similarly to what is stipulated under organic production contract. As such, traditional animal husbandry may represent an effective landscape management tool for restoring or maintaining threatened species and ecosystems in rural areas of the EU. Ultimately, the apparent lack of a measurable effect of the other AES considered here supports the current move towards evidence-based regional targeting of compensatory measures, so as to concentrate scarce resources to where they can yield the highest ecological benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2945083152,"Background Determining mycobacterial burden is important in assessing severity of disease, evaluating infectiousness and predicting patient treatment outcomes. Mycobacterial burden assessed by smear microscopy grade and time to culture positivity is clearly interpretable by most physicians. GeneXpert (Xpert) has been recommended by WHO as a first line tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic test as an alternative to smear microscopy. Xpert gives cycle threshold (Ct) values as a potential measure for mycobacterial burden. For physicians to clearly interpret Ct values as measures of mycobacterial burden, this study compared the Xpert quantification capabilities with those of smear microscopy and culture. The study also determined a linear relationship between Xpert Ct values and MGIT culture time to positivity (MGIT-TTP) and associated factors. A cut off Ct value which best predicts smear positivity was also determined using the Receiver Operator Curve analysis method. Results Excluding missing results and rifampicin resistant TB cases, a moderately strong correlation of 0.55 between Xpert Ct value and smear grade was obtained. A weak correlation of 0.37 was obtained between Xpert Ct values and MGIT time to positivity while that between Xpert Ct values and LJ culture was 0.34. The Xpert Ct values were found to increase by 2.57 for every unit increase in days to positive and HIV status was significantly associated with this relationship. A cut off Ct value of 23.62 was found to best predict smear positivity regardless of HIV status. Conclusion Our study findings show that GeneXpert Ct values are comparable to smear microscopy as a measure of M. tuberculosis burden and can be used to replace smear microscopy. However, given the low correlation between Xpert Ct value and culture positivity, Xpert Ct values cannot replace culture as a measure of M. tuberculosis burden among TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2945265480,"Background Currently, it is not feasible to obtain laboratory-based measures of joint motion in large numbers of older adults. We assessed the utility of a portable depth-sensing camera for quantifying hip and knee joint motion of older adults during mobility testing in the community. Methods Participants were 52 older adults enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of aging. In a subset, we compared dynamic hip and knee flexion/extension obtained via the depth-sensing camera with that obtained concurrently using a laboratory-based optoelectronic motion capture system. Then we recorded participants’ annual instrumented gait assessment in the community setting with the depth-sensing camera and examined the inter-relationships of hip and knee range of motion (ROM) with mobility metrics derived from a wearable sensor and other mobility-related health measures. Results In the community, we successfully acquired joint motion from 49/52 participants using the depth-sensing camera. Hip and knee ROMs were related to diverse sensor-derived metrics of mobility performance (hip: Pearson’s r = 0.31 to 0.58; knee: Pearson’s r = 0.29 to 0.51), as well as daily physical activity, conventional motor measures, self-report hip and knee pain and dysfunction, mobility disability, and falls. Conclusions The depth-sensing camera’s high rate of successful data acquisition and correlations of its hip and knee ROMs with other mobility measures suggest that this device can provide a cost-efficient means of quantifying joint motion in large numbers of community-dwelling older adults who span the health spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2945533454,"Both academic and popular literatures have repeatedly contended that emerging adults are the most narcissistic and entitled age-group in modern times. Although this contention is fiercely debated, the message that emerging adults are narcissistic and entitled has saturated popular culture. Despite this saturation, relatively little empirical work has examined how emerging adults might react to such labels. Across three studies in five samples in the U.S., the present work sought to address this deficit in research. Results from cross-sectional samples of university students at two universities, as well as an online convenience sample of web-using adults (Study 1), indicated that emerging adults believe their age-group and the one following them (e.g., adolescents) to be the most narcissistic and entitled age-groups, that they have generally negative opinions of narcissism and entitlement, and that they respond negatively to being labeled as narcissistic and entitled. Additionally, results from adult web-users revealed that, while all age groups tend to view adolescents and emerging adults as more narcissistic and entitled than older age-groups, these opinions are more exaggerated among members of older age-groups. Finally, across two experimental studies (Studies 2 & 3), results indicated that emerging adults react negatively to labeling of their age-group as narcissistic and entitled, but no more negatively than they do to potentially related undesirable labels (e.g., oversensitive). Collectively, these results indicate that emerging adults are aware of and somewhat distressed by messaging that casts their age-group as the most narcissistic and entitled age-group ever."

However, transforming this data into patient care is a critical challenge. There are two difficulties: how to integrate functional information into mutation interpretation and how to make the integration easy to apply. One solution is to visualize amino acid changes with protein structure and function in web app platform. There are multiple existing tools for plotting mutations, but the majority of them requires programming skills that are not common background for clinicians or researchers. Furthermore, the recurrent mutations are the focus and the recurrence cutoff varies. Yet, none of the current software offers customer-defined cutoff. Thus, we developed this user-friendly web-based tool, Mutplot (https://bioinformaticstools.shinyapps.io/lollipop/). Mutplot retrieves up-to-date domain information from the protein resource UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/), integrates the submitted mutation information and produces lollipop diagrams with annotations and highlighted candidates. It offers flexible output options. For data that follows security standards, the app can also be hosted in web servers inside a firewall or computers without internet with Uniprot database stored on them. Altogether, Mutplot is an excellent tool for visualizing protein mutations, especially for clinicians or researchers without any bioinformatics background."
https://openalex.org/W2945256935,This paper aims to develop a novel computational technique for the detection of the transit through the anaerobic threshold. This technique uses only cardiac intervals derived from the electrocardiogram and is based on algebraic relationships between RR and QRS intervals. Electrocardiograms are measured during the load and the recovery processes. Algebraic relationships between cardiac intervals are used not only to identify the anaerobic threshold but also to characterise individual features of the person during the transit through the threshold. The ratio between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the exhaled air is used to validate the results. The algebraic relationship between cardiac intervals serves as a stand-alone indicator for both the determination of the anaerobic threshold and the characterization of the performance of the person during the load and the recovery processes.

It is important to identify the quality of the IPR pairs in a discussion thread in order to extract relevant information and helpful replies because a higher frequency of irrelevant replies in the thread could take the discussion in a different direction and the genuine users would lose interest in this discussion thread.

In this cross-sectional analysis, plasma was collected at pneumonia presentation to measure the following 12 biomarkers: interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2 (sTNFR-1 and sTNFR-2), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fibrinogen, D-dimer, soluble CD27 (sCD27), interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163 (sCD163), hyaluronan, and intestinal fatty acid binding protein. We asked whether biomarker levels differed between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants, and whether higher levels of these biomarkers were associated with mortality.One hundred seventy-three participants were enrolled. Fifty-three percent were HIV-infected. Eight plasma biomarkers-sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2, hsCRP, D-dimer, sCD27, IP-10, sCD14, and hyaluronan-were higher among participants with HIV infection, after adjustment for pneumonia severity. Higher levels of 8 biomarkers-IL-6, sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2, hsCRP, IP-10, sCD14, sCD163, and hyaluronan-were associated with increased 2-month mortality.As in other clinical contexts, HIV infection is associated with a greater degree of immune activation among Ugandan adults with pneumonia.

https://openalex.org/W4247925670,"Plesiochelyidae were relatively large coastal marine turtles, which inhabited the epicontinental seas of Western Europe during the Late Jurassic. Their fossil record can be tracked in Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal. The Jura Mountains, in northwestern Switzerland, have been the main source for the study of this group, mostly thanks to the rich and famous historical locality of Solothurn. In the last two decades, numerous plesiochelyid remains have been collected from Kimmeridgian deposits (Lower Virgula Marls and Banné Marls) in the area of Porrentruy (Canton of Jura, Switzerland). This material was revealed by construction works of the A16 Transjurane highway between 2000 and 2011, and led to the recent description of the new species Plesiochelys bigleri. In the years 2014 and 2016, new fragmentary turtle material was collected from the Banné Marls (Reuchenette Formation, lower Kimmeridgian) near the village of Glovelier, Canton of Jura, Switzerland. The new material consists of a complete shell, additional shell elements, a few bones from the appendicular and vertebral skeleton, and a fragmentary basicranium. This material can be confidently assigned to the species P. bigleri. It supports the presence of this species in the Banné Marls, slightly extends its spatial distribution and confirms the differences with the closely related species P. etalloni. The new material reveals that the split between the cerebral and palatine branches of the internal carotid artery occurs in a vertical plane in P. bigleri. This condition could not be observed in the type material due to poor preservation. This new character clearly distinguishes P. bigleri from P. etalloni and seems to be unique among thalassochelydians."
https://openalex.org/W2945675215,"Delayed wound healing and reduced barrier function with an increased risk of cancer are characteristics of aged skin and one possible mechanism is misregulation or dysfunction of epidermal stem cells during aging. Recent studies have identified heterogeneous stem cell populations within the mouse interfollicular epidermis that are defined by territorial distribution and cell division frequency; however, it is unknown whether the individual stem cell populations undergo distinct aging processes. Here we provide comprehensive characterization of age-related changes in the mouse epidermis within the specific territories of slow-cycling and fast-dividing stem cells using old wild-type, senescence-accelerated mouse prone 1 (SAMP1) and SAMP8 mice. During aging, the epidermis exhibits structural changes such as irregular micro-undulations and overall thinning of the tissue. We also find that, in the old epidermis, proliferation is preferentially decreased in the region where fast-dividing stem cells reside whereas the lineage differentiation marker appears to be more affected in the slow-cycling stem cell region. Furthermore, SAMP8, but not SAMP1, exhibits precocious aging similar to that of aged wild-type mice, suggesting a potential use of this model for aging study of the epidermis and its stem cells. Taken together, our study reveals distinct aging processes governing the two epidermal stem cell populations and suggests a potential mechanism in differential responses of compartmentalized stem cells and their niches to aging."
https://openalex.org/W2946378571,"Chronic pressure overload due to aortic valve stenosis leads to pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in myocyte surface area, which requires a proportional increase in the number of cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts to withstand enhanced workload. In a proteomic analysis we identified nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin1), a 16kDa transmembrane cell-surface protein involved in cell adhesion and nerve repair, to be increased in hypertrophic hearts from patients with aortic stenosis. We hypothesised that Ninjurin1 is involved in myocyte hypertrophy. We analyzed cardiac biopsies from aortic-stenosis patients and control patients undergoing elective heart surgery. We studied cardiac hypertrophy in mice after transverse aortic constriction and angiotensin II infusions, and performed mechanistic analyses in cultured myocytes. We assessed the physiological role of ninjurin1 in zebrafish during heart and skeletal muscle development. Ninjurin1 was increased in hearts of aortic stenosis patients, compared to controls, as well as in hearts from mice with cardiac hypertrophy. Besides the 16kDa Ninjurin1 (Ninjurin1-16) we detected a 24kDa variant of Ninjurin1 (Ninjurin1-24), which was predominantly expressed during myocyte hypertrophy. We disclosed that the higher molecular weight of Ninjurin1-24 was caused by N-glycosylation. Ninjurin1-16 was contained in the cytoplasm of myocytes where it colocalized with stress-fibers. In contrast, Ninjurin1-24 was localized at myocyte membranes. Gain and loss-of-function experiments showed that Ninjurin1-24 plays a role in myocyte hypertrophy and myogenic differentiation in vitro. Reduced levels of ninjurin1 impaired cardiac and skeletal muscle development in zebrafish. We conclude that Ninjurin1 contributes to myocyte growth and differentiation, and that these effects are mainly mediated by N-glycosylated Ninjurin1-24."
https://openalex.org/W2944847891,"Selection pressures leading to extreme, female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in spiders continue to be debated. It has been proposed that males of sexually size dimorphic spiders could be small because gravity constrains adult agility (locomotor abilities). Accordingly, small males should achieve higher vertical climbing speeds and should be more prone to bridge. The curvilinear model of the gravity hypothesis predicts a negative relationship between vertical climbing speed and male body size only over a threshold of 7.6 mm, 42.5 mg. Because males of most species with extreme SSD fall well below this threshold, the relationship between male size and agility at this scale remains vague. Here, we tested three hypotheses on how male size, mass and age (after maturation) relate to vertical climbing and bridging ability in Nephilingis cruentata, a highly sexually dimorphic orb-weaver with males well below the size threshold. We placed males of different sizes and adult ages in a vertical platform and recorded their climbing speeds. Contrary to the original study testing male bridging ability as binary variable, we measured the duration of the crossing of the bridging thread, as well as its sagging distance. Male body size and mass positively related to the vertical climbing speed and to the distance of the sagging thread during bridging, but had no influence on the bridging duration. The detected positive correlation between male size/mass and vertical climbing speed goes against our first prediction, that small males would have vertical climbing advantage in Nephilingis cruentata, but agrees with the curvilinear model. Against our second prediction, small males were not faster during bridging. Finally, in agreement with our third prediction, threads sagged more in heavier males. These results suggest that small male size confers no agility advantages in Nephilingis cruentata."

Patients must adhere to specific precautions due to an impaired immune system, which challenges and influence the life of the whole family. This qualitative study, based on individual and group interviews with spouses to AL patients in curative intended treatment, elucidates how the intense and substantial caregiver role affects the everyday lives of spouses to AL patients in curative intended treatment.Qualitative semi-structured group interviews (n = 6) and individual interviews (n = 5) with spouses to AL patients were conducted at different time points during the whole course of treatment. Theories of everyday life served as the theoretical framework.The spouses described their life as a constant state of vigilance and attention as a consequence of the responsibility they felt arising from the treatment in the outpatient setting. These made them experience their role as a burden. The social life of the spouses and the families suffered substantially due to the precautions that were instated in the home. However, many experienced that relations in the family were developed positively.Close relatives experience additional psychosocial burdens instigated by the outpatient management regimens. This is important knowledge for the health care system to include in future development of AL outpatient settings, to prioritize and support offers to the relatives that recognize their sense of burden. This could apply not only to relatives of AL patients but to the relatives of other severely ill patients as well."
https://openalex.org/W2946081647,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered as a potential target for combating obesity in humans where active BAT metabolizes glucose and fatty acids as fuel resulting in heat production. Prospective studies in humans have been set up to further study the presence and metabolic activity of BAT mostly using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging in cold-stimulated conditions with the radiolabeled glucose derivative [18F]FDG. However, radiotracers beyond [18F]FDG have been proposed to investigate BAT activity, targeting various aspects of BAT metabolism. It remains questionable which tracer is best suited to detect metabolic BAT activity and to what extent those results correlate with ex vivo metabolic BAT activity.PET and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging, targeting different aspects of BAT activation such as glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, noradrenergic stimulation, blood perfusion and amino acid transport system, was performed immediately after injection of the tracer in rats under different temperatures: room temperature, acute cold (4 ⁰C for 4 h) or acclimated to cold (4 ⁰C for 6 h per day during 28 days). Furthermore, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)-derived BAT temperature was measured in control and cold-acclimated rats.At room temperature, only [18F]FDG visualized BAT. Glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, noradrenergic stimulation and blood perfusion showed a clear tracer-dependent twofold increase in BAT uptake upon cold exposure. Only the tracer for the amino acid transport system did not show BAT specific uptake under any of the experimental conditions. MRS demonstrated that cold-acclimated animals had BAT with a stronger heat-production compared to control animals.BAT activity following cold exposure in rats was visualized by several tracers, while only [18F]FDG was also able to show BAT activity under non-stimulated conditions (room temperature). The variances in uptake of the different tracers should be taken into account when developing future clinical applications in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2944900670,"To investigate the undesired irradiations outside of the treatment field by electron streams in air (air-electron-stream) during magnetic-resonance image-guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT). A custom-made support phantom adjusting angles between the beam central axis (CAX) and the phantom surface (termed phantom-angles), were used. Using the ViewRay system, a rectangular parallelepiped phantom placed on the support phantom, was irradiated with field sizes of 6.3 cm × 6.3 cm (FS6.3) and 12.6 cm × 12.6 cm (FS12.6) at gantry angles of 0°, 30°, and 330°, and phantom-angles of 10°, 20°, and 30°. For each beam delivery, the isocenter was located at the center of mass of the phantom and 3 Gy was delivered to the isocenter (prescription dose = 3 Gy). The doses given by the air-electron-streams were measured using the EBT3 films on the panels placed orthogonal to the direction of the magnetic field at distances of 10 and 17 cm from CAX. Two dose distributions per irradiation were measured on the panel facing the phantom surface of the incident beam (front panel) and on the panel facing the phantom surface of the beam exit (end panel). We investigated the doses by the air-electron-streams by calculating the average doses inside the circles drawn around a point of the maximum dose with radii of x cm (DRx) from the dose distributions on the panels (x = 1-5 cm). The largest value of DRx was DR1 (1.64 Gy, 55% of the prescription dose) at 10 cm distance from CAX, with FS12.6, at 30° phantom-angle and 330° gantry angle. The average difference of the DR1 at the end panels (FS12.6) between the calculations and measurements was 1.36 Gy. The average global gamma passing rate with 3%/3 mm on the dose distributions at the end panels (FS12.6) was 40.3%. The calculated dose distributions on both panels were not coincident with the measured dose distributions. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the projected areas and the DRx values were always higher than 0.75 (all with p < 0.001). The doses by the air-electron-streams increased with the projected areas of the cross-sections of the treatment beams on the panels."
https://openalex.org/W2944959209,"Dietary supplements are products that are widely used for instance as energisers or to lose weight. There have been cases reported where undeclared ingredients present in such supplements have caused adverse effects on the health of the user. As there are many different products to choose from, it seems impossible to predict which might contain harmful components and to ban them from the market. Nonetheless, the use of dietary supplements and the experiences of users are shared in online discussions. We describe the development of a search engine to retrieve products associated with certain effects. Upon application we were able to retrieve a list of dietary supplements that are repeatedly associated with excessive effects by users on public fora. The top of the list contains supplements that have previously been banned because they contained undeclared harmful components. The use of the search engine as described here is a powerful method for making a risk-based selection of dietary supplements which can then be analysed for the presence of illegal or other unwanted components."
https://openalex.org/W2944847621,"How do echo chambers operate? Why does social propagation of information become trapped within the boundaries of social groups? Previous studies of these questions have identified informational and structural factors which hinder information exchange across group boundaries; these factors constitute ""chambers"" in which information flows are confined and transformed into ""echoes."" However, empirical evidence has indicated that these factors may not sufficiently explain the mechanism of echo chambers. Hence, the present study investigated whether the insular flow of information emerges and endures without the chambers. A randomized controlled experiment was conducted in which participants, who were classified into two political groups, exchanged randomly selected articles with the same number of ingroup and outgroup neighbors. The experiment manipulated the directionality of incoming information flow by varying the number of articles sent from ingroup neighbors across two conditions. Analyses revealed that the ingroup-slanted inflow induced ingroup-slanted outflow, suppressing transmission toward neighbors in a different social group. The biased inflow also promoted positive reactions to information exchanges and reduced negative evaluations on the exchanged information. Furthermore, the ingroup-slanted inflow increased false perceptions of ingroup majority, which is known to encourage information dissemination by a social group. The present study suggests two self-reinforcing mechanisms of ingroup-biased flows that generate echoes even without the chambers. These mechanisms may enable a small group of strategic actors to exacerbate polarization within a large population by manipulating directions of information flow."
https://openalex.org/W2945134267,"The aim of this article is to provide a detailed description of the SWEDE-I cohort, a prospective study designed to investigate work-related risk factors for transmission of viral infections. A total of 2,237 subjects aged 25–64, working and residing in Eskilstuna (central Sweden), enrolled in the study in August 2011. They filled in five detailed questionnaires including information on demography, personal characteristics, work tasks, work place, contact patterns, family structure, health status, physical activity and diet. During a 9-month follow-up period, the participants self-reported—via internet or telephone—any onset of fever, upper respiratory tract infection, or gastroenteritis immediately as they occurred. For each disease episode, the participants were asked to submit a self-sampled nasal swab for viral diagnosis. In total, 1,733 disease reports were recorded and 1,843 nasal swabs were received, of which 48% tested positive for one or more of 14 analyzed viruses. The cohort has been used to date to study diet, sleep and physical activity as determinants for upper respiratory tract infections. Analyses of contact patterns and occupational circumstances as risk factors for the transmission of infections are ongoing. The SWEDE-I study should be seen as a first pioneering effort to provide new insight in the epidemiology and prevention of viral infections. Potential joint collaborations can be discussed with the principal investigators."
