https://openalex.org/W2020803547,"The unusual floral biology of a neotropical herb provided an opportunity to determine that floral visitors varied significantly in their ability to effect fruit-set. Pollination efficiency and visitation frequency varied among Hymenoptera (five taxa), which were responsible for 99 percent of all fruits set. Lepidoptera (four taxa) were common visitors but poor pollinators. These results indicate that flower visitors vary in their beneficial effects on plants, fulfilling one of the primary conditions required for the specialization of plants on pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W2026568376,"Sex pheromone production in the female corn earworm moth Heliothis zea is controlled by a hormonal substance produced in the female's brain. It is present in the brain in scotophase as well as photophase, but it is released into the hemolymph to stimulate pheromone production only in the scotophase. The stimulatory activity was also detected in the brains of male corn earworm moths and of other moths."
https://openalex.org/W2095308329,"The magnetic stratigraphly of seven cores of deep-sea sediment established the existence of a short interval of reversed polarity in the upper part of the Brunches epoch of normal polarity. The reversed zone in the cores correlates well with paleontological boundaries and is named the Blake event. Its boundaries are estimated to be 108,000 and 114,000 years ago +/- 10 percent."
https://openalex.org/W2066217096,"New data substantiate as well as modify the south Florida submergence curve, which indicates that eustatic sea level has risen continuously, although at a generally decreasing rate, during the last 6500 to 7000 sidereal years (5500 standard radiocarbon years) to reach its present position. Accumulation rates of coastal deposits are similar to the rate of sea-level rise, thus supporting the generalization that submergence rates largely determine as well as limit rates of coastal sedimentation in lagoonal and estuarine areas."
https://openalex.org/W2013867010,"Spectral measurements of red bioluminescence were obtained from the deep-sea stomiatoid fishes Aristostomias scintillans (Gilbert) and Malacosteus niger (Ayres). Red luminescence from suborbital light organs extends to the near infrared, with peak emission at approximately 705 nanometers in the far red. These fishes also have postorbital light organs that emit blue luminescence with maxima between 470 and 480 nanometers. The red bioluminescence may be due to an energy transfer system and wavelength-selective filtering."
https://openalex.org/W2045815392,"The fig (Ficus) is absolutely dependent upon pollination by minute agaonid wasps for development of fertile seeds. In some species of the wasp genera Agaon, Allotriozoon, Blastophaga, Ceratosolen, Elisabethiella, Liporrhopalum, and Pleistodontes, the females possess concavities (""corbiculae"") to carry pollen. The New World Tetrapus and some Old World Blastophaga lack pollen-carrying structures and may carry pollen dusted over the body or in the digestive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2077632110,"With the color vision and learning abilities of birds and teleosts now proved, it appears possible that the hitherto puzzling massive variation in color and pattern of certain species, distributed through at least five phyla, is not the result of the mere free play of mutation but represents a protective variation and is the product of what may be called reflexive selection."

https://openalex.org/W2080047631,Proportions of sedimentary rock types remaining today differ from period to period. These differences may be chiefly the result of differential rates of deposition and erosion of the various components of the rocks. Lower percentages of limestones and evaporites in Precambrian rocks than in post-Precambrian rocks probably represent selective loss of these more easily removable components from the original deposits.
https://openalex.org/W1980594319,A circadian rhythm of egg hatching in the moth Pectinophora gossypiella can be initiated with a brief light pulse. The action spectrum for this effect has a peak in the blue and near ultraviolet region of the spectrum with a sharp cutoff above 500 nanometers and a more gradual cutoff below 390 nanometers.
https://openalex.org/W2010426615,"Volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount St. Helens on 18 May 1980 fell into Williams Lake in eastern Washington and was temporarily suspended at the sediment-water interface. After several months of compaction, the ash layer broke up and sank into lower density uncompacted lake sediment. Stratigraphic time displacements of several hundred years and a failure to recognize discontinuous ash layers in sediment cores are possible consequences of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2039517842,"In the light of the discussion presented here, we may conclude that fluorine dating is subject to many uncertainties. While the geochemical and geological uncertainties have been recognized (24), numerous crystalchemical concepts concerning the nature of the carbonate-apatite minerals have been almost completely disregarded."
https://openalex.org/W2062317020,"When treated with atrazine, a herbicide that acts as an inhibitor of photosynthesis, both tolerant and susceptible plants showed a reduction in transpiration rate. This occurred within 1 to 3 hours of application and usually reduced transpiration by 50 percent or more after about 6 hours."
https://openalex.org/W2027949263,"Tumors were formed on germinating seeds of a hybrid of Lilium speciosum ""Album"" x L. auratum. Ferulic acid and the glucose ester were isolated from both pericarp and seeds. Tumors were induced on excised embryos only when the embryos were grown on nutrient agar containing ferulic acid. Tumors may result from the limited amount of glycosylation and from detoxification of ferulic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1974595748,"Explants from fruits of the peach were stimulated to grow by cell enlargement, cell division, or both when placed on media containing kinetin. Callus cultures have been obtained, even occasionally from ripening fruits, long after cessation of normal cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2023569516,"Woodhenge and the Trinity chapel, Canterbury, are strikingly similar in outline. One is megalithic, the other Norman Christian over Saxon Christian. An analysis of the geometry shows that both are based on Pythagorean triangles: Woodhenge with sides, 6, 17.5, and 18.5, and Canterbury with sides 12, 72, and 73 in megalithic yards. The structurally more recent eastern end of Canterbury Cathedral may have been built over and around an older megalithic site. The longitudinal axes of the composite cathedral differ by 2 degrees , and these, if aligned on Betelgeuse, would indicate buried megalithic structures dating from 2300, 1900, and 1500 B.C."

https://openalex.org/W2062266604,"Gamma-ray spectral lines have recently been reported coming from the celestial object SS 433, which is known to emit high-speed jets in opposite directions. The proposed identification of the lines as coming from fusion reactions on nitrogen nuclei as part of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle operating in the jets has now received observational support. Predictions of strengths and widths of additional lines which, if seen, would provide valuable new information about conditions giving rise to the jets are presented."
