https://openalex.org/W1649409333,"New data have clearly confirmed the earlier finding that specific locus mutation rates obtained with chronic gamma irradiation of spermatogonia are lower than those obtained with acute x-rays. Since this result is in contrast to classical findings for Drosophila spermatozoa, and apparently contradicts one of the basic tenets of radiation genetics, it was important to determine what factors were responsible for it. Experiments undertaken for this purpose reveal the following: (i) the lower mutation frequency is due mainly to difference in dose rate of radiation, rather than quality; (ii) a dose-rate effect is not obtained in experiments with mouse spermatozoa, confirming classical findings for spermatozoa, and indicating that the explanation for intensity dependence in spermatogonia resides in some characteristic of gametogenic stage; and (iii) a dose-rate effect is found not only in spermatogonia but also in oocytes, where cell selection is improbable, indicating that the radiation intensity effect is on the mutation process itself. A threshold response for all mutations in spermatogonia and oocytes is not a necessary consequence of the findings. Plausible hypotheses consistent with the present results can lead to other predictions. From a practical point of view, the results indicate that the genetic hazards, at least under some radiation conditions, may not be as great as those estimated from the mutation rates obtained with acute irradiation. However, it should not be forgotten that even the lower mutation rates obtained with the present intensity levels are still appreciable (16)."

The study discussed in this report examined the critical period for infantile manipulation on the depletion of AAA. It was found that infant rats manipulated immediately following birth exhibited significant AAA depletion, whereas infants manipulated later did not exhibit depletion."

Only virulent cocci grow rapidly within leukocytes. Leukocyte destruction by the virulent strain and release of many phagocytized cocci precedes mouse death. The leukocidic agent may be delta-hemolysin."

https://openalex.org/W2031959903,"IT appears to be a popular belief that the use of hydrogen or helium as the carrier gas in gas Chromatography gives the highest sensitivity with a thermal conductivity detector, because the difference in thermal conductivity between organic vapours and hydrogen or helium is greater than for any other carrier gas1,2. This is not necessarily true, however, for the difference in temperature between the hot wire (at t 1° C.) and the body of the thermal conductivity cell (at t 0° C.) is inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity K 1 of the carrier gas: , where a is constant. If the concentration of organic vapour in the carrier gas is x, the sensitivity of the detector is proportional to: When x is small, dK/dx is approximately equal to K 1–K 2, where K 2 is the thermal conductivity of the organic vapour."
https://openalex.org/W1993500502,"The osmotic pressure gradient across the collagen solid matrix-solution interface forces the solid to imbibe fluid and thereby increases its volume. Concurrently, the decrease in entropy of the solid matrix produces a force which tends to resist any further increase in volume. The instantaneous velocity at which the swelling takes place is related to the difference between the osmotic and entropic forces. Finally, an explicit relationship is obtained between volume and time."

https://openalex.org/W2053134751,The administration of ketoproline to chick embryos resulted in an increase in the free hydroxyproline. This phenomenon is explained by the inhibitory action of ketoproline on the catabolism of hydroxyproline as well as by the conversion of the former to the latter. Ketoproline was found to be reduced to hydroxyproline by the supernatant fraction of rat-kidney homogenate in the presence of a reduced pyridine nucleotide.
