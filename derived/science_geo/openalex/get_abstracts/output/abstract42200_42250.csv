https://openalex.org/W2079115295,"Heat shock protein (hsp) genes, a group of ubiquitous genes, are activated by various metabolic stresses. The suggestion that denaturation of intracellular proteins may be produced by the metabolic stresses and then signal the activation of the hsp genes was examined by co-injection of purified proteins and hsp genes into frog oocytes. Activation of hsp genes was observed if the proteins were denatured prior to injection but not if they were introduced in their native form. Furthermore, the activation of hsp genes by abnormal proteins and by heat shock appears to occur by a common mechanism. A model for the transcriptional regulation of the genes is based on competition for degradation between abnormal intracellular proteins and a labile regulatory factor."
https://openalex.org/W1609735481,"The chemistry of Maillard or browning reactions of glycated proteins was studied using the model compound, N alpha-formyl-N epsilon-fructoselysine (fFL), an analog of glycated lysine residues in protein. Incubation of fFL (15 mM) at physiological pH and temperature in 0.2 M phosphate buffer resulted in formation of N epsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML) in about 40% yield after 15 days. CML was formed by oxidative cleavage of fFL between C-2 and C-3 of the carbohydrate chain and erythronic acid (EA) was identified as the split product formed in the reaction. Neither CML nor EA was formed from fFL under a nitrogen atmosphere. The rate of formation of CML was dependent on phosphate concentration in the incubation mixture and the reaction was shown to occur by a free radical mechanism. CML was also identified by amino acid analysis in hydrolysates of both poly-L-lysine and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease glycated in phosphate buffer under air. CML was also detected in human lens proteins and tissue collagens by HPLC and the identification was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The presence of both CML and EA in human urine suggests that they are formed by degradation of glycated proteins in vivo. The browning of fFL incubation mixtures proceeded to a greater extent under a nitrogen versus an air atmosphere, suggesting that oxidative degradation of Amadori adducts to form CML may limit the browning reactions of glycated proteins. Since the reaction products, CML and EA, are relatively inert, both chemically and metabolically, oxidative cleavage of Amadori adducts may have a role in limiting the consequences of protein glycation in the body."
https://openalex.org/W2027574957,"The mutation rates of DNA sequences during evolution can be estimated from interspecies DNA sequence differences by assaying changes that have little or no effect on the phenotype (neutral mutations). Examination of available measurements shows that rates of DNA change of different phylogenetic groups differ by a factor of 5. The slowest rates are observed for higher primates and some bird lineages, while faster rates are seen in rodents, sea urchins, and drosophila. The rate of DNA sequence change has decreased markedly during primate evolution. The contrast in rates of DNA sequence change is probably due to evolutionary variation and selection of biochemical mechanisms such as DNA replication or repair."
https://openalex.org/W1975536870,"A monoclonal antibody was prepared against pooled homogenates of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease. This antibody recognizes an antigen present in much higher concentration in certain brain regions of Alzheimer patients than in normal brain. The antigen appears to be a protein present in neurons involved in the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and in some morphologically normal neurons in sections from Alzheimer brains. Partial purification and Western blot analysis revealed the antigen from Alzheimer brain to be a single protein with a molecular weight of 68,000. Application of the same purification procedure to normal brain tissue results in the detection of small amounts of a protein of lower molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1576009119,"Angiotensin II acts on cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells to stimulate phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides and subsequent formation of diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates. In intact cells, angiotensin II induces a dose-dependent increase in diglyceride which is detectable after 5 s and sustained for at least 20 min. Angiotensin II (100 nM)-stimulated diglyceride formation is biphasic, peaking at 15 s (227 +/- 19% control) and at 5 min (303 +/- 23% control). Simultaneous analysis of labeled inositol phospholipids shows that at 15 s phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) decline to 52 +/- 6% control and 63 +/- 5% control, respectively, while phosphatidylinositol (PI) remains unchanged. In contrast, at 5 min, PIP2 and PIP have returned toward control levels (92 +/- 2 and 82 +/- 4% control, respectively), while PI has decreased substantially (81 +/- 2% control). The calcium ionophore ionomycin (15 microM) stimulates diglyceride accumulation but does not cause PI hydrolysis. 4 beta-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, inhibits early PIP and PIP2 breakdown and diglyceride formation, without inhibiting late-phase diglyceride accumulation. Thus, angiotensin II induces rapid transient breakdown of PIP and PIP2 and delayed hydrolysis of PI. The rapid attenuation of polyphosphoinositide breakdown is likely caused by a protein kinase C-mediated inhibition of PIP and PIP2 hydrolysis. While in vascular smooth muscle stimulated with angiotensin II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation is transient, diglyceride production is biphasic, suggesting that initial and sustained diglyceride formation from the phosphoinositides results from different biochemical and/or cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W4244591305,"Monocytes are a subpopulation of peripheral blood leukocytes, which when appropriately activated by the regulatory hormones of the immune system, are capable of becoming macrophages—potent effector cells for immune response to tumors and parasites. A complementary DNA for the T lymphocyte-derived lymphokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has been cloned, and recombinant GM-CSF protein has been expressed in yeast and purified to homogeneity. This purified human recombinant GM-CSF stimulated peripheral blood monocytes in vitro to become cytotoxic for the malignant melanoma cell line A375. Another T cell-derived lymphokine, γ-interferon (IFN-γ), also stimulated peripheral blood monocytes to become tumoricidal against this malignant cell line. When IFN-γ activates monocytes to become tumoricidal, additional stimulation by exogenously added lipopolysaccharide is required. No such exogenous signals were required for the activation of monocytes by GM-CSF."

https://openalex.org/W2000139612,"The establishment of the segmental body pattern of Drosophila requires the coordinated functions of three classes of zygotically active genes early in development. We have examined the effects of mutations in these genes on the spatial expression of the fushi tarazu (ftz) pair-rule segmentation gene. Mutations in four gap loci and in three pair-rule loci dramatically affect the initial pattern of transverse stripes of ftz-containing nuclei. Five other pair-rule genes and several other loci that affect the larval cuticular pattern do not detectably affect ftz expression. No simple regulatory relationships can be deduced. Rather, expression of the ftz gene depends upon the interactions among the different segmentation genes active at each position along the anterior-posterior axis of the early embryo."

https://openalex.org/W1507560840,"Two GTP-binding trimeric proteins (referred to as alpha 41 beta gamma and alpha 39 beta gamma based on the kilodalton molecular weights of their alpha-subunits) were purified from rat brain as the specific substrates of the ADP-ribosylation reaction catalyzed by islet-activating protein, pertussis toxin, and resolved irreversibly into alpha- and beta gamma-subunits by incubation with guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). Some of these resolved subunits interacted directly with the adenylate cyclase catalyst partially purified from rat brain in a detergent-containing solution, resulting in inhibition of the cyclase activity as follows. 1) GTP gamma S-bound alpha 41 inhibited the catalyst, but GTP gamma S-bound alpha 39 did not; the inhibition was competitive with GTP gamma S-bound alpha-subunit of Ns, the GTP-binding protein involved in activation of adenylate cyclase. 2) beta gamma from either alpha 41 beta gamma or alpha 39 beta gamma inhibited the catalyst in a manner not competitive with the activator such as forskolin or the alpha-subunit of Ns. 3) The ADP-ribosylation of alpha 41 beta gamma by islet-activating protein did not exert any influence on the subsequent GTP gamma S-induced resolution and the ability of the resolved GTP gamma S-bound alpha 41 to inhibit the catalyst. 4) The beta gamma-induced inhibition of the catalyst was additive to the inhibition caused by GTP gamma S-bound alpha 41. Thus, the direct inhibition of the catalyst by beta gamma or GTP gamma S-bound alpha 41 is a likely mechanism involved in receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, in addition to the previously proposed indirect inhibition due to the reduction of the concentration of the active alpha-subunit of Ns by reassociation with beta gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1531929623,"Type X collagen is a recently discovered product of hypertrophic chondrocytes that is localized to presumptive mineralization zones of hyaline cartilage. Thus, in the epiphyseal growth plate of long bones it is present only in the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes and absent in the resting and rapidly growing cartilage and in bone. Type X collagen represents, therefore, a transient and developmentally regulated collagen which is synthesized by a subpopulation of chondrocytes. We report here the isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic clones specific for the chicken protein. The results demonstrate that the polypeptide chains of this collagen contain three distinct domains: a short non-collagenous, amino-terminal region, a collagenous domain of 460 amino acid residues, and a non-collagenous, carboxyl-terminal domain of 170 amino acid residues. The nucleotide sequence of the gene shows that these domains are encoded by a long open reading frame that is not interrupted by introns. Examination of the amino acid sequence derived from this nucleotide sequence reveals the presence of a hydrophobic segment localized 10 amino acid residues upstream from the translational stop codon. The length and sequence characteristics of this segment raise the intriguing possibility that Type X collagen polypeptides may contain a transmembrane segment."
https://openalex.org/W1598059529,"The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA), which activates protein kinase C, acted synergistically with A23187 to decrease muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) number in neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115) as determined by a filter binding assay using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in membrane homogenates. After a 6-h incubation, 10(-7) M PMA and 3 X 10(-7) M A23187 reduced mAChR number 30-40%, compared to the 40-50% reduction observed after treatment with 10(-3) M carbachol, a muscarinic agonist. Incubation with 3 X 10(-7) M A23187 and 10(-7) M 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, an inactive phorbol ester, did not alter mAChR number. The addition of PMA and A23187 to cultures incubated with 10(-3) M carbachol caused only a modest 6% further reduction in mAChR number as compared to incubation with carbachol alone. The kinetics of the decrease in mAChR number produced by PMA/A23187 were similar to those seen after carbachol treatment. Recovery of mAChR number after treatment with either carbachol or PMA/A23187 was blocked by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Intact cell binding studies employing [3H]N-methylscopolamine showed that treatment with either PMA/A23187 or carbachol caused a rapid (within 15 min) loss of receptors from the cell surface prior to the decrease in total mAChR number. PMA (10(-7) M), but not 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, promoted the translocation of protein kinase C activity from the cytosol to the membrane. Incubation with carbachol increased membrane-associated protein kinase C activity within 5 min with an EC50 of 3 X 10(-6) M. This increase persisted for at least 60 min in the continued presence of carbachol and was blocked by simultaneous incubation with atropine. These results suggest that activation of protein kinase C may be involved in the regulation of mAChR number in response to agonist."
https://openalex.org/W1974826934,"The genetic control of courtship song differences between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans males was investigated by producing hybrids from reciprocal crosses. The song rhythm difference between the parental species appears to be due to sex-linked genes, whereas the basic interpulse-interval difference is autosomally inherited. Hybrid females show selective preferences for artificially generated songs carrying intermediate ""hybrid"" characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1512432174,"We recently reported the partial characterization of a new human collagen termed Type VII. This molecule is distinctive among the collagen family in that it contains three identical subunit alpha chains within a triple helical domain 424 nm in length. The molecule contains three identical alpha chains which are genetically distinct from other known collagens. Previous studies indicate that a portion of the limited pepsin-solubilized molecules appears to exist as antiparallel dimers associated by disulfide bonds. In this report, we demonstrate that the major tissue form of Type VII collagen is a dimer, associated by disulfide bonds through a 60-nm overlap of the aminoterminal triple helical ends. Intermolecular disulfide bonds occur only within this overlap region. Interchain disulfide bonds exist in the carboxyl terminal 7% of the molecule and may exist within the overlap region as well. Disulfide bond-stabilized aggregates larger than dimers are not seen."
https://openalex.org/W1550682466,"A child with the type VII form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was shown to have a structural defect in the amino terminus of the pro-alpha 1(I) chain of type I procollagen. Normal and mutant amino-terminal cyanogen bromide peptides (pN-alpha 1(I) CB0,1 peptides) were purified from the medium of the patient's cultured fibroblasts. Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from the mutant pN-alpha 1(I) CB0,1 peptide showed that an expected sequence of 24 amino acids (positions 136-159 of the normal pN-alpha 1(I) CB0,1 peptide) was deleted. The segment deleted from the mutant pro-alpha 1(I) chain contains the small globular region of the NH2-propeptide, the procollagen N-proteinase cleavage site, the NH2-telopeptide, and first triplet of the helix of the alpha I(I) collagen chain (Chu, M.-L., de Wet, W., Bernard, M., Ding, J.F., Morabito, M., Myers, J., Williams, C., and Ramirez, F. (1984) Nature 310, 337-340). Loss of the procollagen N-proteinase cleavage site from the mutant pro-alpha 1(I) chain accounted for the persistence of its NH2-propeptide despite normal production of the N-proteinase by cultured mutant fibroblasts. Collagen production by mutant fibroblasts was doubled possibly due to reduced feedback inhibition by the NH2-propeptides. The child appeared to be heterozygous for the peptide deletion and, as the parents did not show any evidence of the deletion, it is likely that the child had a new mutation of one allele of the pro-alpha 1(I) gene. The deleted peptide corresponds precisely to the sequence coded by exon 46 of the normal pro-alpha 1(I) gene (Chu, M.-L., de Wet, W., Bernard, M., Ding, J.F., Morabito, M., Myers, J., Williams, C., and Ramirez, F. (1984) Nature 310, 337-340)."
https://openalex.org/W1967078340,"The pathophysiology of anaphylaxis is very complex, and the sequelae of events are not fully explained in terms of the effects of histamine and peptide leukotrienes alone. Platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine, PAF-acether) has been detected in animals undergoing anaphylaxis. Injection of synthetic PAF-acether induces similar effects, including bronchoconstriction, respiratory arrest, systemic hypotension, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The results reported here demonstrate that the histamine- and leukotriene-independent component of guinea pig anaphylaxis in vivo and in isolated lung parenchymal strips in vitro is mediated by PAF-acether. However, PAF-acether is not responsible for the anaphylaxis-induced thrombocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2027809400,"The runt gene is required in a Drosophila embryo for normal segmentation. We investigate this requirement by analyzing runt mutations of varying strength and by manipulating wild-type gene dosage. Elimination of runt causes periodic deletions in the segmentation pattern which are spaced at two segment intervals along the antero-posterior axis. The pattern deletions produced by partial loss of function mutations and by halving the normal wild-type gene dosage reveal a gradation in the requirement for runt, with the centers of the affected regions being most sensitive to deletion. Significantly, increased runt+ dosage causes an anti-runt phenotype consisting of periodic pattern deletions that are out of phase with those caused by runt mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1509227091,"UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase has been purified from two sources. A soluble form, purified 517,000-fold to homogeneity from bovine colostrum, has a molecular mass of 70,000 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 69,000 daltons by gel filtration. A membrane-bound form, partially purified 2,500-fold from BW5147 mouse lymphoma cells, has a molecular mass of 70,000 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 71,500 daltons by gel filtration.

The Km is 8 microM for UDP-GalNAc and 2.5 mg/ml for deglycosylated bovine submaxillary mucin. Treatments with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and F indicate that the colostrum enzyme is a glycoprotein containing two N-linked oligosaccharides. On most enzyme molecules, both oligosaccharides are of the complex type, but some molecules contain one complex type and one high mannose type.

https://openalex.org/W1523687014,"In the preceding paper, we reported that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells contain two different serine-exchange enzymes (I and II) which catalyze the base-exchange reaction of phospholipid(s) with serine and that a phosphatidylserine-requiring mutant (strain PSA-3) of CHO cells is defective in serine-exchange enzyme I and lacks the ability to synthesize phosphatidylserine (Kuge, O., Nishijima, M., and Akamatsu, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5790-5794). In this study, we examined precursor phospholipids for phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in CHO cells. When mutant PSA-3 and parent (CHO-K1) cells were cultured with [32P]phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine in the parent accumulated radioactivity while that in the mutant was not labeled significantly. On the contrary, when cultured with [32P]phosphatidylethanolamine, the mutant incorporated the label into phosphatidylserine more efficiently than the parent. Furthermore, we found that mutant PSA-3 grew normally in growth medium supplemented with 30 microM phosphatidylethanolamine as well as phosphatidylserine and that the biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine in the mutant was biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine in the mutant was normal when cells were cultured in the presence of exogenous phosphatidylethanolamine. The simplest interpretation of these findings is that phosphatidylserine in CHO cells is biosynthesized through the following sequential reactions: phosphatidylcholine----phosphatidylserine----phosphatidylethanolamine--- - phosphatidylserine. The three reactions are catalyzed by serine-exchange enzyme I, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, and serine-exchange enzyme II, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1604658771,"Apolipoprotein synthesis was measured in control optic nerves and optic nerves undergoing Wallerian degeneration. After short term organ culture with radiolabeled amino acid, optic nerve extracts were reacted with antiserum to rat or chicken apolipoproteins. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the degenerating rat optic nerve, apo-E synthesis increased from 0.30 to 0.90% of newly synthesized protein and from 0.45 to 1.4% of secreted protein. A DNA-excess solution hybridization assay was constructed to measure the absolute amount of apo-E mRNA in control and degenerating optic nerves. Paralleling the increase in apo-E protein synthesis, the absolute amount of apo-E mRNA was elevated 3- to 4-fold after enucleation. Similar to rat apo-E, apo-A-I synthesis was increased in degenerating chicken optic nerve. Chicken apo-A-I represented 0.65 and 3.5% of newly synthesized protein from control and enucleated optic nerves, respectively. Apo-A-I increased from 0.85 to 5.5% of secreted protein following enucleation. Using in vitro translation to quantitate relative amounts of chicken apo-A-I mRNA, enucleated optic nerve apo-A-I mRNA content was increased 5-fold. These results suggest that local apolipoprotein synthesis may be involved in the mobilization of myelin cholesterol which occurs during Wallerian degeneration. The similar response of the rat and chicken to increase optic nerve apolipoprotein synthesis during degeneration supports the idea that avian peripheral apo-A-I and mammalian peripheral apo-E may be performing functions common to both classes of animals."
https://openalex.org/W1980301409,"The human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) precursor comprises the GnRH sequence followed by an extension of 59 amino acids. Basic amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminal extension may represent sites of processing to biologically active peptides. A synthetic peptide comprising the first 13 amino acids (H X Asp-Ala-Glu-Asn-Leu-Ile-Asp-Ser-Phe-Gln-Glu-Ile-Val X OH) of the 59-amino acid peptide was found to stimulate the release of gonadotropic hormones from human and baboon anterior pituitary cells in culture. The peptide did not affect thyrotropin or prolactin secretion. A GnRH antagonist did not inhibit gonadotropin stimulation by the peptide, and the peptide did not compete with GnRH for GnRH pituitary receptors, indicating that the action of the peptide is independent of the GnRH receptor. The GnRH precursor contains two distinct peptide sequences capable of stimulating gonadotropin release from human and baboon pituitary cells."

H., and Bruckner, P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4758-4763). Here we demonstrate that the chondroitin sulfate carrying 115-kDa polypeptide of type IX collagen corresponds to the alpha 2(IX) chain. In addition the 84- and 68-kDa polypeptides were identified as the alpha 1(IX) and the alpha 3(IX) chains, respectively. This conclusion is based on a comparison of the tryptic fingerprints of the 84-, 115-, and 68-kDa chains of type IX collagen on high performance liquid chromatography with the similarly treated C2, C3, and C5 chains of the peptic fragment HMW. In addition, we provide evidence that both the C3 and C4 components of HMW are derived from the alpha 2(IX) chain."
https://openalex.org/W1672168449,"A perfused rat liver was used to study the effects of 5-diazo-4-oxo-L-norvaline on lysosomal glycoprotein catabolism. Addition of this compound (1.0 mM) to the perfusate reduced activity of beta-aspartyl-N-acetylglucosylamine amidohydrolase by 99% in 1 h. Treated livers were unable to completely degrade endocytosed N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine-labeled asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein as evidenced by a 50% reduction in radiolabeled serum glycoprotein secretion compared to controls. This decreased degradation was matched by a lysosomal accumulation of glycopeptides with the structure: GlcNAc beta(1-4)GlcNAc-Asn. The result suggested the presence of an unrecognized glycosidase in rat liver lysosomes, since this remnant was extended by one more GlcNAc residue than would have been expected after specific inactivation of the amidohydrolase. Such a novel enzyme would therefore catalyze cleavage of the N-acetylglucosamine residue at the reducing end of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein oligosaccharides only following removal of the linking Asn. The activity was then detected in lysosomal extracts by using intact asialo-biantennary oligosaccharides labeled with [3H] galactose or N-acetyl[14C]glucosamine residues as a substrate. To prevent simultaneous digestion of the material from its nonreducing end, beta-D-galactosidase in the enzyme extract was first inactivated with the irreversible active site-directed inhibitor, beta-D-galactopyranosylmethyl-p-nitrophenyltriazene. The observed di-N-acetylchitobiose cleaving activity worked optimally at pH 3.4 and was uniquely associated with the lysosomal fraction of the liver homogenate. The enzyme also cleaved triantennary chains and di-N-acetylchitobiose, but failed to hydrolyze substrates that had been reduced with NaBH4. The new glycosidase was well separated from N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (assayed with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucosaminide) by gel filtration chromatography and had an apparent molecular weight of 37,000. A similar enzyme that hydrolyzes di-N-acetylchitobiose had previously been found in extracts of human liver (Stirling, J. L. (1974) FEBS Lett. 39, 171-175)."
https://openalex.org/W1544755511,"A catalytically active gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase was prepared from pure, but inactive, gamma subunit obtained by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC procedure (Crabb, J. W., and Heilmeyer, L. M. J., Jr. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6346-6350) leaves the isolated gamma subunit in 50% acetonitrile and 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.5) and assay of this species at pH 8.2 indicates that it is inactive. Reactivation occurred, however, when the HPLC-isolated gamma subunit was diluted into an ice-cold, pH 8.2 buffer containing both calcium and calmodulin. Optimum reactivation depended on time, temperature, concentration of the HPLC solvent components, gamma subunit concentration, pH, the presence of both calcium and calmodulin, and an additional protein such as bovine serum albumin or phosphorylase b. Studies of the reactivated gamma subunit in the presence of the reactivation mixture indicate that it may be equivalent to a gamma delta subunit complex previously isolated (Chan, K.-F. J., and Graves, D. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5939-5947). Like the gamma delta subunit complex, the catalytic activity of the reactivated gamma subunit species is not significantly affected by pH within the range of pH 6.8-8.2 and is inhibited 70% by removal of Ca2+. A reactivated gamma subunit free of calmodulin was also obtained. This was done by first substituting agarose-bound calmodulin for free calmodulin in the reactivation procedure described above and, then, elution of the gamma subunit from the calmodulin-agarose with a solution containing 1.0 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The activity of the isolated, active gamma subunit is insensitive to Ca2+ and is stimulated 1.4-fold in a calcium-dependent manner by the addition of calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W2151520786,"Removal of ADP-ribose from the iron protein of nitrogenase by activating enzyme resulted in the activation of the inactive iron protein. A radioassay that directly measured the initial velocity of the activation was developed using iron protein radiolabeled with either [8-3H]- or [G-32P]ADP-ribose. The release of radiolabeled ADP-ribose by activating enzyme was linearly correlated with the increase in the specific activity of the iron protein as measured by acetylene reduction. Both ATP and MnCl2 were required for the activation of inactive iron protein. The optimal ratio of [MnCl2]/[ATP] in the radioassay was 2:1, and the optimal concentrations were 4 mM and 2 mM for [MnCl2] and [ATP], respectively. The Km for inactive iron protein was 74 microM and the Vmax was 628 pmol of [32P] ADP-ribose released min-1 microgram of activating enzyme-1. Adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, or uridine mono-, di-, or triphosphates did not substitute for ATP in the activation of native iron protein. Activating enzyme removed ADP-ribose from oxygen-denatured iron protein in the absence of ATP. ADP, ADP-ribose, pyrophosphate, and high concentrations of NaCl inhibited activating enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1504388745,"The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been shown to induce the differentiation of a murine pre-B like cell line 70Z/3. An early intracellular event caused by exposure to IL-1 is an amiloride-sensitive progressive rise in the total concentration of intracellular sodium ([Na]i), caused by influx of Na+ from outside, and a transient fall in total intracellular calcium. The results suggest that IL-1-induced influx of Na+ into 70Z/3 occurs via stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiport. IL-1-induced differentiation is also blocked by amiloride suggesting that stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange may play a role in IL-1-induced differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1648153747,"Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells can be induced to differentiate into mature granulocytes by exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide. The addition of N-formylMet-Leu-Phe or the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to these differentiated cells generated 15-30 pmol of platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacetyl-GPC)/10(6) cells as quantified by platelet aggregation assays. Under identical conditions, uninduced cells produced little alkylacetyl-GPC. Upon the addition of ionophore A23187, differentiated cells, and not uninduced ones, released [14C]arachidonate from prelabeled phospholipids including ether-linked phosphatidylcholines, formed both 3H-labeled 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkyllyso-GPC) and [3H]alkylacetyl-GPC from endogenous 3H-labeled 1-O-alkyl-2-(long chain) acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (alkylacyl-GPC), and incorporated exogenously added [3H]acetate or [3H]alkyllyso-GPC into alkylacetyl-GPC. These results are suggestive that both phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase activities are involved in alkylacetyl-GPC biosynthesis by HL60 cells and that these activities appear during differentiation. However, when measured in cell extracts, the activities of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase of uninduced cells were virtually indistinguishable from those of differentiated cells. Uninduced cells exhibited enhanced incorporation of [3H]alkyllyso-GPC or [3H]alkylacetyl-GPC into alkylacyl-GPC and of [14C]arachidonate and [14C]oleate into various phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine. However, such enhanced expression of acylation reactions could not account for the lack of accumulation of arachidonate or of alkylacetyl-GPC by uninduced cells. Furthermore, analyses of phospholipid classes by phosphorus determination showed no significant alterations in phospholipid composition of HL60 cells during differentiation. Together these data are suggestive that mechanisms regulating the activation of phospholipase A2 and acetyltransferase activities are defective in uninduced cells and that an increased concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ alone is not a sufficient requirement for these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1552408096,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces aggregation and the release of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine from human platelets rendered permeable with saponin. This action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is associated with a significant formation of thromboxane B2, activation of phospholipase C, and phosphorylation of 20,000- and 40,000-dalton proteins, which are the substrates for myosin light chain kinase and protein kinase C, respectively. All of these responses are blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin and aspirin and the dual cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor 3-amino-1-[m-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2-pyrazoline (BW 755C). These data indicate that platelet activation by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is initiated by the mobilization of Ca2+, which leads to phospholipase A2 activation. The thromboxanes and endoperoxides that are subsequently generated then induce activation via cell surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1528778858,"A UDP-Gal:N-acetyllactosaminide alpha (1,3)-galactosyltransferase from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has been purified over 200,000-fold to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity. The purified enzyme transfers D-galactosyl groups from UDP-Gal to beta-D-Gal-(1,4)-D-GlcNAc in alpha-linkage. The apparent Km values for donor and acceptor substrates are 12.6 microM and 1.15 mM, respectively. The trisaccharides beta-D-Gal(1,4)-beta-D-GlcNAc(1,2)- or (1,6)-D-Man exhibit a Km 5-fold lower than that of N-acetyllactosamine, and an even more pronounced effect is observed with the biantennary pentasaccharide beta-D-Gal(1,4)-beta-D-GlcNAc(1,2)-[beta-D-Gal(1, 4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1,6)]-D-Man (Km 0.10 mM). The transferase shows a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions with an apparent subunit molecular weight of 80,000, exhibits a pH optimum at 6.2, and requires Mn2+ ions and detergent for enzymatic activity. Specificity studies using immobilized oligosaccharides show that the minimum acceptor structure for the alpha-galactosyltransferase is N-acetyllactosamine. The narrow specificity of the alpha-galactosyltransferase is indicated by the fact that lactose, beta-D-Gal(1,3)-D-GlcNAc, and beta-D-Gal(1,4)-[alpha-L-Fuc(1,3)]-D-GlcNAc are very poor acceptors. The enzyme differs from the blood-group B-specified galactosyltransferase in that the sequence alpha-L-Fuc(1,2)-beta-D-Gal(1,4)-D-GlcNAc is not an acceptor. Oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans containing the terminal nonreducing N-acetyllactosamine unit all serve as acceptors for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1495609748,"The proteoglycans secreted by a malignant human breast cell line (MDA-MB-231) were compared with the corresponding proteoglycans from a normal human breast cell line (HBL-100). The physicochemical characteristics of these proteoglycans were established by hexosamine analysis, chemical and enzymatic degradations, and dissociative cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and by gel filtration before and after alkaline beta-elimination. Both cell lines secreted approximately 70% of the synthesized proteoglycans, which were composed of 20% heparan sulfate and 80% chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The MDA cell line secreted large hydrodynamic size (major) and small hydrodynamic size heparan sulfate proteoglycan. In contrast HBL cells secreted only one species having a hydrodynamic size intermediate to the above two. The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans from MDA medium were slightly larger than the corresponding polymers from HBL medium. All proteoglycans except the small hydrodynamic size heparan sulfate proteoglycan from MDA medium were of high buoyant density. The proteoglycans of both cell lines contained significant proportions of disulfide-linked lower molecular weight components which were more pronounced in the proteoheparan sulfate polymers, particularly those from MDA medium, than in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The glycosaminoglycans of heparan sulfate proteoglycans from MDA medium were more heterogeneous than those from HBL medium. The glycosaminoglycan chains of large hydrodynamic size heparan sulfate proteoglycans from MDA medium were larger in size than those from HBL medium while small hydrodynamic size heparan sulfate proteoglycans contained shorter glycosaminoglycan chains. In contrast to the glycosaminoglycans derived from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of both MDA and HBL medium were comparable in size. The heparan sulfate as well as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of both cell lines contained both neutral (di- and tetrasaccharides) and sialylated (tri- to hexasaccharides) O-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2016651010,"A complete human γ1 heavy chain gene (HIG1) was transferred into mouse cells by protoplast fusion. The HIG1 gene was strongly expressed in mouse myeloma cells but not in mouse fibroblasts (L cells). Nuclear extracts from myeloma cells were injected into L cell transformants containing one copy of the HIG1 gene; this triggered accurate transcription of the HIG1 gene in the transformants. The induction of HIG1 gene expression by a myeloma nuclear factor (or factors) appeared to depend on the enhancers in the heavy chain gene. Nuclear proteins prepared from cells of the B lineage could induce the transcription of HIG1 gene in the L cell transformants, while those from the cells of non-B-lineage could not. The present study shows that positive regulatory trans-acting factors are involved in the activation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene through its enhancers and are contained only in cells of the B lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1515517002,"The formation of a complex between the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and the Inhibitor Protein of this enzyme has been examined by means of nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Two forms of complex were identified, both containing a 1:1 molar ratio of the component proteins. The formation of the major of the two forms is markedly enhanced by the presence of nucleotide triphosphate and divalent cation. Either Mg2+ or Mn2+ serves to promote complex formation. With Mg2+, only ATP is effective for enhancing complex formation, whereas with Mn2+ complex formation occurs to an equal extent with ATP, GTP, ITP, and adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. The formation of the two complexes is only minimally dependent upon nucleotide triphosphate. It is suggested that the two types of complex are a result of different species of catalytic subunit. Two principal forms of the complex have been detected occurring maximally in approximately a 2.5:1 ratio. In the accompanying paper (Fletcher, W.H., Van Patten, S.M., Cheng, H-C., and Walsh, D.A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5504-5513), we have described the use of a fluoresceinated derivative of catalytic subunit as a cytochemical probe to localize the Inhibitor Protein and the regulatory subunit of the protein kinase. The integrity of this fluorophore has been further characterized using the method of examining catalytic subunit-Inhibitor Protein interaction delineated here."
https://openalex.org/W1511292826,"Radioactive labeling of p-collagens V, collagens V, and, to a small extent, of procollagen V occurred when [35S]sulfate was incubated with tendons or primary tendon cell cultures, or blood vessels and crops of 17- to 19-day-old chick embryos, or with lung slices from neonatal rats. Most or all of this label is in the form of 1 or more sulfated tyrosine residues/chain of p alpha 1(V), alpha 1(V), p alpha 1'(V), alpha 1'(V), p alpha 2(V), and alpha 2(V), and it remains attached through purification by dialysis, ammonium sulfate precipitation, CsCl-GdnCl2 equilibrium buoyant density and velocity sedimentations, ion-exchange chromatography, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Radioactive tyrosine sulfate was identified in alkaline hydrolysates of these collagen V chains, after labeling the tissues with either [35S]sulfate or [3H]tyrosine, by electrophoretic and chromatographic comigration with a tyrosine sulfate standard. Tunicamycin A1, which inhibits the attachment of N-linked complex carbohydrate, did not interfere with the sulfation process. The tyrosine sulfate is located in a noncollagenous domain, which is probably adjacent to the amino end of the collagen helix, and is retained throughout the physiological proteolytic processing of procollagens V. After digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, 35S-labeled p alpha 1(V) and alpha 1(V) chains gave the same map of labeled peptides, and this differed from the map given by p alpha 1'(V) and alpha 1'(V) chains. Little sulfation of p alpha 2(V) and alpha 2(V) chains occurs. The implications of these observations for the structure and properties of procollagens V and their derivatives are considered."
https://openalex.org/W1496848333,Affinity chromatography on galactose-Sepharose has been utilized to demonstrate that rat liver asialoglycoprotein receptor synthesized in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate system is capable of binding carbohydrate ligand only when dog pancreas microsomes are present during translation. Analysis of receptor isolated from tunicamycin-treated rat hepatocytes indicates that glycosylation is not necessary for receptor activity. Genetically engineered receptor derivatives in which the natural membrane anchor is either deleted entirely or replaced with a cleavable signal sequence derived from dog preproinsulin have been used to demonstrate that: (a) inactive receptor made in the absence of membranes does not result from incorrect nucleation of folding around the hydrophobic portion of the polypeptide which is normally buried in the membrane and (b) the carbohydrate-binding domain of the receptor does not need to be tethered to the luminal side of the membrane to fold correctly. These results suggest that factors within the lumen of the microsomes are essential to establish the native conformation of the binding domain.

https://openalex.org/W1562440089,"The recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor was expressed in mouse mammary epithelial cells following the transfection of these cells with an expression vector containing the human IL-2 receptor cDNA. The recombinant IL-2 receptor in these cells was rapidly phosphorylated in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), but its phosphorylation could not be detected in the absence of PMA or upon addition of human IL-2. The C-terminal, cytoplasmic peptide domain of the IL-2 receptor, Gln-Arg-Arg-Gln-Arg-Lys-Ser-Arg-Arg-Thr-Ile, was synthesized and used as a substrate for protein kinase C. The Km for phosphorylation of the peptide by protein kinase C was 23 microM. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 1 mol of phosphate/mol of peptide and serine was the predominant amino acid phosphorylated. Because this peptide was a good substrate for protein kinase C in vitro, it was possible that the same serine (serine 247) was also phosphorylated in the receptor in the cell. The IL-2 receptor gene in the expression vector was therefore altered by site-directed mutagenesis to code for an IL-2 receptor containing an alanine in the place of serine 247. The IL-2 receptor expressed by these cells was not phosphorylated in the presence of PMA. These data suggest that protein kinase C, in response to PMA, phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residue (serine 247) in the human IL-2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W95923340,Cultured fibroblasts from different variants of GM1-gangliosidosis synthesize normal amounts of 88-kDa beta-galactosidase precursor. Yet the amount of the mature 64-kDa form is reduced to 5-15% of normal values. In this communication it is shown that the mutation in the infantile and adult form of GM1-gangliosidosis interferes with the phosphorylation of precursor beta-galactosidase. As a result the precursor is secreted instead of being compartmentalized into the lysosomes and further processed. The impaired phosphorylation might be due to conformational changes of the precursor molecule.
https://openalex.org/W1997534410,"The metabolism of styrene by prostaglandin hydroperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase was examined. Ram seminal vesicle microsomes in the presence of arachidonic acid or hydrogen peroxide and glutathione converted styrene to glutathione adducts. Neither styrene 7,8-oxide nor styrene glycol was detected as a product in the incubation. Also, the addition of styrene 7,8-oxide and glutathione to ram seminal vesicle microsomes did not yield styrene glutathione adducts. The peroxidase-generated styrene glutathione adducts were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by NMR and tandem mass spectrometry as a mixture of (2R)- and (2S)-S-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)glutathione. (1R)- and (1S)-S-(1-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)glutathione were not formed by the peroxidase system. The addition of phenol or aminopyrine to incubations, which greatly enhances the oxidation of glutathione to a thiyl radical by peroxidases, increased the formation of styrene glutathione adducts. We propose a new mechanism for the formation of glutathione adducts that is independent of epoxide formation but dependent on the initial oxidation of glutathione to a thiyl radical by the peroxidase, and the subsequent reaction of the thiyl radical with a suitable substrate, such as styrene."
https://openalex.org/W1509168848,"The sodium-dependent leucine transport system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reconstituted into liposomes of specific polar head group composition. Na+-dependent counterflow and Na+ gradient-driven transport were measured as reconstituted transport activities. Proteoliposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine exhibited increased transport activities. Phosphatidylglycerol, second to phosphatidylethanolamine, also enhanced the reconstituted transport activities. Proteoliposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine did not accumulate leucine. The enhanced transport activity by phosphatidylethanolamine was significantly influenced by its fatty acid composition. Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine was more effective in stimulating counterflow activity than dilauroylphosphatidylethanolamine. These results show that the leucine transport system of P. aeruginosa is sensitive to not only the polar head group composition but also the acyl group composition of phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1539656150,"An aminopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from bovine lens tissue by gel filtration and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 96,000 under both native and denaturing conditions. The purified enzyme hydrolyzed a variety of synthetic substrates as well as di-, tri-, and higher molecular weight peptides. Significantly this enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing arginine, lysine, and proline aminoacyl bonds. The pH optimum for activity and stability was 6.0. Both a reduced sulfhydryl group and a divalent metal ion are essential for activity. The native enzyme contains 1.6 mol of zinc and 1.0 mol of copper/mol of enzyme. No activation was seen upon incubation with either magnesium or manganese; however, heavy metal ions were inhibitory. Bestatin and puromycin were effective inhibitors and no endopeptidase activity could be detected in the purified preparation. This enzyme is clearly distinct from the lens leucine aminopeptidase, but rather, is identical to a cytosolic aminopeptidase III isolated from other tissues. Evidence is presented which argues that this enzyme may be the major lens aminopeptidase under in vivo conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1570559562,"The nucleotide affinity label 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine reacts at the active site of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, with irreversible inactivation occurring concomitant with incorporation of about 1 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit (Annamalai, A. E., and Colman, R. F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10276-10283). Purified peptides have now been isolated from 70% inactivated enzyme containing 0.7 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit. Rabbit muscle enzyme labeled with radioactive 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine was digested with thermolysin. Nucleosidyl peptides were purified by chromatography on phenylboronate-agarose and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. After amino acid and N-terminal analysis, the peptides were identified by comparison with the primary sequences of chicken and cat muscle enzyme. About 75% of the reagent incorporated was distributed equally among three O-(4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl)tyrosine-containing peptides: Leu-Asp-CBS-Tyr-Lys-Asn, Val-CBS-Tyr, and Leu-Asp-Asn-Ala-CBS-Tyr. These tyrosines are located in a 28-residue segment of the 530-amino acid sequence. The remainder of the incorporation was found in two N epsilon-(4-carboxybenzenesulfonyl)lysine-containing peptides. Leu-CBS-Lys and Ala-CBS-Lys-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Pro. Modification in the presence of MnATP or MnADP resulted in a marked decrease in labeling of these peptides in proportion to the decreased inactivation. It is suggested that these modified residues are located in the region of the catalytically functional nucleotide binding site of pyruvate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2112452662,"A weakly expressed allele of Sgs-4 obtained from the Kochi strain of D. melanogaster (Sgs-4K) increases 4-fold in levels of accumulated transcript when paired with a wild-type (Oregon-R) Sgs-4 allele (Sgs-4ORE) and increases 9-fold when paired with a duplication of the wild-type Sgs-4 allele Confluens (Sgs-4Co). There is no enhancement of expression when Sgs-4K is paired with the Sgs-4 null allele Ber-I (Sgs-4BER) or with another weakly expressed Sgs-4 allele, Hikone-R (Sgs-4HIK); there is minimal enhancement when chromosome pairing is disrupted near the Sgs-4 locus by rearrangement of the wild-type Sgs-4 allele. Cytological analysis of third instar salivary gland nuclei from Kochi/Confluens heterozygotes suggests that complete pairing is not essential for Sgs-4K enhancement. Interactions between homologous loci that could produce a trans enhancement effect are discussed and a hypothesis is formulated to test the significance of specific upstream sequences from both alleles in expression enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1569979216,"The presence of a common antigenic determinant on the Dictyostelium discoideum acid phosphatase isozyme 1 (ap 1), and the absence of this determinant on the isozyme ap2 enables separation of the two isozymes. This separation is accomplished by removal of ap1 from samples with a common antigen monoclonal antibody followed by immunoprecipitation of ap2 with an acid phosphatase monoclonal antibody. Application of this separation scheme on cells pulse-labeled early (2 h) and late (18 h) in the developmental cycle reveal that ap1 protein synthesis occurs only early in development and that the protein remains stable throughout development, whereas ap2 protein synthesis occurs only late in development. Furthermore, pulse-chase experiments during both early and late development reveal that both isozymes of acid phosphatase are initially synthesized as precursor molecules (Mr = 60,000) which are then processed to mature forms (Mr = 58,000). The processing event(s) for acid phosphatase begin in less than 5 min compared to 25-30 min for Dictyostelium alpha-mannosidase and 10-15 min for Dictyostelium beta-glucosidase. Endoglycosidase H and Endoglycosidase F treatment of both isozymes reveals identical cleavage patterns for ap1 and ap2, indicating that the amount of carbohydrate on both molecules is equivalent. Preliminary studies to identify modification differences reveal that fucose is not present on either isozyme; however, sulfate is present on the ap1 isozyme and absent on the ap2 isozyme. These results suggest that differences in the modification of newly synthesized acid phosphatase at different times during the Dictyostelium life cycle result in the appearance of two distinct acid phosphatase isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2134601829,"Abstract Human urine was found to contain an endo-beta-galactosidase capable of depolymerizing sulfated and non-sulfated polylactosaminoglycans. Using 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, this enzyme was not retained by DEAE-Sephadex A-50 or concanavalin A-Sepharose. The urinary endo-beta-galactosidase liberated a disaccharide with chromatographic mobility identical to 6-O-sulfo-GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal as one of the major products from keratan sulfates isolated from whale nasal cartilage, bovine cornea, and human costal cartilage. It also liberated GlcNAc beta 1----3 Gal as one of the major oligosaccharides from erythroglycan. The oligosaccharide profiles produced from various keratan sulfates and erythroglycan by the action of urinary endo-beta-galactosidase are quite similar to those produced by Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase (Nakagawa, H., Yamada, T., Chien, J.-L., Gardas, A., Kitamikado, M., Li, S.-C., and Li, Y.-T. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5955-5959). The presence of urinary endo-beta-galactosidase indicates the existence of a new catabolic pathway for polylactosaminoglycans. This pathway involves the cleavage of internal beta-galactosyl linkages of the glycan chain."
https://openalex.org/W1565580831,"The pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a is rapidly inactivated by incubation with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and glycine ethyl ester. On 90% of inactivation, 1.3 residues of [14C]glycine ethyl ester are incorporated per alpha subunit; nearly 60% of this is linked to the beta-carboxyl group of Asp-191. Histamine, a competitive inhibitor, protects against this inactivation. The KM value of the modified enzyme for histidine (6.2 mM) is much higher than that of the unmodified enzyme (KM = 0.4 mM); catalytic activity is reduced but not eliminated. Thus, Asp-191 is the most reactive accessible carboxyl group under these conditions and is close to the substrate-binding site, but apparently is not essential for catalysis. At pH 8.0, fluorodinitrobenzene inactivates histidine decarboxylase completely with the incorporation of two dinitrophenyl residues/alpha subunit; the modified residues are Lys-155 and Cys-228. Urocanic acid, a competitive inhibitor, protects against inactivation. Treatment with mercaptoethanol restores the free -SH of Cys-228 but does not restore activity. Conversion of Cys-228 to its cyano derivative slows but does not prevent dinitrophenylation of Lys-155; the resulting derivative is catalytically inactive. Thus, Lys-155 is located within the active site and may play an essential role in catalysis. Finally, histidine methyl ester was shown to inhibit this decarboxylase by forming a Schiff's base with the essential pyruvoyl group."
