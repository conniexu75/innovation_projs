https://openalex.org/W2005868568,"HIF is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian oxygen homeostasis. Recent studies have defined posttranslational modification by prolyl hydroxylation as a key regulatory event that targets HIF-alpha subunits for proteasomal destruction via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex. Here, we define a conserved HIF-VHL-prolyl hydroxylase pathway in C. elegans, and use a genetic approach to identify EGL-9 as a dioxygenase that regulates HIF by prolyl hydroxylation. In mammalian cells, we show that the HIF-prolyl hydroxylases are represented by a series of isoforms bearing a conserved 2-histidine-1-carboxylate iron coordination motif at the catalytic site. Direct modulation of recombinant enzyme activity by graded hypoxia, iron chelation, and cobaltous ions mirrors the characteristics of HIF induction in vivo, fulfilling requirements for these enzymes being oxygen sensors that regulate HIF."

We now show that Tsg101 protein, which functions in vacuolar protein sorting (Vps), is required for HIV-1 budding. The UEV domain of Tsg101 binds to an essential tetrapeptide (PTAP) motif within the p6 domain of the structural Gag protein and also to ubiquitin. Depletion of cellular Tsg101 by small interfering RNA arrests HIV-1 budding at a late stage, and budding is rescued by reintroduction of Tsg101. Dominant negative mutant Vps4 proteins that inhibit vacuolar protein sorting also arrest HIV-1 and MLV budding. These observations suggest that retroviruses bud by appropriating cellular machinery normally used in the Vps pathway to form multivesicular bodies."

To investigate the processes that trigger cellular responses to telomere dysfunction, we crossed mTR−/− G6 mice that have short telomeres with mice heterozygous for telomerase (mTR+/−) that have long telomeres. The phenotype of the telomerase null offspring was similar to that of the late generation parent, although only half of the chromosomes were short. Strikingly, spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis revealed that loss of telomere function occurred preferentially on chromosomes with critically short telomeres. Our data indicate that, while average telomere length is measured in most studies, it is not the average but rather the shortest telomeres that constitute telomere dysfunction and limit cellular survival in the absence of telomerase."
https://openalex.org/W2055703635,"Calcium and cyclic nucleotides have crucial roles in mammalian fertilization, but the molecules comprising the Ca2+-permeation pathway in sperm motility are poorly understood. Here we describe a putative sperm cation channel, CatSper, whose amino-acid sequence most closely resembles a single, six-transmembrane-spanning repeat of the voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel four-repeat structure. CatSper is located specifically in the principal piece of the sperm tail. Targeted disruption of the gene results in male sterility in otherwise normal mice. Sperm motility is decreased markedly in CatSper-/- mice, and CatSper-/- sperm are unable to fertilize intact eggs. In addition, the cyclic-AMP-induced Ca2+ influx is abolished in the sperm of mutant mice. CatSper is thus vital to cAMP-mediated Ca2+ influx in sperm, sperm motility and fertilization. CatSper represents an excellent target for non-hormonal contraceptives for both men and women."
https://openalex.org/W2079955502,"Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) is a DinB homolog that belongs to the recently described Y-family of DNA polymerases, which are best characterized by their low-fidelity synthesis on undamaged DNA templates and propensity to traverse normally replication-blocking lesions. Crystal structures of Dpo4 in ternary complexes with DNA and an incoming nucleotide, either correct or incorrect, have been solved at 1.7 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. Despite a conserved active site and a hand-like configuration similar to all known polymerases, Dpo4 makes limited and nonspecific contacts with the replicating base pair, thus relaxing base selection. Dpo4 is also captured in the crystal translocating two template bases to the active site at once, suggesting a possible mechanism for bypassing thymine dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2071481601,"The C. elegans genes ced-2, ced-5, and ced-10, and their mammalian homologs crkII, dock180, and rac1, mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and cell motility. Here, we describe an additional member of this signaling pathway, ced-12, and its mammalian homologs, elmo1 and elmo2. In C. elegans, CED-12 is required for engulfment of dying cells and for cell migrations. In mammalian cells, ELMO1 functionally cooperates with CrkII and Dock180 to promote phagocytosis and cell shape changes. CED-12/ELMO-1 binds directly to CED-5/Dock180; this evolutionarily conserved complex stimulates a Rac-GEF, leading to Rac1 activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. These studies identify CED-12/ELMO as an upstream regulator of Rac1 that affects engulfment and cell migration from C. elegans to mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1975971309,"Directed cell migrations are important for development, but the signaling pathways and mechanisms responsible for guiding cell migration in vivo are poorly understood. Migration of border cells during Drosophila oogenesis is a simple and attractive model system in which to address these questions. We demonstrate that PVR, a receptor tyrosine kinase related to mammalian PDGF and VEGF receptors, acts in border cells to guide them to the oocyte. The oocyte is the source of a ligand for PVR, PDGF/VEGF factor 1 (PVF1). Intriguingly, the guidance function of PVR is largely redundant with that of EGFR. We present evidence implicating Rac and the Rac activator Mbc/DOCK180/CED-5 as mediators of the guidance signal."
https://openalex.org/W2079332441,"Faces are visual objects in our environment that provide strong social cues, with the eyes assuming particular importance. Here we show that the perceived attractiveness of an unfamiliar face increases brain activity in the ventral striatum of the viewer when meeting the person's eye, and decreases activity when eye gaze is directed away. Depending on the direction of gaze, attractiveness can thus activate dopaminergic regions that are strongly linked to reward prediction, indicating that central reward systems may be engaged during the initiation of social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2083445344,"Expression of the yeast transcription factor Hac1p, which controls the unfolded protein response, is regulated posttranscriptionally. Hac1p is only produced when an intron at the 3' end of its mRNA is removed by a nonconventional, regulated splicing reaction. We show that a previously unrecognized base-pairing interaction between the intron and the 5' untranslated region is required and sufficient to block mRNA translation. Unspliced HAC1 mRNA is stable, located in the cytosol, and is associated with polyribosomes, yet does not produce protein, indicating that the ribosomes engaged on the mRNA are stalled. We show that the polysomal, cytoplasmic pool of HAC1 mRNA is a substrate for splicing, suggesting that the stalled ribosomes may resume translation after the intron is removed."
https://openalex.org/W2095506400,"Polarized delivery and incorporation of proteins and lipids to specific domains of the plasma membrane is fundamental to a wide range of biological processes such as neuronal synaptogenesis and epithelial cell polarization. The exocyst complex is specifically localized to sites of active exocytosis and plays essential roles in secretory vesicle targeting and docking at the plasma membrane. Sec3p, a component of the exocyst, is thought to be a spatial landmark for polarized exocytosis. In a search for proteins that regulate the localization of the exocyst in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found that certain cdc42 mutants affect the polarized localization of the exocyst proteins. In addition, we found that these mutant cells have a randomized protein secretion pattern on the cell surface. Biochemical experiments indicated that Sec3p directly interacts with Cdc42 in its GTP-bound form. Genetic studies demonstrated synthetically lethal interactions between cdc42 and several exocyst mutants. These results have revealed a role for Cdc42 in exocytosis.

Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeundergoes polarized growth, which requires directional transport and incorporation of newly synthesized materials to specific domains of the plasma membrane for cell surface expansion. Using the budding yeast as a model system, a large number of proteins involved in many essential cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, cell polarization, and membrane traffic have been identified (2Lew D.J. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Madden K. Snyder M.

Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Most of the proteins involved in these processes are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotic organisms. Recent studies have indicated that a multiprotein complex, termed the exocyst, is involved in vesicle targeting and docking at the plasma membrane (6TerBush D.R. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7TerBush D.R. Maurice T.M. Roth D. Novick P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The exocyst consists of eight components: Sec3p, Sec5p, Sec6p, Sec8p, Sec10p, Sec15p, Exo70p, and Exo84p. They are specifically localized to sites of active exocytosis. In developing neurons, exocyst components are localized to growth cones and the tips of growing neurites (13Hazuka C.D. Foletti D.L. Hsu S.C. Kee Y. Hopf F.W. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in epithelial cells, they are concentrated near the tight junction, a region of active basolateral membrane addition (14Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast, the exocyst proteins are localized to regions of active cell surface expansion: the bud tip at the early phases of the cell cycle and the mother/daughter connection during cytokinesis (6TerBush D.R. Novick P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The exocyst subunit Sec3p is localized to sites of exocytosis independent of the actin cytoskeleton and ongoing membrane traffic (8Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In a variety of mutants blocking secretion at or before the Golgi apparatus, GFP-Sec3p is still localized at bud tips and mother/daughter cell connections. Thus Sec3p, rather than “riding” the vesicles to these sites, appears to be at the exocytic sites in “anticipation” of the arrival of the secretory vesicles (5Finger F.P. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the localization of Sec3p appears to be independent of the other subunits of the exocyst (8Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it was proposed that Sec3p represents a spatial landmark for polarized secretion (5Finger F.P. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In addition to Sec3p, several other components of the yeast exocytic machinery are also localized to sites of polarized growth. For example, Sec4p, the Rab protein essential for post-Golgi secretion, is localized to exocytic sites through its association with secretory vesicles, which are transported via the actin cytoskeleton (31Walch-Solimena C. Collins R.N. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1495-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Another exocyst protein, Sec15p, associates with secretory vesicles and interacts with the GTP-bound form of Sec4p. Sec4p promotes protein-protein interactions among the exocyst components, which then link Sec15p to Sec3p (10Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The assembly of the exocyst complex thereby tethers secretory vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane for subsequent membrane fusion. Proper localization of the exocyst complex is important for spatial regulation of secretion. To identify proteins that regulate the polarized localization of the exocyst, we examined the localization of GFP-tagged1 exocyst proteins in various classes of mutants. Here we report that the polarized localization of the exocyst is controlled by Cdc42. Cdc42 is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, which are master regulators of many cellular activities including polarization, morphogenesis, membrane traffic, and cell growth and development (4Chant J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 365-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,15Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cabib E. Drgonova J. Drgon T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We found in certain cdc42 mutants that the exocyst proteins were depolarized and the exocytosis pattern was randomized.In vitro assays indicated that Sec3p directly interacted with Cdc42 in its GTP-bound form. These results revealed a role for Cdc42 in polarized exocytosis and help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the polarized localization of exocytic machinery and the spatial regulation of secretion. Yeast cells were grown in YP medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) supplemented with 2% dextrose (YPD) or grown in a medium of synthetic complete plus 2% dextrose lacking certain supplements.

Drubin) Open table in a new tab To isolate temperature-sensitive mutations in CDC42 that may cause distinct morphological changes at either permissive or nonpermissive temperature, we randomly mutagenized the entire CDC42 gene by a PCR-based method. The mutagenic PCR conditions (100 μl of reaction volume) were as follows: 1 μl of template DNA (0.1 mg/ml) of plasmid pKS-CDC42, 2 μl of the forward (454 bp upstream of the start codon) and reverse (540 bp downstream of the stop codon) primers (50 mm each), 10 μl of Taq polymerase buffer (10× stock, Mg2+ free), 10 μl of Mg2+ (10× stock, 25 mm), 10 μl of mutagenic dNTPs mixture (10× stock; 2 mm dATP, 2 mm dGTP, 10 mm dCTP, and 10 mm dTTP), 1 μl of MnCl2 (50 mm), 1 μl of Taq (5 units/μl) (Promega), and 63 μl of double distilled H2O. PCR was carried out with the following program: 94 °C for 4 min → 94 °C for 1 min; 45 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 1 min 45 s for 30 cycles → 72 °C for 10 min → 4 °C. Multiple PCRs were combined, and the ∼1.6-kb PCR-amplified fragment was purified by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in double distilled H2O. The mutagenized PCR products were mixed with an equal amount of linearized pRS314-CDC42 (CEN TRP1), in which the entireCDC42 gene was removed by a restriction digestion withHpaI (67 bp upstream of the start codon) and NsiI (346 bp downstream of the stop codon). This mixture of DNA was transformed into strain YEF1194 (a cdc42Δ::HIS3,pRS316-GAL1-CDC42) (pRS316-GAL1-CDC42 is a centromere-based, URA3-marked plasmid carryingCDC42) grown in SC-Ura medium containing 2% glucose and 2% galactose to allow “gap repair” between the PCR products and the linearized pRS314-CDC42, and transformants were selected on SC-Trp plates at 24 °C. The transformants were replicated onto SC-Trp plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for the loss of plasmid pRS316-GAL1-CDC42 at 24 °C. These Trp+ Ura− transformants were replicated onto two sets of SC-Trp plates that were incubated at 24 and 37 °C, respectively, to allow the identification of temperature-sensitive mutants. Plasmids were rescued from mutants that displayed interesting morphologies at either permissive or nonpermissive temperature and were sequenced to confirm the existence of mutation(s) in CDC42. These plasmids were transformed into strain YEF1194 and processed as described above to confirm that the temperature-sensitive and morphological phenotypes were indeed caused by mutations on the plasmids. YEF1961 (cdc42-201) and YEF1962 (cdc42-13) were constructed through homologous recombination at thecdc42Δ::HIS3 locus by transforming a ∼1.7-kb BamHI-SalI fragment frompRS314-CDC42-201 or pRS314-CDC42-13 into YEF1194, selecting for colony formation on YPD plates (to repress the expression of CDC42 from the plasmid) at 24 °C. These colonies were then screened for His− and temperature sensitivity for growth. Finally, the colonies were “cured” of plasmidpRS316-GAL1-CDC42 by streaking out cells on synthetic complete medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid at 24 °C, thus forming the strains YEF1961 and YEF1962. The mutations in cdc42-201 are C6S, D31V, D65G, and F90C; the mutation incdc42-13 is R120G. The exocyst-GFP plasmids were transformed into wild type and various mutant yeast strains by integration into the chromosomal loci of the exocyst genes. To localize exocyst-GFP, cells from an early log phase culture grown in SC medium lacking uracil were transferred to 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then pelleted in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol at −20 °C, pelleted, and washed with acetone at −20 °C. The cells were subsequently rehydrated by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The cells were then immediately examined by microscopy. For Sec3-GFP localization in cells recovering from G0 arrest, the cells were first grown overnight in liquid culture. 0.2 ml of the culture was then spread onto YPD agar plates. After the yeast cells form a lawn (2–3 days at 25 °C), the cells were scraped from the plates and transferred into YPD liquid medium. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 1m sorbitol, 50% YPD and then spun for 1 min at 500 ×g to pellet budded cells. The supernatant containing unbudded cells was collected. These cells were examined under the microscope. If necessary, the cells were further spun to ensure that the cells were uniformly unbudded. Aliquots of the unbudded cells were transferred to YPD liquid medium and allowed to grow for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested, and Sec3-GFP localization was examined as described above. Immunofluorescence localization of Cdc42 in yeast cells was performed using affinity-purified rabbit anti-Cdc42 antibody as described previously (22Kozminski K.G. Chen A.J. Rodal A.A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Leica microscope fitted with a 100× oil immersion objective and standard filter sets. The images were acquired with a Quantix HCCD camera and OpenLab Imaging Software. Sec3p (amino acids 1–501) was fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP-Sec3p). Cdc42 with its C-terminal four amino acid lipid modification sites deleted was fused to GST. The recombinant fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates and used in the in vitro binding assay. The GST fusion proteins were first incubated with 0.05 mmGTPγS or GDP for 15 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Then 10 mm MgCl2 was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After nucleotide loading, the GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins (10 μg) or GST alone (60 μg) were incubated with the resin containing MBP-Sec3p (10 μg) or MBP (100 μg) for 2 h at room temperature in the binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins bound to the resin were detected by Western blot with anti-GST monoclonal antibody. The binding of variouscdc42 mutant proteins to MBP-Sec3p was performed the same as that described above. The cDNAs encoding these mutant proteins was obtained by PCR from mutant yeast cells. All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For monitoring polarized growth, cells from yeast strains WT (YEF473A) (32Bi E. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar),cdc24-4 (YEF313), cdc42-201 (YEF1961), andcdc42-13 (YEF1962) were grown in YPD medium exponentially at 24 °C, and cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer P (10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) at ∼5.0 × 107 cells/ml. For each time point, 0.9 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with 0.1 ml of FITC-conjugated ConA (stock concentration, 1 mg/ml in buffer P) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated in the dark for 10 min. The cells were washed with buffer P three times and resuspended in prewarmed, fresh YPD medium (33Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to allow new growth (the dark zones on the cell surface correspond to new cell wall growth) at 37 °C. The cells were collected at 0, 30, 90, and 215 min, respectively, and fixed with formaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C and an additional 30 min at 24 °C. The cells were washed with buffer P twice and resuspended in mounting medium for observation of the growth pattern. To identify proteins that regulate the polarized localization of the exocyst, we examined the localization of GFP-tagged exocyst components in mutants that are defective in different aspects of the budding process such as bud site selection, bud site establishment, cell polarization, actin organization, cell cycle regulation, and septin assembly (18Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The GFP-tagged exocyst proteins were expressed under the control of their own promoters and were fully functional because yeast cells expressing the tagged version as the sole source of the exocyst protein grew as well as wild type cells in both rich and synthetic medium and at temperatures ranging from 25 to 37 °C. We previously found that the exocyst proteins were mislocalized in severalrho1 mutants (18Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Rho1 is a member of the yeast Rho family of small GTPases. It is involved in such cellular processes as actin organization, yeast cell wall remodeling, and maintenance of polarized cell growth (17Cabib E. Drgonova J. Drgon T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 307-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another member of the Rho family of small GTPases is Cdc42. Cdc42 is important for the initial establishment of polarity and functions very early in the signaling cascade that orchestrates polarized morphogenesis (19Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 7: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that Cdc42 may also control exocyst localization. cdc42-1 is the first identified cdc42 mutant strain (36Adams A.E. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and it has been widely used in studying the function of Cdc42 and cell polarity. Surprisingly, a previous study showed that there is no mislocalization of Sec3-GFP incdc42-1 cells (8Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of Cdc42 on the exocyst, we decided to examine whether exocyst localization is dependent upon the activity of Cdc24, which is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42. Wild type and cdc24-4 mutant cells synchronized to G0phase were incubated for 3 h in YPD liquid medium at the restrictive temperature (37 °C). The localization of Sec3-GFP in the cells was then examined. As shown in Fig. 1, Sec3-GFP randomly distributed incdc24-4 mutant cells but not in the wild type cells, where it polarized to the bud tips. This result demonstrated that the initial targeting of Sec3 to correct sites in the cells is regulated by Cdc24, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42. The effect of Cdc24 on the exocyst may be a result of its role in activating Cdc42. Although cdc42-1 did not show exocyst mislocalization, this mutant strain may not be the appropriate allele for revealing the specific defect. Very recently, a number of new cdc42 mutants have been generated that revealed some previously unidentified functions of Cdc42 (22Kozminski K.G. Chen A.J. Rodal A.A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol.

We examined the localization of GFP-tagged exocyst proteins in some of the mutants. Several of the cdc42 mutants used in this study were generated as described under “Materials and Methods”; other mutants were recently characterized (22Kozminski K.G. Chen A.J. Rodal A.A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the distribution of two GFP-tagged exocyst proteins, Sec3p and Sec5p, after a shift to 37 °C for 2 h. In addition, F-actin was also examined using rhodamine-phalloidin. In wild type cells (Fig. 2, top panels), the exocyst proteins were localized to emerging bud sites, the tips of small daughter cells (“bud tip”), or mother/daughter connections (“necks”). However, incdc42-201 and cdc42-13 mutant cells, Sec3-GFP and Sec5-GFP were either dispersed throughout the cell or formed multiple punctuate spots. In some mutant cells, the GFP-tagged exocyst was concentrated in one or several areas, but not in the bud tip or mother/daughter connection. In the parent wild type strain, most of the cells scored from a single focal plane had polarized Sec3-GFP (66%) and Sec5-GFP (61%) localization (n = 100) (Table II). However, in cdc42-201, only 3 and 2% of the cells, respectively, had polarized localization of Sec3-GFP and Sec5-GFP. In cdc42-13, only 9 and 8% of the cells, respectively, demonstrated polarized localization of Sec3-GFP and Sec5-GFP. All of the mutant strains expressed levels of Sec3-GFP and Sec5-GFP similar to that of the wild type strain at 37 °C (data not shown). Sec3-GFP was partially localized in the othercdc42 mutant strains, cdc42-123 andcdc42-129. Table II summarizes the results we obtained using various mutant strains. F-actin was generally depolarized in both mutant alleles (Fig. 2).Table IISec3-GFP localization in wild type and cdc42 mutant strainsStrainOriginal strainPolarized Sec3-GFPCell morphologyDescriptions of Sec3-GFP localization%YEF473ACDC4266NormalNormal polarized localizationYEF1961cdc42–2013Misshaped cellsRandom peripheral and cytoplasmic localizationYEF1962cdc42–139Mostly unbuddedMostly random localizationDDY1300CDC4256NormalNormal polarized localizationDDY1336cdc42–12322Unbudded or small buddedPolarized in small budded cells but slightly diffuse in that regionDDY1344cdc42–12930Elongated or misshaped budsPolarized in elongated bud tips Open table in a new tab Because Cdc42 is involved in the establishment of cell polarity, by starting with a population of cells from G0 phase, one should be able to study the effect of Cdc42 on the initial targeting of Sec3p-GFP to the emerging bud tip. We therefore examined the localization of Sec3-GFP in cdc42-201 andcdc42-13 mutant cells after release from G0arrest for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Sec3-GFP was depolarized in the cdc42-201 cells at the nonpermissive temperature. Forcdc42-13, most of the cells lost polarized Sec3-GFP localization. In fact, less than 6% of the cells still had polarized localization. As a control, Sec3-GFP was well localized in the wild type cells released from G0 for 3 h. These results suggest that initial targeting of Sec3p is affected in cdc42mutant alleles. In contrast to these observations, it was found that Sec3p can be correctly targeted in actin mutant cells or in cells treated with latrunculin-A starting from the G0phase (8Finger F.P. Hughes T.E. Novick P. Cell. 1998; 92: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), indicating that the polarized localization of Sec3p can be established in an actin-independent fashion. We have also compared the localization of Sec3-GFP and Cdc42 in the yeast cells. Because of technical difficulties with the yeast cells, we were not able to observe the Cdc42 immunofluorescence and Sec3p signals (by GFP signals or immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibody) in the same cell by double labeling. However, we were able to perform the localization experiments on Cdc42 and Sec3-GFP separately and then compare their localization in the cells at similar cell cycle stages. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Cdc42 co-localizes with Sec3-GFP at the bud emerging sites or at the tips of the small buds. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that Sec3p needs Cdc42 for its initial targeting to the bud tip. The effect ofcdc42 mutants on Sec3-GFP localization could reflect either a direct interaction of Sec3p with Cdc42 or an indirect effect mediated by one of the Cdc42 effectors. To understand the molecular basis for this effect, we tested for the direct binding of Sec3p with Cdc42 with a biochemical assay using MBP-Sec3p and GST-Cdc42 fusion proteins purified from bacteria lysates. Previous domain analysis indicates that the post-coiled-coil region of Sec3p (amino acids 500–1336) is responsible for binding to another component of the exocyst complex, Sec5p. The N-terminal portion of Sec3p binds Rho1, and Sec3p lacking its N terminus diffuses inside cells (18Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We tested whether the N-terminal region of Sec3p also binds to Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 4 A, GST-Cdc42 preferentially bound to the N-terminal region of Sec3p conjugated to the resin in the presence of GTPγS. The amounts of Cdc42 bound to MBP-Sec3p resin are in average about 20% of the input levels in six independent experiments (not shown). As a negative control, we found that GST alone did not bind MBP-Sec3p under the same reaction conditions. As another negative control, MBP itself, even at levels in great excess of MBP-Sec3p, did not bind GST-Cdc42. Because Sec3p is mislocalized incdc42-201 and, to a lesser extent, in cdc42-13, we have compared their binding to MBP-Sec3p with wild type Cdc42. As shown in Fig. 4 B, comparing with GST-Cdc42 (wild type), GST-cdc42-201 had a much weaker interaction with MBP-Sec3p in the presence of either GTP or GDP. This may explain why Sec3-GFP is mislocalized in the cdc42-201 mutant allele. We have also detected a decrease in GST-cdc42-13 binding to MBP-Sec3p. However, the decrease in binding was not as dramatic as that seen with the GST-cdc42-201 mutant. Sec3-GFP was mislocalized incdc42-13, although the localization defect was less severe than that of cdc42-201 (Table II). Finally, we did not detect any change in cdc42-1 mutant binding (Fig. 4 B). Overall, the binding properties seem to correlate with the exocyst localization in these cdc42 mutants. It is possible that the defects in binding account for the Sec3 mislocalization defects in some cdc42 mutants. However, we do not exclude the possibility that additional mechanisms are involved in mislocalization of Sec3-GFP in these mutant cells. Because the Rho1 binding region is also localized to the N terminus of Sec3p (18Guo W. Tamanoi F. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), we tested whether Cdc42 competes with Rho1 binding to MBP-Sec3p. The Rho1 and Cdc42 fusion proteins were first loaded with GTPγS. Then various amounts of Cdc42 were added to the Rho1-Sec3p binding reaction as described above. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the Cdc42 recombinant protein competed with Rho1 in binding Sec3p. Because Cdc42 interacts with Sec3p and controls the localization of the exocyst, the essential secretory vesicle targeting and docking machine, we speculated that Cdc42 might spatially regulate exocytosis in cells. We therefore examined the exocytosis pattern in the wild type and cdc42 mutant cells by monitoring cell wall glycoproteins using the lectin ConA. The cell wall was prelabeled with FITC-conjugated ConA and then thoroughly washed. As cells grow, newly synthesized cell wall glycoproteins are incorporated into the cell surface through exocytosis, displacing previous FITC-ConA-labeled glycoproteins on the cell surface. The spatial distribution of exocytosis thus can be identified by monitoring the development of nonfluorescent regions (“dark zones”). As shown in"
https://openalex.org/W2084158547,"The stalling of DNA replication forks that occurs as a consequence of encountering DNA damage is a critical problem for cells. RecG protein is involved in the processing of stalled replication forks, and acts by reversing the fork past the damage to create a four-way junction that allows template switching and lesion bypass. We have determined the crystal structure of RecG bound to a DNA substrate that mimics a stalled replication fork. The structure not only reveals the elegant mechanism used by the protein to recognize junctions but has also trapped the protein in the initial stage of fork reversal. We propose a mechanism for how forks are processed by RecG to facilitate replication fork restart.

This study examines Zn2+-initiated mitochondrial cell death signaling. 10 nm Zn2+ induced acute swelling of isolated mitochondria, which was much greater than that induced by higher Ca2+ levels. Zn2+ entry into mitochondria was dependent upon the Ca2+ uniporter, and the consequent swelling resulted from opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.

Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar). Although many studies have focused on the role of Ca2+ in excitotoxic injury, recent studies have highlighted likely roles of another divalent cation, Zn2+, which is sequestered in synaptic vesicles of many excitatory forebrain neurons (2Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1471S-1483SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of intense presynaptic activity, as occurs in epilepsy and ischemia, Zn2+ is released along with glutamate into the synaptic space, where it may achieve peak levels of 100–300 μm (2Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1471S-1483SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Observations that Zn2+accumulates in injured postsynaptic neurons and that extracellular Zn2+ chelators decrease both Zn2+ accumulation and the resultant neurodegeneration support the hypothesis that transsynaptic movement of Zn2+ (“Zn2+translocation”) contributes to neuronal injury under these conditions (2Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1471S-1483SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in simplified systems have provided clues to mechanisms through which Zn2+ injures neurons. Upon glutamate receptor activation, it can gain entry into neurons largely through the same routes as Ca2+, although with a distinct rank order of permeability: Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate channels > voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels ≫ NMDA1 channels (3Sensi S.L. Yin H.Z. Carriedo S.G. Rao S.S. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2414-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). With particularly rapid entry through highly Zn2+- and Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate channels, resulting in micromolar Zn2+i rises, microfluorometric studies have demonstrated abrupt dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and generation of reactive oxygen species (3Sensi S.L. Yin H.Z. Carriedo S.G. Rao S.S. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2414-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with findings that with micromolar exposures, Zn2+ is taken up into, inhibits respiration of, and induces opening of a nonspecific large conductance channel, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), in isolated non-neural mitochondria (4Brierley G.P. Knight V.A. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 3892-3901Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Skulachev V.P. Chistyakov V.V. Jasaitis A.A. Smirnova E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although studies of neurotoxicity caused by less intense Zn2+ exposures have not explicitly implicated mitochondria, they have reported effects, including reactive oxygen species generation and reduction of ATP levels (7Manev H. Kharlamov E. Uz T. Mason R.P. Cagnoli C.M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Kim E.Y. Koh J.Y. Kim Y.H. Sohn S. Joe E. Gwag B.J. Eur. J.

Also, although observations of DNA fragmentation or attenuation of injury by caspase or protein synthesis inhibitors suggest activation of apoptotic processes, other studies showing swelling of intracellular organelles and demonstrating protection by antioxidants favor necrotic injury mechanisms (7Manev H. Kharlamov E. Uz T. Mason R.P. Cagnoli C.M. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Kim Y.H. Kim E.Y. Gwag B.J. Sohn S. Koh J.Y.

An emerging body of evidence supports a central role for mitochondria in mediating both necrotic and apoptotic forms of cell death. Indeed, although acute mitochondrial disruption initiated by Ca2+overload is generally associated with necrotic cell death, under certain conditions, mitochondria release peptide mediators of apoptotic cell death pathways, including cytochrome c(Cyt-c), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and Smac/DIABLO (12Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 13Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The nature of the release mechanism(s) is at present highly debated, but the release is modulated by members of the Bcl-2 protein family and can occur following mPTP opening (12Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 13Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem.

Based on the lines of evidence outlined above, we hypothesize that as with Ca2+, the toxic effects of Zn2+ are substantially mediated through effects on mitochondria. To test this idea, we have compared the abilities of Zn2+ and Ca2+ to trigger mitochondrial swelling (both in isolated brain mitochondria and in intact neurons) via opening of the mPTP and their efficacies in inducing release of the apoptotic mediators Cyt-c and AIF. Bongkrekic acid was purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cyclosporin A, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX), and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma. MitoTracker Green was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Tissue culture media and serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from common commercial sources. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the isolated mitochondrial experiments. Murine cortical cultures were prepared from embryonic Swiss-Webster mice. Prior to death, all animals were housed individually on a 12-h light/dark cycle with access to water and food ad libitum. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Isolated mitochondria were prepared largely as described, and swelling was assessed under both energized and de-energized conditions as the decrease in absorbance (light scattering) (15Sullivan P.G. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. Scheff S.W. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μg of mitochondria was suspended in 1 ml of respiration buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mminorganic phosphates, pH 7.2) plus 5 mm glutamate and succinate (energized conditions) or isotonic buffer (150 mmKCl, 20 mm MOPS, 10 mm Tris, 1 μmrotenone, 1 μm antimycin, and 2 μmionomycin (to ensure complete equilibration of Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions across the mitochondrial membrane), pH 7.2) (de-energized conditions). After a 5-min preincubation at 36 °C and base-line measurement, CaCl2 (50 nmol/mg of protein for energized conditions or 50 μm for de-energized conditions) and/or ZnSO4 (10 and 100 nm) was added to the cuvette in equal volumes (10 μl) at t = 30 s (10 μl of H2O was used as a control). Alamethicin (40 μg/ml) was added at the end of all experiments to induce maximal swelling. When used, bongkrekic acid (5 μm) or ruthenium red (20 μm) was added prior to the 5-min preincubation and was present throughout the experiment. The swelling rate was measured as the decrease in absorbance (540 nm) over 4.5 min following addition of ions. For data analysis, basal (Ca2+/Zn2+-independent) absorbance changes were subtracted, and swelling was expressed as the loss of absorbance/unit time/μg of mitochondrial protein (arbitrary units). For statistical analysis, the high and low were omitted for each group. Release of Cyt-c from isolated mitochondria into the media was measured using a Quantikine M cytochrome c enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Mitochondria (250 μg) were incubated under energized conditions exactly as described above. Exactly 4.5 min after addition of Ca2+ and/or Zn2+, the suspension was centrifuged (13,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C); protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added; and both the supernatant and pellet were processed for assays (all in duplicate) following the manufacturer's recommendations. For data analysis, basal release in the absence of Ca2+ or Zn2+ was subtracted from all groups. Dissociated mixed neocortical cultures were prepared largely as described (16Yin H.Z. Ha D.H. Carriedo S.G. Weiss J.H. Brain Res. 1998; 781: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) from 14–16-day-old embryonic Swiss-Webster mice (plated at 1–2 × 105 cells/cm2) on previously established astrocytic monolayers. Before exposures, 12–15-day-old cultures were transferred to a simplified HEPES-buffered salt solution (HSS) consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 15 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm NaOH, pH 7.4. Entry of Zn2+ and/or Ca2+ into neurons through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels was triggered by replacement of HSS with depolarizing 60 mm K+-HSS (“K buffer”; produced by equimolar substitution of KCl for NaCl) either alone (to trigger Ca2+ entry) or with 300 μmZn2+ (“K/Zn buffer”; to trigger entry of Ca2+ and Zn2+). In some experiments, rapid Ca2+ influx was induced by exposure to HSS containing 100 μm NMDA and 10 μm glycine. All exposures (except for NMDA) were in the presence of MK-801 and NBQX (both at 10 μm) to prevent influx through glutamate channels. For cell injury and immunocytochemistry experiments, exposures were for 6 min (25 °C) and were terminated by replacing the exposure solution with minimal essential medium plus glucose (25 mm) prior to returning the dishes to the 37 °C/5% CO2incubator. Immunocytochemistry was performed at various time points after the treatments, and trypan blue exclusion assays were performed 5–6 h after treatment. For confocal imaging experiments (described below), treatments were for 10 min, followed by washout into HSS, and the mitochondrial morphology was monitored as described. Cortical cultures were loaded with the mitochondrially sequestered dye MitoTracker Green FM (200 nm, 30 min, 37 °C), washed, and mounted on the stage of a confocal microscope. Images were obtained with an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope (100× objective; excitation (argon), 488 nm; emission, 516 nm) at base line and 10, 30, and 50 min following the start of brief exposures (10 min, 25 °C) as described above. At base line, mitochondria appeared as slim rod-like structures; after K/Zn buffer exposures, morphological changes were evident, with progressive rounding and increases in diameter. To quantify mitochondrial changes after these exposures, mitochondria in each imaged cell were visually assigned a “swelling index” on a 4-point scale (0, minimal change from base line; 1, evident increased swelling, but of a minority of mitochondria; 2, increased swelling, affecting most mitochondria; and 3, swelling of virtually all mitochondria). Immunocytochemistry was performed using primary antibodies to Cyt-c (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Briefly, after exposures as described above, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min; blocked for 1 h at 25 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% horse serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin; and incubated with primary antibody (diluted 1:1000 for Cyt-c and 1:250 for AIF) in blocking solution for 16 h at 4 °C. Cultures were then washed and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin prior to reaction with ABC reagent (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 1 h and with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 5 min. Control cultures processed without primary antibody exhibited no specific staining. To assess the extent of Cyt-c and AIF release, we estimated the percentage of positive cells by cell counting. For Cyt-c, only cells that showed strong homogeneous staining throughout nearly all of the cytosolic space (although generally sparing the nucleus) were considered positive. For AIF, strong homogeneous staining in the cytosol and/or the nucleus was defined as positive. For both markers, faint, punctate, or blotchy patterns of staining, seen in almost all neurons at base line, were considered negative (Fig. 3). In each experiment, positive cells were counted in 8–20 random digitally photographed 200× microscope fields from each of one to three glass-bottomed dishes for each condition, with each field usually containing 50–200 neurons. Values for each condition were calculated as the percentage of positive cells in each field, averaged over all fields counted. Because of some variability between culture preparations in basal levels of release and responsiveness to agonist exposures, significance was determined by paired t tests between each condition with paired K/Zn buffer conditions. At 5–6 h after treatments, cells were incubated for 2–5 min in a solution of 0.2% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline. In each experiment, nonviable cells (stained blue) and viable cells (colorless) were counted in 5–10 random digitally photographed 100× microscope fields from each of one to three glass-bottomed dishes for each condition, with each field usually containing between 100 and 400 neurons. As in the immunocytochemistry experiments, values were calculated as the percentage of nonviable cells, and significance was determined by paired t tests with K/Zn buffer conditions. Prior studies have demonstrated the ability of relatively high concentrations of Zn2+ (2–10 μm) to induce swelling of isolated liver mitochondria, indicative of opening of the mPTP (6Wudarczyk J. Debska G. Lenartowicz E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Accordingly, our first goal was to compare the degree of swelling of neuronal mitochondria induced by Zn2+ versusthat induced by Ca2+. In mitochondria isolated from adult rat forebrain, swelling was evidenced by rapid decreases in absorbance after exposure to the divalent cations (Fig. 1 A). Under both energized (with oxidative substrates) and de-energized (with ionomycin to ensure complete equilibration of Ca2+ and Zn2+ ions across the mitochondrial membrane) conditions, mitochondria exhibited rapid swelling upon addition of Zn2+(10 or 100 nm) (Fig. 1 A). Although addition of Ca2+ (energized conditions, 50 nmol/mg of protein, and de-energized conditions, 50 μm) induced little mitochondrial swelling under either condition, addition of Ca2+ along with Zn2+ induced greater swelling than Zn2+ alone. Higher levels of Ca2+(energized conditions, 100 nmol/mg of protein; and de-energized conditions, 100 μm ) induced rapid swelling, whereas <10 nm Zn2+ had little effect (data not shown). Inclusion of ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the Ca2+ uniporter, blocked Zn2+-induced swelling under energized conditions, suggesting that Zn2+ gains entry into mitochondria through this route. Addition of the mPTP antagonist bongkrekic acid inhibited mitochondrial swelling under all conditions, confirming that the swelling is due to opening of this high conductance channel (Fig. 1 A). A consequence of mPTP opening is the catastrophic release of mitochondrial proteins into the medium. Release of Cyt-cfrom isolated energized mitochondria was monitored under conditions identical to those described above (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of Ca2+ (50 nmol/mg of protein), only a small amount of Cyt-c was released, whereas Zn2+ (10 and 100 nm) alone or in combination with Ca2+resulted in a 3–6-fold increase in release. To assess morphology of mitochondria in intact neurons, neurons were loaded with MitoTracker Green and examined by confocal microscopy (see “Experimental Procedures”). This dye has the advantage of being largely unaffected by loss of Δψm or reactive oxygen species generation in neurons (17Buckman J.F. Hernandez H. Kress G.J. Votyakova T.V. Pal S. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 104: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Induction of Zn2+and/or Ca2+ entry into neurons was accomplished by exposure to the ions in the presence of K buffer, which depolarizes neurons and permits entry of either divalent cation through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Exposures were carried out in the presence of the glutamate blockers MK-801 and NBQX (each at 10 μm) to prevent effects of endogenously released glutamate. Neurons were imaged at base line and 10, 30, and 50 min after the start of a brief exposure (10 min) to HSS (“sham wash”), to K buffer (triggering entry of Ca2+ alone), or to K/Zn buffer (causing entry of both Ca2+ and Zn2+). At base line, mitochondria appeared as slim, strongly fluorescent, rod-like structures. After K/Zn buffer exposures, there was a remarkable change in mitochondrial morphology as evidenced by a progressive increase in mitochondrial diameter that peaked within 30–50 min of exposure onset. In contrast, little change was noted after exposures either to K buffer alone or to sham wash (Fig. 2). Over 80% of neurons imaged after K/Zn buffer exposures showed a substantial increase in mitochondrial swelling at 50 min (swelling index of 2 or 3; see “Experimental Procedures”), in contrast to <25% after exposure to K buffer alone (Fig. 2 B). The subcellular localization of Cyt-c and AIF in cortical neurons was assessed immunocytochemically after exposures either to sham wash or to induction of Zn2+ or Ca2+ entry as described above. In untreated (sham-washed) cultures, staining for both AIF and Cyt-c was light and often appeared to be localized in puncta distributed throughout the cytoplasm, consistent with the mitochondrial localization of these peptides. Following a 6-min exposure to K/Zn buffer (with MK-801 and NBQX, as described above), there was a dramatic increase in immunostaining for both Cyt-c and AIF. Increased cytoplasmic Cyt-cstaining was evident within 30 min, appearing initially as clumps of stain; and within 1 h, near-homogeneous cytoplasmic staining, usually sparing the nucleus, was evident in many neurons (Fig. 3). Increases in AIF staining were evident within 1 h of the K/Zn buffer exposures; and unlike Cyt-c, which spares the nucleus, at 3 h after the exposures, many neurons showed strong nuclear AIF accumulation (Fig. 3). Exposure to staurosporine (1 μm, 5 h), a potent inducer of neuronal apoptosis that has been reported to induce both Cyt-c and AIF release, resulted in qualitatively similar patterns of Cyt-c and AIF staining in many neurons(data not shown). For quantification of Cyt-c or AIF release, a uniform time of assessment (1 h for Cyt-c and 3 h for AIF) and criteria for positive staining (Fig. 3; see “Experimental Procedures”) were established. After K/Zn buffer exposures, 44 ± 4% of neurons (n = 12 experiments) were judged to be Cyt-c-positive and 35 ± 3% (n = 10 experiments) to be AIF-positive. In contrast, little Cyt-cor AIF labeling was evident in cultures exposed to sham wash, to 300 μm Zn2+, or to K buffer alone (Fig. 4). Rapid Ca2+ entry through NMDA channels has been reported to trigger mitochondrial Ca2+ overload with opening of the mPTP and release of Cyt-c (18White R.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Peng T.I. Jou M.J. Sheu S.S. Greenamyre J.T. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Schinder A.F.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, to induce toxic Ca2+ overload, cultures were subjected to NMDA exposure (100 μm NMDA + 10 μm glycine for 6 min), which induces substantial injury in 24 h. Although the Zn2+ exposures employed have been found to induce Δ[Zn2+]i of several hundred nanomolar (3Sensi S.L. Yin H.Z. Carriedo S.G. Rao S.S. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2414-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Canzoniero L.M. Turetsky D.M. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the NMDA exposures induce markedly higher [Ca2+]irises of >10 μm (24Hyrc K. Handran S.D. Rothman S.M. Goldberg M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6669-6677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in comparison with Zn2+ influx, the NMDA exposures induced markedly less Cyt-c release (Fig. 4 A). The mPTP antagonists cyclosporin A (CsA) and bongkrekic acid were used to examine the possibility that opening of the mPTP is involved in Zn2+-induced release of Cyt-c and AIF. CsA (10 μm) or bongkrekic acid (5 μm) was added for 30 min before, during, and after the K/Zn buffer exposures, and Cyt-c and AIF immunoreactivity was examined 1 and 3 h, respectively, after the exposures. We found CsA to attenuate release of both Cyt-c and AIF, and bongkrekic acid to attenuate release of AIF (effect on Cyt-c release not tested) (Fig. 4). Thus, these data support a role for mPTP opening in the Zn2+-dependent release of Cyt-c and AIF from mitochondria. The demonstration that Zn2+ can induce opening of the mPTP and release of the apoptotic mediators Cyt-c and AIF into the cytoplasm does not indicate that these mechanisms contribute to the resultant Zn2+-dependent neuronal death. Thus, further experiments were carried out using the mPTP blockers to test the possibility that mPTP opening does play a role in cell death resulting after the Zn2+ exposures. Cortical cultures were exposed to K/Zn buffer exactly as described above, either with or without addition of CsA (10 μm) or bongkrekic acid (5 μm) before, during, and after the exposure. After 5–6 h, cell injury was assessed by staining with trypan blue dye, which labels neurons that have lost their plasma membrane integrity. At this time point, little injury (<15%) was noted in sham wash- and K buffer-treated cultures, whereas the K/Zn buffer exposures killed a substantial minority (∼40–50%) of neurons. This injury was significantly (but incompletely) attenuated either by CsA or by bongkrekic acid (Fig. 5). Advances in recent years have established that mitochondria play a critical role in neuronal injury caused by excitotoxic Ca2+overload (25Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Mitochondria can buffer large amounts of intracellular Ca2+; and upon Ca2+ overloading, several events are set in motion that can mediate neuronal death. These include cessation of mitochondrial function (causing loss of ATP), loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity due to opening of the mPTP, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. Such acute effects are generally thought to underlie rapidly evolving necrotic forms of cell death characterized by organellar swelling and cell lysis. With less intense glutamate exposures, when energy levels may be relatively preserved, slowly evolving apoptotic cell death pathways may also be triggered (26), in large part after mitochondrial release of certain pro-apoptotic peptides, including Cyt-c, which plays a role in the activation of the apoptotic effector enzyme caspase-3, and AIF, which translocates to the nucleus and induces fragmentation of nuclear DNA (12Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that Zn2+ might initiate neuronal injury through similar mechanisms, but with greater potency than Ca2+. Indeed, in initial studies on isolated neuronal mitochondria, we found that in comparison with Ca2+, Zn2+ was remarkably potent, with 10 nm levels causing rapid swelling of both energized and de-energized mitochondria. Although these levels are much lower than levels previously reported to induce swelling of isolated liver mitochondria (6Wudarczyk J. Debska G. Lenartowicz E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), such a disparity in sensitivity might be compatible with the observation that liver cells have high [Zn2+]i (>1 μm) (27). Consistent with a previous report (28Saris N.E. Niva K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Zn2+-induced swelling of energized mitochondria appeared to depend upon uptake through the Ca2+ uniporter. Induction of swelling under de-energized conditions indicates that, provided an entry route (via ionomycin pores), the effect is independent of electron transport and Δψm. Although the specific site of Zn2+ effects on mitochondria is uncertain, the swelling appears to result from mPTP opening and is coupled to release of Cyt-c. This high Zn2+ sensitivity carried over to intact neurons, in which depolarizing exposures estimated to induce submicromolar Zn2+i rises (3Sensi S.L. Yin H.Z. Carriedo S.G. Rao S.S. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2414-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 23Canzoniero L.M. Turetsky D.M. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) caused greater mitochondrial swelling than exposures in the absence of Zn2+ that induce far higher [Ca2+]i rises (24Hyrc K. Handran S.D. Rothman S.M. Goldberg M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6669-6677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paralleling effects on swelling, the [Zn2+]i rises also caused more release of the apoptotic mediators Cyt-c and AIF. The additional observations that mPTP antagonists attenuated both release of the pro-apoptotic factors and the subsequent neuronal loss suggest that, as in the case of Ca2+ overload (12Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 13Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar), mPTP opening might contribute to both of these downstream events. There are two conspicuous differences between these effects and the present observation in isolated mitochondria. First, although they occurred at estimated intracellular levels below those needed for Ca2+to cause similar effects, they were much higher than the 10 nm levels of Zn2+ found to trigger mPTP opening in isolated mitochondria. Although further studies will be necessary to fully ascertain the basis for this apparent discrepancy in Zn2+ sensitivity, it is likely to reflect the presence of physiological Zn2+ buffers and binding sites in intact cells (29Aschner M. Cherian M.G. Klaassen C.D. Palmiter R.D. Erickson J.C. Bush A.I. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Second, the partial attenuation of pro-apoptotic factor release and injury by mPTP antagonists is in contrast to the virtual complete block of mPTP opening in isolated mitochondria. This is reminiscent of observations of Ca2+-dependent release of Cyt-c in intact neurons, where mPTP blockers have often shown poor efficacy in attenuating release. Although it is clear that mPTP opening can result in Cyt-c release, it is presently uncertain whether the incomplete block observed reflects the existence of mPTP-independent release mechanisms (30Andreyev A.Y. Fahy B. Fiskum G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or whether sufficiently strong divalent cation loading somehow overwhelms the blocking capability of the mPTP antagonists (13Bernardi P. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Forte M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 112-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar, 31Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our observations may strengthen the analogies between toxic effects induced by Zn2+ and Ca2+; both can mediate injury through effects on mitochondria, and both might trigger either acute necrotic or slower apoptotic forms of injury depending largely upon the intensity of the ionic exposure. Parallels between Zn2+- and Ca2+-dependent injury mechanisms may well extend to human diseases in which excitotoxicity is implicated. Indeed, indices of apoptotic damage, including nuclear fragmentation, Cyt-c release, and attenuation of injury by caspase inhibitors, have been reported in submaximal ischemia and glutamate exposures (32, 33). Such apoptotic signaling might be hypothesized to be of particular importance in vivo under conditions in which only a subset of mitochondria in a cell undergo permeability transition (14Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting subcellular concentrations of Ca2+ or Zn2+ adjacent to sites of postsynaptic entry. Additional recent studies have raised the possibility that in addition to translocation, under certain conditions, Zn2+ release from intracellular stores might injure neurons (34Aizenman E. Stout A.K. Hartnett K.A. Dineley K.E. McLaughlin B. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1878-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Whatever the sources, understanding ways in which cytosolic [Zn2+]i rises contribute to necrotic and/or apoptotic neuronal injury is likely to powerfully impact the development of neuroprotective interventions for these conditions.

Its unique ability to switch from yeast to hyphal growth in response to various environmental signals is inherent to its pathogenicity. Filamentation is regulated by multiple pathways including a Cph1-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, an Efg1-mediated cAMP/PKA pathway, and a Cph2 pathway. To gain a general picture of how these various signaling pathways regulate differential gene expression during filamentation, we have constructed a partial C. albicans DNA array of 7,000 genes and used it to study the gene expression profiles using various mutants and growth conditions. By combining this novel technology with a new liquid medium in which cph1/cph1 is defective in filamentation, previously identified differentially expressed genes (ECE1, HWP1, HYR1,RBT1, SAPs5–6, and RBT4) are found to be regulated by all three pathways. In addition, two novel genes,DDR48 and YPL184, have been found to be differentially regulated during hyphal development and by all three pathways. This suggests that distinct filamentation signaling pathways converge to regulate a common set of differentially expressed genes. As one of the mechanisms for the observed convergence, we find that the transcription of a key regulator, TEC1, is regulated by Efg1 and Cph2. Importantly, most of the genes regulated by multiple filamentation pathways encode known virulence factors.

However, the incidence of fatal C. albicans infections, as well as drug-resistant strains, have increased dramatically in recent years in patients undergoing chemotherapy, transplantation, and in particular, in immunocompromised patients suffering from AIDS (1Powderly W.G. Mayer K.H. Perfect J.R. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). C. albicans exhibits the ability to grow in a variety of reversible morphological forms (yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal) in response to various environmental signals (2Brown A.J. Gow N.A.

The ability of C. albicans to switch its mode of growth has been shown to be required for the pathogenicity of this fungus (3Lo H.J. Kohler J.R. DiDomenico B. Loebenberg D. Cacciapuoti A. Fink G.R.

Clearly a better understanding of the differentiation pathways which permit C. albicans to switch between the different morphological forms will reveal more about C. albicans pathogenesis. Multiple signaling pathways have been found to regulate filamentation. Cph1, a transcription factor homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste12, plays a role in hyphal development on certain solid media in C. albicans (6Liu H. Kohler J. Fink G.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As in S. cerevisiae, Cph1 in C. albicans is regulated by a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase cascade that includes Cst20, Hst7, and Cek1 (7Kohler J.R. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13223-13228Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 8Leberer E. Harcus D. Broadbent I.D. Clark K.L. Dignard D. Ziegelbauer K. Schmidt A. Gow N.A. Brown A.J. Thomas D.Y. Proc. Natl.

Mutants with homozygous deletions of the genes encoding these proteins all display a medium-specific defect in hyphal development on certain solid media. Efg1, a basic helix-loop-helix protein similar to Phd1 of S. cerevisiae and StuA of Aspergillus nidulans, plays a major role in regulating hyphal development in C. albicans(3Lo H.J. Kohler J.R.

Ernst J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1982-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Efg1 acts downstream of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway (11Sonneborn A. Bockmuhl D.P. Gerads M.

The Efg1-mediated cAMP pathway is thought to be distinct from the Cph1-mediated MAP kinase pathway, because thecph1/cph1 efg1/efg1 double mutant has a greater defect in hyphal development and virulence than either single mutant (3Lo H.J. Kohler J.R. DiDomenico B. Loebenberg D. Cacciapuoti A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Cph1 and Efg1 are the first identified regulators of hyphal development. Recently, a new member of the TEA/ATTS family of transcription factors, Tec1, has been shown to regulate hyphal development and virulence in C. albicans (13Schweizer A. Rupp S. Taylor B.N. Rollinghoff M. Schroppel K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). More recently, Cph2, a basic helix loop helix protein of the Myc subfamily, is found to regulate hyphal development in a medium-specific manner (34Lane S. Zhou S. Pan T. Dai Q. Liu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6418-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Its activity is mediated, in part, through regulatingTEC1 transcriptional induction. Condition-specific hyphal regulators such as Czf1 and Rim101/Prr2 have also been identified in C. albicans (14Brown Jr., D.H. Giusani A.D. Chen X. Kumamoto C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15El Barkani A. Kurzai O. Fonzi W.A. Ramon A. Porta A. Frosch M. Muhlschlegel F.A. Mol. Cell.

Tup1, a global transcriptional co-repressor, is required to maintain the organism in yeast form, as the disruption ofTUP1 causes the organism to filament under conditions that normally induce it to grow as yeast (19Braun B.R.

Many of them encode either cell wall or secreted proteins and some have been shown to be important virulence factors for systemic infection. HWP1 encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified cell wall protein that can serve as a target for mammalian transglutaminases to form covalent attachments between C. albicans and host epithelial cells (30Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P. Science. 1999; 283: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rbt1 and Rbt4, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified cell wall protein and a secreted protein similar to plant pathogenesis-related protein (PRY-1), are also necessary for the full virulence of C. albicans in a systemic mouse model. Als3 and Als8 belong to a family of cell wall agglutinin-like proteins, some of which are involved in adhesion to host cells (28Hoyer L.L. Payne T.L. Bell M. Myers A.M. Scherer S. Curr.

In addition, three members of the secreted aspartyl proteinase genes, SAPs 4–6, are differentially transcribed when hyphal development is induced with serum or media containing polypeptides as the sole nitrogen source (31Hube B. Monod M. Schofield D.A. Brown A.J. Gow N.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).

Tup1-Nfg1 and Tup1-Nrg1 also regulate the repression and full induction of these genes (20Kadosh D. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell.

In addition, the expression of SAPs 4–6 also require Efg1 (35Schroppel K. Sprosser K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Rollinghoff M. Csank C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7159-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), Cph2 (34Lane S. Zhou S. Pan T. Dai Q. Liu H. Mol. Cell.

Microbiol. 2000; 38: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, filamentation signaling pathways not only regulate hyphal morphogenesis but also the expression of virulence genes. While several differentially expressed genes have been identified by screening libraries by differential hybridization, this type of approach is limited to comparing a single growth condition or strain per experimental set. The recently established DNA array technology, on the other hand, allows a more efficient analysis of gemone-wide gene expression in multiple growth conditions and strains. Here, we report the construction of a partial C. albicans DNA array and its application in studying differential gene expression during the yeast-to-hyphal transition in wild type and mutants of different signaling pathways. Our studies have identified two novel, differentially expressed genes. It also indicates that multiple filamentation signaling pathways converge to regulate the expression of a common set of differentially expressed genes. Potential mechanisms of convergence are discussed. As many of the target genes have been shown to be required for C. albicans virulence, these studies are vital to understanding much about the components and mechanism of fungal pathogenesis. S. cerevisiaemedia were used for routine culturing of C. albicans, except that uridine, instead of uracil, was used for growing Ura−C. albicans strains. Several hyphal inducing media were used: Lee's medium (36Miller K.Y. Wu J. Miller B.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1770-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with 1% mannitol as the carbon source, YPD + 10% serum, SS (synthetic succinate) medium (0.0425% YNB without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco), 0.125% ammonium sulfate, 2% succinic acid, pH 6.5), and SSA (SS with amino acids) medium. A modified lithium acetate method was used for C. albicanstransformation (34Lane S. Zhou S. Pan T. Dai Q. Liu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6418-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Strains HLY3223 were obtained by transforming an ura− strain of HLC52 with the PCK1p-TEC1plasmid BP2-TEC1 (34Lane S. Zhou S. Pan T. Dai Q. Liu H. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 90: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The primer information was collated in a Candida Primer Pairs Data base using the Filemaker Pro software program and sequence information exported directly to the Stanford PAN Facility for the synthesis of primers in a 96-well format (20 nmol scale). 1 μg of C. albicans SC5314 genomic DNA was used for each 100-μl PCR reaction with 2.5 units of Biolase (ISC) in 96-well PCR plates (Greiner). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94.5 °C for 3 min, 8 cycles of 94.6 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles of 94.5 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s. An aliquot of each PCR reaction was run on a Visigel Separation Matrix (Stratagene) to determine the yield of the PCR reaction and to confirm that the product was of the expected size. Approximately 70% of the PCR reactions (from a total of 1,000 primer pairs) were successful on the first attempted amplification. As the C. albicans genome is estimated to contain 7,000 open reading frames (ORFs), the PCR products represent roughly 10% of these ORFs. Without additional purification, 20 μl of each PCR product was transferred to 384-well plates and directly gridded onto a positively charged nylon membrane in triplicate (Fig.1), using a BioMek 2000 robotic gridding machine. The gridding of each filter was repeated for a total of three to five overprints, and the membranes were subsequently fixed by UV cross-linking. In addition to the randomly selected ORFs, several controls were also included on the membrane. The previously reported differentially expressed genes, such as ECE1, HWP1, and HYR1,were included to serve as positive controls. As shown in Fig. 1, many of these are shown to be up-regulated in hyphal versus yeast form, a positive indication of the success of the array. C. albicans genomic DNA was also spotted at multiple locations throughout each filter to control for the evenness of hybridization across the filter. Furthermore, pBluescript DNA was included to control for nonspecific hybridization. Finally, a series of PCR products that spanned TDH3 and TEF1 (two relatively long, highly expressed C. albicans genes) from the 5′ to 3′ end were included to control for transcriptase processivity. Two sets of array filters were constructed during the course of this study. Differences in the intensity of hybridization for some genes were observed between filters A and B. This was likely due to a difference in the concentration of the PCR reactions used for gridding. Some PCR products were re-made for filter set A and the PCR reactions of several positive controls were diluted in the set A. The array filters were pretreated, prehybridized, hybridized, and washed using the protocol for the Yeast Index GENEFILTERS Microarrays (Research Genetics). They were probed with 33P-labeled cDNA reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) from 1 μg of total RNA extracted using a hot acidic phenol method (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 13.12) from differentC. albicans morphological forms. The arrays were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) (Fig. 1). Each filter could be stripped in boiling 0.5% SDS (Research Genetics) and re-probed up to 7 times without a significant loss of signal. As shown in Table II, filter A1 was hybridized, sequentially, with wild type,cph1/cph1,cph2/cph2, andefg1/efg1 strains that were grown in YPD at 25 °C. Similarly, filter A2 was probed in succession with the above four strains grown in Lee's medium at 25 °C. Likewise, filter A3 was probed with cells from YPD + Ser at 37 °C, and filter A4 with cells in Lee's medium at 37 °C. Additional hybridizations were performed on filters A2 and A4 with thecph1/cph1 andcph1/cph1+PCK1p-CPH1strains grown in SS medium at 25 and 37 °C, respectively. Filters B5 and B6 were sequentially hybridized with the wild type strain in yeast, hyphal, and the cph1/cph1 efg1/efg1 strain in hyphal growth media (TableII). The same filter was used for each set of compared experiments to avoid any variations among filters.Table IIArray experimentsA1A2A3A4YPD 25 °CLee's 25 °CSer 37 °CLee's 37 °CWild typeA1-4A2-4A3-4A4-4Cph1/cph1A1-2A2-2A3-2A4-2Cph2/cph2A1-3A2-3A3-3A4-3Efg1/efg1A1-6A2-5A3-5A4-5SS 25 °CSS 37 °Ccph1/cph1A2-6A4-6cph1 + PCK1p-CPH1A2-7A4-7B5B6Wild type YPD 25 °CB5-1 Wild type Lee's 25 °CB6-1Wild type Ser 37 °CB5-2Wild type Lee's 37 °CB6-2cph1efg1 Ser 37 °CB5-4 cph1efg1Lee's 37 °CB6-4Experiments used for clustering analysis are listed.

Open table in a new tab Experiments used for clustering analysis are listed. Two sets of filters were gridded, A and B, of which each of the filters is numbered. The subsequent value indicates the hybridization number for the filter. The images from the PhosphorImager for each array experiment were analyzed for initial data quantification using ArrayVision software (Imaging Research, Inc.). The background subtracted intensity of each spot on the array was calculated by taking the average intensity of the area surrounding each group of 9 spots and subtracting it from the intensity value of each spot within the group. The data were subsequently exported to Excel where the values for each of the three spots corresponding to a particular gene were averaged and divided by the sum of the values for every gene spotted on the array (not including controls) to get an average % intensity value for each gene. Lowly expressed genes, with an average % intensity value less than or close to that of pBluescript in all hybridizations, were eliminated from further data analysis. Many of the controls were also removed (Genomic DNA, TDH3, TEF1, rDNA, pBluescript). The ratio value using the average % intensity values for each gene from a pair of hybridizations was calculated. As a further measure, we visually checked the array images to eliminate false positives caused by a flaw on the array filters. The remaining gene ratio values from 16 pairs of comparisons were used for the clustering analysis (using software available at rana.stanford.edu). The results were viewed using the TreeView program. Several genes were clustered with the positive controls of differentially regulated genes, but were found to be false positives by Northern analyses (data not shown). These false positive genes usually appeared in only one batch of the arrays (either A or B), and were all in close proximity to the highly expressed control genes in a 384-well plate, and were removed from the final data set. The remaining 637 genes were used in the clustering analysis (Fig. 2). Methods for RNA isolation and Northern blot hybridization were as described (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 13.12). A ClaI-SalI ACT1fragment from the plasmid p1595/3 (37Delbruck S. Ernst J.F. Mol.

PCR products ofECE1, HWP1, HYR1,SAPs4-6, ALS3, RBT4,EBP1, WH11, ECE99, TEC1,DDR48, and YPL184 were used for probing Northern blots. The oligos used for PCR are listed in TableIII.

https://openalex.org/W1965257507,"The mechanism by which peptide release factor RF3 recycles RF1 and RF2 has been clarified and incorporated in a complete scheme for translation termination. Free RF3 is in vivo stably bound to GDP, and ribosomes in complex with RF1 or RF2 act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF). Hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA by RF1 or RF2 allows GTP binding to RF3 on the ribosome. This induces an RF3 conformation with high affinity for ribosomes and leads to rapid dissociation of RF1 or RF2. Dissociation of RF3 from the ribosome requires GTP hydrolysis. Our data suggest that RF3 and its eukaryotic counterpart, eRF3, have mechanistic principles in common."
https://openalex.org/W1972012172,"We have previously reported that the Jak2 tyrosine kinase but not Jak1 is tyrosine phosphorylated in the absence of IL-3 in Bcr-Abl positive M3.16 cells, which are rendered IL-3 independent by BCR-ABL gene expression. We have explored the involvement of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation in Bcr-Abl oncogenic effects. Our results indicate that Jak2 became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a number of cell lines expressing Bcr-Abl, when maintained in medium lacking IL-3, whereas Bcr-Abl negative cells lacked Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Jak2 was poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing the SH2 deletion mutant of Bcr-Abl compared to either wild-type Bcr-Abl or its SH3 deletion mutant. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 by Bcr-Abl was inhibited by the Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI 571, in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase by the drug did not interfere with the ability of Jak2 and Bcr-Abl to form a complex. Studies with deletion mutants of Bcr-Abl indicated that the C-terminal domain of Abl within Bcr-Abl was involved in complex formation with Jak2. Similarly, GST-Abl pull-down assays confirmed the strong binding to Jak2 by the C-terminus of Abl. Jak2 peptide substrate studies indicated that the Bcr-Abl and Abl tyrosine kinases specifically phosphorylated Y1007 of Jak2 but only poorly phosphorylated Y1008. Phosphorylation of Y1007 of Jak2 is known to be critical for its tyrosine kinase activation. Tyrosine residue 1007 of Jak2 was phosphorylated in 32Dp210 cells as measured by Western blotting with a phosphotyrosine 1007 sequence-specific antibody. A kinase-inactive Jak2 mutant blocked the colony forming ability of K562 cells. Tumor formation of K562 cells in nude mice was similarly inhibited by this kinase-inactive Jak2 mutant. This inhibition was independent of Stat5 tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 was detected in blood cells from CML patients in blast crisis but not in a normal marrow sample. In summary, these findings provide strong evidence that the Jak2 tyrosine kinase is a critical factor in Bcr-Abl malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2049734794,"The N-terminal regions of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha-N) and beta (ER beta-N) were expressed and purified to homogeneity. Using NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we conclude that both ER alpha-N and ER beta-N are unstructured in solution. The TATA box-binding protein (TBP) has been shown previously to interact with ER alpha-N in vitro and to potentiate ER-activated transcription. We used surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy to confirm and further characterize the ER-N-TBP interaction. Our results show that the intrinsically unstructured ER alpha-N interacts with TBP, and suggest that structural changes are induced in ER alpha-N upon TBP interaction. Conformational changes upon target factor interaction have not previously been demonstrated for any N-terminal region of nuclear receptors. In addition, no binding of ER beta-N to TBP was detected. This difference in TBP binding could imply differential recruitment of target proteins by ER alpha-N and ER beta-N. The affinity of the ER alpha-N-TBP interaction was determined to be in the micromolar range (K(D) = 10(-6) to 10(-5) m). Our results support models of TBP as a target protein for the N-terminal activation domain of ER alpha. Further, our results suggest that target proteins can induce and/or stabilize ordered structure in N-terminal regions of nuclear receptors upon interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1980674137,"The small GTP-binding protein Rac is a downstream effector of the oncogene product p21-ras. Rac is involved in actin polymerization, Jun kinase activation, and intracellular superoxide anion production, through distinct pathways in tumor cells. Here we investigated the role of activated Rac in the response of tumor cells to apoptosis triggered by anti-cancer drugs or the cell surface death receptor CD95. Using M14 melanoma cells stably transfected with a constitutively active form of Rac1, we show that activated Rac inhibits tumor cell response to apoptosis. The inhibitory effect of activated Rac on apoptotic signaling is mediated by the interaction of Rac with intracellular oxidase and the subsequent production of superoxide, which is supported by experiments performed with M14 and NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with the loss-of-function mutants of Rac in an activated RacV12 background. Consistent with these findings, we also demonstrate that inhibition of the Rac pathway in the HaRas-expressing T24 bladder carcinoma cell line induces a decrease in superoxide anion concentration, and results in a significant increase in tumor cell sensitivity to apoptosis. These findings demonstrate the existence of a novel Rac-dependent survival pathway mediated by intracellular superoxide in tumor cells."

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4265-4268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Both DNA polymerases δ and ε can elongate primers synthesized by DNA polymerase α and appear to have overlapping or complementary functions (5Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Although DNA polymerase δ alone can replicate both leading and lagging strands in vitro (5Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), mounting evidence suggests that DNA polymerase ε may be implicated in DNA replication in ways that may not necessarily involve its DNA polymerase activity (6Morrison A.

We have been interested in how DNA polymerase δ interacts with other factors to accomplish replication of the mammalian genome. Extensive research over a number of years has shown that DNA polymerase δ requires interactions with at least two factors, a toroidal-shaped homotrimeric protein known as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)1 and a heteropentameric complex termed replication factor C. In the presence of ATP, replication factor C interacts with the 3′ primer-template terminus and recruits PCNA onto the DNA, creating a mobile platform that tethers DNA polymerase δ to the primer terminus. Once bound to PCNA, DNA polymerase δ acquires new dynamic properties, including high processivity, low nonproductive binding to single-stranded DNA, and propinquity to factors engaged in ancillary activities at the replication fork (5Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Replication complex formation involving PCNA, DNA polymerase δ, and replication factor C is inhibited by p21Cip1 (11Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Goubin F. Ducommun B. Hübscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8869-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar), a Cdk inhibitor whose increased synthesis following DNA damage results in mitotic arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (13Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar, 14Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5248) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effect of p21Cip1 on nucleotide excision repair, which requires PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase δ, remains controversial (15Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 16Shivji M.K. Ferrari E. Ball K. Hübscher U. Wood R.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of p21Cip1 contains the canonical PCNA-binding domain (17Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). A peptide containing this domain inhibits DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase δ in vitro (17–19). Crystallographic studies have shown that the peptide interacts with the domain-interconnecting loop of PCNA, a region that has also been shown to mediate DNA polymerase δ binding to PCNA (20Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that p21Cip1 inhibition of DNA polymerase δ involves competition between their respective PCNA-binding domains for binding to PCNA. However, despite the fundamental importance of this interaction, the identity of the subunit of mammalian DNA polymerase δ that mediates PCNA binding remains controversial. All three DNA polymerases mentioned have complicated subunit compositions consisting of a large catalytic subunit and smaller subunits whose functions in many cases remain to be elucidated. DNA polymerase δ from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombeconsists of at least four subunits: Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1 (21Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Cdc27 subunit was recognized early on to contain a C-terminal sequence motif that shares significant homology with the consensus PCNA-binding motif found in a variety of PCNA-binding proteins such as p21Cip1, Fen1, 5′ cytosine methyltransferase, and DNA ligase I (22Hughes D.A. MacNeill S.A. Fantes P.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 23: 401-410Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Since then, the region has been shown to interact directly with PCNA and to be essential for cell viability, indicating that Cdc27 plays an essential function by bridging the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ to PCNA (23Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. MacNeill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Likewise, purified DNA polymerase δ complexes from S. cerevisiae contain three subunits (24Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), one of which, Pol32, has been shown to be the functional homologue of Cdc27 (25Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In mammals, however, DNA polymerase δ has up until recently been consistently purified as a heterodimeric complex of only two subunits (26Lee M.Y. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a catalytic subunit of 125 kDa and a small subunit of 48–50 kDa that display homology respectively to Pol3 and Cdc1 of S. pombe. PCNA stimulation of the two-subunit complex and the absence of a visible Cdc27 homologue led to the identification of binding sites for PCNA on the large subunit of human DNA polymerase δ (27Zhang P. Mo J.Y Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26647-26653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, none of these binding sites display significant homology to the canonical PCNA-binding site found in other PCNA-binding proteins such as p21Cip1, although one of the sites resembles the novel PCNA-binding site recently identified by screening a random peptide library for PCNA-binding proteins (28Xu H. Zhang P. Liu L. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4512-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The necessity of the small 48–50-kDa subunit for the reconstitution of active two-subunit DNA polymerase δ led to the alternative suggestion that the PCNA-binding site was located on the small subunit or was formed at the interface between both subunits (29Zhou J.Q. He H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, new purification procedures for DNA polymerase δ from mouse (30Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), calf thymus (31Mo J. Liu L. Leon A. Mazloum N. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and human cells (32Shikata K. Ohta S. Yamada K. Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T.J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) yielded a novel subunit of 66–68 kDa, termed p66 or subunit C according to the newly proposed nomenclature for DNA polymerase δ subunits (34MacNeill S.A. Baldacci G. Burgers P.M. Hübscher U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 16-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we present results that strongly suggest that this subunit mediates PCNA binding to DNA polymerase δ and corresponds to the subunit whose interaction with PCNA is targeted by p21Cip1. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and dithiothreitol (DTT) were from ICN Biomedicals Inc. Antibiotics were from Eurobio. ELISA plates (Maxisorb) were from Nalgen-Nunc International. Restriction enzymes and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fraction V) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tablets (pH 7.2) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Where indicated, protease inhibitors (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) were added at the following concentrations: 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Streptavidin was from Promega. Streptavidin-agarose beads were from Sigma-Aldrich. Nitrocellulose membranes (BioTrace NT 0.45 μ) were from Gelman Sciences. Ni-NTA agarose was from Qiagen. The synthetic peptides had the following sequences: N-terminal biotinated p66 peptide, Btn-KGTAALGKANRQVSITGFFQRK; p21Cip1 peptide, GRKRRQTSMTDFYHSKRRLIFS; and mutated p21Cip1peptide, GRKRRQTSATDFYHSKRRLIFSKRKP. The methionine to alanine substitution in the mutated peptide is indicated in bold type. All peptides were greater than 95% pure and were obtained from SigmaGenosys. Cyclin-Cdk complexes were a kind gift of Dr. Heinz-Peter Nasheuer. Buffer PBS-T contained PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, and buffer PBS-TM was buffer PBS-T plus 5% skimmed milk. Mouse DNA polymerase δ complex was purified as described previously (30Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-p66 antibody was prepared by Q-BIOgene using recombinant p66 protein expressed in Escherichia coli. One hybridoma clone (2C11) was selected for its ability to recognize p66 on Western blots and immunoprecipitate p66 from mouse cell extracts. Rabbit anti-serum directed against recombinant p50 (I4 527) was kindly provided by Dr. Antero So. Unless indicted otherwise, the antibodies were diluted as follows for Western blot analyses: goat anti-p125 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000; rabbit anti-p50 antibody at 1:1,000; rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:1000; and mouse anti-phosphothreonine antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at 1:1000. His-tagged PCNA protein was purified as described previously (35Tratner I. Piard K. Grenon M. Perderiset M. Baldacci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) except that proteins eluted from the Ni-NTA column were dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and charged onto a 1-ml Hi-Trap ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCNA was eluted at about 0.4 m NaCl after applying a gradient of 0.1m NaCl to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer to the column at 4 °C. Biotination of PCNA and recombinant human RP-A (replication protein A) was achieved by using the biotin labeling kit of Roche Molecular Biochemicals according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding sequence of human-p66 was cloned into pET19b as described previously (30Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the recombinant plasmid was transferred into E. coli BLR DE3. Transformed cells were incubated at 37 °C with continual shaking in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 mm glucose. When the cells reached anA600 of about 0.3, the cells were resuspended in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The culture was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mmNa2HPO4, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors. After 20 min on ice, the suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 19,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A, pH 8.0 (100 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). The resuspension was agitated gently overnight at 4 °C. After another sonication, the extract was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B (100 mmNa2HPO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6m guanidine HCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors), and the suspension was shaken at 4 °C for at least 6 h. After centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant containing p66 was collected. Renaturation of p66 was achieved by diluting the p66 suspension dropwise into a 100-fold excess of renaturation buffer with continual stirring (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mmammonium sulfate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmDTT, and 10% glycerol). The protein was further purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography. The column (500 μl) was equilibrated with 5 ml of renaturation buffer and charged three times with 500 μg of renaturated p66 protein. After washing the column with 5 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5), six fractions of 250 μl were collected from the column with column buffer containing 450 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors. pBluescript SK+ containing the full-length KIAA0039 cDNA was digested with NcoI and ApaI, which liberated a fragment of 1324 base pairs whose sequence started just upstream of the first ATG codon of the p66 gene and stopped 80 base pairs before the stop codon. The truncation resulted in the loss of the last 22 amino acids from the C terminus of p66, which comprises the putative PCNA-binding domain. The fragment was subjected to the 3′-5′ exonuclease and DNA polymerase activities of T4 DNA polymerase, resulting in a blunt-ended fragment. The fragment was then inserted by blunt end ligation into the blunt-ended XhoI site of pET19b, which placed it downstream of the T7 lac promoter and in frame with the His tag coding region. The synthesis of products longer than that encoded by the inserted fragment is prevented in this construct by the presence of a stop codon in each open reading frame on the 3′ side of the insertion. E. coli BLR DE3 was transformed with the recombinant plasmid by electroporation, and the truncated protein was expressed and purified as described for full-length p66 protein. The open reading frames of the three subunits of human DNA polymerase δ (GenBankTM) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from 50 ng of HeLa cDNA using the Klenow polymerase mix (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the following primer sets designed from sequences deposited in GenBankTM: p125, 5′-GGGATGGATGGCAAGCGGCGGCCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCATGGGATGCTTGCAAGGTCACCAGG-3; p66, 5′-ACCATGGCGGACCAGCTTTATCTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGTCTCTGATCTACCAGAGATGG-3; and p50, 5′-GCCATGTTTTCTGAGCAGGCTGCCC-3′ and 5′-CAGCCTCCATCTGGGCCTCTC- TGGTC-3′. The cycling parameters were: 94 °C for 60 s; 36 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, and 67 °C for 3–5 min; and finally 10 min at 67 °C. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pCR2.1 topo (Invitrogen), the sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing, excised by EcoRI digestion, and subcloned intoEcoRI sites of the baculovirus transfer vectors pVL1393 or pAcHLT-A (Pharmingen) for production of untagged or histidine-tagged recombinant products, respectively. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by co-transfecting the appropriate baculovirus transfer vector containing the desired gene and Bsu36I linearized Bakpak6 baculovirus DNA into insect Sf9 cells. The Sf9 cell line was maintained as a monolayer culture at 28 °C in TC-100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.37 g/liter α-ketoglutaric acid, 0.4 g/liter β-d-fructose, 0.055 g/liter fumaric acid, 0.67 g/liter malic acid, 0.06 g/liter succinic acid, 2.7 g/liter sucrose, 0.2 g/liter choline chloride, 0.2 g/liter β-alanine, 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, 3.33 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 0.1 g/liter streptomycin, 0.25 mg/liter amphotericin B, and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was buffered to pH 6.2 using NaOH. The cells were split every 4 days to maintain a density of 105 cells/ml. Recombinant baculoviruses (RBVs) were amplified to 108plaque-forming units/ml and used for protein expression. Sf9 cells in exponential phase were layered at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and infected simultaneously with different RBVs. For a 175-cm2 cell culture, dish cells were infected using 3 ml of RBV-p125, 2 ml of RBV-p66, and/or 1 ml of RBV-p50. After 2 days of incubation at 28 °C, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 volumes of hypotonic buffer (25 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 5 mm KCl, and 1.5 mmMgCl2) and immediately centrifuged at 800 ×g for 3 min. The cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer containing protease inhibitors. The suspension was left on ice for 10 min and lysed with 16 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After incubating on ice again for 20 min, the ionic strength was adjusted to 0.4 m NaCl followed by constant mixing for 30 min. The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min). The supernatant was adjusted to 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.7, and applied to a Ni-NTA column (1 ml for 10 175-cm2 cell culture dishes) equilibrated beforehand in buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.7, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.7, and 10% glycerol). After washing with 20 volumes of buffer A, the column was equilibrated with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 75 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted using buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.7. Incubations were done at room temperature, and the wells were washed three times between each incubation step with PBS-T unless otherwise indicated. To measure p66 binding to PCNA, a 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 1 μg of streptavidin in 50 μl of PBS/well for 1 h. The wells were then saturated by incubating them with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Various concentrations of biotinated PCNA or biotinated, recombinant human RP-A were added to 50 ng of p66 in 50 μl of PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl, and the mixtures were incubated in the streptavidin-coated wells for 1 h. After washing, mouse monoclonal antibody against p66 diluted 100-fold in PBS-TM was then added to the wells and incubated for 1 h followed by goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted 2000-fold in PBS-TM for 1 h. After three final washes in PBS-T, the interactions were revealed by adding to each well 100 μl of 0.4 mg/ml ofo-phenylenediamine in a buffer containing 0.012% hydrogen peroxide, 0.1 m citric acid, and 0.1 mNa2HPO4, pH 5.0. The reaction was stopped with 0.1 m H2SO4, and the intensity of the yellow color was measured at A450. The values were used as a measure of the interaction between both proteins after correcting for the background values of PCNA- or RP-A-uncoated wells. To demonstrate p21Cip1 inhibition of the binding of the C-terminal domain of p66 to PCNA, the wells were coated with a streptavidin-biotinated p66 peptide complex by adding 50 μl of 20 μg/ml streptavidin plus 100 ng of biotinated p66 peptide in PBS to each well for 1 h. After rinsing the wells once with PBS, the remaining binding capacity of the wells was saturated by filling them with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. PCNA (30 ng in 50 μl of PBS, 150 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) along with various concentrations of p21 peptide or mutated p21 peptide, were then added to the wells and incubated for another hour. Anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody diluted 1000-fold in PBS-TM was then added to the wells and incubated for 2 h followed by secondary antibody (goat peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG) diluted 1000-fold in 50 μl of PBS-TM for 1 h. The wells were rinsed and processed as described above. The reaction mixtures contained 200 ng of wild-type p66 along with the indicated amounts of biotinated PCNA or biotinated human RP-A in reaction buffer (PBS, 350 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). The reactions were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. Then 20 μl of a 50% suspension of streptavidin-agarose beads was added to each tube followed by incubation on a shaker for another 2 h at 30 °C. The tubes were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 2 min, and the pellets were washed three times for 15 min at 37 °C by resuspending and centrifuging them in reaction buffer. After a fourth wash, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of loading buffer. The samples were processed for Western blotting with 100-fold diluted anti-p66 monoclonal antibody as described below. For the pull-down assays with the PCNA mutant derivatives, the same amount of each derivative (0.5 μg) was added to reactions containing 10 μg of biotinated p66 peptide in reaction buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml BSA). The reactions were processed as described above except that 1000-fold diluted monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody was employed for Western blotting (see below). For pull-down assays of recombinant three- and two-subunit DNA polymerase δ complexes, 20 μl of a 50% suspension of streptavidin-agarose beads in PBS was added to purified two- and three-subunit preparations of DNA polymerase δ in PBS-T (500 μl) containing 200 ng of biotinated PCNA. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature with agitation, the beads were recuperated by centrifugation and washed five times with PBS-T as described above, and the samples were processed for Western blot analysis with anti-p125 antibody as described below. The reactions were performed in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 6 mm MgCl2), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 μm ATP, the indicated amounts of histone H1 or p66 protein, and 1 μl of cyclin-Cdk complex. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 3 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 mm EDTA, 4% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 32% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The samples were boiled and then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. After drying, radioactive bands on the gel were revealed by autoradiography of the gel with Fuji medical x-ray film. All operations were carried out at room temperature unless indicated otherwise. HeLa cells were grown on the surfaces of coverslips in 6-well culture plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Exponentially growing cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C, washed twice in PBS, and fixed for 20 min in methanol at −20 °C. After two washes in PBS, the cells were incubated with 100 μl of appropriate dilutions of the one or both of the following antibodies diluted in PBS containing 5% BSA for 1 h: PCNA-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene) diluted 100-fold, p66 monoclonal antibody (2C11) diluted 100-fold, monoclonal PCNA antibody (PC10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 600-fold, and goat polyclonal antibody against the large subunit of DNA polymerase δ diluted 100-fold. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS-T. Depending on the first antibody, the cells were then incubated as for the first antibody with either one or both of the following secondary antibodies; fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 100-fold (Jackson ImmunoReseach) or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were incubated in 1 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS for 5 min. Finally, after two washes in PBS, coverslips were placed face down on a drop (2 μl) of 100 mg/ml of DABCO in PBS and 50% glycerol and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescent images were captured through a three-dimensional image capture system on a DMRXA LEICA microscope using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). The images were deconvoluted using software developed by Sibarita and DeMey. 2J. B. Sibarita and J. R. DeMey, manuscript in preparation. 200 μl (700 μg of protein) of partially purified mouse FM3A cell extract (phosphocellulose 0.4 m fraction) (30Hughes P. Tratner I. Ducoux M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was added to 160 μl of PBS containing 40 μl of the supernatant of the hybridoma clone 2C11 expressing p66 monoclonal antibodies. The reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min, and immunocomplexes were precipitated by adding 20 μl of a 50% suspension of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and centrifuging at 12,000 ×g for 2 min. After four washes with PBS, the samples were processed for Western blotting with monoclonal anti-p66 and anti-p125 antibodies as described below.

https://openalex.org/W2325780118,"In this study, we show that the ETS transcription factor ER81 directly binds to and activates the promoter of the matrix metalloproteinase gene, MMP-1. Further, the oncoprotein HER2/Neu synergizes with ER81 to stimulate MMP-1 transcription. The activation of ER81 by HER2/Neu is mediated by MAP kinases, which phosphorylate ER81 in its N-terminal activation domain. Four respective phosphorylation sites have been identified. Blocking phosphorylation at these sites decreases ER81 transcriptional activity, which can be further diminished by abolishment of phosphorylation at two non-MAP kinase sites. Altogether, our results reveal mechanisms of how phosphorylation of ER81 regulates the expression of target genes such as MMP-1, which may be important for many physiological processes from embryogenesis to adulthood as well as for tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2093334583,"Signaling specificity of Rho GTPase pathways is achieved in part by selective interaction between members of the Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and their Rho GTPase substrates. For example, Trio, GEF-H1, and Tiam1 are a subset of GEFs that specifically activate Rac1 but not the closely related Cdc42. The Rac1 specificity of these GEFs appears to be governed by Rac1-GEF binding interaction. To understand the detailed mechanism underlying the GEF specificity issue, we have analyzed a panel of chimeras made between Rac1 and Cdc42 and examined a series of point mutants of Rac1 made at the switch I, switch II, and β2/β3 regions for their ability to interact with and to be activated by the GEFs. The results reveal that Rac1 residues of both the switch I and switch II regions are involved in GEF docking and GEF-mediated nucleotide disruption, because mutation of Asp38, Asn39, Gln61, Tyr64, or Arg66/Leu67 into Ala results in the loss of GEF binding, whereas mutation at Tyr32, Asp65, or Leu70/Ser71 leads to the loss of GEF catalysis while retaining the binding capability. The region between amino acids 53–72 of Rac1 is required for specific recognition and activation by the GEFs, and Trp56 in β3 appears to be the critical determinant. Introduction of Trp56 to Cdc42 renders it fully responsive to the Rac-specific GEF in vitro and in cells. Further, a polypeptide derived from the β3 region of Rac1 including the Trp56 residue serves as a specific inhibitor for Rac1 interaction with the GEFs. Taken together, these results indicate that Trp56 is the necessary and sufficient determinant of Rac1 for discrimination by the subset of Rac1-specific GEFs and suggest that a compound mimicking Trp56 action could be explored as an interfering reagent specifically targeting Rac1 activation.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). They are close family members, sharing over 70% sequence identity. Among a broad spectrum of cellular functions, Rac1 is known to be involved in mediating membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation elicited by growth factors and cytokines (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Cdc42, on the other hand, appears to mediate the formation of filopodia and actin microspikes in multiple cell settings. It is well established that they can differentially respond to upstream stimulants and may cause diverse physiological effects in cell migration, adhesion, growth, and apoptosis (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). As in the case for Ras, the cycling between the active, GTP-bound and the inactive, GDP-bound states of these Rho family proteins is tightly regulated in cells. The guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 accelerate the release of GDP from the small G-proteins, thereby facilitating GTP binding and G-protein activation; the GTPase-activating proteins catalyze the conversion of the GTP-bound form of the G-proteins to the GDP-bound form by increasing their intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis, and GDP dissociation inhibitors might serve to stabilize the G-proteins at either state and to target them to specific intracellular locations (1Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 2Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). Signaling specificity of these Rho GTPases is controlled at multiple levels in the complex signal transduction chains. One of the signaling divergent points that might contribute to the specification of signal flows is at the small G-protein activation step (3Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). A large family of Dbl-like GEFs specific for Rho protein activation has emerged over the past decade (4Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 5Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Among the rapidly expanding Dbl family GEFs that share the structural arrangement of two tandemly located motifs of the Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, the Dbl oncoprotein is the prototype member that was shown to interact with and catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange of many Rho proteins, including RhoA and Cdc42. The DH/PH domains have been demonstrated to represent the minimum structural module required for GEF activity and biological functions (6Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16992-16995Google Scholar). The T-cell invasion and metastasis gene product Tiam1 of the Dbl family was shown to be an active GEF for Rac1 and may influence the invasive capacity of T cells in a Rac1-dependent manner (7Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Trio is a large multifunctional domain molecule containing two DH/PH domain modules, with the amino-terminal module (TrioN) displaying the Rac1- and RhoG-specific GEF activity and the carboxyl-terminal module exhibiting RhoA specific GEF activity (8Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Recent biological studies in Drosophila and mouse have implicated Trio as a key component of the intracellular signaling pathway that regulates axon guidance and cell migration in the nervous system with the TrioN module playing an important role in the process (9Newsome T.P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12074-12078Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another Dbl family member, GEF-H1, was identified as a microtubule-associated protein that is capable of stimulating the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rac1 but is inactive toward Cdc42 (13Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, among the Dbl family members, TrioN, GEF-H1, and Tiam1 constitute a subset of GEFs that share the property of acting as a Rac1-specific GEF without displaying much biochemical effect on the highly related Cdc42 GTPase. The mechanism for such exquisite substrate selectivity by the GEFs is not known. Previous mutagenesis studies of the Rho family GTPase-GEF pairs of RhoA-Lbc and Cdc42-Cdc24 have revealed that multiple sites of the Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation by GEFs, contributing to GEF binding or GEF catalysis (14Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Specific recognition of Lbc by RhoA or Cdc24 by Cdc42 is achieved at least in part through the unique residues Lys27 of RhoA and Gln116 of Cdc42, respectively. These results raise the possibility that activation of each Rho family G-protein by a specific GEF may engage in a distinct mechanism. Recently published x-ray crystal structure of Rac1 in complex with the DH/PH domains of Tiam1 (15Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) provides further insights into how Rac1 interacts with a GEF and what structural determinants might be involved in GEF substrate discrimination. The complex structure suggests an “induced fit” model in which Tiam1 first interacts with the conformationally rigid portions of Rac1 (β2/β3 region and residues 65–74 of switch II) to provide sufficient binding energy, followed by an alteration of the conformations in switch I and the remainder of switch II resulting in destabilization of the bound nucleotide. The residues of Rac1 in the β2/β3 region that would lose surface exposure upon complex formation with Tiam1 and are variable from those in the corresponding positions of Cdc42 are proposed as possible determinants that specify Tiam1 interaction in the activation reaction. In the present work, we have attempted to determine the exact determinants of Rac1 that specify the GEF interaction. First, we found that the Rac1 specificity of three GEFs, TrioN, GEF-H1, and Tiam1, is governed by Rac1-GEF binding interaction. Second, by using an extensive collection of point mutants generated at switch regions of Rac1, we have examined the contribution of the switch I and switch II of Rac1 to the GEF interaction and catalysis and concluded that both switches are important for the physical association with the GEFs and the efficient exchange of nucleotides catalyzed by the GEFs. Third, based on the results of the GEF binding and GEF-responsive profiles of a set of Cdc42/Rac1 chimeras and point mutants made in the β2/β3 area of Rac1, we pinpointed Trp56 of Rac1 as the necessary and sufficient determinant for the GEFs to discriminate against Cdc42. By introducing Trp56 into Cdc42, we were able to produce a Cdc42 mutant that is sensitive to Rac-specific GEF stimulation in vitroand in cells. Finally, we were successful in designing a polypeptide derived from the β3 region of Rac1 including Trp56 that serves as a specific inhibitor for Rac1 interaction with the GEFs. Overall, these studies provide a mechanistic basis for substrate discrimination by Rac1-specific GEFs and initiate an effort for exploring interfering reagents specifically targeting Rac1 activation that might constitute a worthy therapeutic target site. Cdc42/Rac1 chimeric cDNAs were produced as previously described (16Kwong C.H. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), which generates blunt-ended DNA fragments in PCRs followed by forced insertion of the ligation product of the blunt-ended fragments into the pGEX-KG vector (14Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants described in this work were generated by the PCR-based second extension amplification technique using the Pfu polymerase with internal primers that contained the desired mutations (14Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). cDNAs of mutant/chimera forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 were subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-KG vector to express as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli DH5α strain. The sequences of mutagenized Rac1 and Cdc42 or Cdc42/Rac1 chimeras were confirmed by automated sequencing prior to protein expression. All point mutations used are described by single-letter amino acid denominations. Based on a Blast search in the human expressed sequence tag data base using the published Tiam1 sequences (17Crompton A.M. Foley L.H. Wood A. Roscoe W. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Symons M. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25751-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), two clones encoding the human Tiam1 DH/PH sequences were identified; the first one, with GenBankTM accession number AA233606, contains Tiam1 amino acids 1060–1259, while the second one, with accession number AA723139, includes residues 1288–1435. The two cDNA clones were obtained from Incyte Genomics, Inc. and were used as template to piece together an intact Tiam1 DH/PH domain module by the PCR method. To obtain the missing N-terminal sequences of the DH domain of Tiam1, an N-primer with a BglII cleavage site was designed with the sequence 5′-GGGAGATCTAGACAACTCTCGGATGCAGATAAGCTGCGCAAGGTGATCTGCGAGCTCCTGGAGACGGAGCGCACCTACGTGAAGGATTTAAACTGTCTTATGGA-3′, and a C-primer was designed (5′-GCAACCTCTTTTTTCTCA-3′). To fill in the missing sequences between the DH domain and PH domain, an N-primer (5′-AGATCTGAGCATGGGAGACCTGCTTTTGCACACTACCGTGATCTGGCTGAACCCGCCGGCCTCGCTGGGCAAGTGGAAAAAGGAACCAGAGTTGGCAGC-3′) and a C-primer containing an EcoRI digestion site (5′-GGAATTACTCGGTTTTGAGGAGCTG-3′) were used to perform a second round PCR. The two PCR products were digested by BglII andEcoRI, respectively, and were ligated into a modified pET15b vector at the BamHI and EcoRI sites, creating a Tiam1 DH/PH clone (containing residues 1033–1406) with an N-terminal His6 tag. Recombinant TrioN (residues 1225–1537 containing the N-terminal DH/PH module), GEF-H1 (residues 226–643 containing the DH/PH module), Tiam1 (residues 1033–1606, DH/PH module), and PAK1 p21-binding domain (PBD) domain (residues 51–135) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins by using the pET expression system (Novagen). Rac1, Cdc42, and Cdc42/Rac1 chimeras and their mutants were expressed in E. coli DH5α strain as GST fusions using the pGEX-KG vector (14Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tagged GST or His6 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione- or Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography (14Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). GST-GTPases on glutathione beads were eluted off bound guanine nucleotides by washing three times with a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. 0.5 mm GTPγS or GDP was added to the G-proteins after a 10-min incubation together with 12 mm MgCl2 to generate the GTPγS- or GDP-bound small G-proteins. The [3H]GDP/GTP exchanges of Rac1, Cdc42, and different Cdc42/Rac1 chimeras were measured at 25 °C by a filter binding assay as described previously (19Zheng Y. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The exchange reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 500 μm GTP in the presence or absence of the indicated amount of purified GEFs. The reactions were terminated at the 5-min time point by nitrocellulose filtration, and the amounts of [3H]GDP remaining bound to the Rho GTPases were normalized as the percentage of [3H]GDP bound at time 0. Fluorescence measurement of mant-GDP/GTP exchange was carried out using an LS 50B Luminescent Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in an exchange buffer including 200 nm concentrations of respective GTPases and 200 nm GEF as described before (18Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mant-GDP fluorescence changes during the exchange reactions were monitored with an excitation wavelength at 360 nm and the emission wavelength at 440 nm. All measurements were performed at 25 °C in the exchange buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm GTP, and 0.2 μm mant-GDP-bound G-protein. The exchange assays of each mutant/chimera were carried out at least three times. ∼2 μg of GST-tagged, nucleotide-free small GTPases and 0.5 μg of His6-TrioN, His6-GEF-H1 or 1 μg of His6-Tiam1 were added to 200 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm MgCl2) containing 10 μl of glutathione-agarose suspension. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C under constant agitation, the glutathione beads were washed twice in the incubation buffer, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His monoclonal antibodies similar to that described (6Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16992-16995Google Scholar, 13Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In peptide inhibition assays, different amounts of peptides were preincubated with the respective GEFs in the incubation buffer for 10 min prior to mixing with the GST-GTPase and glutathione-agarose beads. Each set of binding experiments was carried out three times independently. The Myc-tagged full-length PAK1 cloned in pCMV6 vector (20Li R. Debreceni B. Jia B. Gao Y. Tigyi G. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29648-29654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was transfected into COS-7 cells by using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitor mixtures (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by brief centrifugation and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of different GST-GTPases that were preloaded with GTPγS and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. The GST beads were washed twice in the wash buffer and subjected to analysis by immunoblotting with anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The polypeptide W56 was added to 250 μmin the incubation buffer where it is indicated. Wild type Rac1, Cdc42, and their mutant cDNAs were subcloned into pCEFL-GST vector at the BamHI andEcoRI sites to be expressed as GST-tagged proteins. TrioN cDNA encoding the DH/PH module was cloned into the pMX-IRES-GFP vector, which expresses the TrioN and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a bicistronic mRNA (21Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Retroviral packaging and infection were carried out according to described methods (21Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were infected with the retroviruses, and cells were harvested 72 h postinfection. GFP-positive cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and were used for analysis immediately after sorting. For transient expression, the NIH 3T3 GFP/TrioN cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% calf serum. The next day, different pCEFL vectors were transfected into the cells by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. In the following day, transfected cells were harvested and replated onto glass coverslips. 12 h prior to fixation, serum was withdrawn from the medium. To create cell lines stably expressing the GST fusion proteins, 80% confluent NIH 3T3 GFP/TrioN cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with different pCEFL vectors. 48 h post-transfection, cells were selected on growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. ∼3 weeks later, cell clones were pooled, and the expression of the GST fusions was checked by anti-GST immunoblotting of the cell lysates. The cells were serum-starved for another 12 h with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before the effector PAK1 pull-down assay was carried out. For the His6-PAK1 PBD pull-down assay, cell lysates expressing comparable levels of various GST fusions were incubated with Ni2+-agarose-immobilized His6-PAK1 PBD domain (∼1 μg each) purified fromE. coli for 30 min as described (21Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Ni2+-agarose co-precipitates were washed twice in the wash buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, washed, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min (21Zhu K. Debreceni B. Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25993-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After washes, the fixed cells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with monoclonal anti-GST antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min, followed by incubation with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The coverslips with cells were mounted onto slides in Vectamount and viewed under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Simulation of the amino acid substitutions in the structural coordinates of the Rac1-Tiam1 complex was made using Insight II software (Molecular Simulations Inc.). After the substitution was introduced, energy minimizations of the resulting structure were carried out by applying the Biopolymer and Discover modules of Insight II, respectively. Unlike the Dbl family GEFs Bcr and Ect2, which are capable of indiscriminately activating the two closely related Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (22Chuang T. Xu X. Kaartinen V. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Bokoch G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10282-10286Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), a subset of Dbl family members, including TrioN, GEF-H1, and Tiam1, appears to be specifically involved in Rac1, but not Cdc42, activation. Fig. 1 A shows that purified TrioN protein acts as a Rac1-specific GEF by stimulating the rate of mant-GDP dissociation from Rac1 while displaying only marginal activity in accelerating the time courses of mant-GDP dissociation from Cdc42 under similar conditions. Similarly, GEF-H1 and Tiam1 also favor Rac1 over Cdc42 as a GEF reaction substrate (Fig. 1, B andC, upper panels). To determine whether the observed Rac1 specificity of the GEFs is reflected in their direct binding interaction, a complex formation assay was performed by using immobilized GST-Rac1 or GST-Cdc42 as a probe to pull down the respective GEFs. As shown in Fig. 1 A (lower panel), TrioN selectively binds to GST-Rac1 without detectable affinity toward GST-Cdc42 or GST, indicating that substrate binding discrimination may be the governing factor in determining the GEF reaction specificity. Similar binding results were obtained in the case of GEF-H1 or Tiam1 interaction with Rac1 and Cdc42 (Figs. 1,B and C, lower panels). Of the three GEFs, GEF-H1 appears to be the most potent activator of nucleotide exchange on Rac1, whereas Tiam1 is the weakest. As described previously (17Crompton A.M. Foley L.H. Wood A. Roscoe W. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Symons M. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25751-25759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found that human Tiam1 requires the phosphoinositol lipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate for activation of its GEF activity, which differs from that found for the constitutively active murine Tiam1. Overall, TrioN, GEF-H1, and Tiam1 are able to discriminate Rac1 from Cdc42 as a substrate in their respective GEF reactions based on their binding preferences. Structural complexes and mutagenesis data obtained between Ras, ADP-ribosylation factor, and Ran and their respective GEFs have shown that the switch regions of the small GTPases play important roles in the GEF binding interaction and in the subsequent nucleotide dissociation (24Boriack-Sjodin P.A.

Switch II, in particular, has been proposed to contribute to the substrate docking, while switch I is thought to be involved in the subsequent step of stimulation of GDP dissociation. This feature is probably conserved in Rho GTPase-GEF interaction, although it may differ in details. Previous structural studies have shown that both switch I and II regions of Rac1 appear to be in broad contact with the GEF domain of Tiam1 (15Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), while the mutagenesis data has shown that many switch II residues of RhoA and Cdc42 do not seem to be required for the functional interaction with their respective GEFs, Lbc and Cdc24 (14Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To further investigate the contribution of Rac1 switch regions to the GEF reaction, we have generated a panel of point mutants at both switch I (E31A, Y32A, I33A, T35A, D38A, and N39A) and switch II (A59G, Q61L, Y64A, D65A, R66A/L67A, L70A/S71A, and Q74D) positions at which most of the mutated residues are highly conserved among Rho family GTPases. The abilities of the mutants to bind to and to be activated by the GEFs, TrioN, GEF-H1, and Tiam1 were analyzed. Under similar conditions, the switch I mutants E31A, I33A, and T35A maintained both the binding activity and GEF responsiveness to TrioN and GEF-H1, Y32A retained the binding but lost the GEF sensitivity, and D38A and N39A were inactive in either binding or catalysis toward TrioN or GEF-H1 (Figs. 2, A and B). Similar results were also obtained for Tiam1 binding and catalysis (data not shown). These results indicate that the switch I residues are probably involved in both aspects of the GEF reactions, the GEF binding (residues Asp38 and Asn39) and the nucleotide exchange catalysis (residue Tyr32). When the switch II mutants of Rac1 were examined in the similar assays, we found that A59G, D65A, L70A/S71A, and Q74D remained capable of binding to TrioN and GEF-H1, whereas Q61L, Y64A, and R66A/L67A lost binding activity to the GEFs (Fig. 2 C). In the GDP/GTP exchange reactions, Q61L, Y64A, D65A, R66A/L67A, and L70A/S71A failed to undergo nucleotide exchange when incubated with TrioN or GEF-H1 (Fig. 2 D). Tiam1 acted similarly to TrioN or GEF-H1 in both aspects (data not shown). Like the switch I situation, we conclude that switch II of Rac1 is also important for both the physical association with the GEFs (residues Gln61, Tyr64, and Arg66/Leu67) and the efficient exchange of nucleotides catalyzed by the GEFs (residues Asp65 and Leu70/Ser71). Rac1 and Cdc42 share over 70% sequence identity throughout their sequences (Fig. 3 A). Since the switch resid"

In cardiac myocytes the maintenance of optimal calcium levels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a specialized form of the ER, is required for proper contractility. The present study investigated the hypothesis that ATF6 serves as a regulator of the expression of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase-2 (SERCA2), a protein that transports calcium into the SR from the cytoplasm. Depletion of SR calcium in cultured cardiac myocytes fostered the translocation of ATF6 from the ER to the nucleus, activated the promoter for rat SERCA2, and led to increased levels of SERCA2 protein. SERCA2 promoter induction by calcium depletion was partially blocked by dominant-negative ATF6, whereas constitutively activated ATF6 led to SERCA2 promoter activation. Mutation analyses identified a promoter-proximal ER stress-response element in the rat SERCA2 gene that was required for maximal induction by ATF6 and calcium depletion. Although this element was shown to be responsible for all of the effects of ATF6 on SERCA2 promoter activation, it was responsible for only a portion of the effects of calcium depletion. Thus, SERCA2 induction in response to calcium depletion appears to be a potentially physiologically important compensatory response to this stress that involves intracellular signaling pathways that are both dependent and independent of ATF6.

This is known as the unfolded protein response or the ER stress response (1Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar,2Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). In a few model cell types, such as HeLa, 3T3, and 293 cells, dysfunctional protein folding leads to a reduction in translation rate and increased expression of proteins that enhance the folding of nascent proteins and promote cell survival (3Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 4Little E. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9526-9634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although these responses appear to be antithetical, they coordinate to promote cellular recovery and viability. One of the genes induced during the ER stress response is glucose response protein GRP-78, which is targeted to the ER lumen and serves a chaperone function (5Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 6Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-24Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 7Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A regulatory element in the GRP-78 gene, the ER stress-response element (ERSE), is required for transcriptional induction during the ER stress response. This element has been found in other ER stress-responsive genes (8Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the transcription factor, ATF6 (10Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is critical for induction of GRP-78 through the ERSE (9Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of ATF6 is responsible for transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (11Thuerauf D.J. Arnold N.D. Zechner D. Hanford D.S. DeMartin K.M. McDonough P.M. Prywes R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20636-20643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas the central region of ATF6 possesses a b-Zip domain that is characteristic of some DNA-binding proteins. It has been shown in HeLa cells that full-length ATF6, composed of 670 amino acids, resides in the ER membrane; the region of ATF6 responsible for anchoring it in the ER membrane is located in the approximate center of the protein, between amino acids 378 and 398 (Fig.1) (12Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Upon ER stress, the cytosolic, N-terminal portion of ATF6 is released from the ER via proteolysis (12Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). The proteases responsible for this cleavage are the same as those required for the maturation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein maturation in the ER (13Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Given the consensus cleavage sequence for those proteases, it is estimated that ATF6 cleavage probably takes place within the ER transmembrane domain, most likely between leucine 390 and asparagine 391 (13Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of ATF6 possesses several putative nuclear localization signals at residues 170, 330, and 380 (8Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following proteolytic cleavage, the N terminus of ATF6 translocates to the nucleus where it combines with several other proteins to form an ERSE-binding complex that is responsible for the transcriptional induction of ER stress-response proteins, such as GRP-78 (8Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it appears as though ATF6 itself does not bind directly to the ERSE but forms a complex with other proteins that do (8Li W.W. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5533-5546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like GRP-78, most ER stress-inducible genes encode proteins that are targeted to the ER, where they presumably perform stress response-related functions. In electrically excitable cells, such as myocytes, neurons, or endocrine cells, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and/or the ER, depending on the cell type, serves a particularly important cellular function. The SR/ER is a critical storage site for the calcium that must be released at appropriate times and in a transient manner to mediate contraction, neurotransmitter, or hormone release, respectively (14Cheek T.R. Barry V.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 184: 183-196PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tse F.W. Tse A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Lamb G.D. Clin Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2000; 27: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This cytosolic calcium transient requires the rapid reuptake of calcium into the ER, which is usually accomplished by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (reviewed in Ref. 17Misquitta C.M. Mack D.P. Grover A.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 25: 277-290Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, SERCA2 has been shown to play a central role in the contractile event (18Zarain-Herzberg a. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4577-4670Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 19Wu K.-D. Lee W.-S. Wey J. Bundgard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively small decreases in SERCA2 levels, which are sometimes observed in diseased hearts (20Mercardier J.J. Lompre A.M. Duc P. Boheler K.R. Fraysse J.B. Wisnewsky C. Allen P.D. Komajda M. Schwartz K. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), can make considerable differences in contractile function (21Pieske B. Maier L.S. Bers D.M. Hasenfuss G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 22Gwathmey J.K. Copelas L. MacKinnon R. Schoen F.J. Feldman M.D. Grossman W. Morgan J.P. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In fact, recent efforts have focused on overexpression of SERCA2 as a potential gene therapy for heart failure (23Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24del Monte F. Harding S.E. Schmidt U. Matsui T. Kang Z.B. Dec G.W. Gwathmey J.K. Rosenzweig A. Hajjar R.J. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2308-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Thus, if SR/ER calcium levels fall below functionally acceptable limits in a normal cardiac myocyte, it seems possible that the ER stress response could initiate signaling events leading to homeostatic adjustments in the levels of important calcium-handling proteins, such as SERCA2. In this way, the status of SR/ER calcium could be communicated via an intracellular signaling mechanism to other organelles, such as the nucleus, where the initial steps required for the appropriate adjustments would take place. We undertook the present study to pursue this hypothesis, with a focus on determining whether ATF6 could serve a role in cardiac myocytes as an intracellular communicator, relaying information about the status of SR/ER calcium to the nucleus. Primary ventricular myocytes cell cultures were prepared from 1–4-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (25Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Handord D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The apical two-thirds of the ventricle were dissected away from the atria, minced, and then washed twice with air-compatible DMEM. Isolation of cells were performed by multiple 10-min rounds of tissue dissociation with 0.001% trypsin. After each trypsin incubation, the supernatant was added to an equal volume of DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and all of the supernatants were combined. The cells were initially suspended in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto plastic culture dishes for 2 h, during which time most of the noncardiac myocytes attach to the plastic, whereas the myocytes remain in suspension. After 2 h, the suspended myocytes were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cardiac myocytes were plated onto plastic culture wells that had been pretreated for at least 1 h with fibronectin at 5 μg/ml of DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1). Alternatively, myocytes were plated onto 2-chamber Lab-tekTM glass slides (Nalge Nunc International) that had been pretreated for at least 1 h with fibronectin at 25 μg/ml of DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1). For immunocytofluorescence, myocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 106cells/Lab-tekTM glass slide chamber. For Western analyses, the myocytes were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106cells/35-mm plastic culture dish. For reporter analyses, the myocytes were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/24-mm plastic culture dish. Cytoplasmic free calcium was measured using indo-1, as described previously (27McDonough P.M. Stella S.L. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on glass coverslips were loaded with 3 μm indo-1/acetoxymethylester for 30 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Following loading, the coverslips were mounted in a Biophysica Technologies (Baltimore, MD) microscope chamber that was maintained at 37 °C. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Nikon Diaphot epifluroescence microscope equipped with a 100× fluor objective that was interfaced to a Photon Technologies Inc. (South Brunswick, NJ) dual emission photometry system. Illumination was provided by a 75-watt zenon lamp, with the excitation wavelength set to 355 nm (1–4-nm band pass) via a monochrometer. Fluorescence emission data at 405 and 485 nm were collected at a rate of 40 Hz and plotted as the ratio of 405/485. An aperture mechanism allowed fluorescence to be collected from a selected portion of the field that was always positioned over the cytoplasmic region of individual cells. Pacing of contractions during fluorescence measurements was performed as previously described (28Ho P.D. Zechner D.K. He H. Dillmann W.H. Glembotski C.C. McDonough P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21730-21735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, myocytes obtained after preplating were resuspended in serum-free DMEM/Ham’s F-12 (1:1), and between 6 × 106 and 9 × 106 cells were combined with 12–45 μg of the indicated plasmids in a total volume of 300 μl. The total quantity of plasmid DNA used in each electroporation was equalized using pCMV6, when necessary. Optimal quantities of each test plasmid were determined in preliminary dose-response experiments. The cells were electroporated at 500 V, 25 microfarad, and 100 Ω in a 0.2-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Under these conditions, cardiac myocytes are efficiently transfected, whereas any remaining nonmyocytes are not (25Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Following transfection, the cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/fibronectin-coated, 24-mm plastic culture dish. The following plasmids were used as indicated in this study. pGL2-Basic (catalog number E1641; Promega, Madison WI) is a vector containing luciferase reporter gene but does not contain eukaryotic promoter or enhancer sequences. pGL2 promoter (catalog number E1631; Promega) is a vector containing an SV40 promoter inserted into the pGL2-Basic vector upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. pCH110-LacZ, which codes for a galactosidase reporter driven by the SV40 promoter, was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (code number 27-4509-01). pEGFP-C1, which codes for a form of green fluorescent protein (GFP) that has been optimized for brighter fluorescence in mammalian cells driven by the CMV promoter, was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA (code number 6084-1).

The other truncated forms of the SERCA promoter were prepared by digesting rat SERCA 3.2 with Hin dIII and Kpn I (−2395), Eco RI (−1205), Eco RI (−563), Sac I (−334), and Nsp 1 (−56), purifying the appropriate fragments, and then cloning into the appropriate sites of pGL2. This construct codes for a form of SERCA344-Luc where the CCACA sequence within SERCA344-Luc ERSE-1, located at positions −78 to −74, has been mutated to TACAA (see Figs.6 C and 8 A). This mutation was created using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the following primers: CGGCCAATGAGCGGCGTTACAATGCCGCGGCGGCGGCG and CGCCGCCGCCGCGGCATTGTAACGCCGCTCATTGGCCG, where the mutated nucleotides are in bold and underlined.Figure 8Point mutation analysis of SERCA promoter activation by ATF6 and by calcium depletion. A, diagram of rat SERCA334-Luc constructs. Shown is a diagram of the wild type and mutated forms of rat SERCA334-Luc. In the region of the rat SERCA2 gene spanning positions −334 to +78, there is only one ERSE, ERSE-1, which is located at position −78. Shown is the mutation in ERSE-1 that was prepared in a manner expected to render it inactive in the ER stress response; bold letters indicate the boundaries of ERSE-1, and underlined letters represent the mutated positions.B, effect of ATF6 on wild type and mutated rat SERCA334-Luc. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with pGL2 (Con) or one of the SERCA2-luciferase constructs shown and SV40-β-galactosidase (pCH110). The cultures were also transfected with either 3× FLAG-pcDNA3.1 (Vector Con) or with 3× FLAG-ATF6(1–373) (ATF6(373)). The cultures were then treated and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 6 B. C, effect of calcium depletion on wild type and mutated rat SERCA334-Luc. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with pGL2p (Con) or one of the SERCA2-luciferase constructs shown and SV40-β-galactosidase (pCH110). The cultures were then maintained in serum-containing medium for 48 h and then switched to medium fostering normal calcium or calcium-depleted conditions for 16 h, then treated, and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 4 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A version of pcDNA3.1(−) containing a 3× FLAG sequence was constructed by annealing the following oligonucleotides: ctagcGCCATGGACTACAAAGACCACGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCACGATATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGt and ctagaCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGATATCGTGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCGTGGTCTTTGTAGTCCATGGCg. The Nhe I and Xba I overhangs of the annealed oligonucleotides were used to ligate the product into theXba I site of pcDNA3.1(−) (Promega), resulting in the creation of 3× FLAG-pcDNA3.1. Construction of 3× FLAG-ATF6(1–670) began with a 1× FLAG-ATF6(1–670) construct that was provided by Dr. Ron Prywes (Columbia University, New York, NY). Using 1- FLAG-ATF6(1–670) as the template, PCR was carried out to introduce an Xba I site at the first amino acid of ATF6; the resulting product was then ligated into the Xba I site of the 3× FLAG-pcDNA3.1. The 3× FLAG-ATF6(1–373) and 3× FLAG-ATF6(1–366) were created by introducing and Xho I site at amino acid 1, as described above, and by introducing a termination codon and Sac I site in the PCR product and then ligating the product into the 3× FLAG vector. The 3× FLAG-ATF6(1–273) was created by introducing an Xho I site at amino acid 1, as described above, and then cutting the PCR product with Xho I and Kpn I, the latter of which is a native restriction site located at amino acid 273. The 3× FLAG-ATF6 constructs were prepared to optimize cross-reactivity with the anti-FLAG antibody and, thus, enhance the sensitivity of immunocytofluorescence. pcDNA3 FLAG-MKK6 (Glu) codes for activated human MKK6 and was obtained from R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). After the indicated times, the cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation, and 200-μl samples of each cell lysate were combined with 400 μl of galactosidase buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 1 mg/ml chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for at least 2 h, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. After cell lysis and removal of cell debris by centrifugation, as described above, 200-μl samples of cell lysate were combined with 100 μl of luciferase buffer (25 mmGly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 45 mm KPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mmd-Luciferin, 3 mm ATP). A Bio Orbit 1251 luminometer was used to measure light emission of each sample for 10 s. Relative luciferase activities were determined by dividing luciferase values by β-galactosidase values. All values shown are the means of three cultures ± S.E. Cultured cardiac myocytes were dissociated and in some cases transfected with pGL2p (Control) or with a test luciferase construct and pCH110 (SV40-β-gal). Cultures were then maintained for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cultures were then switched to a calcium depletion medium, consisting of calcium-free medium (DMEM catalog number 21068; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 584 mg/literl-glutamine, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 1 mmEGTA, and 10 μg/ml ryanodine. Control cultures were maintained in normal calcium medium, consisting of DMEM (catalog number 11960; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 584 mg/literl-glutamine, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate. Following these treatments, the cultures were extracted and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The relative luciferase (Luc/β-Gal) values that were obtained for each luciferase test construct following a normal calcium or calcium depletion treatment were then divided by the relative luciferase values that were obtained for pGL2p (control) following normal calcium and calcium depletion treatments, respectively. Thus, by default, all of the relative luciferase values obtained for pGL2p (control) were set to 1.0 for normal calcium and for calcium depletion, and all other values were compared with these as percentages of the control. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with pEGFP-C1 and either 3× FLAG-ATF6(670) or 3× FLAG-ATF6(373) and then plated onto glass slides. The cultures were maintained for 24 h in serum-containing medium and then treated for 4 h with N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (catalog number 208719; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) to inhibit proteosomal ATF6 degradation, which is necessary to visualize ATF6 by either Western analysis or immunocytofluorescence (13Ye J.

Mutation of FUS1 is infrequent in lung cancers which we have confirmed in 40 other primary lung cancers. In addition, we found no evidence for FUS1 promoter region methylation. Because haploinsufficiency or low expression of Fus1 may play a role in lung tumorigenesis, we tested the effect of exogenously induced overexpression of Fus1 protein and found 60-80% inhibition of colony formation for non-small cell lung cancer lines NCI-H1299 (showing allele loss for FUS1) and NCI-H322 (containing only a mutated FUS1 allele) in vitro. By contrast, a similar level of expression of a tumor-acquired mutant form of FUS1 protein did not significantly suppress colony formation. Also, induced expression of Fus1 under the control of an Ecdysone regulated promoter decreased colony formation 75%, increased the doubling time twofold, and arrested H1299 cells in G1. In conclusion, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that FUS1 may function as a 3p21.3 TSG, warranting further studies of its function in the pathogenesis of human cancers."

To address this issue, cybrids were generated by fusing osteosarcoma cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with platelets from a patient with a stop-codon mutation in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX I). The molecular and biochemical characteristics of cybrids harboring varying levels of mutated mitochondrial DNA were studied. We found a direct correlation between the levels of mutated COX I DNA and mutated COX I mRNA, whereas the levels of COX I total mRNA were unchanged. COX I polypeptide synthesis and steady-state levels were inversely proportional to mutation levels. Cytochrome coxidase subunit II was reduced proportionally to COX I, indicating impairment in complex assembly. COX enzymatic activity was inversely proportional to the levels of mutated mtDNA. However, both cell respiration and ATP synthesis were preserved in cells with lower proportions of mutated genomes, with a threshold at ∼40%, and decreased linearly with increasing mutated mtDNA. These results indicate that COX levels in mutated cells were not regulated at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels.

It transfers electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen and contributes to generating the electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mammalian COX is an enzymatic complex of the inner mitochondrial membrane composed of 13 subunits (1Kadenbach B. Jarausch J. Hartmann R. Merle P. Anal.

So far, no mutations in nuclear genes encoding for COX subunits have been associated with human diseases. Usually, in mitochondrial disorders caused by large scale deletions of mtDNA and by mutations in the mitochondrial tRNA genes, there is a deficit of multiple respiratory chain enzymes including COX (10Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar).

The peculiar characteristics of mammalian mitochondrial genetics, where each cell contains a large number of mtDNAs in the order of 103–105 copies (15Gross N.J. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1552-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) render the issues of “gene dosage” and “threshold” for phenotypic effect very compelling, especially in the case of mtDNA mutations. In fact, very little is known about the regulation of the expression of genes involved in OXPHOS in mammalian mitochondria in response to mtDNA abnormalities. In most cases, mtDNA harboring pathogenic mutations coexist with wild-type mtDNA, a condition called “heteroplasmy.” It is well known that for many tRNA point mutations a relatively high proportion of mutated mtDNAs is required to determine OXPHOS defects (10Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). This is probably because of the ability of the remaining normal tRNAs to complement the function of the defective ones, suggesting that tRNAs are normally synthesized in excess of the minimum required for normal mitochondrial protein synthesis (16Enriquez J.A. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 17Hayashi J. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). On the contrary, despite the apparent genetic redundancy, mutations in mtDNA genes encoding COX subunits seem to cause enzymatic defects at low levels of heteroplasmy (i.e.low proportions of mutated mtDNA). Ostensibly, the level of heteroplasmy corresponding to the threshold for COX deficiency in the muscle of patients harboring mutations in COX genes is ∼40%, as demonstrated by genetic and biochemical analyses of COX deficient fibers (11Keightley J.A.

Genet. 1999; 64: 1330-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Studies performed on intact human cultured cells treated with increasing doses of the COX inhibitor KCN demonstrate that COX capacity is in low excess compared with that required to support normal cell respiration (18Villani G. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Villani G. Greco M. Papa S. Attardi G. J. Biol.

To better understand how genetic defects in mtDNA-coded COX subunits affect the regulation of OXPHOS in vivo, we have analyzed a set of transmitochondrial cell lines (cybrids) containing various proportions (from 0 to 100%) of a G6930A stop-codon mutation in the COX I gene (13Bruno C. Martinuzzi A. Tang Y. Andreu A.L. Pallotti F. Bonilla E. Shanske S. Fu J. Sue C.M. Angelini C. DiMauro S. Manfredi G. Am. J. Hum.

Cybrids were generated by fusion of platelets from a patient with the G6930A mtDNA mutation with human osteosarcoma 143B cells lacking mtDNA (ρ0 cells) as described elsewhere (13Bruno C. Martinuzzi A. Tang Y. Andreu A.L. Pallotti F. Bonilla E. Shanske S. Fu J. Sue C.M. Angelini C. DiMauro S. Manfredi G. Am. J. Hum.

Ethidium bromide was used to manipulate the mtDNA content in a cell line with 65% of mtDNA mutation (20King M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 339-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide, and 50 μg/ml uridine for 9 or 11 days. After ethidium bromide treatment cells were replated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at the cloning dilution of 100 cells/plate. Subclones were isolated with cloning rings and expanded for genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses. Growth of subclones in selective conditions were determined by seeding 35-mm plastic Petri dishes with 5 × 104 cells in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, 5 mm galactose, 50 μg/ml uridine. Cell counts were obtained daily for 6 days. Total DNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells by standard techniques. PCR/RFLP analysis was performed to detect the G6930A mutation and to quantify the proportion of mutated mtDNA as described elsewhere (13Bruno C. Martinuzzi A. Tang Y. Andreu A.L. Pallotti F.

Radiolabeled mtDNA fragments digested with AluI were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and quantified with Cyclone phosphorimager using the OpiQuant software (Hewlett Packard). Total RNA was extracted from a semi-confluent 100-mm dish (∼107 cells) using a ToTALLY®RNA kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA yield was measured by UV absorbance. For Northern blot analyses, 16 μg of total RNA were loaded on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel following the described protocols (21Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar). RNA was blotted on a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The membrane was probed sequentially with mtDNA fragments corresponding to portions of COX I (nucleotides 6459–7315) and ND2 (nucleotides 4485–5420) genes, and β-actin DNA (CLONTECH) were labeled with [32P]dATP by a random primer labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Intensities of RNA bands were quantified with Cyclone phosphorimager using the OpiQuant software (Hewlett Packard). For RT-PCR/RFLP analyses of mt-cDNA, 5–8 μg of total RNA were subjected to DNase I digestion for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was arrested by incubation at 75 °C for 15 min. One μg of DNase I-digested RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using a Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total cDNA was incubated with RNase A to digest any residual mtRNA) for 1 h at 37 °C. PCR amplification of COX I cDNA fragments encompassing the G6930A mutation was performed as described elsewhere (13Bruno C. Martinuzzi A. Tang Y. Andreu A.L. Pallotti F. Bonilla E. Shanske S. Fu J.

To exclude potential mtDNA contamination and unprocessed mtRNA, another PCR reaction was carried out using the primers 11F (3′ position at mtDNA nucleotide 7148 in the COX I gene) and 11R (3′ position at mtDNA nucleotide 8095 in the COX II gene). These primers could only amplify mtDNA and unprocessed mtRNA. PCR products were radiolabeled, digested with AluI, and quantified as described above. For oxygen consumption measurement, cells were fluid-changed with fresh medium 1 h before performing the assays. Cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation, counted, and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking glucose and containing 110 mg/ml pyruvate at 37 °C. 0.3 ml of cell suspension was transferred into an oxygraph chamber equipped with a Clark-type electrode (Hansatech). After adequate time for accurate slope measurement, the coupled endogenous respiration was inhibited by 1.5 mm KCN. A replicate measurement on the same cell suspension was carried out in the presence of 3 μm FCCP. For respiratory chain activity assays, the mitochondrial fraction was isolated from two semiconfluent cultures on 150-mm dishes as described elsewhere (22Pallotti F. Lenaz G. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex I + III, complex IV, and citrate synthase activities were measured as described elsewhere (23Trounce I.A. Kim Y.L. Jun A.S. Wallace D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 484-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For ATP synthesis measurements (24Manfredi G. Spinazzola A. Checcarelli N. Naini A. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 133-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells were fluid-changed with fresh medium 1 h before performing the assay. Cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation, counted, and resuspended at 1 × 107cells/ml in buffer A containing 150 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4. 160 μl of the cell suspension was incubated with 50 μg/ml digitonin for 1 min at room temperature, diluted with 1 ml of buffer A, and centrifuged at low speed for 1 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 160 μl of buffer A, and 0.15 mm Ap5A, 0.1 mm ADP, 1 mm malate, 1 mm pyruvate, and 10 μl of buffer B containing 0.8 mm luciferin and 20 μg/ml luciferase were added. The light emission was recorded by an Optocomp I luminometer (MGM Electronics) at 15-s intervals for a total recording time of 4 min. Each measurement was replicated with the addition of 1 μg/ml oligomycin to determine the non-mitochondrial ATP synthesis. A standard ATP/luminescence curve was constructed by measuring luminescence of different ATP concentrations. To measure the rate of mitochondrial protein synthesis, pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine were performed according to the method of Chomyn et al. (25Chomyn A. Mariottini P. Cleeter M.W. Ragan C.I. Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Doolittle R.F. Attardi G. Nature. 1985; 314: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Samples of 2 × 106 cells were plated on 100-mm Petri dishes, incubated overnight, washed with methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then incubated for 7 min at 37 °C in 4 ml of the same medium containing 50 μg/ml cytoplasmic translation inhibitor emetine. Thereafter, [35S]methionine (0.2 mCi (1.75 Ci/mmol)/plate) was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 min. Cells were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1% SDS. 40 μg of protein were electrophoresed through an SDS, 15% polyacrylamide gel. The intensities of the bands corresponding to mitochondrial translation products were quantified with Cyclone phosphorimager using the OpiQuant software (Hewlett Packard). Immunoblot analyses of equal amounts of total cell proteins (30 μg) was performed as described elsewhere (26Marusich M.F. Robinson B.H. Taanman J.W. Kim S.J. Schillace R. Smith J.L. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1362: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using mouse monoclonal antibodies against COX I and COX II (Molecular Probes). For separation of mitochondrial complexes under native conditions, cells from exponentially growing cultures were collected by trypsinization, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and counted. Crude mitochondrial pellets were obtained by incubating 1 × 106 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min on ice with 4 mg/ml digitonin, pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (27Nijtmans L.G. Taanman J.W. Muijsers A.O. Speijer D. Van den Bogert C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 1.5 m6-aminohexanoic acid, 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0. Membrane complexes were extracted by adding 10 μl of 10% n-dodecyl maltoside and incubating cells on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of 5% Serva Blue G in 1m 6-aminohexanoic acid and loaded on a 5–10% gradient gel. (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). COX was immnunodetected by Western blot using mouse monoclonal antibodies against COX I (Molecular Probes). To obtain cybrid cell lines containing various different proportions of mtDNA G6930A point mutation, a previously characterized heteroplasmic cybrid clone with ∼65% mutated mtDNAs (13Bruno C. Martinuzzi A. Tang Y. Andreu A.L. Pallotti F. Bonilla E. Shanske S. Fu J. Sue C.M. Angelini C. DiMauro S. Manfredi G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was subjected to ethidium bromide treatment for 9 or 11 days. By decreasing the mtDNA copy number, ethidium bromide increases the likelihood of skewed mitotic segregation of the mtDNAs in dividing cells. After ethidium bromide treatment, cells were plated at low concentrations in medium containing uridine. mtDNA from single-cell-derived subclones was analyzed by PCR/RFLP. As expected, these subclones contained various amounts of mutated mtDNA ranging from 0 to 100% (Fig. 1 A). A genetic drift of mtDNA resulting in a variation of the proportion of mutated mtDNA over time has been described in heteroplasmic cell lines (29Bentlage H.A. Attardi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Lehtinen S.K. Hance N. El Meziane A. Juhola M.K. Juhola K.M. Karhu R. Spelbrink J.N. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Genetics. 2000; 154: 363-380PubMed Google Scholar). The content of mutated mtDNA was measured periodically in a subset of our subclones for 90 days of continuous culture. We found that some heteroplasmic subclones had a tendency to drift toward higher levels of mutated mtDNA, although they always maintained their heteroplasmic state (Fig. 1 B). There was no apparent correlation between the initial proportion of mutated mtDNA and its tendency to shift upward or remain stable. For this reason, a portion of the cells was set aside and utilized for DNA extraction each time an experiment was performed to determine the exact proportion of mutated genomes at that particular time point. To investigate whether the G6930A stop-codon mutation had any effect on COX I gene transcription, total RNA was extracted, and total cDNA was generated by RT. Samples were treated with DNase prior to RT to eliminate any residual mtDNA. To ensure that all residual mtDNA had been eliminated, cDNAs were subjected to PCR amplification with a forward primer corresponding to COX I gene and a reverse primer complementary to COX II gene. As expected, no PCR products were generated from the cDNA samples, whereas the positive mtDNA controls generated the 948-bp target product (not shown). cDNAs were subjected to PCR-RFLP to determine the relative content of mutated mtRNA (Fig. 2 A). RNA from parental 143Bρ0 cells was used as a negative control and did not yield any PCR product (not shown) excluding the presence of COX I-expressed nuclear pseudo-genes. There was a linear correlation between the proportion of mutated mtDNA and mutated mRNA (Fig. 2 B), indicating that in heteroplasmic cells the rate of transcription of wild-type and mutated COX I genes was the same. We also looked at total COX I mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 C). The COX I mRNA normalized to β-actin mRNA varied in different cell lines from 2.75 to 4.70 (Fig. 2 D). However, there was no correlation between the proportion of mutated mtDNA and relative COX I mRNA content. Quantification of ND2 mRNA, another mtDNA-encoded gene unrelated to the G6930A mutation, also showed variability among subclones with no correlation with the proportion of mutated genomes (Figs. 2,C–D). These results show that the stop-codon mutation had no qualitative or quantitative effects on COX I mRNA expression and presumably did not affect the transcription of other mtDNA genes. Mitochondrial translation products were labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine in the presence of the cytosolic protein translation inhibitor emetine (Fig. 3 A). Although equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane to correct for potential differences in protein loading, the intensity of the band corresponding to COX I was normalized to that of the ATPase subunit 6 (A6), and the amount of COX I polypeptide synthesized was expressed as the ratio COX I:A6. Although there was a gap between clones containing 8 and 58% mutated mtDNA, the trend of the data suggested a linear correlation between the proportion of mutated mtDNA and the decrease in synthesized COX I polypeptide (Fig. 3 B). Protein steady-state levels were assayed by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies against COX I and COX II (Fig. 4 A). The intensities of the bands corresponding to the two COX subunits were quantified by densitometry. Again, we observed a direct correlation between the decrease in COX I steady state levels and the proportion of mutated mtDNA. Interestingly also, COX II was decreased in parallel with COX I (Fig. 4 B). Because COX II synthesis was normal in mutated cells, the reduction in COX II steady-state levels was due to protein degradation, presumably caused by lack of complex IV assembly. COX assembly was assayed in blue-native gel electrophoresis. As expected, the loss of COX I caused a deficit of COX assembly. Although we expected in cells with 65% mutated mtDNAs, assembled COX should have been 35% normal, using anti-COX I antibodies we found that as little as 65% mutated genomes caused complete disappearance of immunoreactive assembled COX IV (Fig. 4 C). However, it has been shown that only ∼80% of COX can be extracted under the mild conditions used (31Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is possible, that the sample preparation for native gels did not allow for complete antigen presentation for the anti-COX I antibody, leading to an underestimation of assembled complex IV. In agreement with the results obtained by Western blot, immunostaining of the native blot with antibodies to anti-COX II also showed the absence of reactive material in cells with 65% mutated genomes (not shown). The apparently inverse linear correlation between the proportion of mutated mtDNA and the decrease in COX I protein suggested that the remaining wild-type mtRNAs were not able to compensate for the lack in COX I protein translation caused by the mutation. Moreover, COX I protein turnover and degradation were unchanged in mutated cells, again suggesting that any compensatory mechanisms at the protein level was either very small or not present at all. COX activity measured in mitochondrial fractions was decreased proportionally to the mutation load (Fig. 5 A). This correlation was maintained when COX activities were normalized by the activity of citrate synthase (Fig. 5 B), a nuclear-encoded matrix enzyme of the Krebs cycle, to correct for the possible variations in mitochondrial content due to the isolation procedures. In addition, the activity of complex I + III (NADH-cytochrome coxidoreductase) was unchanged in mutated cells (Fig. 5 C). These results showed that there was no threshold for COX enzymatic activity and that there was no compensatory increase of the other mitochondrial enzymes that would have resulted in a steeper decrease of the COX:citrate synthase ratio and higher complex I + III activities in mutated cells. Oxygen consumption was assayed in intact cells respiring in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing pyruvate and l-glutamine as the sole energy sources. Cell respiration was almost completely inhibited by the addition of 1.5 mm KCN, a specific inhibitor of complex IV. Cell respiration plotted against the proportion of mutated genomes showed almost normal rates up to ∼30–40%, above which there was a steep decrease linearly correlated with the mutation load (Fig. 6 A). To avoid the potential influence of proton cycling and OXPHOS on cell respiration, cells were completely uncoupled with 3 μm FCCP, a potent protonophore. The addition of FCCP increased the cellular respiration rate by ∼100%. However, the correlation between respiration and mutation load did not change. Cells harboring 30–40% mutated genomes were still able to sustain almost normal cell respiration with a steep drop at higher levels of mutation (Fig. 6 B). ATP synthesis was measured by luminometry in permeabilized cells using malate and pyruvate as substrates with and without the addition of 15 μg/ml of the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin. In wild-type cells, more than 90% ATP synthesis was oligomycin-sensitive, indicating its mitochondrial origin. As for cell respiration, mitochondrial ATP synthesis plotted against the proportion of mutated genomes was normal up to 30–40%, above which there was a sharp decrease that correlated linearly with the mutation load (Fig. 6 C). We investigated the impact of reduced respiratory chain functions on cell survival in culture conditions where ATP synthesis depends primarily on oxidative metabolism. Cells were grown in medium lacking glucose and containing pyruvate and galactose. Galactose can enter glycolysis via three consecutive reactions that convert galactose to glucose 6-phosphate. Because in cultured cells this reaction is much slower than the conversion of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase, the ATP produced by galactose-derived glycolysis alone is not sufficient for cell viability. Therefore, cells have to rely on mitochondrial OXPHOS as the main source of ATP (32Robinson B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 454-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was a rather high degree of variability in growth rates among clones also in medium containing glucose that was unrelated to the proportion of mutated genomes. However, in medium containing galactose and pyruvate the growth of cells harboring more than 50% mutated genomes was dramatically decreased, and cells containing more than 70% mutated genomes were unable to divide after only 2 days of culture (data not shown). Therefore, we es"

The effect of estrogen on cardiovascular disease is mainly dependent on direct actions on the vascular wall involving activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) via Akt and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) cascades. Although raloxifene is also known to activate eNOS in the vascular endothelium, the molecular mechanism responsible for this effect remains to be elucidated. In studies of both human umbilical vein endothelial cells and simian virus 40-transformed rat lung vascular endothelial cells (TRLECs), the raloxifene analog LY117018 caused acute phosphorylation of eNOS that was unaffected by actinomycin D and was blocked by the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI182,780. Activation of Akt by raloxifene reached a plateau at 15–30 min and declined thereafter, a similar time frame to that of Akt activation by 17β-estradiol. On the other hand, both activation and phosphorylation of ERK by raloxifene showed a biphasic pattern (peaks at 5 min and 1 h), whereas ERK activation and phosphorylation by 17β-estradiol reached a plateau at 5 min and declined thereafter. A MEK inhibitor, PD98059, had no effect on the raloxifene-induced Akt activity, suggesting an absence of cross-talk between the ERK and Akt cascades. Either exogenous expression of a dominant-negative Akt or pretreatment of TRLECs with PD98059 decreased the raloxifene-induced eNOS phosphorylation. Moreover, raloxifene stimulated the activation of Akt, ERK, and eNOS in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing estrogen receptor α but not Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing estrogen receptor β. Our findings suggest that raloxifene-induced eNOS phosphorylation is mediated by estrogen receptor α via a nongenomic mechanism and is differentially mediated by Akt- and ERK-dependent cascades.

In several studies, estrogens have been shown to decrease the otherwise increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A.

Heart disease is the most common cause of death of women in most industrialized nations, and observational studies have suggested a 50% reduction in heart disease risk in postmenopausal women taking estrogen (3The Writing Group for the PEPI Trial J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 273: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this cardiovascular protective effect has not yet been established, but favorable effects of hormone therapy on plasma lipids and vascular endothelial function have been proposed. However, estrogens can also increase the risk of breast cancer (4Lobo R.A. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1995; 173: 982-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Colditz G.A.

Gynecol. 1995; 173: 982-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Combining estrogen with progesterone has been shown to decrease the incidence of uterine endometrial hyperplasia and the risk of uterine endometrial cancer, but unfortunately it also lessens the beneficial effects of estrogen on lipid profiles, and it does not ameliorate the increased risk of breast cancer (3The Writing Group for the PEPI Trial J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 273: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2335) Google Scholar). There is, therefore, a need for an ideal estrogen. The search for such an ideal compound has led to the development of a class of drugs termed selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)1 (6Walsh B.W. Kuller L.H. Wild R.A. Paul S. Farmer M. Lawrence J.B. Shah A.S. Anderson P.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Raloxifene is a nonsteroidal benzothiophene that has been classified as a SERM based on the facts that it produces both estrogen-agonistic effects on bone (7Delmas P.D. Bjarnason N.H. Mitlak B.H.

Because of its tissue selectivity, raloxifene may cause fewer side effects than are typically observed with estrogen therapy. Raloxifene has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, its ability to protect against cardiovascular disease has yet to be determined and awaits the results of the RUTH (raloxifene use for theheart) trial (11Miller V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Future experimental studies will be needed to address the cardioprotective effects of raloxifene. Recent evidence suggests that the direct actions of estrogen on blood vessels contribute to the cardioprotective effects of estrogen (12Mendelsohn M.E. Karas R.H. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 1994; 9: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar,13Farhat M.Y. Lavigne M.C. Ramwell P.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). There are many kinds of direct effects of estrogen on blood vessels such as estrogen-induced increases of vasodilatation and inhibition of the response of blood vessels to injury and of the development of atherosclerosis. Several studies suggest that a key mediator of this vasodilator response may be the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO) (14Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. Germian Z. Chen Z. Shaul P.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: 119-126PubMed Google Scholar). Estrogen activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) without altering expression of the eNOS gene in vascular endothelium (14Lantin-Hermoso R.L. Rosenfeld C.R. Yuhanna I.S. Germian Z. Chen Z.

Commun. 1999; 263: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, the details of the mechanism of the estrogen-induced eNOS activation are not yet well understood. The serine/threonine kinase termed Akt or protein kinase B is an important regulator of various cellular processes including glucose metabolism and cell survival (19Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R.

Activated Akt can phosphorylate substrates such as glycogen synthase kinase 3, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, and Bcl-2-associated death promoter. It was found that eNOS is also an Akt substrate and is activated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, leading to release of NO in endothelial cells (26Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J.

In addition, evidence of a short term activation of eNOS, mediated by estrogen receptor-α functioning in a nongenomic manner via mitogen-activated protein kinase, has recently been published (17Chen Z.

Raloxifene has the ability to bind to and activate the estrogen receptor while exerting tissue-specific effects distinct from those of estrogen (35Gradishar W.J. Jordan V.C. J. Clin.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether the eNOS phosphorylation induced by the raloxifene analog LY117018 is mediated by Akt activation or mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) activation and which type of ER is involved in this effect using both human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and simian virus 40-transformed rat lung vascular endothelial cells (TRLECs) (38Jiang B.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p < 0.01 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. To evaluate whether eNOS phosphorylation is induced (Fig. 1 A) by raloxifene in TRLECs (upper panel) and HUVECs (lower panel), cultured cells were exposed to raloxifene for the indicated times. The increase in eNOS phosphorylation induced by 10−6mraloxifene reached a plateau at 5–15 min in TRLECs or at 15–30 min in HUVECs and rapidly declined thereafter. To determine whether this response involves rapid ER activation, the effect of concomitant treatment with the pure ER antagonist ICI182,780 was determined. ICI182,780 significantly decreased the induction of eNOS phosphorylation by raloxifene in TRLECs (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Moreover, the effects of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of gene transcription, were tested to rule out the influence of genomic events mediated by nuclear ERs (Fig. 1 B).

Sadekova et al. (30Sadekova S. Lamarche-Cane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have shown that when Swiss 3T3 cells are microinjected with murine CEACAM1-L, Rho GTPase activation is required for localization to cell-cell boundaries and co-localization with actin filaments. To gain more direct evidence of the interaction of CEACAM1-L with the cytoskeleton, we transfected murine MC38 cells with human CEACAM1-L and showed that actin and tropomyosin, among other proteins, were immunoprecipitated with CEACAM1 from MC38/CEACAM1-L cells stimulated with sodium pervanadate, a treatment that caused tyrosine phosphorylation of CEACAM1-L. In agreement with the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation, co-sedimentation studies showed that a GST-Cyto-L fusion protein does not co-sediment with F-actin. However, the GST-Cyto-S fusion protein does co-sediment with F-actin, especially if incubated with G-actin during polymerization to F-actin. Surface plasmon resonance binding studies with both the GST-Cyto-L and GST-Cyto-S fusion proteins showed direct binding to both G-actin and tropomyosin. Similar studies using synthetic peptides from the juxtamembrane region of the L-isoform cytoplasmic domain show binding to G-actin. From these studies, we conclude that G-actin and tropomyosin share at least one binding site in the juxtamembrane region of the long cytoplasmic domain. Calmodulin, which has been previously shown to bind to this region (27Blikstad I. Wikstrom T. Aurivillius M. Obrink O. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Edlund M. Blikstad I. Obrink B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1393-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), abrogates binding of both actin and tropomyosin, suggesting a regulatory function of this protein in the association of CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domains to the cytoskeleton. Taken together, these studies provide important clues to the differential function of the CEACAM1 cytoplasmic isoforms on the tumorigenicity of epithelial cells. Murine MC38 cells (methylcholanthrene-induced adenocarcinoma) were transfected with full-length human CEACAM1-L cDNA (6Hinoda Y. Neumaier M. Hefta S.A. Drzeniek Z. Wagener C. Shively L. Hefta L.J.F.

Ng S.-Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were negative prior to transfection and uniformly positive for CEACAM1-L after transfection and selection in G418. Transfected cells were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium with 10% fetal calf serum before each experiment. Cells (1 × 107 cells/ml) were treated with sodium pervanadate (10 mm H2O2 and 0.1 mmNa3VO4) for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were harvested by resuspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium without fetal calf serum. The murine anti-CD66 mAb T84.1, which recognizes an epitope in the extracellular NH2-terminal domain of human CEACAM1, was used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (32Wagener C. Clark B.R. Rickard K.J. Shively J.E. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2302-2307PubMed Google Scholar). The murine anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used for immunoblotting. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) was used for immunoblot detection. Unless mentioned, all proteins and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Purified rabbit muscle actin for BIAcore binding experiments was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc. and polymerized according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-cytofusion proteins containing the 74 or 14 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domains of CEACAM1-L or -S, respectively, were amplified from CEACAM1 cDNAs (6Hinoda Y. Neumaier M. Hefta S.A. Drzeniek Z. Wagener C. Shively L. Hefta L.J.F. Shively J.E. Paxton R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GST-Cyto fusion proteins were bacterially expressed and purified on glutathione-agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions. The size of the GST-Cyto fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight-MS. Synthetic peptides containing 14 amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane domain of the CEACAM1 long cytoplasmic domain or the complete CEACAM1 short cytoplasmic domain were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry with an amino-terminal biotin residue linked to the peptide via a Gly-Gly linker (Table I). The conditions for coupling biotin are briefly described as follows: biotin (122 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of Me2SO and 1 ml of dimethylformamide, 0.5 m 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, reacted with 0.5 ml of 1 m dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in dichloromethane for 1 h, filtered to remove the precipitated urea, and added to the peptide/solid support (0.1 mmol) containing a free amino group. Coupling was performed at 65 °C for 15 min, the resin washed with dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, dried, and cleaved in the usual manner.O-Benzyl-protected phosphoserine and phosphothreonine Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem and coupled to the peptide/solid support (0.1 mmol) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peptides were purified to >95% purity by reversed-phase HPLC on a Poros RP2 or Oligo R3 column and their masses confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer.Table ISynthetic peptides used in SPR experimentsPeptide sequenceCyto-L-(419–432)BGGFLHFGKTGRASDQRCyto-L-scrambledBGGRRKQAHFDFLSTGGCyto-L-T425E,S429EBGGFLHFGKEGRAEDQRCyto-L-T425A,S429ABGGFLHFGKAGRAADQRCyto-L-Thr(P)-425BGGFLHFGKT(P)GRASDQRCyto-L-Ser(P)-429BGGFLHFGKTGRAS(P)DQRCyto-L-Thr(P)-425, Ser(P)-429BGGFLHFGKT(P)GRAS(P)DQRCyto-S-(419–432)BGGFLHFGKTGSSGPLQCyto-S-T425E,S429EBGGFLHFGKEGSEGPLQCyto-S-T425A,S429ABGGFLHFGKAGSAGPLQCyto-S-Thr(P)-425, Ser(P)-429BGGFLHFGKT(P)GSS(P)GPLQPeptides were synthesized at the City of Hope as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All peptides start with the linker biotin-Gly-Gly (BGG) and continue through cytoplasmic residues 419–432 from either the long (Cyto-L) or short (Cyto-S) cytoplasmic domains.

Immunofluorescent staining of CEACAM1-L-transfected MC38 cells with antibodies and subsequent confocal microscopy experiments were performed according to Griffiths (34Griffiths G.M. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 1251-1257Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 104) were grown for 2 or 24 h at 37 °C on polylysine-coated glass coverslips, treated or untreated with pervanadate (0.1 mm, 15 min), and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.01% saponin (w/v), 0.25% gelatin (v/v), and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with Oregon Green-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and anti-CEACAM1 antibody (T84.1) followed by goat anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes). Imaging was performed on a Leica TCS-SP spectral confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation of CEACAM1-L from CEACAM1-L-transfected MC38 cells was performed using the anti-CD66 mAb T84.1 and protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described in the manufacturer's manual. Harvested cells were frozen overnight at −70 °C and extracted with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v)) by vortexing for 30 s at 4 °C. Preclearing of the cell lysates was performed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of mAb T84.66 (an isotype matched anti-CEA antibody), addition of 20 μl of protein G-agarose, and continued incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Following the preclearing, 4 μg of mAb T84.1 was added to the lysates for 2 h, followed by addition of 20 μl of protein G-agarose and incubation overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were recovered by incubation of the slurry for 1 h at 37 °C in solubilization buffer (9m urea, 4% Nonidet P-40, 2% ampholytes, pH 2–11, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) and subsequently stored at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8–16% Tris glycine gradient gels (NOVEX) as described previously (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by O'Farrell (36O'Farrell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Protean IIxi system. Samples were analyzed in the first dimension on a pH 2–11 gradient (Sigma ampholytes), followed by a separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in the second dimension. Polyacrylamide gels were silver-stained according to Shevchenko et al. (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Bio-Rad semidry blotting system and subsequently probed with the monoclonal antibodies T84.1 or 4G10 as described previously (38Chen C. Lin T.-T. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28181-28188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Visualization of immunocomplexes was performed by incubation of the membranes with Pierce SuperSignal CL/horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence solution and subsequent exposure of Kodak BIOMAX-MR autoradiography films. Silver-stained protein spots were excised from two-dimensional gels and in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega) as described by Shevchenko et al. (37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). All solutions were prepared fresh prior to the digestion using HPLC-grade chemicals (Sigma) and 0.2 μm of filtered MilliQ water. To ensure successful tryptic digestion, two additional washing steps involving dehydration of the gel pieces with 100% acetonitrile (MeCN) and rehydration using 100 mm NH4HCO3 were added before and after the reduction/alkylation step. Extracted peptides were concentrated in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To minimize introduction of contaminating proteins, all in-gel digestion steps were carried out in a laminar flow hood. LC/MS/MS analyses were performed using an Apple Macintosh controlled microcapillary HPLC system developed at the City of Hope (39Davis M.T. Lee T.D. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The standard gradient was from 2 to 92% Buffer B over 120 min using low TFA buffers (Buffer A, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid; Buffer B, 90% MeCN, 0.014% trifluoroacetic acid) at 50 p.s.i. Sample injection was performed at 1500 p.s.i. for 2 min followed by 10 min of washing at high pressure with Buffer A for desalting and removal of contaminating components. Prior to the injection of the preformed gradient, the system pressure was reduced to 50 p.s.i. over 1 min. The 150-μm inner diameter × 350-μm outer diameter on-line microspray needles were pulled using a laser-based micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) to a terminal inner diameter of ∼5 μm. The tip was packed at 4000 p.s.i. using a Zorbax, 5 μm, C18 packing as described previously by Davis et al. (39Davis M.T. Lee T.D. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The packed tip was connected to a 75-μm inner diameter × 350-μm outer diameter transfer line using a PEEK capillary Tee (Valco) and graphite ferrules. A 0.3-mm gold wire was introduced through the off-axis inlet to apply the electrospray potential. All mass spectral analyses were performed using a Finnigan LCQ ITMS equipped with a custom microspray interface. The LCQ was operated under Automatic Gain Control and enabled dynamic exclusion in the Navigator view. The automatic gain control targets are as follows: full MS, 5e + 007; MSn, 2e + 007, and Zoom MS, 2.55e + 006. The default maximum injection time was 500 ms with a single microscan count. Co-sedimentation assays were performed with the actin protein binding kit (Cytoskeleton) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, G-actin (2.7 μm) was polymerized in the presence or absence of the GST-Cyto fusion proteins (2–18 μm) for 60 min at 28 °C and pelleted at 150,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge using an SW50.1 rotor. The pellets and supernatant fractions were run on 12% polyacrylamide SDS gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands were scanned on a Bio-Rad GS710 calibrated densitometer, integrated, and expressed as GST-Cyto-S fusion protein/actin ratios. Experiments were repeated 3 times, and the results were plotted as GST-Cyto-S fusion protein/Actinversus [GST-Cyto-S fusion protein] (Hill plots). The K D was determined from the [GST-Cyto-S fusion protein] at half-maximal binding. Controls included α-actinin (positive binding), BSA (negative binding), and the GST only protein (negative binding). Biomolecular interaction analyses were carried out in HBS Buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Surfactant P20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) using the BIAcore® 2000 (BIAcore, Inc.). Depending on the experiment, CaCl2 at varying concentrations or 10 mm EDTA was added to the HBS. G-actin or tropomyosin were immobilized on a CM5-rg sensorchip (BIAcore) using the Amine Coupling Kit (BIAcore). The surface of the sensorchip was activated with 30 μl of 100 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, 400 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide using a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For immobilization of the protein, 1 μg of G-actin or 5 μg of tropomyosin in 100 μl of 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.0, were applied (flow rate, 5 μl/min). Subsequently, the sensorchip was deactivated with 30 μl of 1m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5 (flow rate, 5 μl/min), and conditioned with 10 μl of 100 mm HCl (flow rate, 5 μl/min). Binding studies and regeneration of the chip surface between injections were carried out at a flow rate of 20 μl/min unless otherwise noted. Samples were diluted in HBS Buffer immediately prior to injection. Between sample injections the surface was regenerated with 15 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl followed by three 30-s injections of HBS. Previous studies (30Sadekova S. Lamarche-Cane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) demonstrated that murine CEACAM1-L interacts with the cytoskeleton in a Rho kinase-dependent manner. This study suggested that the interaction was indirect, requiring CEACAM1-L modification or interaction through associated proteins. Possible modifications for CEACAM1-L such as phosphorylation on one or both of its tyrosines located in the cytoplasmic domain have been shown previously to affect its biological properties (18Turbide C. Kunath T. Daniels E. Beauchemin N. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2781-2788PubMed Google Scholar, 26Huber M. Izzi L. Grondin P. Turbide C. Houde C. Kunath T. Veillete A. Beauchemin N. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We explored these possibilities further using murine MC38 cells transfected with human CEACAM1-L. This murine colon cancer cell line, in contrast to most human colon cancer cell lines, does not express CEACAM1, and when transfected with the human CEACAM1-L cDNA and grown for 24 h on polylysine-coated glass slides, the cell line expressed high levels of CEACAM1-L that localize to cell-cell junctions with little evidence of co-localization with actin (red only, Fig. 1 C). Actin is found mainly at the periphery of the cells in stress fibers (green only). When these cells were treated with sodium pervanadate, a treatment which increases tyrosine phosphorylation by inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases (40Leis J.F. Kaplan N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 41Swarup G. Chen S. Garbers D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), CEACAM1-L remained at cell-cell boundaries and co-localized with actin (yellow, Fig. 1 D). These results show that pervanadate treatment causes CEACAM1-L to associate with the actin cytoskeleton in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In contradiction to our results, Sadekov et al. (30Sadekova S. Lamarche-Cane N. Li X. Beauchemin N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) showed extensive co-localization of murine CEACAM1-L with actin in murine CT-51 carcinoma cells; however, their cells exhibited a rounded morphology with extensive cortical actin. Indeed, when our transfected cells were grown for only 2 h on glass slides, they exhibited a rounded morphology, cortical actin, and co-localization of actin with CEACAM1-L at the cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1, A andB). Because this does not mimic the morphology of these cells when grown on plastic, we believe the results shown in Fig. 1,C and D, for cells grown on slides for 24 h are more relevant. Pervan"

However, the role of MTG8 is ambiguous. Here we found that MTG8 interacted with the regulatory subunit of type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA RIIalpha). The binding site of MTG8 was NHR3 domain, and that of RIIalpha was the N-terminus for interacting with PKA anchoring proteins (AKAPs). NHR3 contains a putative alpha-amphipathic helix which is characteristic in binding of AKAPs with RII. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that MTG8 and RIIalpha were overlapped at the centrosome-Golgi area in lymphocytes. These findings suggest that MTG8 may function as an AKAP at the centrosome-Golgi area in lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2026413110,"The mechanism by which all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) leads to a G(1) arrest of the cell cycle remains unclear. We show here that the decrease in D-type cyclin levels observed following ATRA treatment correlates with an increase in the rate of cyclin D1 ubiquitylation in both T-47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. However, MCF-7 cells are more resistant to ATRA than T-47D cells indicating that cyclin D1 degradation is not sufficient for ATRA-mediated arrest. We found a striking difference between these cells in that while ATRA induces an elevation in the cdk inhibitor p27 in T-47D cells, this is not observed in the ATRA-resistant MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATRA promotes the ubiquitylation of Skp2, an F-box protein that targets p27 for degradation. Moreover, overexpression of Skp2 in T-47D cells prevents accumulation of p27 and promotes resistance to ATRA. In addition, overexpression of cyclin D1 in T-47D cells also promotes ATRA resistance. We found that the mechanism of ATRA-induced ubiquitylation of cyclin D1 and Skp2 is independent of CUL-1 expression and that ATRA can rescue cyclin D1 degradation in the uterine cell line SK-UT-1, where D-type cyclins are stabilized due to a specific defect in proteolysis. These data suggest that ATRA induces a novel pathway of ubiquitylation and that the degradation of the F-box protein Skp2 is the mechanism underlying p27 accumulation and cyclin E-cdk2 inactivation following ATRA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2086170152,"Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the serine/threonine mTOR kinase, markedly inhibited both cell growth and apoptosis in human B-cell lines. Besides arresting cells in G1 by increasing p27kip1, rapamycin tripled the cellular level of the BCL-2 protein. The activity was dose-dependent and specific for the p27kip1 and BCL-2 proteins. Rapamycin did not affect bcl-2 mRNA although it increased cellular BCL-2 concentration by inhibiting phosphorylation, a mechanism initiating the decay process. To add new insight, we combined rapamycin treatment with treatment by taxol, which, by damaging microtubules, can phosphorylate BCL-2 and activate apoptosis. It was found that the mTOR kinase was activated in cells treated with taxol or with nocodazole although it was inhibited in cells pre-treated with rapamycin. BCL-2 phosphorylation, apoptosis and hyperdiploidy were also inhibited by rapamycin. In contrast, taxol-induced microtubule stabilization or metaphase synchronization were not inhibited by rapamycin. Taken together, these findings indicate that mTOR belongs to the enzymatic cascade that, starting from damaged microtubules, phosphorylates BCL-2. By regulating apoptosis, in addition to the control of a multitude of growth-related pathways, mTOR plays a nodal role in signaling G1 and G2-M events."
https://openalex.org/W2097166367,"Three major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the role of membrane-spanning proteins in establishing/maintaining membrane stability. These hypotheses ascribe the essential contribution of integral membrane proteins to (i) their ability to anchor the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer, (ii) their capacity to bind and stabilize membrane lipids, and (iii) their ability to influence and regulate local membrane curvature. In an effort to test these hypotheses in greater detail, we have modified both the membrane skeletal and lipid binding interactions of band 3 (the major membrane-spanning and skeletal binding protein of the human erythrocyte membrane) and have examined the impact of these modifications on erythrocyte membrane morphology, deformability, and stability. The desired changes in membrane skeletal and protein-lipid interactions were induced by 1) reaction of the cells with 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS), an inhibitor of band 3-mediated anion transport that dissociates band 3 into dimers (increasing its surface area in contact with lipid) and severs band 3 linkages to the membrane skeleton; 2) a fragment of ankyrin that ruptures the same ankyrin-band 3 bridge to the membrane skeleton, but drives the band 3 subunit equilibrium toward the tetramer (i.e. decreasing the band 3 surface area in contact with lipid); and 3) an antibody to the ankyrin-binding site on band 3 that promotes the same changes in band 3 skeletal and lipid interactions as the ankyrin fragment. We observed that although DIDS induced echinocytic morphological changes in the treated erythrocytes, it had little impact on either membrane deformability or stability. In contrast, resealing of either the ankyrin fragment or anti-band 3 IgG into erythrocytes caused spontaneous membrane fragmentation and loss of deformability/stability. Because these and other new observations cannot all be reconciled with any single hypothesis on membrane stability, we suggest that more than one hypothesis may be operative and provide an explanation of how each might individually contribute to net membrane stability.

In this representation, the outer component is composed of a lipid bilayer traversed by multiple transport and structural proteins, predominantly the glycophorins and band 3. In contrast, the inner component consists of a two-dimensional scaffold of interconnecting skeletal proteins, primarily spectrin, protein 4.1R, and actin. Connections between the two components occur at regular intervals and are mainly established by bridging proteins. Prominent among the bridging proteins are ankyrin, which links the β-subunit of spectrin to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, and protein 4.1R, which connects a spectrin-protein 4.1R-actin junctional complex to the cytoplasmic tail of glycophorin C (1Davis L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17252-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they are not generally considered to be dominant contributors to membrane structural and mechanical properties. Despite general agreement that the currently available models provide a broad mechanistic description of membrane shape and deformability, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the structural basis for membrane mechanical properties. In fact, a major source of uncertainty has centered on the roles of integral membrane proteins in maintaining cell shape and membrane stability. Indeed, three well articulated hypotheses are currently being discussed. In the first hypothesis, membrane-spanning polypeptides such as band 3 and glycophorin C are thought to serve primarily to anchor the protein skeleton to the lipid bilayer, thereby coupling the “stretched spring-and-girder” properties of the skeleton with the non-compressible phospholipid envelope (12Low P.S. Willardson B.M. Mohandas N. Rossi M. Shohet S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1581-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this scenario, periodic bridges between the two layers not only force their shared morphology, but also require their stabilities to be linked via redistribution of any stress imposed on one layer into the coupled layer. A second hypothesis explaining the role of integral membrane proteins in maintaining membrane morphology/stability attributes their contribution to their ability to regulate membrane curvature (13Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Kennedy S.P. Cianci C.D. Sinard J.H. Weed S.A. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar). Due to shape and lipid packing considerations, membrane-spanning proteins are proposed to naturally impose a convex or concave bending on the surrounding lipid surface. When multiple membrane-spanning proteins with similar effects on membrane curvature are permitted to cluster, the cumulative bending is thought to ultimately drive membrane vesiculation and loss of surface area. Bridges between the membrane-spanning proteins and the spectrin skeleton are important in this model to prevent the unwanted aggregation of similarly shaped membrane proteins and the consequent vesiculation. In the third hypothesis, membrane-spanning proteins are pictured primarily as “lipid anchors” that bind and stabilize surrounding lipids and thereby prevent their spontaneous fragmentation/vesiculation (14Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. Liu S.-C. Hanspal M. John K.H. Gonzalez J.M. Brugnara C. Gwynn G. Mohandas N. Alper S. Orkin S.H. Lux S.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Evenly spaced connections to the membrane skeleton are considered important in this hypothesis to assure that no membrane regions become devoid of these stabilizing lipid anchors. Although numerous mutations/perturbations have been shown to alter erythrocyte membrane stability and morphology, very few distinguish among the above three hypotheses, and those that appear to favor one hypothesis can generally be challenged by a convincing argument supporting an opposing hypothesis. For example, the claim that integral proteins function solely to couple the lipid bilayer to a more stable membrane skeleton is readily rebutted by observations showing reduced mechanical stability in membranes depleted of freely diffusing but not skeletally attached band 3 (15Jarolim P. Rubin H.L. Liu S.-C. Cho M.R. Brabec V. Derick L.H. Yi S.J. Saad S.T.O. Alper S. Brugnara C. Golan D.E. Palek J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, in cases of hereditary spherocytosis due to a deficiency in band 3, the content of band 3 attached to the spectrin-actin skeleton is apparently normal, but the population of freely diffusing band 3 molecules is dramatically reduced. Because such erythrocytes spontaneously lose lipid bilayer until their shapes become spherical, it logically follows that the pool of free band 3 is critical to membrane morphology/stability. A contrasting conclusion is, however, suggested upon comparison of the impacts of deficiencies of various membrane-spanning proteins on membrane morphology/stability. Thus, when all 106 copies of band 3 are missing from the erythrocyte membrane (14Peters L.L. Shivdasani R.A. Liu S.-C. Hanspal M. John K.H. Gonzalez J.M. Brugnara C. Gwynn G. Mohandas N. Alper S.

Genet. 1996; 14: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the membrane becomes very unstable and vesiculates in response to mechanical stress. Similarly, deletion of all 2 × 105copies of glycophorin C leads to a related, albeit much less severe instability and elliptocytic morphology (18Reid M. Chasis J. Mohandas N. Blood. 1987; 69: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the absence of all 106 copies of glycophorin A results in membranes with essentially normal morphology/stability (19Tanner M.J. Anstee D.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). If integral proteins functioned primarily to bind and/or organize lipid, then cogent arguments must be articulated to explain why deletion of the two skeletal anchoring membrane-spanning proteins (i.e. band 3 and glycophorin C) has an impact on cell morphology/stability, whereas deletion of a non-anchoring membrane-spanning protein (i.e.glycophorin A) is phenotypically silent. Clearly, much remains to be resolved before a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic basis of membrane morphology/stability can be achieved. In this study, we have exploited our ability to modulate the interaction of band 3 with both the membrane skeleton and its surrounding lipids to clarify the contribution of band 3 to erythrocyte membrane stability and morphology. As discussed below, we find evidence for contributions from more than one of the above described mechanisms to the regulation of the mechanical properties of the erythrocyte membrane. We further show that these different mechanisms can compensate for each other's contributions, thereby reducing the impact of certain deleterious perturbations on membrane stability. Human blood was drawn from healthy volunteers and used within 1 week of donation. DIDS,1 EMA, and Affi-Gel 10 were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Sephacryl S-200 HR andn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. C12E8 (octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether) was obtained from Nikko Chemical Co.125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was from ICN. Triton X-100 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Stractan was a kind gift of Martin Sorrette. All other reagents were obtained from major suppliers and were of the highest purity available. A 45.6-kDa fragment of ankyrin containing the binding site for band 3 (residues 403–827) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (the expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. Vann Bennett) and purified as described by Davis and Bennett (1Davis L. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein was concentrated and stored at 4 °C until used. The protein was found to remain stable and functional up to 1 year in high ionic strength gel filtration buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 msodium bromide, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). Just prior to use, however, the buffer was changed to isotonic phosphate buffer because the ankyrin fragment was stable for only 7 days in low ionic strength solutions. Ankyrin fragment concentration was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm (21Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar) using an experimentally determined ε = 15,816 m−1 cm−1 for the 45.6-kDa protein, which calculates to 0.347 ml mg−1cm−1. Generation of antibodies against an ankyrin-binding region of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (residues 190–203, PQHSSLETQLFCGQ) was carried out as described previously by Willardson et al. (22Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the antibodies from the defibrinated rabbit antiserum was achieved by precipitation with cold 40% NH4SO4, pH 7.5. After resolubilizing in PBS, the antibody solution was dialyzed first against PBS and then against 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.5. The antibodies were loaded onto an affinity column prepared by coupling the above peptide to Bio-Rad Affi-Gel 10 beads, eluted with 1.0 mpropionic acid, and immediately brought to neutral pH with NH4OH. The purified antibodies were concentrated and dialyzed against PBS. Because the antibodies were stable for only 3 days in low ionic strength buffers, the buffer was changed to lysis buffer by ultrafiltration immediately prior to use. Washed red cells (50% hematocrit) were incubated with 50 μm DIDS for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Cells were washed four times with 5 volumes of the same buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin to remove unreacted DIDS and then three times without the serum albumin. Under these conditions, >95% of the DIDS resides on band 3 (23Jennings M.L. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 498-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).Washed red cells (20% hematocrit) were incubated with 0.1 μm EMA for 1 h at 25 °C in 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Cells were washed four times with 5 volumes of the same buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin to remove unreacted EMA and then three times without the serum albumin. Under these conditions, >80% of the EMA resides on band 3 (24Nigg E.A. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3457-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Golan D.E. Brown C.S. Cianci C.M.L. Furlong S.T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were digested with 1 mg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 1 h to cleave band 3 into its non-glycosylated 65,000-Da and heterogeneously glycosylated 35,000-Da fragments. This cleavage does not impact on anion transport or membrane skeletal interactions (23Jennings M.L. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 498-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but allows sharper resolution of the 65,000-Da fragment of band 3 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To evaluate the amount of band 3 retained in the membrane skeletons, 1 ml of packed DIDS-treated, untreated, or resealed spherocytic cells that had been separated from vesiculated membrane components was treated with 1 ml of 4% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA, and 80 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The resulting membrane skeletal extract was loaded onto a 35% sucrose cushion, and the sample was centrifuged at 85,500 × g for 90 min to separate the solubilized membrane components from the pelleted membrane skeletons. The tubes were inverted to allow the supernatant to drain, and the pellet was solubilized in SDS buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Band 3 content in the membrane skeletons was easily quantitated by densitometric analysis of the well defined 65,000-Da fragment. Band 3 association with the membrane skeleton in intact membranes was evaluated using the micropipette aspiration technique of Evans et al. (27Evans E. Mohandas N. Leung A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) coupled with fluorescence imaging (28Discher D.E. Mohandas N. Evans E.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 29Discher D.E. Mohandas N. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1680-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this method, band 3 was fluorescently labeled in intact cells with 0.1 μm EMA or 50 μm DIDS prior to resealing with the ankyrin fragment, anti-band 3 IgG, or ovalbumin (as a non-interacting control). After varying periods of incubation at 37 °C, the redistribution of band 3 relative to lipids and the membrane skeletal component actin was evaluated following aspiration of part of the membrane into a 1–1.2-μm diameter micropipette. As described elsewhere (27Evans E. Mohandas N. Leung A. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Discher D.E. Mohandas N. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1680-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the aspirated membrane surface that entered the pipette formed a cylindrical projection with a hemispherical cap at the tip, whereas the remaining red cell formed a sphere outside of the pipette. The distribution of band 3 along the projection, as determined by the fluorescence of EMA or DIDS, was compared with the distribution of a freely diffusing lipid probe (fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine) and a marker of the membrane skeleton (phalloidin-labeled actin). Fluorescence intensity was quantified using a Nikon Diaphot microscope with a liquid nitrogen-cooled camera (CH-260, Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) as described by Hiraoka et al. (30Hiraoka Y. Sedat J.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1987; 238: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The means ± S.D. of the band 3 density gradients were derived from multiple experiments and several samplings of the labeled cells. Membrane deformability and stability were measured using an ektacytometer (31Bessis M. Mohandas N. Blood Cells. 1975; 1: 307-313Google Scholar, 32Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Shohet S.B. Semin. Hematol. 1983; 20: 225-242PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cells were suspended in PBS containing 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone or 25% dextran (cell deformability analysis), and resealed ghosts were suspended in PBS containing 35% dextran (membrane mechanical stability analysis) or in PBS containing 40% stractan (membrane deformability analysis) and deformed in a Couette viscometer, in which the outer cylinder is spun to produce a uniform shear stress. For deformability analyses, erythrocytes were subjected to increasing shear stresses in a laminar flow field, which caused the discoid cells to deform into ellipsoids. For stability analyses, resealed erythrocyte membranes were subjected to a constant higher shear stress, which caused fragmentation of the cells, generating small spherical vesicles. A laser beam was diffracted by the cells in the sample, and the diffraction pattern was analyzed to obtain quantitative information about the deformation of the sheared cells. Quantitation of the ellipticity of the pattern was graphically recorded as the deformability index as a function of applied shear stress for deformability measurements and as a function of time for membrane mechanical stability measurements. To measure deformability and mechanical stability, the cells were subjected to shear stresses of 0–125 and 575 dynes/cm2, respectively, over a 3-min period. Freshly drawn erythrocytes were washed three times with PBS, lysed in cold hypotonic buffer (7.5 mm NaH2PO4 and 1 mmMgATP, pH 7.4) at 20% hematocrit, and then incubated on ice for 30 min. Protein solutions containing either the ankyrin fragment or anti-band 3 IgG were aliquoted into a 150-μl total volume and also incubated on ice for 30 min to ensure that all samples were equilibrated at 0 °C. Then, 30 μl of packed leaky ghosts were added to the desired protein solution, gently agitated to promote equilibration of the protein into the cells, and allowed to sit for 1 h. At that time, 18.2 μl of a 10× stock of PBS were added and gently mixed, and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to reseal the membranes. As resealing of the ankyrin fragment or anti-band 3 antibody into the fresh erythrocytes led to a progressive loss of membrane surface, the residual cells were separated from the membrane vesicles by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Under these conditions, the larger spherocytic and stomatocytic cells pelleted to the bottom of the centrifuge tube, and the vesicles remained in the supernatant. Quantitation of the amount of the 45.6-kDa ankyrin fragment associated with the erythrocyte membranes following lysis and resealing was determined by comparing the amount of 125I-ankyrin fragment and 125I-ovalbumin (both labeled with125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent) (34Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) retained on the membranes of the resealed cells. After removal of unbound protein, the resealed cells were relysed and washed three times with ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The total protein content of the washed membranes was then determined, and the amount of specifically bound protein was evaluated using a γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). A similar strategy was employed for the fluorescence-imaged microdeformation studies, except that a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled ankyrin fragment was introduced during the resealing step. To determine whether the 45.6-kDa ankyrin fragment could displace whole ankyrin from red cell membranes, 45.6-kDa ankyrin was incubated at 100-fold molar excess with inside-out vesicles (spectrin- and actin-depleted membrane vesicles) at 25 °C for 24 h. Briefly, erythrocytes were lysed with 5 mmsodium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4; and spectrin and actin were removed by incubating the membranes in a 10-volume excess of 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 20 min. The resulting inside-out vesicles were washed and incubated with the added protein in 5% sucrose, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mmboric acid, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol adjusted to pH 7.8 or in 5 mmsodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4. The unbound protein was separated from the inside-out vesicles by pelleting the inside-out vesicles through 1 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion at 19,000 × g for 15 min. Quantitation of the residual bound ankyrin was accomplished by densitometry of the pellet following its separation in the 3.5–8% electrophoretic gel system of Fairbank et al. (35Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). DIDS is an inhibitor of anion transport that reacts with lysine 539 in the membrane-spanning domain of band 3 (23Jennings M.L. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 498-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DIDS binding to band 3 has been shown to induce loss of all low affinity and roughly half of all high affinity ankyrin-binding sites on the membrane (36Van Dort H.M. Moriyama R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14819-14826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and it thereby reduces band 3 retention in membrane skeletons prepared directly from DIDS-labeled cells by ∼50% (36Van Dort H.M. Moriyama R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14819-14826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DIDS treatment therefore constitutes a noninvasive method by which the major bilayer-skeleton bridge can be severed and its impact on membrane stability examined. Analysis of the DIDS-labeled cells employed in this study revealed a reduction in the skeletally linked band 3 content of ∼45% within 1 h of DIDS labeling in four separate skeleton preparations (data not shown). Thus, extraction of the modified cells directly in 2% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside yielded spectrin-actin skeletons with only approximately on-half of their normal band 3 content. Similar methods of analysis demonstrated that resealing the 45.6-kDa ankyrin fragment (8.8 μm) into erythrocytes caused a similar (∼45%) loss of band 3 from the corresponding n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside-extracted skeletons. Dissociation of band 3 from the membrane skeleton by the 45.6-kDa ankyrin fragment was expected because it competes with endogenous ankyrin for band 3 binding, but lacks the complementary domain for spectrin binding (37Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the band 3 linkage to the membrane skeleton was at least partially disrupted by both DIDS derivatization and ankyrin fragment incorporation, the distribution of band 3 relative to both the membrane skeleton and a fluid lipid marker was quantitated during aspiration of a region of the erythrocyte membrane into a 1–1.2-μm diameter micropipette. Band 3 distribution in DIDS-labeled cells could be directly monitored because DIDS is fluorescent. However, band 3 distribution in both unmodified and ankyrin fragment-containing cells was determined using EMA-labeled cells (24Nigg E.A. Cherry R.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3457-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Golan D.E. Brown C.S. Cianci C.M.L. Furlong S.T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). EMA fluorescently labels band 3 without disrupting its interactions with other proteins (data not shown). Because unmodified band 3 is composed of both skeletally associated and freely diffusing components, it would be expected to exhibit a redistribution pattern that is intermediate between those of the fluid-phase lipid marker and the immobile membrane skeleton. As anticipated, EMA-labeled band 3 in control cells did indeed migrate with a density gradient of 0.12, which is intermediate between that of skeletally attached phalloidin-labeled actin (0.15) and freely diffusing lipid (0.0) (Table I). In contrast, when band 3 was labeled with DIDS, the density gradient was more gradual, as visualized by the fluorescence intensity profile (Fig. 1) and as quantitated in the derived density gradient (Table I). These data imply that DIDS-labeled band 3 associates less with the membrane skeleton compared with EMA-labeled band 3. This result is consistent with the reduced retention of DIDS-labeled band 3 in detergent-extracted membrane skeletons.Table IEffect of different variables on the concentration gradient of band 3 and other membrane components along a membrane projection aspirated into a micropipetteFluorescent labelTimeMicropipette density gradienthEMA-labeled band 3 (control)1–120.12 ± 0.02DIDS-labeled band 310.07 ± 0.01DIDS-labeled band 3120.06 ± 0.02EMA-labeled band 3 + 9 μm ankyrin fragment1–20.10 ± 0.02EMA-labeled band 3 + 17.5 μm ankyrin fragment1–20.00 ± 0.01Rhodamine/phalloidin-labeled actin0.15 ± 0.02Fluorescein-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine0.00 Open table in a new tab Incorporation of the 45.6-kDa ankyrin fragment into EMA-labeled cells caused a concentration-dependent release of band 3 from membrane skeletal constraints (Fig. 2 and Table I).

The samples included thylakoid membranes, salt-washed Triton X-100-prepared membrane fragments, and purified core complexes from spinach and cyanobacteria. For each sample type, two kinetically distinct isotopic exchange rates could be resolved, indicating that the biphasic exchange behavior for the substrate water is inherent to the O2-evolving catalytic site in the S3 state. However, the fast phase of exchange became somewhat slower (by a factor of ∼2) in NaCl-washed membrane fragments and core complexes from spinach in which the 16- and 23-kDa extrinsic proteins have been removed, compared with the corresponding rate for the intact samples. For CaCl2-washed membrane fragments in which the 33-kDa manganese stabilizing protein (MSP) has also been removed, the fast phase of exchange slowed down even further (by a factor of ∼3). Interestingly, the slow phase of exchange was little affected in the samples from spinach. For core complexes prepared fromSynechocystis PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongatus, the fast and slow exchange rates were variously affected. Nevertheless, within the experimental error, nearly the same exchange rates were measured for thylakoid samples made from wild type and an MSP-lacking mutant of Synechocystis PCC 6803. This result could indicate that the MSP has a slightly different function in eukaryotic organisms compared with prokaryotic organisms. In all samples, however, the differences in the exchange rates are relatively small. Such small differences are unlikely to arise from major changes in the metal-ligand structure at the catalytic site. Rather, the observed differences may reflect subtle long range effects in which the exchange reaction coordinates become slightly altered.

Photobiol. 1969; 10: 309-329Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The period four phenomenon is now universally interpreted in terms of the S-state model, in which the catalytic site cycles through five intermediary Sn states (n = 0–4) (2Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 11: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar). Beginning in S0 and traversing to S4, each Sn state is driven forward by a single quantum event at the PSII reaction center. Upon reaching the S4 state (which may be equivalent to S3YZ⋅) O2is released, S0 is regenerated, and the cycle begins anew. The catalytic site for water oxidation involves an inorganic metal cluster consisting of four manganese ions, one Ca2+ ion, possibly one Cl− ion, and the redox-active Tyr-161 residue of the D1 reaction center polypeptide (YZ) (3Britt D.R.

Ligands to the manganese cluster are likely to be derived mostly from the D1 polypeptide, though there are at least 30 other polypeptides involved in the holoenzyme (7Bricker T.M. Ghanotakis D.F. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 113-136Google Scholar, 8Debus R.J. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 2000; 37: 657-711PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional crystal structure of the PSII complex has been determined to a resolution of 3.8 Å and has provided a structural location for the Mn4Ca1ClX cluster within the complex (9Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Seanger W. Orth P. Nature. 2000; 409: 739-743Crossref Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Many of the extra polypeptides in PSII function by forming binding sites for the antenna pigments, but some are important for the assembly of the reaction center and the O2-evolving subdomain. Deletion mutagenesis and detergent solubilization have been used to selectively remove peripheral polypeptides and to make various subcomplexes of PSII. These preparations, collectively termed PSII core complexes, exhibit higher specific rates of O2 evolution because of the smaller antenna size. In higher plants, three extrinsic proteins of 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa molecular mass are peripherally associated with the active PSII core and are involved in regulating the O2-evolving activity (10Seidler A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1277: 35-60Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The 16- and 23-kDa extrinsic proteins (the psbP andpsbQ gene products, respectively) can be reversibly dissociated from the PSII complex under high ionic strength conditions (e.g. 1 m NaCl). The psbP andpsbQ gene products are not present in cyanobacteria or red algae; instead, these organisms contain an extrinsic 9–12-kDa protein and a cytochrome-containing component calledc 550 (the psbU and psbV gene products, respectively) (11Shen R.-J. Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Enami I. Murayama H. Ohta H. Kamo M. Nakazato K. Shen J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Shen J.-R. Qian M. Inoue Y. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1551-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The other major extrinsic polypeptide, the 33-kDa protein (the psbO gene product), appears to be universally conserved within cyanobacteria, higher plants, and algae. In PSII samples from spinach, the 33-kDa extrinsic protein can be removed by salt washing in 1 mCaCl2. Under these conditions, two of the functional manganese ions become destabilized and are released from the catalytic site unless the samples are maintained in high concentrations of Cl− (14Ono T-A. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 281-286Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Kuwabara T. Miyao M. Murata T. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 283-289Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The 33-kDa extrinsic protein is thus often referred to as the manganese-stabilizing protein, or MSP. Despite the title, however, the MSP does not appear to be directly involved in the ligation of the manganese cluster, as respectable rates of O2 evolution can be achieved in virtual absence of the MSP (16Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similarly, the MSP can be removed by genetic deletion in the prokaryotic cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. This genetic deletion results in a strain (ΔpsbO) that can evolve O2 (17Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Mayes S.R. Cook K.M. Self S.J. Zhang Z. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 1-12Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Philbrick J.B. Diner B.A. Zilinskas B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13370-13376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, genetic deletion of the MSP in the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas results in an obligatory heterotroph (20Mayfield S.P. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, there appears to be some difference in the absolute requirement of the MSP for O2 evolution between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this respect, it is important to note that the O2 release kinetics of the ΔpsbO mutant in Synechocystis PCC 6803 is slower than in the wild type, and the O2 flash pattern is heavily damped (21Burnap R. Shen J.R. Jursinic P.A. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Burnap R.L. Qian M. Pierce C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Accompanying the slower O2 release is a marked slowing down of the electron-transfer step during the S3-[S4]-S0 transition (23Razeghifard M.R. Wydrzynski T. Pace R.J. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14474-14478Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and an increased relative quantum yield of photoactivation (22Burnap R.L. Qian M. Pierce C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, slower O2 release kinetics and increased damping are also observed in PSII core preparations made from spinach, which retain the MSP yet lack the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides (24van Leeuwen P.J. Nieveen M.C. Gast P. Dekker J.P. van Gorkom H.J. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Haumann M. Bögershausen O. Cherepanov D. Ahlbrink R. Junge W. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 51: 193-208Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results appear to show that the extrinsic polypeptides function in general to optimize the O2-evolving activity. In the present communication, we have examined the 18O exchange properties of the substrate water in various PSII-containing preparations to consider the influence of the peripheral polypeptides on substrate binding to the catalytic site for O2evolution. Earlier work on spinach thylakoid samples has shown that the two substrate water molecules exchange rapidly in the S3state (26Messinger J. Badger T. Wydrzynski T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) with differing exchange rates and activation energies (27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion that the two substrate water molecules are bound at different chemical sites in the S3state of PSII. Here, we have extended the 18O exchange measurements to PSII-enriched membrane fragments containing a varying complement of extrinsic polypeptides, PSII core samples from spinach, thylakoid samples from ΔpsbO, wild-type strains of Synechocystis PCC 6803, and PSII core samples fromSynechococcus elongatus and Synechocystis PCC 6803. Spinach thylakoid membranes were prepared from hydroponically grown plants by grinding the leaves in 30 mm MES (pH 6.5), 350 mm sorbitol, 15 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 in a Waring blender for 10 s. The homogenate was then filtered through two layers of gauze and two layers of nylon cloth (20-μm mesh size) and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. The pellet containing the thylakoid membranes was resuspended in a medium containing 30 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and washed once before being frozen as small beads in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Rates of O2 evolution were ∼240 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1 in the presence of 500 μm2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and potassium ferricyanide (FeCN). Spinach PSII-enriched membrane fragments were prepared from fresh thylakoids using 5% Triton X-100 (28Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The PSII membrane fragments (BBYs) were resuspended in a final buffer medium of 30 mmHEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and stored as small beads at −80 °C. Rates of O2 evolution were ∼670 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1 in the presence of 500 μm DCBQ and FeCN. Spinach PSII-enriched membrane fragments depleted of the extrinsic polypeptides were prepared by suspending PSII-enriched membranes in either 1 m NaCl (29Åkerlund H.-E. Jansson C. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 1-10Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Kuwabara T. Murata N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1983; 24: 741-747Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or 1 mCaCl2 (31Ono T-A. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 255-259Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar) at 1 mg Chl ml−1. The samples were then incubated on ice in the dark for 30 min. At 10-min intervals the sample was passed twice through a Teflon homogenizer. After this treatment, the samples were centrifuged at 40,000 ×g and incubated for a second 30-min treatment in either 1 m NaCl or 1 m CaCl2, respectively. The samples were finally centrifuged and washed twice in 30 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 before being stored as small beads at −80 °C. Rates of O2evolution were ∼174 and ∼57 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1 in the NaCl- and CaCl2-washed BBY membranes in the presence of 500 μm DCBQ and FeCN. Spinach PSII core complexes were prepared from the PSII-enriched membrane fragments using 1.5%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DM) (32van Leeuwen P.J. Nieveen M.C. van de Meent E.J. Dekker J.P. van Gorkom H.J. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 28: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and purified on a POROS HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystems) under a linear flow of 1800 cm h−1 by elution with a linear gradient of 0–50 mm MgSO4. The PSII core complexes were then dialyzed in a medium consisting of 20 mmbis-tris (pH 6.5), 400 mm sucrose, 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% (w/v) β-dm and concentrated with an Amicon concentration cell. The core samples were stored as small beads at −80 °C. Rates of O2 evolution were about ∼1420 μmol of O2(mg of Chl)−1 h−1 in the presence of 500 μm DCBQ and FeCN. Synechocystis thylakoid membranes were isolated from a glucose- tolerant strain of Synechocystis PCC 6803 (subsequently referred to as the wild type) and a derivative strain with the MSP deleted (i.e. the ΔpsbO strain). Construction and characterization of the ΔpsbO strain has been described earlier (17Burnap R.L. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Burnap R. Shen J.R. Jursinic P.A. Inoue Y. Sherman L.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7404-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were maintained using established procedures (33Williams J.G.K. Packer L. Glazer A.N. Methods in Enzymology: Cyanobacteria. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1988: 766-778Google Scholar) and were grown (3-liter batches) in the presence of 5 mm glucose under ∼80 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 light and constant aeration. Cells during the late logarithmic phase of growth were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and then soaked for 1 h in HMCS medium (50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 m sucrose). The cells were then broken in a bead beater apparatus (Biospec Products) at ice temperatures using 0.1-mm glass beads. The glass beads and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 12 min at 8000 ×g, and the supernatant was then centrifuged twice for 1 h each at 175,000 × g to collect the thylakoid membranes. Rates of O2 evolution were ∼510 and ∼190 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1 in the wild type and ΔpsbO thylakoid membranes in the presence of 500 μm DCBQ and FeCN. Synechocystis PSII core complexes were prepared from the glucose-tolerant, HT-3A histidine-tagged strain ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 (34Tang X.-S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4594-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Cells were grown photoheterotrophically, broken in a prechilled bead beater, and the thylakoid membranes were collected by centrifugation as described above. Solubilization of the thylakoid membranes was achieved by the dropwise addition of 1% β-DM from a freshly made 10% stock solution. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 36,000 × g for 20 min, and the solubilized material was gravity fed onto 20 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm MES (pH 6.0), 400 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm CaCl2, and 0.04% β-DM. The column was washed until the eluent was pale green in color (∼5-column volumes) and the PSII core sample was eluted using 100 mm imidazole. The PSII-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at −80 °C. Rates of O2 evolution were ∼1200 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1h−1 in the presence of 500 μm DCBQ and FeCN. S. elongatus PSII core complexes were prepared using detergent solubilization, Toyopearl 650 ion exchange purification, and polyethylene glycol precipitation (36Zouni A. Luneberg C. Fromme P. Schubert W.D. Saenger W. Witt H. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 925-928Google Scholar, 37Zouni A. Jordan R. Schlodder E. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sample was kindly provided to us by Professor H. T. Witt and Dr. A. Zouni of the Technical University of Berlin. Isotopic determination of the O2 produced by the sample was measured atm/e = 34 with an in-line mass spectrometer (VG, Winsford, United Kingdom) as described earlier (26Messinger J. Badger T. Wydrzynski T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A stirred cuvette was connected to the mass spectrometer via a dry ice/ethanol ice bath, and injection of H218O was achieved with a solenoid-activated Hamilton CR-200 syringe. Samples were illuminated by saturating light flashes obtained from a xenon flash lamp (EG&G FX193, 4 μF at 1 kV capacitor; EG & G, Salem, MA) through a fiber optic situated directly before the sample chamber. The flash and injection sequence was controlled via a computer, and accurate timing intervals were established from a digital oscilloscope. Isotopic exchange rates were measured for the S3 state at 10 °C at m/e = 34. Samples were preflashed at room temperature to enrich the S1 population and then loaded into the cuvette in the dark and degassed for 20 min. The injection/flash protocol that was used has been described earlier (27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The O2 background introduced into the sample during the injection of labeled water was subtracted from the photochemically generated O2 by performing a preinjection under the same conditions but without illumination. To reduce the size of the O2 background, small quantities of glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase were added to the labeled water prior to injection without interference to photosynthetically generated O2. The signal amplitudes for the third flash (Y3) less the contribution from injection were normalized to the sum of the four to seven flashes, in Equation 1, Y3/∑n=47YnEquation 1 to account for small variations in the sample concentration between measurements. The Y3 value at each exchange time was then further normalized to the value obtained after complete exchange (i.e. 10 s). The data at fast exchange times were then corrected for the 175 s−1 injection response of the chamber as described earlier (27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The level of 18O enrichment in the chamber was determined from the ratio of isotopically labeled CO2 peaks at m/e = 44, 46, and 48 according to the relation (1−ε)2:2(1−ε)ε:ε2 = 100% and was typically ε = 12 ± 0.2%. The plots of the corrected yields, YC versusΔt at m/e = 34, were biphasic and were analyzed as the sum of two exponential functions. Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to fit the data according to Equation 2. 34YC=0.57[1−exp(−34k2×t)]+0.43[1−exp(−34k1×t)]Equation 2 The two kinetic phases, k 1 andk 2, are disproportionate because of the kinetic effect on the m/e = 34 equilibrium enrichment (26Messinger J. Badger T. Wydrzynski T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This arises because the fast phase of exchange is complete at ε = 12.0% enrichment before the18O16O equilibrium of 21.12% is achieved. The kinetics of the fast phase, k 2, therefore dictate a proportionately greater contribution to the normalized yield,i.e. 12.0/21.12 ≅ 57%. This empirical approach yields an accurate fit to the m/e = 34 data for a variety of temperatures (27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and S states (38Hillier W. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4399-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The results from the 18O exchange measurements of the different spinach samples in the S3 state are shown in Fig. 1. The data atm/e = 34 for the thylakoid samples is given in Fig. 1 A and reveal two distinct kinetic phases, as was observed earlier (26Messinger J. Badger T. Wydrzynski T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 38Hillier W. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4399-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A kinetic fit to the data according to Eq. 1 yields a rate constant of 1.8 ± 0.2 s−1 for the slow phase (34 k 1) and 38.0 ± 2.0 s−1 for the fast phase (34 k 2) (Table I). The two kinetic phases reflect the independent 18O exchange behavior of the two substrate water molecules and indicate separate binding sites at the catalytic site in the S3 state (27Hillier W. Messinger J. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16908-16914Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Table IRate constants for 18O exchange in the S3 state of different PSII samples at 10 °CSample34 k 1(s−1)34 k 2 (s−1)Thylakoid membranes (spinach)1-aBuffer solution medium: 30 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl2.1.8 ± 0.238.0 ± 2.0PSII membrane fragments (spinach)1-aBuffer solution medium: 30 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl2.2.1 ± 0.137.3 ± 1.6 minus 16- and 23-kDa extrinsics1-aBuffer solution medium: 30 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl2.1.7 ± 0.322.7 ± 2.0 minus 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa extrinsics1-bBuffer solution medium: same as footnote a with 100 mm CaCl2.1.6 ± 0.79.7 ± 2.6PSII core particles (spinach)1-cBuffer solution medium: 20 mm bis-tris (pH 6.5), 400 mm sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d maltoside.1.1 ± 0.418.0 ± 3.9PSII core particles (Synechococcus)1-cBuffer solution medium: 20 mm bis-tris (pH 6.5), 400 mm sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d maltoside.0.5 ± 0.134.6 ± 2.3PSII core particles (Synechocystis)1-cBuffer solution medium: 20 mm bis-tris (pH 6.5), 400 mm sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d maltoside.0.9 ± 0.215.2 ± 2.4Thylakoid membranes (Synechocystis wild type)1-d50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 1 mm sucrose, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2.3.8 ± 1.325.9 ± 6.7Thylakoid membranes (SynechocystisΔpsbO)1-d50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 1 mm sucrose, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2.4.5 ± 3.323.9 ± 12.31-a Buffer solution medium: 30 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 400 mm sucrose, 15 mm NaCl2.1-b Buffer solution medium: same as footnote a with 100 mm CaCl2.1-c Buffer solution medium: 20 mm bis-tris (pH 6.5), 400 mm sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d maltoside.1-d 50 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 1 mm sucrose, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2. Open table in a new tab Because most functional studies of PSII are carried out on detergent-prepared BBY samples, it is important to know whether the substrate exchange reactions are altered by the detergent treatment. Fig. 1 B shows the 18O exchange measurements for the BBY membrane fragments. The data at m/e= 34 remains strongly biphasic, with rate constants of 2.1 ± 0.1 and 37.3 ± 1.6 s−1 for34 k 1 and34 k 2, respectively (Table I). Clearly, the treatment of thylakoid membranes with 5% Triton X-100 detergent and the subfractionation into PSII-enriched membrane fragments has little effect on the substrate exchange kinetics. The 18O exchange measurements were also determined on spinach PSII core preparations, which are highly purified PSII samples that are increasingly being used in functional studies. In this preparation, PSII is stripped of the chlorophyll a/blight-harvesting complex components by treatment with 1.5% β-dm, and the sample no longer maintains a membranous structure. In addition, the PSII core sample has also lost the 16- and 23-kDa extrinsic polypeptides but does retain the MSP (Table II). It has a high O2-evolving activity when elevated levels of Ca2+ and Cl− are present in the assay medium. The data at m/e = 34 for the spinach PSII core sample is shown in Fig. 1 C. The results in this case also reveal a strong biphasic exchange behavior, similar to what was observed for the thylakoid and BBY samples. The determined rate constants, however, are somewhat different, being 1.1 ± 0.4 s−1 and 18.0 ± 3.9 s−1 for34 k 1 and34 k 2, respectively (Table I). The18O exchange results from PSII samples of decreasing complexity show that the biphasic behavior must be inherent to the O2-evolving mechanism.Table IIExtrinsic polypeptide composition for the different PSII samplesHigher plant PSII samples33 kDa23 kDa16 kDa(psbO)(psbP)(psbQ)Thylakoid membranes (spinach)++++++PSII (BBY) membrane fragments (spinach)++++++ 1M NaCl washed++−−−− 1M CaCl2washed−−−−−−PSII core particles (spinach)++−−−−Cyanobacterial PSII samples33 kDa12 kDaCyt c 550(psbO)(psbU)(psbV)Thylakoid membranes (Synechocystis wild type)++++++Thylakoid membranes (Synechocystis ΔpsbO)−−−−++PSII core particles (Synechococcus)++++++PSII core particles (Synechocystis)++??++ Open table in a new tab To determine the possible influence of the extrinsic polypeptides on the exchange reactions, the 18O exchange was measured for BBY samples depleted of either the 16- and 23-kDa polypeptides (by 1m NaCl washing) or the 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa polypeptides (by 1 m CaCl2 washing) (Table II). The data atm/e = 34 for these samples are shown in Fig. 2. The 18O exchange behavior in these samples also retain the biphasic behavior. The 16- and 23-kDa polypeptide-depleted sample exhibits exchange rates of 1.7 ± 0.3 s−1 and 22.7 ± 2.0 s−1 for34 k 1 and34 k 2, respectively, whereas the 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa polypeptide-depleted sample yielded rates of 1.6 ± 0.7 s−1 and 9.7 ± 2.6 s−1 (Table I). The general slowing down of the fast phase of exchange in these samples suggests that there is some interaction between the extrinsic polypeptides and the substrate water. The ability to genetically engineer mutants in theSynechocystis 6803 strain makes it a powerful tool in PSII research.

https://openalex.org/W2056882459,"Low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an enzyme involved in mitogenic signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement after platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation. Recently, we demonstrated that LMW-PTP is regulated by a redox mechanism involving the two cysteine residues of the catalytic site, which turn reversibly from reduced to oxidized state after PDGF stimulation. Since recent findings showed a decrease of intracellular reactive oxygen species in contact inhibited cells and a lower tyrosine phosphorylation level in dense cultures in comparison to sparse ones, we studied if the level of endogenous LMW-PTP is regulated by growth inhibition conditions, such as cell confluence and differentiation. Results show that both cell confluence and cell differentiation up-regulate LMW-PTP expression in C2C12 and PC12 cells. We demonstrate that during myogenesis LMW-PTP is regulated at translational level and that the protein accumulates at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we showed that both myogenesis and cell-cell contact lead to a dramatical decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation level of PDGF receptor. In addition, we observed an increased association of the receptor with LMW-PTP during myogenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that myogenesis decreases the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, as observed in dense cultures. As a consequence, LMW-PTP turns from oxidized to reduced form during muscle differentiation, increasing its activity in growth inhibition conditions such as differentiation. These data suggest that LMW-PTP plays a crucial role in physiological processes, which require cell growth arrest such as confluence and differentiation."

Nevertheless, no direct structural imaging of this crucial molecule to the development of cellular immune responses has yet been obtained. There is a need for structural studies of whole ABC transporters to permit insights into their overall structure and functions.

In the MsbA structure, the NBDs do not contact at all apart from crystal contacts, whereas in all the preceding NBD-only structures, the NBDs contact each other over extensive dimer interfaces. A recent structure for the TAP1 NBD provided the first exception to this, with no significant interface detected (35Gaudet R. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence for the cooperativity of the NBDs would argue for significant contacts (36Alberts P. Daumke O.

In this report we have studied the structure of TAP by electron microscopy of detergent-solubilized immunopurified particles. Single particle analysis was used to compare TAP from cells expressing the TAP1-TAP2 heterodimer with particles from cells expressing TAP2 alone. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the TAP heterodimer was also carried out that allowed direct comparison with the structure of P-glycoprotein. The resulting assignment of features in the molecule to previously characterized domains provides the first direct structural evidence supporting models of TAP that have until now been predominantly predictive in nature. T2, T2-TAP2 (expressing rat TAP2 only), T2-TAP1 (expressing rat TAP1 only), and T2 TAP1+2 (expressing rat TAP1 and TAP2) cells (39Momburg F. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Neefjes J. Goulmy E. van de Wal Y.

Cells were washed into PFN medium (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum, 0.1% azide) and incubated with monoclonal antibody MEI (anti-HLA B) tissue culture supernatant (a gift from J. Taurog, University of Texas) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson Facsort using CellQuest software. Immunoisolation utilized sheep anti-TAP2 antisera raised against the C-terminal 14 residues of rat TAP2 (KVYAHLVQQRLEA) (40Powis S.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 2 × 108 cells were lysed in detergent buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoaffinity beads were prepared by equilibrating 5 μg of purified anti-TAP2 antisera with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Pre-cleared lysates (50 μl of protein G-Sepharose, 1 h) were incubated sequentially in 1.5-ml aliquots with the same immunoaffinity beads for 30 min each. Beads were washed extensively before eluting with 50 μm above C-terminal TAP2 peptide. Eluted samples were cleared of any residual immunoglobulin by two further clearing steps with protein G-Sepharose with 20,000 × g-centrifuge spins in between. Samples were adjusted to 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant and stored at −80 °C. Western blotting of detergent-solubilized cells was carried out as previously described (40Powis S.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Antibody immobilized using sheep anti-TAP1 or -TAP2 antisera (40Powis S.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or peptide-eluted TAP polypeptides was incubated in a volume of 30 μl of lysis buffer with 1 μCi of 8-azidoadenosine 5′- [α-32P]triphosphate (Affinity Labeling Technology, Lexington, KY) for 15 min on ice, then exposed to UV irradiation at 365 nm for 10 min on ice. In some experiments unlabeled ATP was added at a concentration of 1 mm. For antibody-immobilized TAP polypeptides, free 8N3ATP was removed by washes in lysis buffer. Particles in solution were diluted in 500 μl of lysis buffer and re-immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody MAC394 (41Knittler M.R. Gulow K. Seelig A. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5967-5977PubMed Google Scholar), recognizing rat TAP2 (at an epitope different from the C-terminal sheep sera), which was a gift from M. Knittler and J. Howard (University of Cologne). For SDS denaturation, samples were adjusted to contain 1% w/v SDS, heated to 80 °C for 5 min, cooled on ice, diluted as above in lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated with sheep anti-rat TAP1 antisera or monoclonal antibody MAC394. Samples were heated in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE. Ethylene glycol bis(succininmidylsuccinate) (EGS, Sigma) labeling was performed on cell lysates prepared at a concentration of 20 × 108 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Peptides were added to a final concentration of 20 μm for 30 min on ice followed by EGS at a concentration of 1 mm for a further 30 min. Samples were heated in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with rabbit anti-TAP2 sera 116 (41Knittler M.R. Gulow K. Seelig A. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5967-5977PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter peptide TNKTVARYV was coupled to hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate (HSAB; Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and iodinated with iodogen. Coupling of the peptide to HSAB was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Immunoisolated or peptide-eluted TAP particles were incubated with ∼5 μm reporter peptide in the presence or absence of 10 μm inhibitor peptides for 10 min on ice, and cross-linking was induced at 365 nm as described above. Immunoimmobilized TAP polypeptides were washed in lysis buffer. Eluted TAP particles were re-immunoprecipitated with MAC394 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software. Samples were added to freshly glow-discharged (rendered hydrophilic) copper/carbon mesh grids for 30 s, and the sides were blotted with Whatman grade 50 filter paper and negatively stained in 4% uranyl acetate. Micrographs of the grids were taken with a Philips CM10 (University of Leeds) and a Philips Technai 10 (UMIST) electron microscope operating at 100 kV. The micrographs were scanned using a Leaf Microdensitometer (University of Leeds) and a Zeiss scanner (University of Sheffield). Image files were initially contrast transfer function (CTF)-corrected using the CRISP image processing package (Calidris Software, Stockholm). Particles were then selected using SPIDER (42Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar), and the densities were normalized between several micrographs. Reference-free alignment was carried out, and the results were statistically analyzed. Particles were sorted into groups for averaging using hierarchical ascendant classification with complete linkage. For each average, Fourier ring correlation between two sub-averages was used to assess its resolution. A cut-off point at which the Fourier ring correlation values dropped below 0.5 was chosen and was determined by fitting the data with a four-parameter Boltzman function. A threshold for each class that gave the best averages in terms of resolution was thus determined. The random conical reconstruction methods we used were part of a suite of procedures written for SPIDER (www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/spider.html), adapted to include CTF correction in SPIDER. The change in the CTF across the micrographs of the tilted specimen was determined using the program ctfind2.com (43Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Particles from untilted micrographs were selected with their equivalent tilted partners (40°) from the underfocused side of the tilted one. An individual CTF correction was applied to each of the tilted particles selected based on its positional coordinates. CTF correction was not needed to align the untilted data set, but a Fermi low pass filter was used to improve the fidelity of the alignment. Reference-free alignment was carried out on the untilted data set (1013 particles), and hierarchical clustering was used to sort these into the major groups. Three classes (215, 215, and 251 particles) were chosen as before for reconstruction of volumes by back projection from the tilted particles (44Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Each volume was put through an angular refinement step (see Pawel's random conical reconstruction methods on the above-cited SPIDER web site) by generating projections from the initial three-dimensional structure and translationally realigning the original tilted particles to these newly generated projections. The realigned particles were then used to recreate a new volume. This refinement step was carried out six times, and the final volume was used for merging the data. The refined volumes from the three separate groups were then compared and rotationally aligned using a three-dimensional correlation search before combining to give a merged reconstruction. This reconstruction was also subject to a similar refinement procedure. This volume represented 67% (683 particles) of the initial data set (1013 particles). Resolution was assessed by splitting its tilted projection data set into two, constructing two “sub-volumes,” and calculating the Fourier shell correlation between them using a cut-off of 2/N 1/2 (where N is the number of pixels in each Fourier shell). We utilized the TAP-deficient T2 human lymphoblastoid cell line, which had been transfected with both rat TAP1 and TAP2 or with rat TAP2 alone. Peptide specificity and transport activity, and MHC class I-chaperone interactions with TAP polypeptides have been well documented in these transfectant lines (39Momburg F. Ortiz-Navarrete V. Neefjes J. Goulmy E. van de Wal Y. Spits H. Powis S.J. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Walden P. Hammerling G.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 40Powis S.J. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of detergent-solubilized cell lysates confirmed the expression of both TAP polypeptides in the T2-TAP1+2 transfectant and of TAP2 only in T2-TAP2 cells (Fig. 1 b). Flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface levels of MHC class I confirmed no increase in MHC class I on T2-TAP2 cells compared with T2 cells, whereas T2-TAP1+2 displayed at least 10-fold more MHC class I (Fig.1 a). This confirmed that before immunoprecipitation, the TAP heterodimer is functional in peptide transport, whereas TAP2 on its own is not. We chose to purify TAP by a rapid immunoaffinity-based methodology to avoid lengthy chromatography-based isolation, thus limiting the time-dependent inactivation of TAP after detergent solubilization (48Uebel S. Plantinga T. Weber P.J. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Tampe R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 was chosen to isolate the core subunits of TAP1 and -2 in the absence of associated class I MHC-chaperone complexes. Immunopurification was performed utilizing anti-rat TAP2 antisera immobilized on protein G-Sepharose. After extensive washing of the immune complexes, TAP was specifically eluted by the addition of the peptide, against which the antisera was generated. The purity of the TAP preparations was determined by analyzing a portion of the eluate by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig.1 c). Similar attempts to isolate TAP1 using the relevant peptide resulted in very inefficient recovery of TAP1 and was not pursued further in this study. On average purifications using TAP2 reagents yielded between 50 and 200 ng of TAP polypeptides from ∼2 × 108 cells. T2-TAP2 cells produced a predominantly single species of approximate molecular mass 75,000 Da, characteristic of TAP2, whereas a doublet of similar mass representing TAP2 and TAP1 was isolated from T2-TAP1+2 cells. Western blotting verified the identity of the components (not shown). The co-isolation of TAP1 using anti-TAP2 antisera confirmed the functional interaction of these polypeptides, suggesting also that they have been purified in an unaltered conformation. Control purifications from untransfected T2 cell lysates produced no detectable TAP species (Fig. 1 c). Some higher molecular mass contaminants were visible in all preparations including the control T2 lysate; however, the relatively high purity of the TAP preparations was confirmed. Once solubilized in detergent, it is difficult to determine the peptide transport activity of TAP; we therefore studied the integrity of the ATP binding domains of TAP, which are known to intimately control the ability of TAP to bind and transport peptides (36Alberts P.

The presence of an ATP-binding site was probed by incubation of immunoisolated TAPs with 8N3ATP, which can be cross-linked once bound by exposure to UV irradiation. We first tested the ability of the TAP heterodimer, TAP2 alone, and also TAP1 alone (in T2-TAP1 cells) to be labeled by 8N3ATP while still attached to antibody in immune complexes. As shown in Fig.2 a, both TAP2 and TAP1 labeled strongly when expressed singly. In the case of the heterodimer, whether immunoisolated by anti-TAP2 or -TAP1 reagents, a band was obtained that in comparison to single TAP chains, suggested that both ATP binding sites were equally accessible to 8N3ATP. A strikingly different pattern of labeling was obtained when we examined TAP particles free in solution after peptide-specific elution. In this instance poor labeling was observed with TAP2 alone (Fig.2 b), whereas in the TAP heterodimer, the majority of the labeling appeared to be on material of lower molecular mass than TAP2, suggesting almost exclusive labeling of TAP1. In both cases the presence of nonradioactive ATP inhibited the labeling. To confirm this observation we performed the same experiment but denatured a portion of the TAP heterodimer sample in SDS after labeling with 8N3ATP and re-immunoprecipitated with reagents specific for TAP1 or TAP2. The majority of the labeling was cross-linked to TAP1 (Fig. 2 c). Thus the ATP binding sites in the TAP heterodimer appear to differ in their ability to bind ATP when immobilized with antibody. Possibly the presence of antibody directed at the C terminus of either TAP1 or TAP2 may alter the conformation of the NBDs. However, the preferential labeling of TAP1 of TAP particles free in solution correlates with recent data that indicates that the ATP-binding site on TAP1 is more readily labeled than TAP2 (36Alberts P. Daumke O. Deverson E.V. Howard J.C. Knittler M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 242-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 51Hewitt E.W. Gupta S.S. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We also studied the ability of purified TAP particles to bind peptides. An iodinated model peptide TNKTVARYV (termed pep1 in Fig. 2) coupled to the photoreactive cross-linker HSAB (52Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1994; 1: 7-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) labeled the immunoimmobilized TAP heterodimer but not TAP2 alone (Fig.2 d). However, initial attempts to label TAP particles in solution with pep1 were unsuccessful. We reasoned that the presence of the C-terminal TAP2 peptide KVYAHLVQQRLEA (termed pep2) used to competitively elute TAP particles at 50 μm may inhibit the binding of the photoreactive reporter peptide. To test whether pep2 was capable of binding TAP, we utilized the ability of the chemical cross-linker EGS to cross-link TAP polypeptides into a large molecular mass complex, the formation of which is enhanced by TAP-binding peptides (50Karttunen J.T. Lehner P.J. Gupta S.S. Hewitt E.W. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7431-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 53Lacaille V.G. Androlewicz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17386-17390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Detergent lysates of T2 TAP1+2 cells were incubated with pep1 or pep2, and cross-linking was induced by the addition of 1 mm EGS. Western blot analysis of the lysates indicated that both peptides increased the formation of a cross-linked TAP product of relative molecular mass 220 kDa (Fig. 2 e). Thus the C-terminal TAP2 peptide binds to TAP and is likely to compete with the photoreactive reporter peptide. We therefore eluted TAP particles with a 10-fold reduced concentration of pep2 and retested the binding ability of iodinated HSAB-pep1. Under these conditions iodinated HSAB-pep1 labeled TAP particles, and the addition of 10 μm unlabeled pep1 or pep2 resulted in inhibition of 78 and 43% binding, respectively (Fig. 2 f). Thus eluted TAP particles in solution retain the ability to bind peptides. Taken together with the ATP binding data, this suggests that the TAP particles in solution maintain good overall structural integrity. Transmission electron micrographs of the TAP heterodimer, TAP2, and untransfected T2 control preparations are shown in Fig. 3. Untransfected T2 cell preparations contained only very small debris, whereas the other two samples contained much larger particles. Thus the immunoisolation reaction per se does not appear to contribute particulate matter of similar size to the TAP immunoisolates. Particles in the TAP2 micrographs were on average 7–9 nm in diameter, whereas the TAP heterodimer particles were 9–12 nm in diameter. This information assisted in the TAP heterodimer and TAP2 particle selection process to help improve the data set. Images of 686 TAP2 and 1436 TAP1+2 particles were selected (Fig. 3). Each image represents a projection (a two-dimensional view) of the protein structure. After reference-free alignment, particles were sorted into groups, and averages of different orientations of each molecule were generated (Fig.4 A). The choice of threshold to apply in the clustering was selected to maximize resolution (Fig.4 B). For each molecule, five of the highest resolution averages are shown magnified (Fig. 4 C). TAP1+2 averages (Fig. 4 C, top row) are ∼11–12 nm along the longest axis and 8–9 nm perpendicular to the longest axis. These averages have a spatial resolution of 38–42 Å, as determined by Fourier ring correlation (Fig. 4 B). There is pseudo-2-fold symmetry in the orientations. Averages B andC are examples of projections that show a central 3-nm-diameter-stain-accumulating region. Five of the most significant averages of TAP2 are also shown at the same scale as the TAP1+2 averages (Fig. 4 C, bottom row). These averages have a spatial resolution of 26–35 Å, determined by Fourier ring correlation (Fig. 4 B). Some orientations have a diamond shape (Fig. 4 C, bottom row, d ande), and others have a trapezoid shape (Fig. 4 C,bottom row, a–c). Along one axis, the length of the molecule changes from one side, 6–7 nm, to the"
https://openalex.org/W2323493277,"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein caused by gene mutation, association with oncoproteins from small DNA viruses, mutational inactivation of p16(Ink4a), or overexpression of cyclin D is a common feature of many human cancer cells and is causally associated with the aberrant proliferation control of cancer cells; whereas normal cells maintain an integrated cell cycle machinery and are subject to cell cycle checkpoint control by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs). To determine whether this difference can be translated into a therapeutic advantage to protect normal cells from adverse cytotoxicity caused by chemotherapy, we established cell model systems for ecdysone-inducible expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), and p27(Kip1) in one CKI-responsive cell line (A431 human vulvar epidermoid carcinoma cells with functional Rb) and one CKI-unresponsive cell line (SiHa human cervical cancer cells with nonfunctional Rb). Expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) in both SiHa and A431 cells strongly inhibited CDK2 activity, indicating functional expression of the CDK inhibitors in both cell lines. However, only in A431 cells did expression of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) cause Rb dephosphorylation, arrest cell cycle traversal, and potently inhibit cell proliferation. Induction of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) in SiHa cells failed to cause Rb dephosphorylation or to arrest cell cycle traversal, and such induction only minimally inhibited cell proliferation. We then compared the chemosensitivity of clones derived from these two cell lines when the CKIs were and were not induced. Induction of p16(Ink4a), p21(Waf1), or p27(Kip1) conferred strong resistance to paclitaxel- or cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity on the CKI-responsive A431 cells but not on the CKI-unresponsive SiHa cells. Our results support a novel chemotherapy strategy for treating patients with Rb pathway-impaired cancers by concurrent administration of chemotherapy with CKIs as chemoprotective agents for normal cells."

The tmRNA is encoded by the ssrA gene (1Williams K.P. Bartel D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A knock-out of this gene has little effect on the growth of Escherichia coli cells at 37 °C but suppresses growth at elevated temperatures (2Oh K.K. Apirion D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Additionally, this knock-out strain is outcompeted by wild-type strains in a culture (3Williams K.P. Martindale K.A. Bartel D.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The gene is present in all kingdoms of the bacterial domain, including the alpha-proteobacteria (4Felden B. Gesteland R.F. Atkins H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5Keiler K.C. Shapiro L. Williams K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7778-7783Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This molecule is of special interest because it can function as both a tRNA and an mRNA. The 5′ and 3′ ends of the molecule can be folded into a tRNA-like structure with an amino acid-acceptor stem and a TΨC-stem/loop that contains two modifications universally conserved in tRNAs (6Felden B. Hanawa K. Atkins J.F. Himeno H. Muto A. Gesteland R.F. McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3188-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The tmRNA contains an identity element for the alanyl-tRNA synthetase and can be charged with alanine in vivo and in vitro (7Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikava K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, tmRNA has a messenger RNA sequence that encodes a decapeptide in E. coli(8Keiler K.C. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 9Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which is a recognition signal for some proteases (10Silber K.R. Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The main function of tmRNA in the cell seems to be the rescue of ribosomes that are arrested by truncated mRNA lacking their stop codon (8Keiler K.C. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 9Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These ribosomes carry a peptidyl-tRNA at the P site and either a truncated codon or no codon at all at the A site. The alanine-charged tmRNA enters the ribosomal A site, and the alanyl residue is transferred to the growing peptide. After translocation, translation switches from the truncated mRNA to the messenger part of tmRNA. After reading the codon sequence on tmRNA, the ribosome terminates at the stop codon encoded in tmRNA by the usual termination mechanism. This process has two consequences: (i) the ribosomes arrested with truncated mRNA are rescued and recycled for protein synthesis, and (ii) the truncated proteins are tagged with a signal peptide that is recognized by specific proteases. Recently, it was also demonstrated that stalling of a ribosome at rare codons can trigger tagging of polypeptides despite the presence of a substantial region of non-translated 3′-mRNA (11Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4579-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Aminoacyl-tRNAs enter the ribosome as a complex with the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) in the presence of GTP (12Yokosawa H. Inoue-Yokosawa N. Arai K.I. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 375-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu complexed with GTP protects Ala-tmRNA from spontaneous hydrolysis (13Rudinger-Thirion J. Giege R. Felden B. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), as EF-Tu·GTP does with aminoacyl-tRNA. EF-Tu is therefore believed to be involved in the transport of Ala-tmRNA to the ribosome. An additional protein, the RNA-binding SmpB protein, binds with high affinity to tmRNA and is important for the tagging functions of tmRNA on the ribosome (14Karzai, A. W., Susskind, M. M., and Sauer, R. T. (1999)EMBO J. 3793–3799Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ribosomal protein S1 can interact with tmRNA (15Wower I. Zwieb C. Guven S. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and three further proteins have been identified in the tmRNA·SmpB complex, the role of which is still unknown in relation to tmRNA function (16Karzai A. Sauer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus far, the interaction of EF-Tu with tmRNA has not been directly demonstrated. In this research we aimed to identify one or more cellular components that interact with tmRNA under conditions optimal for protein synthesis. A cross-linking approach developed for the investigation of the ribosomal neighborhoods of mRNA and 5 S rRNA was then applied (17Dontsova O. Dokudovskaya S. Kopylov A. Bogdanov A. Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This method utilizes the photosensitive 4-thiouridine that is incorporated randomly into the RNA under study. It is worth noting that results obtained by this approach with 5 S rRNA were in very good agreement with the recent structural data of the ribosome (18–20; see Ref. 21Sergiev P. Dontsova O. Bogdanov A. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 2001; 35 (n press): iCrossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, we identified EF-Tu as the main protein that could be cross-linked to tmRNA in E. coli cell-free S100 extract (S100 enzymes). Surprisingly, deacylated tmRNA can form complexes with EF-Tu·GDP, and this unusual complex was characterized by cross-linking and footprinting experiments. The plasmid containing the tmRNA gene from E. coli under the control of a T7 promoter was a kind gift of Dr. Brosius. tmRNA transcript was synthesized using an in vitro T7 transcription system (22Triana-Alonso F.J.

For the synthesis of sU-modified tmRNA transcripts, UTP was supplemented with 4-thio-UTP at different molar ratios (from 1:1 up to 1:100). The level of 4-thiouridine incorporation was estimated using the T2 fingerprinting technique (17Dontsova O. Dokudovskaya S. Kopylov A. Bogdanov A. Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For example, one or two 4-thiouridine residues per molecule were incorporated at an sU:U ratio of 1:100, and tmRNA transcripts were purified as described for mRNAs (23Alexeeva E.V. Shpanchenko O.V. Dontsova O.A. Bogdanov A.A. Nierhaus K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2228-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To create truncated tmRNAs, the plasmid was linearized with NcoI or XcmI yielding tmRNAs that lacked the CA-3′ end or the ACCA-3′ end, respectively. Full transcripts of tmRNA were alanylated in 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, at 0 °C, 10 mmMg(acetate)2, 150 mm NH4Cl, 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mm ATP. 50 pmol of tmRNA and 30 pmol of AlaRS were incubated in the presence of 20 μm [14C]Ala (specific activity 350 dpm/pmol) in a volume of 30 μl for 20 min at 37 °C. The charging yield was determined by precipitation with cold trichloroacetic acid. The plasmid containing the His-tagged AlaRS was a kind gift from Dr. Paul Schimmel (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). E. colitRNA-free S100 extract (S100 enzymes) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Dabrowski (MPI für Molekulare Genetik). EF-Tu his-tagged at the C terminus was isolated from E. coli as described previously (24Boon K. Vijgenboom E. Madsen L.V. Talens A. Kraal B. Bosch L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Complexes were formed by incubating tmRNA with the S100 enzymes for 10 min at 37 °C under the following ionic conditions: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8 (0 °C), 3 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm spermidine, 0.05 mm spermine, 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 4 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.05 μg/μl pyruvate kinase, and 4 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol. The final concentration of tmRNA was 0.1–1 pmol/μl. Next, 9 μl of S100 was added to 30 μl of the reaction mix that was irradiated by mild (>330 nm) UV light for 5 min as described previously (25Dontsova O. Tishkov V. Dokudovskaya S. Bogdanov A.

Half of this sample was treated with proteinase K (1.4 μg/μl final concentration) for 15 min at 37 °C, and both aliquots were loaded onto the same gel. Cross-linked and non-cross-linked tmRNAs were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) for 4 h at 100 V. The gel region containing the tmRNA-protein cross-link (Fig. 1, line 2) was cut out and incubated in 300 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 0 °C, 0.1% (w/v) SDS together with 5 μl of RNase T1 (10 μg/μl) for 20 min at 55 °C. The same volume of a buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.1% (v/v) 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm sodium acetate, and 5 μl of RNase T1 (10 μg/μl) was added and the resultant mixture was shaken overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were precipitated by ethanol (5 volumes), and after a low speed centrifugation the pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of ultrapure water and 1 μl of RNase T1 (10 μg/μl) was added. This mixture was then incubated for 20 min at 55 °C, diluted by an equal volume of loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 0 °C, 8% (w/v) SDS, 40% glycerol, 400 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue), and loaded onto a 7.5% protein gel (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by staining in a solution containing 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue, 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid, 20% (v/v) methanol for 2 h. Destaining was achieved by washing the gel with 30% (v/v) methanol. Cross-linked proteins were digested in gel according to the method described in a previous study (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar) using 100 ng of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) per gel piece containing a band. The eluted peptides were purified on C-18 ZipTip micro columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-MS) in the presence of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. MALDI-MS analysis was performed on a Reflex-II instrument (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) in reflector mode. Samples for MALDI-MS were prepared by the dried droplet method on stainless steel targets precovered with thin matrix films. The determined peptide masses were submitted to the web-based data base searching programs, MS-Fit and Profound, to identify the protein (see Table II below).Table IIAssociation constants for EF-Tu and tmRNA and Ala- and Phe-tRNAComplexAssociation constants (K a)Nitrocellulosegel-shift[M −1 ]tmRNA·EF-Tu·GDP1.0 (±0.2) × 106tmRNA·EF-Tu·GTP1.4 (±0.2) × 106Ala-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP1.1 (±0.1) × 107Phe-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP2.9 (±0.3) × 1070.7 (±0.2) × 107For nitrocellulose, binding constants were determined with nitrocellulose filtration method (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). For modification with CMCT (1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate), 25 μl of a 42 mg/ml CMCT solution was added to either 25 μl of tmRNA·EF-Tu·GDP complex mixture (2 pmol/μl) obtained as described above (but without an energy regeneration system) or to 25 μl of untreated control tmRNA in solution. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by immediate quenching of the modifying reagent with the appropriate stop solution (28Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1989; 57: 585-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The modification positions were determined by a primer-extension (29Rinke-Appel J. Junke N. Stade K. Brimacombe R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using primers complementary to the nucleotides 55–73, 149–217, or 345–363 of tmRNA. The cross-linked tmRNA·EF-Tu·GDP complex were extracted from the gel as described above (under “Analysis of the Cross-linked Protein”) and shaken overnight at 4 °C. Samples were precipitated by ethanol (5 volumes), and after a low speed centrifugation the pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of ultrapure water and treated with fresh proteinase K (1.4 μg/μl in the reaction mixture) for 15 min at 37 °C.

Association constants (K a) for tmRNA·EF-Tu·GDP/GTP complexes were measured by filtration of the complexes through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). This method was a modification of that described previously (30Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). EF-Tu·GDP was incubated in a multiple of 3.33 μl (32 pmol per 3.33-μl volume unit) of reaction buffer containing 60 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, at 4 °C, 10 mm Mg(acetate)2, 150 mmNH4Cl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and (in the case of complexes with GTP) 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 30 μm [γ-32P]GTP (specific activity 3500 dpm/pmol) and 0.1 μg/μl pyruvate kinase. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the volume unit was increased to 10 μl to maintain the ionic conditions, and up to 80 pmol of tmRNA was added. After 20 min at 0 °C, 10 μl was spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter presoaked in reaction buffer and washed with 100 μl and subsequently three times with each 3 ml of reaction buffer. The filter was resolved in 5 ml of Filter-Count (Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands) and counted. The difference, cpm (binary complex EF-Tu·GTP/GDP in a 3.3-μl volume unit) − cpm (ternary complex in a 10-μl volume unit), gives the amount of ternary complex tmRNA·EF-Tu·GTP/GDP formed. Note that the binary complex is adsorbed to the filter, whereas the ternary complex goes through. The procedure of gel-shift experiments for measuring the formation of ternary complexes was as described previously (44Stelzl U. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4597-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). EF-Tu was isolated as described (24Boon K. Vijgenboom E. Madsen L.V. Talens A. Kraal B. Bosch L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the experiments with tmRNA, native EF-Tu from E. coli lacking a His-tag was used. Experiments monitoring the formation of ternary complexes in the presence of [14C]Phe-tRNA and [14C]Ala-tRNA, respectively, were performed as controls. tmRNA containing statistically two randomly distributed sU residues was synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. The level of sU incorporation was controlled by RNase T2-fingerprints (25Dontsova O. Tishkov V. Dokudovskaya S. Bogdanov A. Doring T. Rinke-Appel J. Thamm S. Greuer B. Brimacombe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4125-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The T7-transcript tmRNA could be charged with [14C]alanine up to a maximal 40%. A similar value (20–40%) has been found by other groups (6Felden B. Hanawa K. Atkins J.F. Himeno H. Muto A. Gesteland R.F. McCloskey J.A. Crain P.F.

The alanine residue could be efficiently attached to nascent peptide chains in vitro in the presence of the 3 mmMg2+/polyamine system 2O. V. Shpanchenko and K. H. Nierhaus, unpublished data. (see Ref. 31Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar for the system). With regards to sequence and length, the homogeneity was determined using transcribed phosphorothioated tmRNA to be about 80% (not shown). S100 enzymes are the post-ribosomal supernatants of bacterial cell extracts. All tRNAs were removed from the S100 enzymes by treatment with DEAE-Sepharose. The S100 enzymes were mixed with modified [32P]tmRNA (sU) in the presence of GTP and a GTP regeneration system. Cross-links were induced by mild irradiation of the reaction mixture with UV light (λ > 330 nm). SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed cross-linked products containing tmRNA by reduced mobility of the complex (seelane 2 in Fig. 1 A;lane 1 contains the non-irradiated sample). This mobility shift was due to the formation of a complex of tmRNA with one or more proteins, because treatment with proteinase K cancelled the shift (lane 3). For identification of the cross-linked protein(s) the complex was purified from the S100-derived proteins that co-migrated with the tmRNA during gel electrophoresis. The complex seen in lane 2 of Fig. 1 A was extracted from the gel and subjected to a second electrophoresis step under the same conditions, after the RNA had been digested with T1 RNase. Cross-linked proteins were expected to change their mobility upon the loss of the RNA moiety. Only one protein band was clearly seen in the gel after this treatment. The gel section containing the band of the cross-linked protein was isolated and subjected to tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI (Table I). A data base search concerning the peptide masses revealed that all major peptides could be assigned as fragments of EF-Tu. The identified peptides covered 65% of the protein's sequence. It follows that EF-Tu is the major protein component of the cross-linked complex.Table IAssignment table of the tryptic peptides of the cross-linked proteinMeasuredCalculated value of [M + H]+DeviationSequence coverageModifications1-aMet-ox, oxidized methionine; Cys-am, acrylamide-modified cysteine.FromTom/zppm776.39776.41−22.07320325837.49837.49−7.361181241027.601027.596.502712801100.671100.67−0.583833941201.571201.5327.922542631Cys-am1233.621233.625.673263341376.671376.6328.5546571703.811703.7722.022502631Met-ox 1Cys-am1728.841728.84−1.303053191780.931780.95−6.163593741795.931795.96−14.449251796.901796.94−21.083593741Met-ox1803.891803.891.9960751812.921812.94−6.183593742Met-ox1962.021962.02−3.421892051964.981964.967.561561722117.162117.16−0.692062242515.132515.23−38.522502701Met-ox 1Cys-am2546.242546.241.973353582729.352729.342.58911172745.342745.340.48911171Met-ox3080.733080.723.33938MALDI-MS peptide mapping identified elongation factor Tu from E. coli (duplicate gene of tufA, GenBank™ accession numberAE000472).

The matched peptides cover 65% (257/394 amino acids) of the protein. An intriguing observation from the experiments described above is the high yield of cross-linked tmRNA in the presence of EF-Tu·GTP and in the absence of alanylation. Under the conditions used here, a significant amount of transcribed tmRNA could not be alanylated in the presence of S100 enzymes, because alanine was not added to the reaction mixture. Therefore, it is possible that EF-Tu·GTP can form complexes with deacylated tmRNA. The formation of tmRNA·EF-Tu complexes in the presence of either GTP or GDP has been examined by using nitrocellulose filtration methods (30Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 30: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, binding was observed, and the association constants,K a, for either complex could be determined. Controls with Phe-tRNA were performed and, furthermore, the association constants with Phe- and Ala-tRNA were determined using band-shift assays. Both constants with deacylated tmRNA (in the presence of GDP or GTP) were about 1 × 106m−1, for the canonical ternary complexes Ala-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP or that with Phe-tRNA up to 10 to 20 times higher values were observed (Table II). It follows that even EF-Tu·GDP can form a ternary complex with deacylated tmRNA. In contrast, a comparable complex even with a large excess of deacylated tRNAbulk (40-fold over the concentration of tmRNA) could not be detected with the applied nitrocellulose filtration technique, in agreement with literature data underscoring the specificity of the complex observed with deacylated tmRNA. An intact CCA end is a prerequisite for aminoacylation of tRNA. Therefore, a rigorous test whether or not deacylated tmRNA can form a complex with EF-Tu·GDP would be an analysis of the question: Is an intact CCA-3′ end of the tmRNA truly a prerequisite for complex formation? To address this question, tmRNA was transcribed lacking either the CA-3′ or the ACCA-3′ ends, and cross-linking experiments were performed with tRNA-free S100 enzymes as shown in Fig. 1 A. The cross-linked products were isolated, and the protein species was analyzed by gel-electrophoresis after digestion of RNA with RNase T1. The protein observed was indeed co-migrating with purified EF-Tu (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that the shortened versions of tmRNA formed complexes with EF-Tu·GDP as efficiently as did full-length tmRNA. Next, we asked whether the cross-link between tmRNA and EF-Tu·GDP observed here exclusively occurs with deacylated tmRNA rather than with alanylated tmRNA. To this end, transcribed [32P]tmRNA randomly containing about 5 (±2) 4-thiouridines per molecule was charged with [14C]Ala with a yield of ∼40% and was employed in a cross-linking experiment with EF-Tu·GDP (Table III). A32P/14C ratio of 2.7 was found in the non-cross-linked control band, and a ratio of 2.4 in the cross-linked band indicating significant amounts of [14C]Ala-tmRNA in the cross-linked product, although deacylated tmRNA was slightly over-represented. This finding demonstrates that EF-Tu·GDP forms a complex with both tmRNA and Ala-tmRNA almost equally well.Table IIICross-link experiment with EF-TuGDP and [14 C]Ala-[32 P]tmRNAExcised band from the gelratio, [32P]/[14C]RatiodpmCross-linked complex (cf. upper band in Fig. 1 A)1268 /4672.7:1Free Ala-tmRNA (cf. lower band in Fig. 1 A)786 /3232.4:1For details see text. Open table in a new tab For details see text. The unusual complex of tmRNA·EF-Tu·GDP might represent a new type of RNA·EF-Tu interaction. To study this further, we analyzed this complex in the next experiments in more detail. Cross-linking experiments were performed with sU containing tmRNA and purified EF-Tu·GDP. Around 20% of the input tmRNA was found in the cross-linked product in different experiments indicating a highly efficient cross-linking reaction. The complex corresponding to the upper band in Fig. 1 A, lane 2, was isolated from the gel and used for primer-extension analysis. Non-cross-linked tmRNA from the same irradiated sample, isolated from the same lane of the gel (but corresponding to the lower band) was used as a control. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Specific stops of the reverse transcriptase were observed at the positions C269 and C270 (Fig. 2 A, lane X) and at A309 (Fig. 2 B, lane X). Therefore, the corresponding cross-linking sites are U268 and U308, respectively. The bands seen inlane K (Fig. 2 A) are probably internal cross-linked sites, if they are stronger than the corresponding band in the X lane (cross-linked tmRNA). The bands corresponding to cross-link sites did not show a band at the same position in the control lane. Bases of the tmRNA that revealed altered reactivity against the modifying reagent CMCT upon complex formation with EF-Tu·GDP were identified in footprinting experiments. CMCT reacts specifically with N3 of the uracil base and N1 of the guanine base. The most obvious changes in the reactivity of the nucleotide bases were detected in the helix 2 of tmRNA. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The reactivity of the base G315 is strongly decreased whereas that of U311 is only weakly reduced corresponding to reverse transcriptase stops at A316 and A312, respectively (Fig. 3, lane 3) as compared with tmRNA in solution (lane 4). Note the weak band at position 316 also in the control (lane 1 of Fig. 3) that was not always seen and was always significantly weaker than in the lane with the modified tmRNA. The two bases G315 and U311 are protected in the complex. The reactivity of the base U308 is increased, indicating that this base is more exposed in the complex than in isolated tmRNA in solution (lane 3, reverse transcriptase stops at position A309, compare with lane 4). U268 is present in"

Recurrent losses of 15q11–22 have also been reported in several other tumor types such as breast and colorectal cancers. To more precisely map the commonly deleted region, we have performed a high density loss of heterozygosity analysis of 46 malignant mesotheliomas, using 26 polymorphic microsatellite markers spanning the entire long arm of chromsome 15. Allelic loss from 15q was observed in 22 of 46 (48%) cases. These analyses have defined a minimally deleted region of ∼3-cM, which was confirmed to reside at 15q15 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with yeast artificial chromosome probes. No tumor suppressor genes have been reported to map to this site. The minimally deleted region identified in this investigation overlaps those observed in other kinds of cancer, and is the smallest site of recurrent 15q loss identified to date in human tumors. The identification of this commonly deleted site implicates a putative tumor suppressor gene(s) at 15q15 involved in diverse forms of human neoplasia."

It binds the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free E2 conformation in the picomolar range, supposedly resulting in a largely catalytically inactive species. We now find that thapsigargin has little effect on medium P<sub>i</sub>↔ HOH oxygen exchange and that this activity is greatly stimulated (up to 30-fold) in the presence of 30% (v/v) Me<sub>2</sub>SO. Assuming a simple two-step mechanism, we have evaluated the effect of thapsigargin and Me<sub>2</sub>SO on the four rate constants governing the reaction of P<sub>i</sub> with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase. The principal effect of thapsigargin alone is to stimulate <i>E</i>P hydrolysis (<i>k</i> <sub>−2</sub>), whereas that of Me<sub>2</sub>SO is to greatly retard P<sub>i</sub> dissociation (<i>k</i> <sub>−1</sub>), accounting for its well known effect on increasing the apparent affinity for P<sub>i</sub>. These effects persist when the agents are used in combination and substantially account for the activated oxygen exchange (<i>v</i> <sub>exchange</sub> =<i>k</i> <sub>−2</sub>[<i>E</i>P]). Kinetic simulations show that the overall rate constant for the formation of <i>E</i>P is very fast (∼300 s<sup>−1</sup>) when the exchange is maximal. Thapsigargin greatly stabilizes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase against denaturation in detergent in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as revealed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking, suggesting that the membrane helices lock together.

RT converts the single-stranded plus-strand RNA genome of the retroelement into a double-stranded preintegrative DNA molecule that is subsequently integrated into the host genome (reviewed in Ref.1). Replication begins with the synthesis of minus-strand DNA, which is primed by a host cell-derived tRNA that binds to the primer binding site of the viral template RNA. Reverse transcription is initiated by extending the 3′ end of the primer, using the 5′ protruding end of the plus-strand genomic RNA as template. When RT reaches the 5′ end of the RNA template, the so called minus-strand strong-stop DNA (−sssDNA) is released and transferred to the 3′ end of the genomic RNA to allow continuation of minus-strand DNA synthesis. During minus-strand DNA synthesis, the template RNA strand of the newly formed RNA/DNA hybrid is degraded by the RT-associated RNase H activity (2Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P.

Using HIV-1 RT, two modes of RNase H activity can be distinguished: (i) a polymerase-dependent mode, which accompanies DNA synthesis and is positioned by the polymerase domain binding to the recessed nascent DNA 3′ end; and (ii) a polymerase-independent mode, which occurs without DNA synthesis but is oriented by the polymerase domain binding to the recessed 5′ end of RNA fragments paired to the DNA. A bimodal hydrolysis mechanism has also been demonstrated for theSaccharomyces cerevisiae retrotransposon Ty3 RT (6Rausch J.W. Bona-Le Grice M.K. Nymark-McMahon M.H.,. Miller J.T. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13879-13887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The polymerase-dependent RNase H activity that takes place during minus-strand synthesis is not sufficient to completely degrade all of the template RNA (7Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One reason for this partial digestion is a greater rate of polymerization versus RNA template cleavage (7Kati W.M.

The fragments that remain bound to the minus-strand DNA must be digested further by the polymerase-independent activity of RNase H. However, specific purine-rich fragments called polypurine tracts (PPT) are resistant to RNase H digestion and function as RNA primers for plus-strand DNA synthesis (2Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar). In all LTR-containing retroelements, a preferred PPT (the 3′ PPT) is located just upstream of the 3′ LTR boundary. Extension of this PPT by the polymerase activity of RT generates the plus-strand strong-stop DNA (+sssDNA). Additional initiation sites have been found in the middle of the genome of some retroviruses and of the yeast retrotransposon Ty1 (10Charneau P. Alizon M. Clavel F. J.

The precision of plus-strand initiation from the 3′ end of the PPT is essential because it defines the 5′ border of the upstream LTR, which contains cis-acting sequences required for integration of the preintegrative DNA into the host cell genome. The mechanism by which RNase H creates the PPT primer is not well understood. Several reports in retroviruses have shown that the precise generation of a PPT primer is sequence-dependent,i.e. the integrity of some positions in the PPT is necessary for cleavage specificity (2Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar). Structural studies suggest that a specific secondary structure of the hybrid RNA/DNA duplex could explain resistance of the PPT to RNase H digestion. Recently, a conserved U-rich sequence upstream of the PPT of several retroelements has been found to be important for their replication (14Noad R.J. Al-Kaff N.S. Turner D.S. Covey S.N. J. Biol.

In this study we have used hybrid RNA/DNA substrates containing the PPT sequence to evaluate how recombinant Ty1 RT extends PPT-containing primers during initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis and cleaves RNA/DNA duplexes near the site of initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis. By working with a genetically tractable endogenous retroelement, we can gain insights into the mechanism by which RNase H activities of RTs generate a PPT primer. The WT Ty1 recombinant RT (p6H Ty1 IN-RT-RH construct 2 described in Ref. 19Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and mutant Ty1 RT versions derived from this construct contained short arrays of histidine residues at their amino termini and were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni2+-nitroloacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography as described (19Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The D211E polymerase active site mutant version of recombinant Ty1 RT (AGE2224) was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis of the Ty1 RT domain, using mutagenic sense and antisense primers corresponding to the sequence 5 ′-GTG ACA ATT TGT TTA TTC GTG GAT GAG ATG GTA TTG TTT AGC-3′ (plus strand of Ty1-H3, positions 4552–4593) to substitute a conserved catalytic triad aspartate with glutamate. The PCR product was cut with SpeI and SphI and ligated to similarly digested p6H Ty1 IN-RT-RH. The D468S RNase H active site mutant version of recombinant Ty1 RT (AGE2219) was initially constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, using oligo RAG257 (TGA TCT ACT ACT AGT AAG TAA GC; corresponding to the minus strand of Ty1-H3, positions 5336–5358), to generate a mutant version of pJEF724 (AGE1160). Next, p6H Ty1 IN-RT-RH was cut with AflII and SnaBI, and the large fragment was ligated to the 930-bp fragment from similarly digested AGE1160. The RNA oligoribonucleotide were chemically synthesized in our laboratory with a DNA-RNA Applied Biosystems synthesizer (Strasbourg laboratory) or purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) (Piscataway laboratory). After synthesis, the oligoribonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from either Thermo Hybaid, Interactiva Division (Ulm, Germany) or Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA). The chemically synthesized RNAs were labeled at their 5′ termini with 32P using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. An alkaline ladder was prepared by treating the 5′-labeled RNA with 0.1m sodium carbonate, pH 9, for 4 min at 90 °C. To prepare the RNA/DNA duplexes, a 3 m excess of DNA was hybridized with the RNA in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 15 mm NaCl, and 8 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 1 min and then incubated for 5 min at 70 °C, 10 min at 42 °C, and 10 min at room temperature. RNase H cleavage was initiated with MgCl2at a final concentration of 20 mm. After addition of the Ty1 RT, the samples were incubated at 23 °C for the time indicated in the legends of the figures. The reaction was stopped by addition of formamide sample buffer. The products of the reaction were analyzed on denaturing 8, 12, or 20% polyacrylamide gels. The polymerization assays described in Table I were performed with equal amounts of RT protein from different sources as described previously (19Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) except the reactions were performed at 30 °C for 60 min.Table IHomopolymer polymerase activity of various recombinant Ty1 RTsPolymerase sourcePolymerase activity relative to WT%Ty1 WT1001-a100% activity equals 3.72 pmol of dGTP incorporated/μg of microgram enzyme/h.Ty1 D468S104Ty1 D211E<3.21-a 100% activity equals 3.72 pmol of dGTP incorporated/μg of microgram enzyme/h. Open table in a new tab E. coli RNase H was obtained from Promega and used at 0.6 unit/reaction. We have demonstrated previously that WT recombinant Ty1 RT can synthesize DNA from a recessed primer as well as degrade RNA present in a RNA/DNA hybrid (19Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using a variety of mutant versions of Ty1 RT, we have shown that a mutation (D211E) in the active site of Ty1 RT cannot transpose, whereas a mutation in the active site of Ty1 RNase H, is still capable of polymerizing −sssDNA in vivo within virus-like particles but is blocked at the minus-strand transfer step and does not make +sssDNA (20Uzun O. Gabriel A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6337-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To examine the potential interactions of the two domains within RT, we generated mutant versions of the recombinant Ty1 RT protein, expressed them in E. coli, and purified them for in vitro study. As shown in Table I, the D468S RNase H mutant and the WT enzyme have approximately equal specific activity at incorporating dGTP in a homopolymer polymerization assay, whereas the D211E active site mutant is nearly devoid of polymerase activity. These same versions of the enzyme were then tested for their ability to cleave RNA/DNA hybrids. For this experiment, the RNA was a 28-mer sequence consisting of the Ty1 PPT, with flanking upstream sequence from the Ty1 3′ untranslated region and downstream sequence from the 3′ U3 segment (Fig. 1 A). The RNA was32P-5′ end-labeled so that cleavages could be visualized. The DNA portion consisted of a complementary oligonucleotide, which annealed either to a portion of (substrate B), or to the complete RNA (substrate C). As shown in Fig. 1 B, Ty1 RNase H generates a pattern of cleavages that is distinct from E. coli RNase H (compare lanes 4–7 with lanes 10–13). As expected, the D468S mutant version lacks any detectable cleavage activity (lanes 14–19). On the other hand, the D211E mutant has a cleavage pattern identical to the WT enzyme, indicating that cleavage specificity is unrelated to the function of the polymerase domain (compare lanes 10–13 with lanes 22–25). Further, whereas the WT enzyme is able to make additional cleavages with substrate B, in the presence of dNTPs (lane 11), the D211E mutant cannot, indicating that these are polymerase-dependent cleavage events. In the yeast retrotransposon Ty1, plus-strand DNA synthesis is initiated at two sites located at the 5′ boundary of the 3′ long terminal repeat and near the middle of the pol gene in the integrase coding sequence (11Heyman T. Agoutin B. Friant S. Wilhelm F.X. Wilhelm M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Pochart P. Agoutin B. Rousset S. Chanet R. Doroszkiewicz V. Heyman T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3513-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The two plus-strand primers have an identical purine-rich sequence: uggguggua. We have tested the ability of recombinant Ty1 RT to use RNA primers containing this purine-rich sequence to support plus-strand synthesis in vitro.32P-5′ end-labeled RNA primers were annealed to a 61-nt minus-strand DNA template containing the PPT region. The duplex substrates were incubated in the presence of dNTPs with reverse transcriptase, and the resulting extension products were examined on a 12% sequencing gel. To avoid cleavage of the extended 5′ end-labeled primer by the RNase H activity, we used the D468S mutant version of Ty1 RT, which lacks RNase H activity. Two PPT-containing oligoribonucleotide primers with 5′ termini at position −9 and 3′ ends at positions −1 and +7 were used to prime plus-strand DNA synthesis (see Fig. 2 for numbering; +1 represents the first base of the 3′ U3). The priming efficiency of the two RNA primers was compared with that of DNA primers of the same sequence. As shown in Fig. 2, full-length DNA extension products were observed for all primers. The DNA oligonucleotides primed DNA synthesis very efficiently because nearly all of the primers could be extended. In contrast, the RNA primers were poorly extended, although the PPT primer with a 3′ end at position −1 was more efficiently used than the primer with the 3′ end at position +7. In addition, we were unable to extend two different non-PPT RNA primers with Ty1 RT (data not shown). In a control experiment, we have found that the RNA primers were efficiently extended by T7 DNA polymerase (data not shown), demonstrating that the poor extension efficiency of the RNA primers is not because of a lower fraction of RNA annealed to the template. Our results are in line with observations that retroviral RTs also use PPT primers more efficiently than other RNA primers and that, in general, DNA primers are used more efficiently than RNA primers (22Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Schultz et al. (4Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34547-34555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that murine leukemia virus RT extends primers with 3′ ends positioned beyond the PPT-U3 border inefficiently, in agreement with our observation that the −9/−1 RNA primer was extended more efficiently than the −9/+7 primer. To better understand the mechanism by which the RNase H activity of Ty1 RT creates the PPT primer, we have examined the polymerase-dependent hydrolytic activity of Ty1 RT during minus-strand synthesis. We have also evaluated the parameters that influence RNase H cleavage of the PPT-containing primers in a polymerase-independent manner by using model hybrid substrates obtained by annealing short PPT-containing RNA primers to longer minus-strand DNA molecules. We previously analyzed Ty1 RT polymerase-dependent RNase H cleavage sites using a 35-nt RNA template/28-nt DNA primer as substrate (19Wilhelm M. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that the distance between the RNase H and polymerase active sites corresponded to the length of a 14-nt RNA/DNA heteroduplex. Here we anneal a 19-nt primer oligodeoxyribonucleotide, complementary to nt −10 to +9, with a 5′ end-labeled 61-nt RNA, which spans the Ty1 PPT sequence. This generates a partially duplex PPT-containing substrate (Fig. 3). When this duplex was incubated with RT, we observed major cleavage products between nt +4 and +5 and between nt −1 and +1(Fig. 3, lane 1). It is noteworthy that RNase H cleavage between nt −1 and +1 generates an RNA with the correct PPT primer 3′ terminus. Two other cleavage products between nt +3 and +4 and between nt +2 and +3 were observed. Next we examined the effect of primer extension on RNase H cleavage. In the presence of dATP, dTTP, and ddGTP, RT extended the 3′ end of the primer by 4 nucleotides. The major RNase H cleavage site (Fig. 3, lane 2) remained at 14 nt from the elongated 3′ primer terminus, as would be expected if hydrolysis was directed by the polymerase active site binding at the 3′ primer terminus. Cleavage to yield shorter products was not very efficient, probably because, after extension of the primer by 4 nt, the RNase H active site is placed on a PPT sequence resistant to RNase H digestion. In the presence of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and ddCTP, the primer was lengthened by 13 nt. As before, a cleavage site was observed 14 nt from the fully advanced primer 3′ terminus between nt −9 and −10 (Fig. 3, lane 3). In addition, shorter products were observed, because the RNase H active site was again able to reach sequences outside the −9/−1 RNase H-resistant PPT primer region. Interestingly, the cleavage between nt −1 and +1 was still observed when the primer was lengthened by 13 nt. This cleavage site was also observed when the primer was extended to full length in the presence of all four dNTPs (Fig. 3, lane 4). This finding can be explained by the property of Ty1 RT to make a specific internal cut at this site. Indeed, Schultz et al. (5Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32299-32309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown recently that murine leukemia virus RT is able to make specific internal cuts to generate the 3′ end of the PPT primer, and data of Powell and Levin (23Powell M.D. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that a HIV-1 PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrid is specifically cleaved at the 3′ end of the PPT by HIV-1 RT. Further, using long PPT-containing RNA/DNA hybrids, we find that Ty1 RT is able to make a specific internal cleavage at the 3′ end of the Ty1 PPT sequence (see Figs. 1 Band 7 below).Figure 7Internal cleavage of 61-base pair PPT-containing RNA/DNA duplexes. 5′ end-labeled 61-nt wild type, U-box mutant, and PPT mutant RNAs were annealed to 61-nt complementary minus-strand DNA (the sequence of the three RNAs are shown in Fig. 4). The RNA/DNA duplexes were incubated with Ty1 RT for 10 min. The digestion products were separated in a 8% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The relevant sequence of wild type plus-sense Ty1 RNA is shown. The bands corresponding to the cleavages that generate the 3′ and 5′ ends of the PPT primer are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next addressed whether RNA/DNA duplexes containing mutations in the PPT region were digested differently from the wild type substrate. For this purpose we used RNA templates with mutations in the PPT sequence and in the U-rich sequence upstream of the PPT (Fig. 4 A). Both mutations have been shown to abolish plus-strand priming in vivo (11Heyman T. Agoutin B. Friant S. Wilhelm F.X. Wilhelm M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Wilhelm M. Heyman T. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The 5′ end-labeled RNAs bearing the PPT or U-rich sequence mutations were annealed to 19-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides with compensatory mutations to restore complementarity to nt −10 to +9 of the RNA template and were incubated with RT. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the same sites were cleaved in the wild type and in the two mutant RNAs but differences in the intensity of cleavage at each site were observed. Of note, the band corresponding to the 3′ end of the PPT was the strongest in each case, and least influenced by the PPT or upstream mutations. Weak bands on the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 3 indicate that some sites in the −9/−1 PPT primer region are not completely resistant to RNase H cleavage. Several weak cleavage sites are observed within the PPT sequence. The most visible of these weak cleavage sites is between nt −5 and −6 (open arrow in Fig. 3, lane 2). To test if this cleavage site is directed by the polymerase active site binding at the 3′ primer terminus, a 28-nt oligodeoxyribonucleotide primer was annealed to the RNA template so that the RNase H active site of RT was positioned between nt −5 and −6, i.e. 14 nt downstream of the polymerase active site bound at the 3′ primer terminus. After incubating this substrate with RT, a cleavage site between nt −5 and −6 was indeed observed for the wild type and mutant RNAs (Fig. 4 C). The U-box mutant behaved similarly to the wild type. For the PPT mutant duplex, more extensive cleavage was observed and strong cuts occurred between nt −4 and −5 and −3 and −4 on each side of a G to C mutation in the PPT. This result is in line with the idea that mutations changing purines to pyrimidines within the −9/−1 PPT region increase the sensitivity of this sequence to RNase H hydrolysis. To test RNase H cleavage of RNA primers annealed near the initiation site of plus-strand DNA synthesis, a series of short oligonucleotides containing the PPT sequence were hybridized to a 61-nt minus-strand DNA spanning the PPT region. The hybrid substrates were incubated with RT, and the digestion products were examined on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. The effect of length of the PPT-containing RNA primers on RNase H cleavage was evaluated using a set of oligoribonucleotides (−18/−1, −13/−1, −12/−1, −11/−1, −10/−1, −9/−1) which had their 3′ termini at position −1 but differed in the length extending upstream of the plus-strand initiation site. The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 5. The shortest −9/−1 RNA primer remained mostly undigested. The other primers were cleaved into fragments of 8–10 nt. For the −13/−1, −12/−1, −11/−1, and −10/−1 primers, the RNase H cleavages occurred in the PPT upstream of the plus-strand initiation site (Fig. 5, A andB). This confirms the result shown above (Fig. 4) that RNase H is able to cleave RNA within the PPT sequence of arrested duplexes. The −18/−1 primer was cleaved into a 8-nt fragment, but, in this case, the cleavage site was outside of the PPT. These cleavages likely result from an RNA 5′ end-directed mechanism, which places the active site of Ty1 RT RNase H 8–10 nt from the 5′ end of the RNA. Our results are consistent with those found for HIV-1 in similar arrested complexes (3Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Kelleher C.D. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32299-32309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We next tested how substrates spanning the plus-strand initiation site were cleaved. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the two primers −9/+3 and −9/+7 that span the plus-strand initiation site were cleaved specifically to generate a product 9 nt in length with the correct PPT primer 3′ terminus at position −1. A mutant −9/+3 primer with two G to C mutations in the PPT did not yield the 9-nt fragment with the correct PPT primer terminus (Fig. 5 C, lane −9/+3 Mut PPT) but was digested at several sites, as was a non-PPT-containing substrate (Fig. 5 C, lane −43/−31 WT). In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 6, we have assessed the effect of mutations in U3 very close to the U3-PPT border on RNase H cleavage of −9/+7 primers. Three mutants were used. In MUT1, the wild type +1/+7 sequence uguugga was changed to ugcauga. In a previous report (17Wilhelm M. Heyman T. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we showed that this mutation had no effect on plus-strand priming in vivo. In MUT2, the +1/+7 sequence was changed to the sequence found 3′ of the inactive PPT3 sequence located in the middle of the Ty1 genome. In MUT3, the +1/+7 sequence was changed to the sequence found 3′ of the active central PPT2 (17Wilhelm M. Heyman T. Boutabout M. Wilhelm F.X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4547-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the mutant primers were digested similarly to the wild type primer and generated a product 9 nt in length with a correct PPT primer 3′ terminus at position −1. This indicates that the mutations in U3 do not affect the specificity of cleavage at the 3′ end of the PPT and is consistent with the observation of Champoux (2Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 103-117Google Scholar) that sequences downstream of the PPT have no detectable effect on priming specificity. Results discussed above suggest that a specific internal cleavage might generate the correct 3′ end of the PPT primer at position −1 in the absence of positioning of the polymerase active site of RT by the 5′ end of an RNA or by the 3′ end of newly synthesized DNA. We therefore examined the digestion pattern of three different RNA/DNA duplexes containing a 5′ end-labeled 61-nt RNA annealed with a complementary 61-nt DNA. One duplex contained the wild type PPT sequence; the two others had mutations in the PPT or in the U-box (the mutations shown in Fig. 4). Incubation of these duplexes with Ty1 RT generated several 5′ end-labeled fragments, 26–55 nt in size (Fig. 7). Because 5′ end-directed cleavage can generate fragments no longer than 8–10 nt, cleavage products longer than 10 nt represent internal cleavage of the 61-nt duplex. Cleavage of the wild type duplex generated fragments with 3′ end at positions +1, −1, −2, −4, −10, −11, and −13 to −16. Notably, internal cleavages can generate the 3′ and 5′ ends of the PPT, i.e.the fragment with 3′ end at position −1 has the correct 3′ end of the PPT and cleavage generating a 3′ end at position −10 generates a downstream fragment with the correct 5′ end of the PPT primer. Thus, if internal cleavages that generate the 3′ and 5′ ends of the PPT occur on the same molecule, the resulting −9/−1 RNA primer could be used to initiate correct plus-strand synthesis. Alternatively, a fragment with only one internal cleavage generating the 5′ end of the PPT could be cleaved specifically at position −1 by the 5′ end-directed mechanism. In that case, plus-strand synthesis could also be initiated correctly from this primer. In the duplex containing the U-box mutation, there was still specificity for cleavage at position −1, whereas the PPT mutant was only weakly digested at positions +1 and −1. For both mutants, there were no cleavages to produce fragments with 3′ end at positions −10. The main cleavage produced a fragment with a 3′ end at position −14. Thus, in mutant duplexes, internal cleavages on the same molecule would not generate the correct −9/−1 primer, but rather generate longer primers extending beyond position −9. Based on data presented above (Fig. 5), these longer primers would be subjected to 5′ end-directed cleavage by RNase H and would be cleaved within the PPT sequence. We speculate that the inability of RT to properly recognize and/or extend primers with incorrect termini could explain in vivo plus-strand synthesis inhibition in PPT and U-box mutants. To generate the primer for plus-strand DNA synthesis, the RNase H activity of retrovirus and retrotransposon RTs must make specific cleavages at the 3′ and 5′ ends of a RNase H-resistant polypurine tract. We have used model RNA/DNA duplexes spanning the PPT region of the Ty1 retrotransposon to investigate some of the parameters affecting Ty1 RNase H cleavage specificity. Our results indicate that the PPT sequence is relatively resistant to RNase H cleavage in vitro, although, in arrested complexes, when the RNase H active site interacts with residues within the PPT, hydrolysis of this sequence can occur. It has been suggested that the low efficiency of cleavage of the PPT stems from the structure of the purine-rich duplex,i.e. RNA/DNA duplexes with a narrow minor groove tend to be resistant to cleavage, whereas duplexes with a minor groove width of 9–10 Å are optimally digested by RNase H (24Fedoroff O. Salazar M. Reid B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 25Fedoroff O.Y. Ge Y. Reid B.R. J. Mol.

The most striking structural feature of the PPT bound to RT is a departure from Watson-Crick base pairing with a melting of the first 2 bp of the PPT. Sarafianos et al. (29Sarafianos S.G. Das K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) suggest that this “unzipping of the PPT” may play a role in the resistance of the PPT to RNase H. It remains to be seen if a similar unzipping of the PPT occurs in other retroelements."

These host cell factors may provide additional drug targets or otherwise influence the ability of a putative inhibitor to successfully inhibit integration. However, relatively little is known about PIC-mediated integration as an enzymatic process, and it has been difficult to construct a high-throughput assay for integration by PICs. Several groups have studied the influence of the target DNA upon PIC integration. PICs prefer to integrate into regions of distorted DNA (16Bor Y.C. Bushman F.D. Orgel L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10334-10338Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) such as nucleosomes (17Pryciak P.M. Varmus H.E.

A. 1994; 91: 5913-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and tend to avoid integration sites upstream of a pyrimidine nucleotide (19Bor Y.C. Miller M.D. Bushman F.D. Orgel L.E. Virology. 1996; 222: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Not addressed in these studies, however, is the issue of target DNA size, which has inherent effects on substrate mobility. The present report describes an entirely fluid phase assay in which integration junctions are directly detected using PCR amplification. The only molecules that score as positive in this assay result from an actual joining of viral cDNA and target DNA. A uniquely designed DNA substrate is used to maintain amplicon size within the optimum limits for real-time fluorescence-monitored PCR detection. By comparing a single target DNA sequence of 105 bp with longer concatemers of the same sequence, the preference of PICs for longer target DNA was clearly demonstrated. A model is presented which suggests that long DNA is preferred because its decreased rate of diffusion allows more time for the rate-limiting “target commitment” stage of PIC integration. Incorporating this information into the assay yielded a sensitive, robust, and adaptable platform for the discovery of drugs that inhibit integration by PICs. This assay was used to detect host cell factors that reconstituted the integration competence of salt-stripped PICs. Plasmid DNA containing head-to-tail concatemers encoding for drag-line silk protein was kindly provided by Dr. David Kaplan, Biotechnology Center, Tufts University (20Prince J.T. McGrath K.P. DiGirolamo C.M. Kaplan D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10879-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 21Winkler S. Wilson D. Kaplan D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12739-12746Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformed Escherichia coliDH5a and purified using a Maxi Prep Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The insert in the plasmid contained monomeric units of 105 bp repeated 32 times. Insert DNA was prepared by overnight digestion withBamHI (which creates the protruding 5′ ends favored by λ exonuclease, described below), purified by electrophoresis in agarose, and isolated using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). To prepare single monomeric units of the 105-bp sequence, insert DNA was digested with StyI (which cleaves between each unit) and similarly gel purified. The real-time PCR (TaqMan) detection of integration junctions used the following oligonucleotides: forward primer LTRTaq5, 5′-GTGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTG-3′; reverse primer SILKREV1a, 5′-CAGCACCGCCCATTGC-3′; and probe LTRTaqP, 5′-FAM-CTGGTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAG-TAMRA-3′ (purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies, Inc., San Diego, CA). In some experiments, integration reactions were also amplified by hemi-nested PCR using the following additional oligonucleotides: HIVout, 5′-CAATAAAGCTTGCCTTGAGTGC-3′; and HIVin2, 5′-AGTAGTGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTG-3′. PICs were prepared from the detergent lysates of cells acutely infected by HIV-1LAI (LAV-1 strain) (22Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4164-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23Ellison V. Abrams H. Roe T. Lifson J. Brown P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2711-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CEM cells were infected by HIV-1LAI under BSL-3 conditions and cultured for 7–10 days until cytopathic changes (ballooning and apoptosis) were evident in the majority of cells by phase microscopic examination (24Terai C. Kornbluth R.S. Pauza C.D. Richman D.D. Carson D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Then, the cells were counted and co-cultured with a 10-fold excess of SupT1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2 in a flask placed on end so that the infected CEM cells and the uninfected SupT1 cells came into contact. After 5–7 h, when the cultures consisted of about 80% syncytia just large enough to be visible to the unaided eye, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 160 × gfor 5 min. The cells were washed once by gently resuspending them in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin (Buffer A of Ellison et al. (23Ellison V. Abrams H. Roe T. Lifson J. Brown P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2711-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and pelleting them again by centrifugation. Then, based on the original cell counts of the culture, the pellet was resuspended in Buffer A plus 0.025% digitonin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml for 10 min at room temperature. The nuclei in the cell lysate were then pelleted at 1,000 ×g at 4 °C for 3 min in an Avanti 30 centrifuge with a F2402H rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). The post-nuclear supernatant was moved to a new microtube and the remaining cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Forty percent sucrose was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 8% sucrose final, and the PIC-containing cytoplasmic extract was aliquotted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. PIC activity was stable at this temperature for at least six months. Typically, these extracts contained ∼0.8 mg/ml total protein measured using the BCA reagent (Pierce Chemical Corp., Rockford, IL), and 0.5–2.0 × 108/ml copies of HIV-1 cDNA as quantified by real-time fluorescence-monitored PCR using the LTR-specific primers and TaqMan probe described by Rossio et al. (25Rossio J.L. Esser M.T. Suryanarayana K. Schneider D.K. Bess Jr., J.W. Vasquez G.M. Wiltrout T.A. Chertova E. Grimes M.K. Sattentau Q. Arthur L.O. Henderson L.E. Lifson J.D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7992-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integration reactions (15 μl total volume) were prepared on ice in 200-μl thin-walled PCR tubes (either in 8-tube strips or in 96-well plates) by adding 5 μl of a master mixture consisting of 1 μl of target DNA (3.3–100 ng/μl, with 11–33 ng/μl S32 concatemer being optimal for general use), 1.5 μl of 10 × integration buffer (200 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and 2.5 μl of 30% PEG-8000 (Sigma). Then, 10 μl of PIC-containing cytoplasmic extract was added and the tube contents were mixed by pipetting up and down. The tubes were kept on ice and placed in a thermocycler (GeneAmp 9600, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 45 min, and then at 60 °C for 5 min. Unreacted target DNA was removed by adding 3–5 units of λ exonuclease in 15 μl of a 2 × concentration of its supplied buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The tubes (now containing 30 μl) were returned to the thermocycler and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min (which allows the λ exonuclease to degrade the target DNA) followed by 75 °C for 10 min (to heat-inactivate the λ exonuclease). The processing was completed by adding 20 μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml in water) and incubating in the thermocycler at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by heat inactivation at 95 °C for 15 min. The processed integration reactions (now 50 μl in volume) could be stored at 4 °C for at least 1 week prior to TaqMan analysis. In some experiments, processed and unprocessed reactions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, staining with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and visualization with UV light. In some experiments, the λ exonuclease and proteinase K-processed integration reaction mixtures were diluted 10-fold in water and then analyzed by real-time PCR. For integration reactions containing colored integration inhibitors, the inhibitor was removed by concentration/filtration of the processed integration reaction mixtures using Microcon PCR 96-well plates according to the manufacturer's protocol (Millipore, Bedford, MA). TaqMan reactions were set up in optical grade 96-well thermocycler plates by adding 20 μl of a master mixture containing 12.5 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix 2X (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 μl each of 9 μm LTRTaq5 and SILKREV1a amplification primers (900 nm final concentration), and 2.5 μl of 2 μm LTRTaq5P probe (200 nm final concentration). Five μl of the processed integration reaction was added to each well, and the tube contents were mixed by pipetting up and down. Real-time fluorescence-monitored PCR reactions (TaqMan) were performed on an Applied Biosystems Model 7700 Sequence Detection System. The temperature profile for the reaction was: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and then 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 45 cycles. Using the manufacturer's software, the cycle number at which fluorescence exceeded background (C t) was determined for each well. For each real-time PCR analysis, a standard curve was generated using dilutions in water of a cloned integration junction (below) calculated to provide 3, 10, 100, and 1000 integration junctions per well. The reactions were set up as 2- or 3-fold replicates and typically differed by less than 0.4 C t. To deduce the number of integration junctions in each sample, its C tvalue was compared with the cloned integration junction standard curve following linear regression analysis. Because each TaqMan reaction used only 5 μl of the 50 μl of processed integration reaction, the number of integration junctions was then multiplied by 10 to arrive at the number of integration events produced by the original 10 μl of PIC-containing cytoplasmic extract. If the processed reaction was diluted prior to TaqMan analysis, then an additional correction was made for the dilution factor. No correction was made, however, for the presumably equal number of integrations into the other, unmeasured strand of the target DNA. Statistical calculations were performed using the InStat software program (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Hemi-nested PCR was used to isolate PCR products in order to confirm that the method identifies integration junctions. For the first round of PCR, integration reactions were diluted 1:1,000 in water and 5 μl was amplified in a 25-μl reaction using HIVout and SILKREV1a (above) and HotStarTaq (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were heated to 95 °C for 15 min; then 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles; and finally 72 °C for 10 min. The first round reaction products were then diluted 1:100 with water and re-amplified in an identical manner using HIVin2 and SILKREV1a. The final products were electrophoresed in agarose, isolated using a using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Dye-terminator sequencing of eight clones was performed by the Molecular Biology Core of the UCSD Center for AIDS Research using the kit-supplied primers. One of the sequenced clones was used to create an integration junction standard curve in the TaqMan reaction above. Salt-stripped PICs were prepared by a modification of the methods of Lee and Craigie (26Lee M.S. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and Chen and Engelman (15Chen H. Engelman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15270-15274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 500 μl of PIC-containing cytoplasmic extract was diluted in an equal volume of Buffer A (above) containing 0.025% digitonin but formulated without KCl to reduce the salt concentration to 75 mm. The diluted PICs were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then pelleted at 8,000 × g for 20 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. The barely visible pellet was then resuspended in 170 μl of Buffer A with 1.2 m KCl and incubated for 30 min on ice. Then, the hypertonic PIC solution was loaded onto a Sepharose CL-4B column (2.2 ml bed volume) that had been pre-equilibrated in the same buffer (but not pretreated with bovine serum albumin). The column was placed in a tube and centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. About 1,500 μl was retrieved from each column and then concentrated to about 40 μl by centrifugation at 800 × g in a Microcon-100 ultrafiltration unit (Millipore), taking care not to allow the sample to concentrate to dryness. The amount of HIV LTR cDNA was then quantified by TaqMan (above) so that samples could be adjusted to equal numbers of PICs before placing them in the integration assay. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from uninfected SupT1 cells using exactly the same protocol used to prepare PIC-containing extracts. 5 μl of this extract was added to 2 μl of salt-stripped PICs and incubated on ice for 15 min. Then, 5 μl of Buffer A without salt was added to bring the KCl concentration down to about 262 mm, and the mixture was incubated on ice for another 15 min to allow the cytoplasmic proteins to assemble onto the salt-stripped PICs. Then, 10 μl of this mixture was analyzed in the integration assay above. To investigate the effect of target DNA length on the efficiency of integration, we chose a concatemeric DNA substrate containing 32 head-to-tail monomeric units encoding dragline silk, a natural protein composed of repeating units (27Winkler S. Szela S. Avtges P. Valluzzi R. Kirschner D.A. Kaplan D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1999; 24: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To amplify integration junctions, PCR primers were designed to hybridize to the 3′ LTR of HIV-1 (forward primer) and the silk target DNA (reverse primer). The concatemeric arrangement of the target DNA places a binding site for the reverse primer within a short distance (≤183 bp) from the LTR forward primer and effectively limits amplicon size to a length that is optimal for TaqMan detection. Although both the 5′ and 3′ LTRs integrate into the target DNA during concerted integration, only the integration of the 3′ LTR was analyzed in these studies. Also, although HIV can integrate into the target DNA in either orientation, the assay only detects integration junctions in one of the two target DNA strands (shown as the top strand in Fig. 1). As a first test of the PCR system depicted in Fig. 1, amplicons containing putative integration junctions were isolated by hemi-nested PCR and cloned into a plasmid. Sequencing analysis revealed that the integrations had occurred into various sites of the target DNA, with a possible “hot spot” immediately 5′ to the reverse primer (data not shown). In several cases, the cloned amplicons contained an additional monomeric unit of target DNA on their 3′ end resulting from the hybridization of the reverse primer to a binding site in the next unit adjacent to the integration site. To validate the real-time PCR detection step, control reactions were set up lacking either PICs or target DNA. As expected for a 45-cycle real-time PCR, these negative control integration reactions yielded C t values equal to 45, indicating that no integration junctions were detected. To quantify positive reactions, dilutions of a cloned integration junction were prepared to create the standard curves used to relate the C t values obtained from an unknown sample to the number of integration events that occurred. When reaction mixtures were diluted prior to detection, the final number of integration events reported was calculated by multiplying by the dilution factor. No correction was performed to account for the presumably equal number of integrations that occurred into the opposite, unmeasured strand of the target DNA. Fig. 2 presents data representative of five experiments. When PICs and target DNA were both present in an integration reaction and the λ exonuclease processing step was omitted, a signal corresponding to 500–1,000 integration events was detected. If the reaction mixtures were diluted prior to PCR, however, the number of integration events detected (corrected for the dilution factor) increased, indicating that the reaction mixtures contained an inhibitor for the PCR detection step. This disturbing nonlinearity likely explains why there has been no previous report of a quantitative PIC assay based upon the PCR quantification of integration junctions. After an exhaustive analysis, it was determined that the principal cause of this inhibition of detection is the carryover into the PCR detection step of unreacted target DNA, which contains a very large number of binding sites for the reverse primer. For example, the addition of target DNA, but not irrelevant plasmid DNA, to a cloned integration junction dramatically inhibited real-time PCR detection. As a first approach to solve this problem, the concentration of the reverse primer was increased 10-fold (to 9 μm final concentration) which completely reversed the inhibitory effects of target DNA on the detection of 10 and 100 copies of a cloned integration junction. However, for the integration junctions generated by PICs in the reaction mixtures, PCR amplification critically depends upon the reverse primer creating the complementary strand to which the forward primer binds (whereas this strand pre-exists when a cloned integration junction is used). In this case, a simple increase in the reverse primer concentration was not sufficient to eliminate the nonlinearity of the assay (data not shown). A close examination of the amplification plots revealed an additional problem caused by the carry-over of target DNA into the TaqMan reaction. In these cases, the slope of the amplification plot was markedly less than that of the cloned integration junction that was used as a standard. In effect, the target DNA prevented the amount of product from doubling with each cycle of PCR. The atypical shape of the amplification plots from the samples containing target DNA reduced the sensitivity of the TaqMan analysis by raising the apparentC t, and also precluded the possibility of converting the assay to an end point detection format. Fortunately, two strategies were found which succeeded in removing the nonlinearity of the assay by reducing or eliminating the carryover of target DNA into the PCR detection step. The first strategy is simply to dilute the integration reaction mixtures prior to PCR detection. However, the drawback of diluting the reaction mixtures is that this also dilutes the integration junctions that the real-time PCR aims to detect. For example, diluting the reaction mixtures beyond 100-fold prior to TaqMan detection generally resulted in C tvalues outside of the dynamic range of the assay. A second strategy is to selectively remove the target DNA in order to prevent it from inhibiting the PCR detection step. This approach was not associated with the loss of sensitivity that occurred when the dilution method is employed. λ Exonuclease, which degrades double-stranded DNA containing phosphorylated, protruding 5′ ends, was employed for target DNA removal prior to the PCR detection step. An examination of the λ exonuclease-treated reactions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SYBR Gold nucleic acid staining showed that all visible DNA in the reactions had been removed (data not shown). However, integration junctions evidently survive this λ exonuclease step because PIC proteins bound to the DNA block the 5′ → 3′ digestive action of this exonuclease as it approaches the integration site (12Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These PIC proteins may be part of the complex (the “intasome”) that has been detected on the ends of integrated Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR DNA using a sensitive DNA footprinting method (28Wei S.Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Supporting the concept that λ exonuclease effects the selective removal of target DNA, pretreatment of an integration reaction with λ exonuclease prior to detection consistently resulted in a 4–10-fold increase in detection sensitivity (Fig. 2). Also, the amplification plots of the λ exonuclease-treated samples showed a normal slope in parallel to the cloned integration junction standards, which could be important for converting the assay into a simplified end point detection format. To study the effects of target DNA length on the efficiency of PIC integration in vitro, target DNAs consisting of either 1 (S1) or 32 (S32) monomeric units of the same silk coding sequence were used in the integration assay system (Fig. 3). Two major conclusions were drawn from these experiments: 1) for a given number of monomeric units of target DNA present in the integration reaction, the concatemerization of those units into a longer molecule resulted in a 2- to >10-fold increase in the integration efficiency. 2) Overall, integration efficiency rises with an increase in the amount of target DNA molecules (in terms of monomeric units) (Fig. 3). This indicates that the amount of target DNA in the integration reaction must be kept high in order to maximize the number of integration events, even though the carryover of target DNA inhibits the subsequent real-time PCR detection step. As a counterbalancing factor, the linearity of the assay for PICs is best at ≤9.27 × 1010 monomers/15 μl reaction (see below and data not shown), a concentration where only the 32-mer can be used. To validate that the integration assay system using long target DNA concatemers can actually measure integration-competent PICs, PIC extracts were serially diluted and then assayed. Based on the data obtained in the experiments described above, the number of integration events was quantified in undiluted integration reactions using 32-mer concatemeric target DNA and λ exonuclease treatment in order to maximize detection efficiency. As shown (Fig. 4), the number of integration events decreased proportionally to PIC dilution. For the PIC extract tested, dilutions beyond 9-fold producedC t values that were outside of the linear range of the assay. In other experiments, the target DNA concentration was reduced resulting in less inhibition of the real-time PCR detection step. In these cases, integration events were detectable in PIC extracts diluted 27-fold, even though the absolute number of integration events at eac"
https://openalex.org/W2016031063,"To investigate the structural context of the fusion peptide region in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 gp21, maltose-binding protein (MBP) was used as an N-terminal solubilization partner for the entire gp21 ectodomain (residues 313–445) and C-terminally truncated ectodomain fragments. The bacterial expression of the MBP/gp21 chimeras resulted in soluble trimers containing intramonomer disulfide bonds. Detergents blocked the proteolytic cleavage of fusion peptide residues in the MBP/gp21-(313–425) chimera, indicating that the fusion peptide is available for interaction with detergent despite the presence of an N-terminal MBP domain. Limited proteolysis experiments indicated that the transmembrane domain proximal sequence Thr<sup>425</sup>–Ala<sup>439</sup> protects fusion peptide residues from chymotrypsin. MBP/gp21 chimera stability therefore depends on a functional interaction between N-terminal and transmembrane domain proximal regions in a gp21 helical hairpin structure. In addition, thermal aggregation experiments indicated that the Thr<sup>425</sup>–Ser<sup>436</sup> sequence confers stability to the fusion peptide-containing MBP/gp21 chimeras. The functional role of the transmembrane domain proximal sequence was assessed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the full-length envelope glycoprotein, with 11 of 12 single alanine substitutions resulting in 1.5- to 4.5-fold enhancements in cell-cell fusion activity. By contrast, single alanine substitutions in MBP/gp21 did not significantly alter chimera stability, indicating that multiple residues within the transmembrane domain proximal region and the fusion peptide and adjacent glycine-rich segment contribute to stability, thereby mitigating the potential effects of the substitutions. The fusion-enhancing effects of the substitutions are therefore likely to be caused by alteration of the prefusion complex. Our observations suggest that the function of the transmembrane domain proximal sequence in the prefusion envelope glycoprotein is distinct from its role in stabilizing the fusion peptide region in the fusion-activated helical hairpin conformation of gp21."
