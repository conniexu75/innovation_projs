https://openalex.org/W2083904901,"Microtubule-dependent motor, murine KIF3B, was disrupted by gene targeting. The null mutants did not survive beyond midgestation, exhibiting growth retardation, pericardial sac ballooning, and neural tube disorganization. Prominently, the left-right asymmetry was randomized in the heart loop and the direction of embryonic turning. lefty-2 expression was either bilateral or absent. Furthermore, the node lacked monocilia while the basal bodies were present. Immunocytochemistry revealed KIF3B localization in wild-type nodal cilia. Video microscopy showed that these cilia were motile and generated a leftward flow. These data suggest that KIF3B is essential for the left-right determination through intraciliary transportation of materials for ciliogenesis of motile primary cilia that could produce a gradient of putative morphogen along the left-right axis in the node."

The basis of this activity is its ability to maintain a pool of pluripotent stem cells, which are the ultimate source of all tissues of the shoot. In Arabidopsis plants mutant for the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene, the stem cells are misspecified and appear to undergo differentiation. Here, we show that WUS encodes a novel homeodomain protein which presumably acts as a transcriptional regulator. The pattern of WUS expression suggests that stem cells in the shoot meristem are specified by an underlying cell group which is established in the 16-cell embryo and becomes localized to its prospective domain of function by asymmetric cell divisions."
https://openalex.org/W1975244118,"Smads transmit signals from transmembrane ser/thr kinase receptors to the nucleus. We now identify SARA (for S mad a nchor for r eceptor a ctivation), a FYVE domain protein that interacts directly with Smad2 and Smad3. SARA functions to recruit Smad2 to the TGFβ receptor by controlling the subcellular localization of Smad2 and by interacting with the TGFβ receptor complex. Phosphorylation of Smad2 induces dissociation from SARA with concomitant formation of Smad2/Smad4 complexes and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, mutations in SARA that cause mislocalization of Smad2 inhibit TGFβ-dependent transcriptional responses, indicating that the regulation of Smad localization is important for TGFβ signaling. These results thus define SARA as a component of the TGFβ pathway that brings the Smad substrate to the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2121652706,"The inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha, sequesters the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, as an inactive complex in the cytoplasm. The structure of the IkappaBalpha ankyrin repeat domain, bound to a partially truncated NF-kappaB heterodimer (p50/ p65), has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.7 A resolution. It shows a stack of six IkappaBalpha ankyrin repeats facing the C-terminal domains of the NF-kappaB Rel homology regions. Contacts occur in discontinuous patches, suggesting a combinatorial quality for ankyrin repeat specificity. The first two repeats cover an alpha helically ordered segment containing the p65 nuclear localization signal. The position of the sixth ankyrin repeat shows that full-length IkappaBalpha will occlude the NF-kappaB DNA-binding cleft. The orientation of IkappaBalpha in the complex places its N- and C-terminal regions in appropriate locations for their known regulatory functions."

https://openalex.org/W1965476757,"Sorting of signal-transducing cell surface receptors within multivesicular bodies (MVBs) is required for their rapid down-regulation and degradation within lysosomes. Yeast mutants defective in late stages of transport to the vacuole/lysosome accumulate MVBs. We demonstrate that the membrane glycoprotein carboxypeptidase S and the G protein–coupled receptor Ste2p are targeted into the vacuole lumen, and this process requires a subset of VPS gene products essential for normal endosome function. The PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase activity of Fab1p, which converts the product of the Vps34p PtdIns 3-kinase PtdIns(3)P into PtdIns(3,5)P2, also is required for cargo-selective sorting into the vacuole lumen. These findings demonstrate a role for phosphoinositide signaling at distinct stages of vacuolar/lysosomal protein transport and couple PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis to regulation of MVB sorting."

https://openalex.org/W2023877008,"IkappaBalpha regulates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through the formation of stable IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB complexes. Prior to induction, IkappaBalpha retains NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm until the NF-kappaB activation signal is received. After activation, NF-kappaB is removed from gene promoters through association with nuclear IkappaBalpha, restoring the preinduction state. The 2.3 A crystal structure of IkappaBalpha in complex with the NF-kappaB p50/p65 heterodimer reveals mechanisms of these inhibitory activities. The presence of IkappaBalpha allows large en bloc movement of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit amino-terminal domain. This conformational change induces allosteric inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA binding. Amino acid residues immediately preceding the nuclear localization signals of both NF-kappaB p50 and p65 subunits are tethered to the IkappaBalpha amino-terminal ankyrin repeats, impeding NF-kappaB from nuclear import machinery recognition."
https://openalex.org/W163411833,"FhuA protein facilitates ligand-gated transport of ferrichrome-bound iron across Escherichia coli outer membranes. X-ray analysis at 2.7 A resolution reveals two distinct conformations in the presence and absence of ferrichrome. The monomeric protein consists of a hollow, 22-stranded, antiparallel beta barrel (residues 160-714), which is obstructed by a plug (residues 19-159). The binding site of ferrichrome, an aromatic pocket near the cell surface, undergoes minor changes upon association with the ligand. These are propagated and amplified across the plug, eventually resulting in substantially different protein conformations at the periplasmic face. Our findings reveal the mechanism of signal transmission and suggest how the energy-transducing TonB complex senses ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2009266803,"The circuits that control movement are comprised of discrete subtypes of motor neurons. How motor neuron subclasses develop and extend axons to their correct targets is still poorly understood. We show that LIM homeodomain factors Lhx3 and Lhx4 are expressed transiently in motor neurons whose axons emerge ventrally from the neural tube (v-MN). Motor neurons develop in embryos deficient in both Lhx3 and Lhx4, but v-MN cells switch their subclass identity to become motor neurons that extend axons dorsally from the neural tube (d-MN). Conversely, the misexpression of Lhx3 in dorsal-exiting motor neurons is sufficient to reorient their axonal projections ventrally. Thus, Lhx3 and Lhx4 act in a binary fashion during a brief period in development to specify the trajectory of motor axons from the neural tube."
https://openalex.org/W2105961658,"Basement membranes are composed of ordered arrays of characteristic extracellular matrix proteins, but little is known about the assembly of these structures in vivo. We have investigated the function of dystroglycan, a cell-surface laminin receptor expressed by cells contacting basement membranes in developing and adult tissues. We find that dystroglycan is required for the formation of a basement membrane in embryoid bodies. Our results further indicate that dystroglycan–laminin interactions are prerequisite for the deposition of other basement membrane proteins. Dystroglycan may exert its influence on basement membrane assembly by binding soluble laminin and organizing it on the cell surface. These data establish a role for dystroglycan in the assembly of basement membranes and suggest fundamental mechanisms underlying this process."

https://openalex.org/W1973607853,"Proteins with SH2 and SH3 domains link tyrosine kinases to intracellular pathways. To investigate the biological functions of a mammalian SH2/SH3 adaptor, we have introduced a null mutation into the mouse gene for Grb2. Analysis of mutant embryonic stem cells, embryos, and chimeras reveals that Grb2 is required during embyrogenesis for the differentiation of endodermal cells and formation of the epiblast. Grb2 acts physiologically as an adaptor, since replacing the C terminus of the Ras activator Sos1 with the Grb2 SH2 domain yields a fusion protein that largely rescues the defects caused by the Grb2 mutation. Furthermore, Grb2 is rate limiting for mammary carcinomas induced by polyomavirus middle T antigen. These data provide genetic evidence for a mammalian Grb2-Ras signaling pathway, mediated by SH2/SH3 domain interactions, that has multiple functions in embryogenesis and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2078937868,"Infectivity of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense to humans is due to its resistance to a lytic factor present in human serum. In the ETat 1 strain this character was associated with antigenic variation, since expression of the ETat 1.10 variant surface glycoprotein was required to generate resistant (R) clones. In addition, in this strain transcription of a gene termed SRA was detected in R clones only. We show that the ETat 1.10 expression site is the one selectively transcribed in R variants. This expression site contains SRA as an expression site-associated gene (ESAG) and is characterized by the deletion of several ESAGs. Transfection of SRA into T.b. brucei was sufficient to confer resistance to human serum, identifying this gene as one of those responsible for T.b. rhodesiense adaptation to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2111667046,"Bactenecin, a 12-amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide from bovine neutrophils, has two cysteine residues, which form one disulfide bond, making it a cyclic molecule. To study the importance of the disulfide bond, a linear derivative Bac2S was made and the reduced form (linear bactenecin) was also included in this study. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that bactenecin existed as a type I β-turn structure regardless of its environment, while the reduced form and linear bactenecin adopted different conformations according to the lipophilicity of the environment. Bactenecin was more active against the Gram-negative wild type bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium than its linear derivative and reduced form, while all three peptides were equally active against the outer membrane barrier-defective mutants of the first two bacteria. Only the two linear peptides showed activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus facaelis. Bactenecin interacted well with the outer membrane and its higher affinity forE. coli UB1005 lipopolysaccharide and improved ability to permeabilize the outer membrane seemed to account for its better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The interaction of bactenecin with the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by its ability to dissipate the membrane potential by using the fluorescence probe 3,3-dipropylthiacarbocyanine and an outer membrane barrier-defective mutant E. coli DC2. It was shown that the linear derivative and reduced form were able to dissipate the membrane potential at much lower concentrations than bactenecin despite the similar minimal inhibitory concentrations of all three against this barrier-defective mutant."

https://openalex.org/W2016589902,"Bovine β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) has been studied extensively in both the isolated and the naturally occurring states. It is a commercially important whey protein of obvious nutritional value but, so far, one that has no clearly identified biological function. In common with many of the other members of the lipocalin family to which it belongs, β-Lg binds hydrophobic ligands, and it appears possible that there are at least two distinct binding sites per monomer for a variety of ligands. By comparison with other members of the family, there is a probable binding site in the central cavity of the molecule that is formed by the eight antiparallel β-strands that are typical of the lipocalins. We have now cocrystallized β-Lg with palmitic acid, and the refined structure (R = 0.204, R free = 0.240 for 6,888 reflections to 2.5-Å resolution) reveals that the ligand binds in the central cavity in a manner similar to the binding of retinol to the related lipocalin, serum retinol-binding protein. The carboxyl group binds to both Lys-60 and Lys-69 at the entrance to the cavity. The hydrophobic tail stretches in an almost fully extended conformation into the center of the protein. This is the first direct observation of a ligand binding to β-Lg. Bovine β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) has been studied extensively in both the isolated and the naturally occurring states.

This is the first direct observation of a ligand binding to β-Lg. β-lactoglobulin. The lipocalin family is a large and diverse family of proteins with functions varying from insect camouflage to small hydrophobic molecule transport typified by the serum retinol-binding protein (1Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). The crystal structures so far determined reveal the typical lipocalin to be an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel arranged to form a conical central calyx or cavity in which the hydrophobic ligand is located (2Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Aqvist J. Sundelin J. Erikkson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). There is an α-helix on the outer surface of the β-barrel, and the amino acid sequence contains three structurally conserved regions (sequence motifs) together with one or more disulfide bridges (see Fig. 1). The calycin superfamily (1Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) extends the family to include proteins such as the fatty acid-binding proteins, which do not contain the second of these three sequence patterns but which are also antiparallel β-sheet proteins, although with 10 β-strands rather than 8. However, in common with their distant lipocalin relatives, their binding site is also within a central cavity (3Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z.H. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not only is β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg),1 from the milk of the domestic cow, a typical lipocalin, but it has also been studied extensively over the past 60 years (see Refs. 4Tilley J.M.A. Dairy Sci. Abstr. 1960; 22: 111-125Google Scholar, 5Lyster R.L.J. J. Dairy Res. 1972; 39: 279-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Hambling S.G. McAlpine A.S. Sawyer L. Fox P.F. Advanced Dairy Chemistry, I: Protein Chemistry. Elsevier, Amsterdam1992: 141-190Google Scholar) because of its size, convenience (∼3 g/liter of milk), and stability. The ruminant protein is normally a dimer at room temperature and physiological pH, although at pH values below 3 and above 8, it dissociates into monomers, for which the structure at low pH is similar to that at pH 7 (7Ragona L. Pusteria F. Zetta L. Monaco H.L. Molinari H. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A further reason for studying β-Lg is its involvement in the loss of functionality during the heat processing of milk (8Fox P.F. Heat Induced Changes in Milk. 2nd Ed. International Dairy Federation, Brussels, Belgium1995Google Scholar). Thus, many studies on the pure protein are being directed toward unraveling the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for its thermal denaturation because this denaturation is thought to initiate the wider aggregation of milk proteins during thermal processing (9Roefs S.P.F.M. De Kruif K.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 10Noh B. Richardson T. Creamer L.K. J.

The initial stage of the thermal denaturation process also involves dimer dissociation (12Gezimati J. Creamer L.K. Singh H. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 1130-1136Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Qi X.L. Holt C. McNulty D. Clarke D.T. Brownlow S. Jones G.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The biological function of β-Lg is unknown. The amino acid composition and the quantities present in ruminant species support a nutritional role. However, the ligand binding properties that have emerged, coupled with the structural similarity of β-Lg to retinol-binding protein and possibly even to fatty acid-binding protein, have led to the suggestion that it has a transport role for ligands such as retinol or fatty acids (1Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 2Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Aqvist J. Sundelin J. Erikkson U. Rask L. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1451-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 14Perez M.D. Calvo M. J. Dairy Sci. 1995; 78: 978-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Rocha T.L. Brownlow S. Saddler K.N. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Sawyer L. J. Dairy Res. 1996; 63: 575-584Crossref Google Scholar, 16Brownlow S. Morais Cabral J.H. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The majority of the ligands that have been examined are hydrophobic, so that a transport role, in keeping with the other lipocalins, is certainly possible, although no real proof of such a role has been published. Fatty acids have been found bound to ruminant β-Lg that has been freshly isolated from milk, and Perez et al. (17Perez M.D. Sanchez L. Aranda P. Ena J.M Oria R. Calvo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1123: 151-155Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have suggested that by removing free fatty acids as they are formed by pregastric lipases, β-Lg could facilitate the digestion of milk fat. If such a role is the true function of β-Lg, it is interesting that ruminant, but not mare and sow, β-Lgs exhibit significant fatty acid binding (18Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), whereas one might expect all β-Lgs to perform this function. On the other hand, β-Lg from all species appears to bind retinol, but this ligand is found associated not only with β-Lg but also with other milk proteins such as serum albumin and α-lactalbumin (18Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), indicating that this interaction seems to be rather unspecific. Thus, the functional relevance of retinol binding to β-Lg is also open to question. As part of our continuing study of the relationship between the structure of the protein and the thermally induced aggregation, we sought convincing evidence of the binding of hydrophobic ligands to the molecule. Monaco et al. (19Monaco H.L. Zanotti G. Spadon P. Bolognesi M. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) reported a possible binding site for retinol on the outer surface of the molecule in a groove formed between the helix and the β-sheet. This result, which has been questioned (16Brownlow S. Morais Cabral J.H. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Narayan M. Berliner L.J.

Dairy J. 1998; 8: 65-72Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is based upon an unrefined difference electron density map. Apart from the location by analogy and modeling ((21, 22), some experimental evidence for an internal binding site comes from the fluorescence and site-directed mutagenesis work of Choet al. (23Cho Y. Batt C.A. Sawyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11102-11107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of two independent ligand binding sites as proposed by Narayan and Berliner (20Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 1906-1911Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) adds further support to the possible existence of a central site (see Fig.1). However, to provide unequivocal evidence, we have now refined the crystal structure of β-Lg co-crystallized with palmitate from sodium citrate solution at pH 7.5 and observed the binding of the ligand in the central calyx. The crystalline complex was prepared in two distinct ways. In the first method, bovine β-Lg (B variant, Sigma) was dissolved in H2O to a concentration of 40 mg/ml and crystallized at 20 °C by the sitting drop method (24Ducruix A. Giegé R. Crystallisation of Nucleic Acids and Proteins. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 73-98Google Scholar) using 1.34 msodium citrate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, as the precipitant. Typically, a microbridge was placed in 1.0 ml of precipitant solution (the reservoir) in a 24-well Linbro tissue culture plate. For a sitting drop, 4 μl of β-Lg solution was added to 12 μl of reservoir solution. Then, 0.4 μl of 100 mm palmitic acid in ethanol was added to the drop (a molar ratio of 10/protein dimer) and mixed by pipette before the well was sealed with a glass coverslip. Because the palmitic acid was supersaturated with respect to the aqueous phase, a white precipitate appeared in the drop. After ∼4–5 days, the white precipitate had disappeared, and lattice Z crystals (space group P3221) grew from the clear drops. The pH of the crystals was assumed to be 7.5, although it was not directly measured. In the second method, bovine β-Lg of mixed genetic variants A and B was prepared according to Puyol et al. (25Puyol P. Perez M.D. Calvo M. J. Dairy Sci. 1994; 77: 1494-1502Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and delipidated by charcoal treatment at pH 3 as described by Chen (26Chen R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 173-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitic acid at a molar concentration ratio of 2:1 with respect to the protein dimer was dissolved in chloroform and dispensed in a glass tube. After the organic solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, a solution of delipidated β-Lg was dissolved in 0.29 m NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 16 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.4, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The saturated protein solution was then dialyzed against distilled water and freeze-dried. Analysis by gas chromatography showed that the complex had about 1 mol of palmitate bound to 1 mol of dimeric protein. The freeze-dried material was dissolved in H2O to a concentration of 40 mg/ml and crystallized as a sitting drop (4 μl of protein solution + 12 μl of well solution) over a well solution of 1.4 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. Crystals, also of the trigonal lattice Z form, grew in a few days and appeared identical to the crystals from the first preparation (see TableI).Table IData collection statisticsData collection statisticsFirst preparationSecond preparationSpace group, P3221a =b = 53.48 Åa = b = 53.52 Åc = 111.64 Åc = 111.37 Åα = β = 90°, γ = 120°α = β = 90°, γ = 120°Resolution range20–2.5 Å25–2.3 ÅNumber of reflections measured97,14248,843Number of unique reflections6,8888,763Completeness99.9%97.8%Multiplicity14.15.57R merge (outer shell)aR merge = Σh‖ I − <I> ‖/Σh‖ I‖, where <I> is the mean intensity of all observation of reflection. h =hkl.7.3% (36.6%)6.3% (37.6%)I/ς (I) (outer shell)bς (I) is the S.D. of the measured intensity.21.2 (3.95)17.38 (2.57)a R merge = Σh‖ I − <I> ‖/Σh‖ I‖, where <I> is the mean intensity of all observation of reflection. h =hkl.b ς (I) is the S.D. of the measured intensity.

The frozen crystal was then transferred to a magnetic goniometer head in a stream of N2 at 100 K (Cryostream; Oxford Cryosystems). Diffraction data were collected on a 300 mm MarResearch imaging plate system mounted upon an ENRAF-Nonius FR571 rotating anode generator operating at 40 kV and 80 mA and producing Cu-Kα radiation from a graphite crystal monochromator. At least 90° of data were collected in 1.5° oscillations (i.e.>60 images), each of a 20-min duration. The data were processed by DENZO (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) and reduced with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The statistics are given in Table I. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE (28Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) with the refined β-Lg lattice X monomer (space group P1: a = 37.8 Å, b = 49.6 Å,c = 56.6 Å, α = 123.4°, β = 97.3°, γ =103.7°) as the search model. Data within the resolution range of 10–4 Å and a Patterson radius of 18 Å were used to calculate the rotation and translation functions. The maximum peak (4.86 ς) in the rotation function and next highest peak (3.70 ς) were used to calculate the translation function, which gave a distinct peak at a height of 9 ς for the maximum rotation peak, whereas the next highest peak was 4.5 ς. The second rotation peak did not give a distinct solution in the translation function. The space group P3221 was also confirmed by the translation function. The highest peak in P3221 was 9 ς (R-factor = 38.9%), whereas the highest peak in P3121 was 5.2 ς (R-factor = 53.1%). Rigid body refinement of the correct solution reduced the R-factor slightly from 38.9 to 38.0%. Positional, occupancy, and temperature factor refinement was performed using SHELX97 (29Sheldrick G.M.

Although the 3.0-Å lattice Z structure (16Brownlow S. Morais Cabral J.H. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) could have been used, the higher resolution lattice X structure was preferred as the better starting model. Baker and co-workers (31Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) have refined the structure of the lattice Z form at three distinct pH values (pH 6.2, 7.1, and 8.2) showing that there is a distinct movement of a loop as the pH value is raised. This movement uncovers a buried carboxyl group, observed during titration by Tanford et al. (32Tanford C. Bunville L.G. Nozaki Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1959; 81: 4032-4036Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), probably identified as Glu-89 by Brownlow et al. (16Brownlow S. Morais Cabral J.H. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) but confirmed convincingly by Qin et al. (31Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Glu-89 is part of the EF loop whose movement allows access for the binding of palmitate in that it is the movement of the loop as the pH is raised from pH 6 to 7.5 that opens up the entrance to the calyx (Fig.2, A and B). The occlusion of, or at least hindrance to, the binding site at low pH may provide an explanation for the failure of our soaking experiments with the lattice X crystal form at pH 6.5. We also noted that cocrystallization appears to favor the lattice Z crystal form. In a control experiment without palmitate added, only crystals of the orthorhombic lattice Y grew at pH 7.5, whereas in drops with palmitate added also at pH 7.5, we never obtained this form but only obtained lattice Z. Fig. 2 C shows the electron density map with the final refined structure superimposed. The final R-factor was 0.204, and R free was 0.240 for the 6,888 unique reflections to 2.5-Å resolution. The geometry is acceptable, and the Ramachandran plot shows that essentially all residues are in the allowed regions, with Tyr-99 the notable exception, adopting a classic γ-turn conformation common to nearly all of the lipocalin structures. The density for the palmitate is clear and shows a kink at C-6 associated with the movement of the side chain of Met-107. To allow access to the calyx, the EF loop, associated with the Tanford transition (16Brownlow S. Morais Cabral J.H. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 31Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), is also repositioned. The local environment of the palmitate within the pocket is shown in Fig.3, which indicates the distances between side chains and the fatty acid. The binding site in β-Lg is rather fully extended, but there is space for longer fatty acid molecules such as stearate and oleate to be accommodated within the calyx, with the carboxyl group making the same interactions with Lys-60 and Lys-69. The association constants for both acids are similar (33Perez M.D. Diaz de Villegas M.C. Sanchez L. Aranda P. Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1094-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Frapin D. Dufour E. Haertlé T. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the fatty acid-binding protein family, palmitate is also observed in an extended form, although alternative conformations of bound fatty acids have been observed (35Saccchetini J.C. Scapin G. Gopaul D. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23534-23545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2278-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As perturbation of the Trp fluorescence can be used to monitor binding of hydrophobic ligands to β-Lg, the distances to the two Trp residues were determined directly. The closest approach of C-2 is 10.36 Å from Trp-61, and C-15 is 6.98 Å from Trp-19. It is possible, therefore, that there is perturbation of signals from both Trp residues, although the Trp at position 19 is in a significantly more restricted environment. Careful comparison of the B-factors of the palmitate carbons well within the calyx (C-8 to C-16) shows that they are similar in magnitude to those of the adjacent side chains. Those nearer the opening of the calyx increase in magnitude, presumably reflecting the larger volume of the cavity and hence less specific nature of the binding in the region of the highly flexible EF and GH loops. The electron density is not well defined for either of these loops. Fig. 2 D shows the electron density for the second data set, where the stoichiometry of the binding of palmitate was measured and shown to be one palmitate per dimer. The final R-factor for the structure in this case was 0.233, and R freewas 0.285 for the 8,763 unique reflections to 2.3-Å resolution. The geometry is again acceptable, with Tyr-99 again the exception in the Ramachandran plot. It is clear that there is a bulge in the density associated with the position of Met-107. The B-factors for the same palmitate carbon atoms after refinement with the second data set were significantly larger than those of the adjacent side chains, but when a single occupancy term for all ligand atoms was used in refinement, the B-value became similar to those of the surrounding side chains. In the lattice Z crystal form, the two binding sites in the dimer are crystallographically identical. If the stoichiometry was one ligand per dimer, the expected occupancy would be 0.5 because, on average, each site contains half a palmitate molecule. The refined occupancy was 0.69. This is higher than 0.5, but because of the imprecise nature of the occupancy determination and the high correlation that exists between occupancy and B-factor, the result indicates a reasonable agreement with the solution study. For comparison, an identical calculation of the occupancy of palmitate in the first data set gave a value of 0.96. The bulge in the electron density at Met-107 is thus explained as the addition of two components for the Met-107 side chain, that of the native structure (Fig. 2 A) and that with bound ligand (Fig. 2 B). It is not clear why the preparation protocols used should produce different results and why the second one should have such a reproducibly precise palmitate to β-Lg dimer ratio. There is no obvious cooperativity between the monomers in which the binding sites, some 35 Å apart, are approached from a direction away from the dimer interface. At this stage, little can be said about the existence of a second binding site. We were surprised to find the palmitate in the calyx, because the report of Narayan and Berliner (20Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 1906-1911Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) establishes fatty acid binding at a site that is not perturbed by retinol, and the report of Cho et al. (23Cho Y. Batt C.A. Sawyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11102-11107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) connects Lys-69 with retinol binding. Further, contrary to the findings of Narayan and Berliner (20Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 1906-1911Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Puyolet al. (18Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) find that palmitate and retinol compete on binding to β-Lg, the former displacing the latter. Thus, the groove identified by Monaco et al. (19Monaco H.L. Zanotti G. Spadon P. Bolognesi M. Sawyer L. Eliopoulos E.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) on the outer surface of the protein (see Fig. 1) has yet to be confirmed as a binding site for any ligand, despite several strands of circumstantial evidence that point to its existence (see Ref. 21Sawyer L. Brownlow S. Polikarpov I. Wu S.-Y. Int. Dairy J. 1998; 8: 65-72Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Many of the reported ligand binding studies have been made at pH values at or above 7, the pH at which the inner binding site is known to be more accessible. It is tempting to speculate that the inner site becomes accessible at high pH, whereas at lower pH only the putative outer site is available. This gating of the inner binding site is reminiscent of the dynamic portal hypothesis in fatty acid-binding protein, where ligand access and binding are mediated by flexible regions of the protein backbone (Ref. 36Hodsdon M.E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2278-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar and references therein). Whereas in the trigonal lattice Z form β-Lg, discrete arrangements of the “portal” loop EF exist, in the triclinic lattice X and the orthorhombic lattice Y apo forms, these loops have weak electron density. To clarify this point, binding studies need to be performed at lower pH values, both in the crystal structure and in solution.

Note Added in Proof Since this paper was accepted, an independent study on 12-bromododecanoic acid binding to the lattice Z form of bovine β-Lg has been published by Qin et al.(Qin, B.

Their findings are in agreement with those presented here: the carboxylate associates with Lys-60 and Lys-69, and the 12-bromo group is at the inner end of the calyx.

Thus, Dvl can lead to two different signaling pathways. Furthermore, the small G proteins of Cdc42 or Rac1, which are involved in JNK activation by many stimuli, do not appear to play a major role in Dvl-mediated JNK activation, because the dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1 could not inhibit Dvl-induced JNK activation. This suggests that Dvl may activate JNK via novel pathways.

Genetic studies inDrosophila revealed the involvement of Dishevelled (Dsh), armadillo (Arm), and pangolin (Pan, DTcf) in Wingless (Wg) signaling. A genetic order of these signal transducers has been established in which Wg acts through Dsh to inhibit Zw-3, thus relieving the suppression of Arm by Zw-3, with a net result of up-regulation of Arm (1Dickinson M.E. McMahon A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Nusse R. Varmus H.E.

Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that the Frizzled (Fz) family of cell surface proteins might function as the receptors for Wnt, because the null mutation of the Drosophila fz gene has similar phenotypes as some Dsh mutants (7Adler P.N. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Theisen H. Purcell J. Bennett M. Kansagara D. Syed A. Marsh J.L.

Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In addition, heterologous expression of Dfz2 (Drosophila fzhomolog) in cells that normally do not express Dfz2 and do not respond to Wg reconstituted the responsiveness to Wg (11Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman C. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The Wnt signaling mechanism appears to be conserved in mammals. In addition to the existence of a large number of Wg homologs, there are mammalian homologs for Fz, Dsh, Zw-3, Arm, and Pan. More than eight mammalian Fz homologs have been cloned and sequenced (12Chan S.D. Karpf D.B. Fowlkes M.E. Hooks M. Bradley M.S. Vuong V. Bambino T. Liu M.Y. Arnaud C.D. Strewler G.J. Nissenson R.A.

Although studies using immunostaining suggest that various Fz may bind to various Wnt proteins (11Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman C. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether Fz by itself is sufficient to transduce signals. In addition, there is little information about the specificity in interactions between different Fz proteins and Wnt proteins, because affinities cannot be measured without purified Wnt proteins. However, there appears to be certain selectivity in the interactions between Fz and Wnt proteins, because Wnt-5A-induced axial duplication in Xenopus requires Fz-5 (14He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H. Science. 1997; 275: 1652-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning also revealed several mammalian Dsh homologs (Dvl), including three from the mouse (15Sussman D.J. Klingensmith J. Salinas P. Adams P.S. Nusse R. Perrimon N. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Klingensmith J. Yang Y. Axelrod J.D. Beier D.R. Perrimon N. Sussman D.J. Mech.

Dyn. 1996; 207: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparison of all known Dsh/Dvl molecules across species revealed several highly conserved regions. Most notable is the one located in the central part of the molecule referred to as the disc-large homology region or PDZ domain, which was found in a number of proteins including PSD-95, ZO-1, and Discs-large (18Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that the PDZ domain in PSD-95 can bind to a C-terminal motif of four amino acids (Xaa-Thr/Ser-Xaa-Val) (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). However, ligands for the PDZ domain of Dsh/Dvl remain unknown. At the C-terminal side of the PDZ domain is located a DEP (Dishevelled, egl-10, andpleckstrin) domain. Similar DEP motifs are also found in a number of other proteins (20Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The N-terminal conserved domain shares homology to a newly identified protein, Axin, which also plays an important role in Wnt signaling (21Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J.

Science. 1998; 280: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). This N-terminal domain is referred to as the DIX (Dishevelled and Axin) domain. Although a mouse knock-out of Dvl-1 did not display any of the dramatic developmental phenotypes exhibited by many of the Wnt knock-outs (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar), behavioral and neurological abnormalities were observed (25Lijam N. Paylor R. McDonald M.P. Crawley J.N. Deng C.X.

Despite great interest, the molecular mechanism by which Dsh/Dvl is involved in signal transduction of Wnt is largely unknown, especially in mammalian systems. One study using cultures ofDrosophila cells showed that overexpression of Dsh can induce elevation of the Arm levels and that the N-terminal portion of Dsh, containing the DIX and PDZ domains, is required for such activity (26Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologs to Zw-3 and Arm are GSK-3β1 and β-catenin, respectively. GSK was found to form a complex with β-catenin and the product of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (27Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar, 28Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that Axin and its homolog, Conductin, may also be part of the complex (22Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 23Sakanaka C. Weiss J.B. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1998; 280: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). GSK was shown to phosphorylate APC and destabilize the complex (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). APC appears to play a role in promoting the degradation of β-catenin via ubiquitination pathways (29Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar), and a similar role was also proposed for Conductin (24Behrens J. Jerchow B. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). APC was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene (30Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 127-147PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in APC that are associated with human colorectal cancers appear to lose the ability to destabilize β-catenin (27Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). β-Catenin has been shown to bind high mobility group box transcription factors of the TCF-LEF-1 family. Complexes between β-catenin and Tcf/LEF-1 have strong transcriptional activity on reporter gene constructs containing the Tcf-LEF-1 recognition sequences (31Molenaar M. van de Wetering M.

Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans suggested that there might exist Wnt signaling pathways independent of β-catenin and TCF/LEF-1 (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Drosophila fz and dsh genes function in the tissue polarity pathway, which regulates cell orientation. However, wg,arm(β-catenin homolog), and dtcfdo not appear to be involved in this pathway, in which a number of other genes,fuzzy, inturned, rhoA, andbsk (DJNK) are involved (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

Mammalian JNK belongs to the superfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (see reviews, Refs. 35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar and 36Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). JNK phosphorylates the N terminus of proto-oncogene c-Jun and its related transcription factor ATF2, leading to stimulation of the transcriptional activity. The best-characterized pathways leading to JNK activation in mammalian cells are those mediated by small GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42 (37Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 38Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 belong to the Rho family, which also includes RhoA (39Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Mammalian RhoA, however, is a weak activator of JNK but a strong activator of serum response factor (SRF) (37Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 38Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). To determine whether Dvl can interact with JNK- and RhoA-linked pathways in mammalian cells, we tested the effects of ectopically expressed Dvl on c-Jun- and SRF-mediated transcription activity. We found that Dvl can stimulate c-Jun-mediated but not SRF-mediated transcription of the reporter genes, suggesting that Dvl may regulate c-Jun. This is confirmed by the observation that Dvl activates JNK. Moreover, we also found that the DEP domain of Dvl-1 is required for JNK activation. By contrast, all three conserved domains, including DIX, PDZ, and DEP, are required for up-regulation of β-catenin and for stimulation of LEF-1-mediated transcription. COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For transfection, cells (5 × 104cells/well) were seeded into 24-well plates the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of DNA/well for COS-7 cells and 0.5 μg of DNA/well for NIH3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), as suggested by the manufacturer. The transfection was stopped by switching to normal growth medium after 3 h. Cell extracts were collected 24 h later for luciferase assays, kinase assays, and Western analysis. Luciferase assays were performed using Boehringer Mannheim Constant Light luciferase assay kit as instructed. Cell lysates were first taken for determining fluorescence intensity emitted by green fluorescence protein (GFP) proteins in a Wallac multi-counter, which is capable of counting fluorescence and luminescence. Then, luciferase substrate was added to the cell lysates, and luciferase activities were determined by measuring luminescence intensity using the same counter. Luminescence intensity was normalized against fluorescence intensity. The wild type and deletion mutants of mouse Dvl1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction with the mouse Dvl-1 cDNA as the template using the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu(Stratagene, CA). Myc epitope tags (EQKLISEEDL) were introduced to the C termini of the full-length and mutant Dvl molecules. The expression of Wnt1, wild type Dvls, and Dvl-1 mutant was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The LEF-1 reporter gene construct was kindly provided by Dr. Grosschedl (University of California at San Franscisco). Elk- and c-Jun-reporter gene systems were purchased from Strategene, CA. For the construction of the reporter gene plasmid, SRE derivative, SRE.L, was synthesized exactly as described in (Hill et al. (40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar)). SER.L was inserted in front of a TK minimal promoter-luciferase gene. Lef-1 and the Lef reporter gene plasmid were provided by Rudolf Grosschedl. Cells expressing JNK-HA were lysed with the lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, and CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim, used as the instructions suggest). The cell lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech, CA) for 0.5 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 1 μl of monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (Berkeley Antibody Company, CA) and 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 3.5 h on ice. The immunocomplexes were pelleted and washed 3 times with cold lysis buffer in the absence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors and twice with cold kinase buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm ATP, and an excess of the substrate, c-Jun-GST. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled and loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The results were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To test whether Dvl is involved in JNK- and RhoA-linked pathways, the effects of overexpressed Dvl on the activities of c-Jun (regulated by JNK) and SRF (regulated by RhoA) were examined. Activation of SRF was determined by cotransfection of the Dvl cDNA with a luciferase reporter construct containing a mutated c-Fos serum response element, SRE.L, upstream of the reporter gene. Because only SRF binds to SER.L, SRE.L-mediated production of luciferase mainly depends on the activity of SRF (40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Regulation of c-Jun was studied using the PathDetect signal transduction reporting systems from Stratagene. In this system, transcription of the luciferase reporter gene depends on activation of c-Jun. We also tested the effect of Dvl on Elk (regulated by Ras)-dependent transcriptional activity using the same method as for c-Jun. Positive controls and specificity of activation of these reporting systems were shown in Fig. 1; the activated form of Cdc42 activates SRF and c-Jun, whereas the activated forms of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase are potent activators of Elk. These results are consistent with previous findings (37Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 38Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). When Dvl was tested in these reporting systems, we found that it could significantly activate c-Jun-mediated transcription but not SRF or Elk-mediated transcription (Fig. 1). These data suggest that Dvl may activate c-Jun. It has been shown that JNK phosphorylates and activates c-Jun (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, activation of JNK by mouse Dvl proteins was examined. Monkey kidney COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA-encoding mouse Dvl-1 and JNK-HA. JNK protein immunoprecipitated via an HA tag from cells coexpressing Dvl-1 showed significantly higher activity in phosphorylating a JNK substrate than that from cells coexpressing the control β-galactosidase (LacZ) (Fig. 2). The expression of mouse Dvl-1 is shown in Fig. 2 C. Heterologous expression of mouse Dvl-2 and 3 (12Chan S.D. Karpf D.B. Fowlkes M.E. Hooks M. Bradley M.S. Vuong V. Bambino T. Liu M.Y. Arnaud C.D. Strewler G.J. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25202-25207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wang Y. Macke J.P. Abella B.S. Andreasson K. Worley P. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4468-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) could also activate JNK (Fig.2). Activation of JNK was also observed when Dvl-1 was expressed in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). To determine which portions of the Dvl-1 molecule are responsible for activation of JNK, truncation mutants of mouse Dvl-1 were generated. Amino acid sequence homology analysis of mammalian andDrosophila Dsh/Dvl molecules suggests that these molecules can be roughly divided into three parts, each of which contains one highly conserved domain (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, three mutants were generated by deleting each of the conserved domains separately. The mutants are: N, an N-terminal truncation mutant; C, a C-terminal truncation mutant; and PDZ, in which the PDZ domain was deleted (Fig.2 A). The ability of these Dvl-1 mutants to activate JNK was tested by coexpression with JNK-HA in COS-7 cells. The expression of the Dvl-1 mutants is shown in Fig. 2 C. Both N and PDZ were able to activate JNK (Fig. 2), whereas C could not (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the C-terminal region of Dvl-1 may be involved in regulation of JNK. To test whether the C-terminal portion of Dvl is sufficient for JNK activation, the C-terminal 320 amino acids of mouse Dvl-1, designated as C1, were expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig.3 C) and tested for JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 3, C1, which contains the DEP domain, is sufficient for activation of JNK. Two additional Dvl-1 deletion mutants, which are depicted in Fig. 3 C, were generated to further delineate the sequences that are important for JNK regulation. When the Dvl mutant, C2, which encompasses the sequence downstream of the DEP domain, was expressed in Cos-7 cells, it was unable to activate JNK (Fig. 3). Because the only difference between C2 and C1 is the lack of the DEP domain (Fig. 3 C), the failure of C2 to activate JNK suggests that the DEP domain is involved in JNK regulation. This hypothesis is further confirmed by the observation that the Dvl mutant N, when expressed in COS-7 cells, could activate JNK (Fig. 3). There is a nonlethal dsh1 allele in Drosophila. Homozygous dsh1 appears to cause only planar polarity but not wg-like phenotypes (8Theisen H. Purcell J. Bennett M. Kansagara D. Syed A. Marsh J.L. Development. 1994; 120: 347-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fahmy O.G. Fahmy M. D. I. S. 1959; 33: 83-94Google Scholar, 42Perrimon N. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1987; 119: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mutation indsh1 was identified as the substitution of Met-438 for Lys (34Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Because the JNK pathway was implicated in regulation of planar polarity, we tested whether this mutation affects JNK activation. A Dvl mutant (DvlKM) containing the equivalent mutation was thus generated. We found that DvlKM activated JNK as effectively as the wild type (Fig.4). DvlKM and its wild type were even compared at two different expression levels (Fig. 4). Thus, although the dsh1 mutation (at residue 438) lies inside the DEP domain, the residue Lys-438 does not appear to play a significant role in JNK activation. It is well established that Dsh can signal through β-catenin and TCF/LEF-1 (2Nusse R. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 1073-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 4Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 396-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 6Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 7Adler P.N. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A previous study indicated that the C-terminal region of Drosophila Dsh, corresponding to C1, was incapable of up-regulating the β-catenin levels in culturedDrosophila cells (26Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This finding, together with our results that C1 is sufficient for JNK activation, suggests that Dvl can lead to two different signaling pathways. Nevertheless, we investigated the effects of Dvl and its mutants on the β-catenin-TCF/LEF-1-linked pathway in mammalian cells. We first tested whether ectopic expression of Wnt-1 and Dvl-1 can up-regulate the levels of β-catenin in Cos-7 cells as Wg and Dsh do in Drosophila cells (11Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman C. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 26Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with cDNA encoding Wnt-1 or Dvl-1 along with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged β-catenin and GFP for 24 h. Cytosol fractions were prepared from cotransfected cells and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific to the Myc tag and GFP. The levels of cytosolic recombinant β-catenin proteins in cells coexpressing Wnt-1 (Fig. 5 A) or Dvl-1 (Fig. 5 B) are clearly higher than those coexpressing the control LacZ. Moreover, coexpression of GSK-3β significantly decreased the levels of cytosolic β-catenin (Fig. 5 A). All of these results are consistent with previous findings (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). The levels of coexpressed GFP were determined to ensure that the changes in the β-catenin levels are not because of variations in transfection (Fig. 5, A and B). Dvl-1 mutants including C, N, PDZ, and C1 were tested for their abilities to up-regulate the β-catenin levels in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, none of the mutants were able to affect the levels of cytosolic β-catenin. β-Catenin has been shown to interact with TCF/LEF-1 and regulate transcription (43Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). A reporter construct, in which LEF response element was placed in front of a minimal promoter and a luciferase gene, were used to assay LEF-1 activity. When this reporter construct was cotransfected with cDNAs encoding LEF-1 and Wnt-1 or Dvl-1, there was a marked increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 5 C). The increase in luciferase activity was Wnt-1- or Dvl-1- and LEF-1-dependent (Fig. 5 C). This suggests that the cells do not contain endogenous LEF-1 and that Dvl-1 activates reporter gene transcription through LEF-1. In addition, the observation that β-catenin is able to stimulate luciferase activity and that GSK-3β could inhibit Dvl-stimulated luciferase activity (Fig. 5 C) indicates that the LEF-1 activity in this assay system can be regulated by β-catenin and GSK. Dvl Mutants Were Tested in the LEF Reporter Gene Assay system. Dvl mutants, including C, N, PDZ, and C1, did not show significant stimulation of the luciferase activity regardless of the presence (Fig.5 D) or absence of LEF-1 (data not shown). This result is consistent with the one from the assay of the β-catenin levels. Only Dvl-N was able to stimulate LEF1-dependent transcription (Fig. 5 D). The fact that Dvl-N can stimulate LEF1-dependent transcription indicates that Dvl sequences downstream of DEP are not required for activation of LEF1-dependent transcription. The ability of DvlKM to regulate the β-catenin-LEF-1 pathway was also investigated. We found that DvlKM was as effective as the wild type Dvl in stimulation of LEF-1-dependent transcription (Fig. 5 E). Thus, the dsh1 mutation did not affect its ability to regulate its downstream effectors, including LEF-1 and JNK, under our experimental conditions. Cdc42 and Rac, members of the Rho family of small G proteins, have been shown to mediate JNK activation by a number of stimuli (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cdc42 or Rac1 also mediates JNK activation by Dvl, Dvl-1 was coexpressed with the dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1, Cdc42N17 and Rac1N17, respectively. Neither of the dominant negative mutants could significantly inhibit Dvl-induced JNK activation (Fig. 6,A and B). To ensure that the dominant-negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1 are effective in suppression of Cdc42 and Rac-mediated JNK activation, we tested these two dominant negative mutants in inhibition of EGF-induced JNK activation. EGF was previously shown to activate JNK through Rac1 and/or Cdc42 (37Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, C and D, the Cdc42 dominant negative mutant suppressed EGF-induced JNK activation by more than 50%, and the Rac1 mutant almost completely abolished EGF-induced JNK activation as reported (37Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cdc42 and Rac1 in COS-7 cells are unlikely to play a significant role in Dvl-induced JNK activation in COS-7 cells. RhoA, another member of the Rho family, has been shown by many laboratories to lack the ability to activate JNK in mammalian cells (37Minden A. Lin A. Claret F. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 38Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), which we also confirmed (data not shown). However, RhoA was suggested to genetically interact with JNK in Drosophila(10Strutt D. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the dominant negative mutant of RhoA, RhoAN19, for its ability to inhibit Dvl-1-mediated JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 5 A, RhoAN19 failed to inhibit Dvl-1-induced JNK activation. In this report, we have described a new signal transduction pathway for Dvl. Dvl activates JNK and regulates c-Jun-dependent gene transcription in addition to its ability to regulate the β-catenin and LEF-1 pathways. Moreover, we found that the DEP domain is required for JNK activation. Our findings agree with two recent reports (10Strutt D. Weber U. Mlodzik M. Nature. 1997; 387: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 34Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) using genetic epistasis analysis in Drosophila showing that Dsh interacts withDrosophila JNK. JNK was shown to be required for correct establishment of planar polarity in Drosophila epidermal tissues, which does not require Arm or Pan. In addition, it was shown that Dvl activates JNK in mammalian cells (34Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Our findings are also largely consistent with the study (26Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) showing that deletion of the conserved domains of Drosophila Dsh including DIX and PDZ resulted in the loss of the ability in up-regulation of the Arm levels. However, there is an apparent discrepancy with regard to the role of the DEP domain in up-regulation of β-catenin. In contrast to our findings, the study by Yanagawa et al. (26Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) suggested that deletion of the part of Drosophila Dsh corresponding to C1 including the DEP domain could still up-regulate the levels of Arm. This discrepancy may result from the use of different assay systems in cells from different species. The Drosophila dsh1 allele shows strong planar polarity phenotypes (8Theisen H. Purcell J. Bennett M. Kansagara D. Syed A. Marsh J.L. Development. 1994; 120: 347-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fahmy O.G. Fahmy M. D. I. S. 1959; 33: 83-94Google Scholar, 42Perrimon N. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1987; 119: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the dsh1 allele does not appear to affect the Wg signaling pathways (8Theisen H. Purcell J. Bennett M. Kansagara D. Syed A. Marsh J.L. Development. 1994; 120: 347-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fahmy O.G. Fahmy M. D. I. S. 1959; 33: 83-94Google Scholar, 42Perrimon N. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1987; 119: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mutation in dsh1 was identified, and Dsh 1 was shown to have less potency in JNK activation than wild type Dsh 1 (34Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that there are no significant differences between DvlKM and Dvl in JNK activation or in activation of LEF-1-dependent transcription (Figs 4 and 5). In our experiments, the effects of DvlKM (the Dvl-1 mutation equivalent todsh1) and Dvl-1 were compared at the same expression levels of Dvl-1 and DvlKM, whereas Boutros et al. (34Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) had significantly higher levels of wild type Dsh as compared with Dsh 1. If our findings are correct, there may be several possible explanations to the genetic data showing that the dsh1 allele only affects the JNK pathway but not the β-catenin pathway (8Theisen H. Purcell J. Bennett M. Kansagara D. Syed A. Marsh J.L. Development. 1994; 120: 347-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Fahmy O.G. Fahmy M. D. I. S. 1959; 33: 83-94Google Scholar, 42Perrimon N. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1987; 119: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 1) Thedsh1 mutation may play different roles in Dvl-1 and Dsh; 2) The mutation may disrupt the coupling of Dvl to its upstream regulators (such as receptors) that are involved only in regulation of the JNK pathway. Thus, only the JNK pathway but not the β-catenin pathway is affected; 3) The mutation may partially reduce the coupling of Dvl to its upstream regulators that are involved in both the β-catenin and JNK pathways. However, there may still be sufficient activity to maintain normal functions required for the β-catenin pathway but not enough to maintain the functions required for the JNK pathway, thus leading solely to a planar polarity phenotype. Although Drosophila RhoA may be involved in JNK activation (although there is lack of biochemical data), mammalian RhoA is clearly not involved in JNK activation (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Mammalian RhoA is involved in the regulation of SRF via yet-to-be identified pathways (39Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 40Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). In mammals, JNK was found to be regulated by two other small G proteins belonging to the Rho family, Cdc42 and Rac. Although Cdc42 and Rac were shown to mediate JNK activation by many growth factor receptors and G protein-coupled receptors (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), they are not involved in all JNK activation pathways (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, they are not involved in ultraviolet, toxin anisomycin, tyrosine kinase c-Abl and Pyk2, or TNF-induced JNK activation (35Minden A. Karin M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). Although mammalian andDrosophila cells are conserved with regard to activation of JNK by Dvl, different signaling pathways are apparently used in JNK activation by Dvl/Dsh. Our data indicate that Rac1 and Cdc42 are not involved in Dvl-mediated JNK activation. Our results as well as others showed that RhoA is irrelevant in JNK activation in mammals. The fact that Dvl-1 does not stimulate SRF-dependent transcription (Fig. 1 A) further supports the idea that Dvl-1 does not regulate RhoA in mammalian cells. It is certainly of great interest to determine the mechanism by which Dvl regulates JNK in mammalian cells. Wg signals through Dfz2, Dsh, Arm (β-catenin), and Pan (TCF) inDrosophila (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence for the involvement of Wg in the Fz-Dsh-JNK pathway, Wnt-like molecules are speculated to be involved (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 34Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D. Mlodzik M.

We tested if mammalian Wnts, Wnt-1, and Wnt5a, can induce JNK activation in a paracrine paradigm by expression of Wnt in COS-7 cells. We found that both Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a gave 2 to 3-fold stimulation of JNK activity (data not shown). However, we were unable to obtain direct evidence to demonstrate that Wnt activates JNK via Dvl. We have tried all of our Dvl mutants, but none of them was able to block JNK activation by Wnt-1 or Wnt-5a (data not shown). We also tested the effect of Fz in JNK activation. A recent report demonstrating the requirement of Fz-5 in Wnt-5a-induced axial duplication in Xenopus implies that Fz-5 may serve as a receptor for Wnt-5a (14He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Wang Y. Nathans J. Dawid I. Varmus H. Science. 1997; 275: 1652-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, coexpression of Fz-5 with Wnt-5a did not potentiate JNK activation by Wnt-5a in COS-7 cells (data not shown). This suggests that Fz-5 alone may not be sufficient for mediating the effect of Wnt-5a on JNK activation. Alternatively, Wnt-5a may use different receptors for JNK activation.

Human and murine Nix have a 56 and 53% amino acid identity to human and murine Nip3, respectively. The carboxyl terminus of Nix, including a transmembrane domain, is highly homologous to Nip3 but it bears a longer and distinct asparagine/proline-rich N terminus. Human Nip3 maps to chromosome 14q11.2–q12, whereas Nix/BNip3L was found on 8q21. Nix encodes a 23.8-kDa protein but it is expressed as a 48-kDa protein, suggesting that it homodimerizes similarly to Nip3. Following transfection, Nix protein undergoes progressive proteolysis to an 11-kDa C-terminal fragment, which is blocked by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Nix colocalizes with the mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60, and removal of the putative transmembrane domain (TM) results in general cytoplasmic and nuclear expression. When transiently expressed, Nix and Nip3 but not TM deletion mutants rapidly activate apoptosis. Nix can overcome the suppressers Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, although high levels of Bcl-XL expression will inhibit apoptosis.

Apoptosis is regulated by molecules that both activate and suppress cell death. The molecular regulators of developmental apoptosis in Caenorhabditis elegans include cell death inducers Ced-3 and -4 (1Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

However, the Bcl-2 family of proteins also contains members that function to activate apoptosis such as Bax, Bad, Bak, Bik/Nbk, and Hrk (5Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev.

Nip3 is a mitochondrial protein that induces apoptosis and can enhance the apoptosis induced by other cell death signals when transiently expressed (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J.

Bcl-2 transiently suppresses Nip3-induced apoptosis although this resistance is rapidly overcome (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J.

We report the cloning of Nix (Nip3-like protein X), which closely resembles Nip3 in both structure and function. We propose that Nix and Nip3 form a new structurally related pro-apoptotic family of mitochondrial proteins. Searches of the GenBank EST1 and TIGR (Institute for Genomic Research) data bank using the human Nip3 cDNA revealed related but novel human and mouse EST clones. Using primers within these EST sequences, we generated PCR fragments, which were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced. The entire mNix and hNix cDNA were then polymerase chain reacted from mouse 17-day embryo Matchmaker cDNA library and human fetal liver 5′-stretch plus cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Murine Nip3 cDNA was cloned from a λGT11 3T3 fibroblast cDNA library using human Nip3 as a probe. KpnI andEcoRI sites were introduced into the full-length cDNA by PCR and then subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3-T7, a modified pcDNA3 vector containing a C-terminal T7-tag (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Transmembrane domain-deleted expression vector mNix (ΔTM) was generated by PCR using splice overlap extension (12Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Human Nip3 and the Nip3163 transmembrane deletion mutant have been described previously (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Rat-1, Rat-1/Bcl-2, TC (10T1/2 parental cell line), TX5 and TX22 (Bcl-XL transfected clones), and MCF-7 cells were culture in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Murine monoclonal anti-T7 antibody was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Rabbit anti-HSP60 antibody was donated by Dr. Radhey Gupta (McMaster University). FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma Chemical Co.) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BioCan Ltd., Mississauga) were used for fluorescence studies. Lactacystin was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Cambridge, MA). Total RNA (30 μg) was fractionated on a formaldehyde denaturing gel and then transferred and hybridized with nick-translated human or mouse Nix cDNA corresponding to the coding region as described (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled Nix proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation of cDNA cloned in pcDNA3 vector using TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of 5 × 104cells transfected with Nix-T7 were separated by an SDS-PAGE method using Tris-Tricine buffer and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that is suitable for detecting small molecular weight peptides (13Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). Cells were transfected with Nix using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of 5 × 104 cells were Western blotted as described above. For apoptosis experiments, Nix-expressing cells were detected with mouse anti-T7 antibody and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody. Apoptotic cells, exhibiting altered DNA morphology following Hoechst dye staining, were enumerated manually counting as described previously (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera. For β-galactosidase apoptosis assays evaluating the effect of removing the transmembrane domain on Nix and Nip3 apoptosis, 293T cells were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of pcDNA3-β-galactosidase plus 0.75 μg of the expression plasmid in triplicate using LipofectAMINE. Cells were fixed, stained, and evaluated 21 h later as described previously (14Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The cloning of hNix, mNix, and mNip3 was as follows. Using the human Nip3 cDNA as a probe, we screened a λGT11 mouse fibroblast cDNA library for clones related to Nip3. The clone containing the longest insert of 1311 bp was found to contain the entire mouse Nip3 coding region of 187 amino acids (GenBank accession number AF041054). The cDNA had overall identity with human Nip3 of 90.2% (Fig.1). Human and murine ESTs related to but different from Nip3 were used for PCR to clone, as described under “Materials and Methods,” a human 1337-bp and murine 1351-bp cDNA containing a large open reading frame of 219 and 218 amino acids, respectively. The protein was named Nix. The predicted human Nix (hNix) (GenBank accession number AF067396) and mouse Nix (mNix) (AF067395) proteins share 56 and 53% identity, respectively, with Nip3 of the same species, and are 97% identical to each other (Fig. 1). The highest regions of homology between the four proteins resides in the C terminus. Nix proteins bear a single hydrophobic α-helical sequence at the extreme carboxyl terminus, corresponding to the location of the TM domain of Nip3 (2Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Nix has a significantly longer N terminus that contains an unusual five asparagines in sequence and is proline-rich. N-terminal amino acids 1–59 of hNix and 1–32 of hNip3 are the most divergent. Another region from amino acids 97–120 of hNix is also distinct from hNip3, whereas the remainder is over 85% homologous with large blocks of identical sequences in both species. Similar to Nip3 (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 11Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), Nix contains PEST sequences comprised of high frequency stretches of Pro, Glu, Ser, Thr, and Asp, flanked by charged amino acids His, Arg, or Lys. PEST sequences are associated with proteins having high turnover rates (15Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar) whose degradation is controlled by the proteasome. hNix and mNix are expressed as 4.5- and 1.4-kilobase mRNA transcripts, respectively (not shown). The smaller transcript corresponds to the size of the cDNAs reported above and is likely the complete sequence. The larger transcript has not been identified; however, some cDNA clones were found that bear a distinct 5′-UTR suggesting alternate splicing of the Nix mRNA, and may represent a larger transcript. Following in vitro transcription and translation and Western blotting (Fig. 2 A), mNix and hNix run as proteins of 48,000 relative molecular weight under reducing and non-reducing conditions using the Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE method (13Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). hNip3 has a 40,000 relative molecular weight in Tris-Tricine-buffered SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, using the Laemmli method, Nix runs as an 80-kDa protein (not shown) and Nip3 at 60 kDa (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The reason for the difference in mobility in the two buffers is not clear; however Nip3, which forms a homodimer that does not dissociate under reducing conditions (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), runs at its predicted molecular weight of 40,000 in the Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Nix is also unaffected by reduction and is about double its 23.8 kDa predicted mass (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that it may also be a homodimer. Western blotting of lysates from Rat-1 cells transiently transfected with expression vector Nix-T7 reveals a 48-kDa protein that is progressively degraded over 42 h (Fig. 2 B). We examined both N- and C-terminal T7-tagged Nix and found that a residual 11-kDa fragment was detected only with the C-terminal tag (Fig.2 B). Nix with an N-terminal tag showed a similar degradation pattern of the 48-kDa band but no smaller fragments were detected (not shown). Intermediate fragments were also visible on some transfections at earlier time points or after prolonged development of the blots but only with the C-terminal tag. A similar pattern of degradation was found following transfection with Nip3 in which an 11-kDa fragment was detected using a C- but not an N-terminal tag. The 11-kDa residual Nip3 fragment was only detectable using the Tris-Tricine-buffered SDS-PAGE, which is optimized for the detection of small peptides. The proteolytic degradation is dependent on an active proteasome. Nix remains as a 48-kDa protein when cells were first treated with lactacystin, the proteasome threonine protease inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). Nip3 is also degraded rapidly following transfection (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and as with Nix, Nip3 degradation is also inhibited in lactacystin-treated cells (not shown). To determine whether Nix is localized to mitochondria, the primary site of Nip3 expression (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), mNix-T7 was transiently transfected into Rat-1 cells and stained with both monoclonal anti-T7 and rabbit anti-HSP60 antibodies. Secondary antibodies, FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, were then used to visualize the localization of Nix and HSP60, respectively, within the cells after immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. HSP60 is primarily located in mitochondria (16Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and our results showed that Nix colocalizes with HSP60 (Fig.3 A). Because Nip3 requires the TM domain to localize to mitochondria, we prepared a mutant Nix without the putative TM domain (Nix ΔTM). Nix ΔTM is expressed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and is not localized to any organelle-like structure (Fig. 3 B). Unlike Nip3 ΔTM (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the Nix mutant was detected in the nucleus in higher levels than in the cytoplasm. Because Nip3 induces apoptosis when transiently transfected, we examined the effects of Nix expression in Rat-1 and MCF-7 cells over time. Nix-expressing cells undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3 C). This was quantitated over a 48-h period, and a progressive increase in the percent of cells that were apoptotic was observed (Fig.4A) and at about the same rate as that in Nip3 (Fig. 4 B). Removal of the transmembrane domain of Nix prevented the induction of cell death similar to that of transmembrane deficient mutant of Nip3 (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4Time course of induction of apoptosis following mNix-T7 (A) or hNip3 (B) transient transfection of MCF-7 (▪, ■) and Rat-1 (•, ○) cells. Each tumor cell was transfected in three independent experiments, and apoptotic cells were quantitated at the times indicated by counting the percentage with apoptotic nuclear morphology by Hoechst staining of Nix or Nip3 expressing cells. Cells transfected with mNix or hNip3 (▪, •) were identified by immunofluorescent staining of anti-T7 antibody. Apoptosis of non-transfected cells (■, ○) was also enumerated. The data from three independent experiments were expressed as the mean ± S.E. for each time point.

Inhibition is detected early in the time course but is overcome at later time points (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Examining the apoptosis rate over a 48-h period following mNix transfection, we found that there was no significant difference between Rat-1 and Rat-1/Bcl-2 cell lines (Fig.5 A), the latter being highly resistant to other apoptotic signals such as granzyme B (9Chen G. Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). At decreasing doses of Nix plasmid from 1.0 to 0.1 μg, the transfection efficiency decreased progressively but the apoptosis rate in transfected cells remained constant between the two cell lines (not shown). Examining Nix apoptosis in Bcl-XL expressing cell lines TX22 and TX5, we find that only the higher Bcl-XLexpressing cell line TX5 was effective at blocking Nix although both lines were resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis when compared with the parental line TC (Fig. 5,B and C). The suppressive action of Bcl-2 can be reversed by heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family through the BH3 (Bcl-2 homology-3) domain (8Inohara N. Ding L.Y. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 17Zha J.P. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Ray R. Dubik D. Shi L.F. Cizeau J. Bleackley R.C. Saxena S. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which may partially function to promote Nip3 cell death (10Yasuda M. Theodorakis P. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12415-12421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, it is also clear that Nip3 and Nix are more structurally related to each other than to pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. A recent report identified a human cDNA called BNip3L that is homologous to hNip3 and maps to chromosome 8p21 (19Matsushima M. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Minaguchi T. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Suzumori K. Nakamura Y. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 21: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by the BNip3L cDNA is identical to the human Nix. For comparison, we have now mapped the chromosomal location of human Nip3 and, using a radiation hybrid panel, we find it is on chromosome 14; 4.08 centi-Ray from the marker WI-6506. Using the Whitehead Institute/MIT YAC map of chromosome 14, the CEPH YAC 951d6 was positive, placing the gene slightly centromeric to WI-6506 at the band 14q11.2-q12. The distinct mapping location of the two genes warrants a unique name for Nix rather than BNip3L because Nix is not a long form of Nip3. Expression of BNip3L in cervical cancer cell lines reduced their colony-forming ability and suggested to the authors that the protein may have growth-suppressive function. Because we find that both hNix and mNix are pro-apoptotic when overexpressed in tumor cell lines, induction of apoptosis can account for the observed growth suppression and poor colony formation in the BNip3L-transfected carcinoma cells. In conclusion, we have described Nix, a homolog of the Nip3 protein, which shares the ability to induce apoptosis, localize to mitochondria, and undergo proteasome-dependent degradation when overexpressed. Nip3 and Nix form a new subfamily of mitochondrial cell death proteins. We thank Dr. Brian Fristensky for analyzing the Nix and Nip3 proteins and Dr. Radhey Gupta for the anti-HSP60 antibody. We also thank the Medical Research Council Genome Resource Facility at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, for radiation and YAC mapping."
https://openalex.org/W1977988390,"In vitro, following the removal of thymine from a G·T mismatch, thymine DNA glycosylase binds tightly to the apurinic site it has formed. It can also bind to an apurinic site opposite S 6-methylthioguanine (SMeG) or opposite any of the remaining natural DNA bases. It will therefore bind to apurinic sites formed by spontaneous depurination, chemical attack, or other glycosylases. In the absence of magnesium, the rate of dissociation of the glycosylase from such complexes is so slow (k off 1.8 − 3.6 × 10−5 s−1; i.e. half-life between 5 and 10 h) that each molecule of glycosylase removes essentially only one molecule of thymine. In the presence of magnesium, the dissociation rates of the complexes with C·AP andSMeG·AP are increased more than 20-fold, allowing each thymine DNA glycosylase to remove more than one uracil or thymine from C·U and SMeG·T mismatches in DNA. In contrast, magnesium does not increase the dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from G·AP sites sufficiently to allow it to remove more than one thymine from G·T mismatches. The bound thymine DNA glycosylase prevents human apurinic endonuclease 1 (HAP1) cutting the apurinic site, so unless the glycosylase was displaced, the repair of apurinic sites would be very slow. However, HAP1 significantly increases the rate of dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from apurinic sites, presumably through direct interaction with the bound glycosylase. This effect is concentration-dependent and at the probable normal concentration of HAP1 in cells the dissociation would be fast. This interaction couples the first step in base excision repair, the glycosylase, to the second step, the apurinic endonuclease. The other proteins involved in base excision repair, polymerase β, XRCC1, and DNA ligase III, do not affect the dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from the apurinic site. In vitro, following the removal of thymine from a G·T mismatch, thymine DNA glycosylase binds tightly to the apurinic site it has formed. It can also bind to an apurinic site opposite S 6-methylthioguanine (SMeG) or opposite any of the remaining natural DNA bases. It will therefore bind to apurinic sites formed by spontaneous depurination, chemical attack, or other glycosylases. In the absence of magnesium, the rate of dissociation of the glycosylase from such complexes is so slow (k off 1.8 − 3.6 × 10−5 s−1; i.e. half-life between 5 and 10 h) that each molecule of glycosylase removes essentially only one molecule of thymine. In the presence of magnesium, the dissociation rates of the complexes with C·AP andSMeG·AP are increased more than 20-fold, allowing each thymine DNA glycosylase to remove more than one uracil or thymine from C·U and SMeG·T mismatches in DNA.

S 6-methylthioguanine apurinic/apyrimidinic site human apurinic endonuclease 1 mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase thymine DNA glycosylase. In mammalian cells, 2–7% of the total cytosine is methylated. Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, which is somewhat faster than cytosine (1Ehrlich M. Zhang X.Y. Inamdar N.M. Mutat.

The repair of these G·T mismatches is initiated by thymine DNA glycosylase which excises the mismatched thymine (2Wiebauer K. Jiricny J.

Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thymine DNA glycosylase removes uracil from G·U base pairs more rapidly than it removes thymine from G·T base pairs (10Neddermann P. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1642-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and can also remove uracil from C·U, T·U, and A·U base pairs (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and may therefore provide a backup function to the general uracil DNA glycosylase. The glycosylase also removes thymine from base pairs with S 6-methylthioguanine (SMeG)1 that are thought to occur in the DNA of cells treated with the drug 6-thioguanine (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J.

Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies in our laboratory showed that each molecule of thymine DNA glycosylase can remove only one thymine molecule because the glycosylase remains bound to the apurinic site it produces (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since this strong binding may have physiological significance, it has been studied in more detail.Removal of an incorrect base by a DNA glycosylase is the first step of base excision repair (reviewed in Refs. 12Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjørås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar and 13Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and one possible role of the bound thymine DNA glycosylase might be to recruit the enzymes needed to complete the repair process. Removal of the base is followed by cleavage of the phosphodiester bond 5′ to the abasic sugar (Fig. 1). In humans, this reaction is most probably carried out by the apurinic endonuclease, HAP1 (also known as APE, APEX, and Ref-1), as this enzyme is responsible for around 95% of all incisions at apurinic sites in HeLa cell extracts (14Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can function satisfactorily in reconstituted in vitro base excision repair systems (15Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 16Nicholl I.D. Nealon K. Kenny M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Following cleavage of the sugar-phosphate backbone, DNA polymerase β then removes the deoxyribose 5′-phosphate and fills the single base gap (17Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5842-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 18Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Ligation of the nick completes repair and is believed to be carried out by DNA ligase III (15Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which is present in cells as a heterodimer with XRCC1 (20Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The XRCC1 may act to ensure that polymerase β adds only one nucleotide (15Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The strong binding of thymine DNA glycosylase to apurinic sites suggested that it might recruit the other proteins involved in base excision repair. Consequently we investigated possible interactions between the thymine DNA glycosylase bound to the apurinic site and the other proteins involved in base excision repair. We found that repair cannot take place while the thymine DNA glycosylase is bound to the apurinic site, and so the extremely slow dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from these sites would greatly inhibit repair. However, the apurinic endonuclease HAP1, which catalyzes the second step in base excision repair, can displace the bound thymine DNA glycosylase. This effect, which couples the first and second steps in base excision repair, is concentration-dependent and would be expected to be significant at the concentrations of HAP1 reported in mammalian cells.DISCUSSIONHaving recently found (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) that each molecule of thymine DNA glycosylase can only remove one thymine because the glycosylase binds so tightly to the G·AP product of the reaction that it is unable to react with another G·T mismatch, we investigated the interaction of thymine DNA glycosylase with apurinic sites in DNA in more detail. We found that the glycosylase can bind to DNA containing an apurinic site opposite guanine, S 6-methylthioguanine (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), cytosine, thymine, and adenine (Fig. 2). Thus thymine DNA glycosylase shows no absolute preference for the base opposite the apurinic site but seems only to require the apurinic site itself. Furthermore, thymine DNA glycosylase binds to all apurinic sites with a relatively low K d. These findings suggest that thymine DNA glycosylase may bind to apurinic sites in the cell produced by the following: (i) spontaneous depurination; (ii) the action of alkylating agents and other chemicals that react with the bases in DNA to produce adducts with unstable glycosidic bonds, such as 3-alkyladenine or 7-methylguanine (27Lawley P.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1966; 5: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar); and, (iii) the action of other DNA glycosylases such as uracil DNA glycosylase and the glycosylases that remove modified bases (28Singer B. Hang B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 713-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).We have measured the dissociation rates for glycosylase-apurinic DNA complexes using a band shift assay that has been used previously for measuring dissociation rates of protein-nucleic acid complexes (23Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Werner M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5832-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,30Long K.S. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8885-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The absolute k off values obtained here need to be confirmed using other techniques and should be treated with caution. However, the dissociation rates are consistent with the results for the reaction of thymine DNA glycosylase (see Fig. 3 and discussion below). In EDTA buffer, the dissociation rates of complexes between thymine DNA glycosylase and all three apurinic containing DNA duplexes tested in Fig. 3 are extremely slow (1.8–3.6 × 10−5 s−1; see Table I) and correspond to half-lives for the complexes of between 5 and 10 h. Assuming a typical second-order association rate (k on) of 107m−1 s−1, these results imply that the binding constants for thymine DNA glycosylase to these apurinic sites in DNA are between 2 and 4 pm. These results confirm our previous finding that the thymine DNA glycosylase action is limited by extremely slow product release (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The E. coli mismatch-specific uracil glycosylase, MUG, which is a homologue of thymine DNA glycosylase (9Gallinari P. Jiricny J. Nature. 1996; 383: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), also binds to apurinic sites in DNA (31Barrett T.E. Savva R. Panayotou G. Barlow T. Brown T. Jiricny J. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1998; 92: 117-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), although the reported K d (6 nm) for the binding of MUG to an apurinic site opposite guanine is a thousand times larger than the value obtained here for human thymine DNA glycosylase.Thymine DNA glycosylase does not require magnesium, and initially we followed the practice of previous authors (2Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Nature. 1989; 339: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Griffin S. Branch P. Xu Y.-Z. Karran P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4787-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Sibghat-Ullah Gallinari P. Xu Y.-Z. Goodman M.F. Bloom L.B. Jiricny J. Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12926-12932Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Neddermann P. Gallinari P. Lettieri T. Schmid D. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and carried out the thymine DNA glycosylase experiments in buffer containing EDTA. As the following step in base excision repair, cutting of the apurinic site by the apurinic endonuclease HAP1 requires at least 0.1 mm magnesium for maximum activity (32Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the dissociation rates were also measured in the presence of 2 mm magnesium. Magnesium had little effect upon the rate of dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from G·AP DNA (only a 60% increase ink off), but it increased the rate of dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from SMeG·AP and C·AP sites in DNA by 20- and 28-fold, respectively (Table I). This increase in the dissociation rate produced by magnesium has a great influence on the reaction of thymine DNA glycosylase with DNA containing aSMeG·T or a C·U mismatch allowing it to remove more than a stoichiometric amount of thymine from SMeG·T and uracil from C·U mismatches (Fig. 3, F and G). In contrast, magnesium had little effect on the dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from a G·AP site in DNA, so even in the presence of magnesium the glycosylase could remove only a stoichiometric amount of the mismatched thymine or uracil from DNA containing a G·T or a G·U mismatch. These results suggest that in the presence of magnesium and with limiting thymine DNA glycosylase, both C·U mismatches andSMeG·T mismatches would be better substrates for the glycosylase than G·T DNA. This is probably irrelevant to the repair of C·U base pairs because they would occur very rarely in cells, and it is almost certain that in vivo uracil would be removed from C·U by the more efficient and abundant uracil DNA glycosylase. However, thymine DNA glycosylase is the only glycosylase known to be able to remove thymine from SMeG·T base pairs so the reasonably rapid attack of thymine DNA glycosylase onSMeG·T mismatches may be important in regard to the cytotoxicity of 6-thioguanine (11Swann P.F. Waters T.R. Moulton D.C. Xu Y.-Z. Zheng Q. Edwards M. Mace R. Science. 1996; 273: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar).Glycosylases mediate the first step in the base excision repair pathway. The apurinic sites produced are then cut at the apurinic site by an apurinic endonuclease, probably HAP1 (reviewed in Ref. 33Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We had expected that the bound thymine DNA glycosylase might recruit HAP1 and thus facilitate the cleavage of the apurinic site, but unexpectedly it was found that neither HAP1 nor Endonuclease IV can cut at the apurinic site while thymine DNA glycosylase is bound to it (Fig. 5,A and B). Thus dissociation of the thymine DNA glycosylase from the apurinic site is a prerequisite for complete repair to take place (Fig. 7). HAP1 increases the rate of this dissociation. This increases the removal of thymine from G·T mismatches, because the displacement allows turnover of the glycosylase (Fig. 5) and accelerates the repair because it allows HAP1 to cut the apurinic site, which in turn allows the other enzymes involved in base excision repair to refill the gap in the DNA. The displacement of thymine DNA glycosylase from the apurinic site appears to be specific to HAP1 since Endonuclease IV, a type II endonuclease from E. coli, has no effect on the glycosylase reaction (Fig.5 A). No similar interaction between a DNA glycosylase and HAP1 has been reported before. The increase induced by 6 nmHAP1 in the rate of turnover of 6 nm thymine DNA glycosylase was quite small, but the increase is concentration-dependent and at 600 nm HAP1 a much larger increase in turnover was induced. From the purification of HAP1 from HeLa cells (14Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we estimate that the concentration of HAP1 is about 0.1–1 mm (a similar figure is given in Ref. 34Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and at this concentration HAP1 should produce a very substantial increase in the rate of dissociation of thymine DNA glycosylase from apurinic sites. The rate of removal of thymine from G·T mismatches by thymine DNA glycosylase in the presence of such a large concentration of HAP1 should be more than adequate to cope with the rate of deamination of 5-methylcytosine in cells (35Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4273) Google Scholar). The high concentration of HAP1 in cells may, in part, reflect its role in maintaining the redox state of some transcription factors (33Barzilay G. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but it may also reflect the necessity for a large concentration of HAP1 to dissociate the thymine DNA glycosylase, and conceivably other DNA glycosylases, from apurinic sites.A multiprotein complex that fully repairs uracil sites in DNA has been purified suggesting that components of base excision repair may exist as a “repairosome” that can carry out complete repair in a concerted manner (36Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Kubota et al. (15Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) reconstitutedin vitro the repair of uracil in DNA using the human proteins uracil DNA glycosylase, HAP1, polymerase β, XRCC1, and DNA ligase III. In an analogous experiment, we reconstituted in vitro repair of DNA containing a G·T mismatch using thymine DNA glycosylase, HAP1, polymerase β, XRCC1, and DNA ligase III. Our present data do not support the view that these proteins act as a repair complex analogous to that seen in nucleotide excision repair (reviewed in Ref. 37Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although this combination of proteins could completely repair the G·T mismatch, the rate of the glycosylase reaction was no greater than that seen with thymine DNA glycosylase and HAP1 alone (Fig. 7) showing that these other repair proteins are not able to cooperate with HAP1 in the displacement of the glycosylase from the apurinic site. Furthermore, there was no evidence from band shift assays that HAP1, which is the only one of these proteins that had any effect on the dissociation of the thymine DNA glycosylase from the apurinic site, formed a complex with the thymine DNA glycosylase bound to the apurinic site (Fig. 6).The interaction between thymine DNA glycosylase and HAP1 would loosely coordinate the first and second step of base excision repair and appears similar to the recently reported interaction between HAP1 and DNA polymerase β (34Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) that would loosely coordinate the second and third step. An interaction between polymerase β and a complex of DNA ligase III and XRCC1 has also been described (15Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The overall effect of these interactions might be to link all the steps in the pathway. However, this coordination does not entirely explain why the glycosylase binds so strongly to apurinic sites. If the site were not protected by the bound glycosylase it would be very rapidly cut by HAP1, which is a relatively fast enzyme (25Strauss P.R. Beard W.A. Patterson T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and so the binding of the glycosylase to apurinic sites slows, rather than accelerates, their repair. One possibility comes from the observation that in human tissue, the amount of HAP1 measured in some cells types is quite low, and in some cells HAP1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and thus may not be available for DNA repair (38Duguid J.R. Eble J.N. Wilson T.M. Kelley M.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar). One could foresee that in cells where there was a lack of HAP1, the binding of thymine DNA glycosylase to apurinic sites might prevent oxidative damage to the apurinic site or might act as a physical block to DNA replication or transcription and prevent misincorporation opposite the apurinic site. Alternatively, it might act as a signal to halt the cell cycle until DNA repair can be completed or, in extreme cases, might act as the signal for apoptosis. In mammalian cells, 2–7% of the total cytosine is methylated. Spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, which is somewhat faster than cytosine (1Ehrlich M. Zhang X.Y. Inamdar N.M. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), generates G·T mispairs in DNA. The repair of these G·T mismatches is initiated by thymine DNA glycosylase which excises the mismatched thymine (2Wiebauer K. Jiricny J.

Kinetic studies in our laboratory showed that each molecule of thymine DNA glycosylase can remove only one thymine molecule because the glycosylase remains bound to the apurinic site it produces (7Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since this strong binding may have physiological significance, it has been studied in more detail. Removal of an incorrect base by a DNA glycosylase is the first step of base excision repair (reviewed in Refs. 12Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjørås M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar and 13Krokan H.E. Standal R. Slupphaug G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), and one possible role of the bound thymine DNA glycosylase might be to recruit the enzymes needed to complete the repair process. Removal of the base is followed by cleavage of the phosphodiester bond 5′ to the abasic sugar (Fig. 1). In humans, this reaction is most probably carried out by the apurinic endonuclease, HAP1 (also known as APE, APEX, and Ref-1), as this enzyme is responsible for around 95% of all incisions at apurinic sites in HeLa cell extracts (14Kane C.M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3405-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can function satisfactorily in reconstituted in vitro base excision repair systems (15Kubota Y. Nash R.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7557-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Following cleavage of the sugar-phosphate backbone, DNA polymerase β then removes the deoxyribose 5′-phosphate and fills the single base gap (17Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), which is present in cells as a heterodimer with XRCC1 (20Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K.

Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The strong binding of thymine DNA glycosylase to apurinic sites suggested that it might recruit the other proteins involved in base excision repair. Consequently we investigated possible interactions between the thymine DNA glycosylase bound to the apurinic site and the other proteins involved in base excision repair. We found that repair cannot take place"

The functional expression of receptors appears to be regulated both generally, at the level of transcription or translation, and locally, at the level of the individual synapse. A key component in the regulation of any protein is its turnover rate, which, measured in half-lives, ranges from a few minutes to several days. In the present study, we measured the turnover rates of subunits of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, the two major ionotropic glutamate receptors, using cultured cerebellar granule cells. Turnover rates for NR1, NR2A/B, GluR2/3, and GluR4 subunits were determined by pulse-chase labeling of cells with [35S]methionine. Half-lives were found to be 18 ± 5 h and 23 ± 8 h for the AMPA receptor subunits GluR2/3 and GluR4, respectively, and 16 ± 5 h for NR2A. The NR1 subunit showed a biphasic decay with half-lives of 2 and 34 h for the rapidly and slowly degraded populations, respectively. Splice variants of the NR1 subunit with different carboxyl-terminal cassettes, C2 and C2′, showed similar biphasic degradation patterns. To further characterize the rapidly degraded pool of NR1, surface receptors were labeled by biotinylation, and half-lives of the biotinylated proteins were determined. All surface NR1 was slowly degraded with a pattern similar to that of NR2A, GluR2/3, and GluR4, suggesting that the rapidly degraded pool is confined to the cytoplasm and not assembled with NR2 subunits. A significant amount of NR1 was not immunoprecipitated by NR2 subunit-specific antibodies after solubilization with deoxycholate. This unassembled pool, but not the assembled one, was greatly diminished following treatment of cycloheximide for 5 h, indicating that the rapidly degraded pool of NR1 is not assembled with NR2. These results show that NMDA and AMPA receptors have similar turnover rates, but NMDA receptors have a separate pool of NR1 subunits that is rapidly degraded and accounts for most of the intracellular pool.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and three distinct subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast excitatory transmission (1Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 365-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). AMPA1 receptors and NMDA receptors are the principle ionotropic receptors, while kainate receptors are widely distributed but less abundant (2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 3Petralia R.S. The Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 219-263Crossref Google Scholar). AMPA receptors are composed of four homologous subunits, GluR1, -2, -3, and -4, which assemble into a receptor complex, probably containing five subunits (2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 4Boulter J. Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Hartley M. Deneris E. Maron C. Heinemann S. Science. 1990; 249: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). While homomeric AMPA receptors are functional and appear to exist in neurons, most native AMPA receptors consist of two or more different subunits (5Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol.

For NMDA receptors, two classes of subunits, NR1 and NR2A-D, have been cloned (2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 1991; 354: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). In addition, various splice variants have been identified for the NR1 subunits (9Durand G.M. Gregor P. Zheng X. Bennett M.V.L.

The NR1 subunit may be functional by itself, but it is generally thought that native NMDA receptors are heteromeric complexes with NR1 serving as an obligatory subunit (12Monyer H. Sprengel R.

Unlike AMPA receptors, all NMDA receptors are calcium-permeable, and gating is voltage-dependent. NMDA and AMPA receptors are expressed in the same neuron and often are co-localized at postsynaptic membranes, where they are anchored through their C termini to PDZ (PSD-95/discs large protein/zona occludens protein 1) domain-containing proteins in the postsynaptic density (14Bekkers J.M.

The number and type of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane will determine the nature as well as the magnitude of the response to release of the neurotransmitter, glutamate. Two general mechanisms appear to control the number and composition of glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. The first is the control of the expression of a receptor at the levels of transcription and translation. Expression of mRNA for all glutamate receptors is developmentally and regionally regulated (20Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 21Sato K. Kiyama H. Tohyama M. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 515-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Watanabe M.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). Selective changes in expression of receptor subunits also occur under certain pathophysiological conditions and may have a critical impact on neurons. For example, it has been proposed that a selective decrease in GluR2 mRNA and protein following ischemia generates calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which eventually lead to neuronal degeneration due to excess calcium influx through their channels (24Gorter J.A. Petrozzino J.J. Aronica E.M. Rosenbaum D.M. Opitz T. Bennett M.V. Connor J.A. Zukin R.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6179-6188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor expression is also regulated at the level of the individual synapse such that different synaptic populations of a neuron may contain different glutamate receptors (25Landsend A.S. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Matsubara A. Bergersen L. Usami S. Wenthold R.J. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 834-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rubio M.E. Wenthold R.J.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The synaptic receptor composition may vary under different physiological conditions; for example, it has been proposed that long term potentiation is generated by the conversion of synapses that previously did not contain AMPA receptors or contained electrophysiologically silent AMPA receptors to synapses that contain functional AMPA receptors through the activation of NMDA receptors (28Liao D. Hessler N.A. Malinow R. Nature. 1995; 375: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 29Isaac J.T.R. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 427-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). A similar up-regulation of AMPA receptors may occur during synapse development (30Durand G.M. Kovalchuk Y. Konnerth A. Nature. 1996; 381: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 31Wu G.Y. Malinow R. Cline H.T. Science. 1996; 274: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). A critical parameter in a protein's response to changes in its rate of synthesis or degradation is the turnover rate of the protein. Turnover rates, usually expressed in half-lives, vary widely for proteins with half-lives ranging from less than 1 min to many days (32Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A protein with a short half-life is much more effectively regulated by changing synthesis or degradation rates than a protein with a long half-life. Therefore, if glutamate receptors have short half-lives, changes in synthesis, resulting from either changes in transcription or translation, as well as changes in degradation could be effective in rapid regulation of levels of synaptic receptors. In the present study, we investigated the turnover characteristics of two key ionotropic receptors, AMPA and NMDA receptors, in cultured cerebellar granule cells. These cultures have the advantage of representing a nearly homogenous population of neurons that express several glutamate receptors, including functional AMPA and NMDA receptors. We demonstrate that subunits of both receptors have similar and relatively long half-lives, with values of about 20 h, as measured both by pulse-chase and surface biotinylation. However, a pool of the NR1 subunit, which is not assembled with NR2 and represents about half of the total NR1, is rapidly degraded with a half-life of about 2 h. Tissue culture media, sera, and supplies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; cytosine arabinoside from Sigma; methionine and cysteine-free medium from NIH Media Service branch; [35S]methionine and Enlightening from NEN Life Science Products; protein A-agarose beads, Ultralink Plus immobilized streptavidin beads, Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, and NHS-SS-biotin from Pierce; Kodak X-Omat AR films from Eastman Kodak Co.; autoradiographic14C-labeled microscales and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; SDS electrophoresis gels from Novex; and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin from Southern Biotechnology Associates. Cultures of cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described by Gallo et al.(33Gallo W. Ciotti M.T. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella were obtained from 7–8-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups. They were chopped by using a tissue slicer and treated with 0.025% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. Following trypsinization, tissue was dissociated by passage through fire-polished pipettes, and tissue debris was separated from dissociated cells by sedimentation. Cells were centrifuged and suspended in the plating medium, which consisted of basal medium Eagle, 25 mm KCl, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and were plated on 3.5-cm culture plates coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/dish. After 19–20 h, proliferation of glial cells was inhibited by treatment with 10 μm cytosine arabinoside. All experiments were performed on 8–9-day in vitro cells. Cells were washed twice with prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 25 mm KCl, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in depletion media, which consisted of methionine- and cysteine-free basal medium Eagle, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and then pulse-labeled with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) in depletion medium for 20 min at 37 °C. Some experiments were performed in medium lacking glutamine. After 20 min, cells were washed once with basal medium Eagle containing 2 mm methionine and then were incubated with conditioned medium containing 2 mmmethionine and 2.5 mm HEPES for variable times. KCl (25 mm) was included in all media throughout the experiment. To block glycosylation, tunicamycin was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml to the medium 12 h before pulse labeling and was included during pulse labeling. To harvest, cells were washed twice with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were stored frozen at −70 °C until use. Monoclonal antibodies (54.2) to NR1 subunits and NR2B subunits were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Antibodies specific to NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C subunits were generated against polyhistidine fusion proteins containing the C-terminal region of each subunit encompassing 934–1203 for NR2A, 935–1856 for NR2B (34Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12107-12115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and 1110–1242 for NR2C subunits. The NR2C antibody was specific to NR2C subunits as tested by Western blot analysis using human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells transfected with different NR2 subunits. Other antibodies to splice variants of NR1, NR2A/B, GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4 subunits were generated against synthetic peptides which correspond to the sequences at the C termini, and characterization and demonstration of the specificity of the antibodies was made in previous studies (5Wenthold R.J.

Cell pellets were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin) by trituration and solubilized with 2% SDS in buffer A by incubating for 3 min at 90 °C. The soluble extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C, and 100 μl of the soluble extract was diluted 6-fold with 2% Triton X-100 in buffer A. To retain NMDA receptor subunit associations, cells were solubilized with 1% deoxycholate at pH 9 in buffer A (36Blahos II, J. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was used instead of 1 mm ABESF). After centrifugation, the soluble extract was diluted 10-fold with 0.1% Triton X-100. SDS or deoxycholate soluble fractions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads to which 10 μg of polyclonal antibodies or 2.5 μg of monoclonal antibodies were preattached. Immunoprecipitated pellets were washed three times with buffer A containing 2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and the above protease mixture, followed by two washes with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer (60 μl) by incubating at 90 °C for 3 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gradient gels. For fluorography, electrophoresed gels were fixed with the solution containing 30% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 30 min and treated with fluorophore (Enlightening) for 30 min. Gels were dried onto Whatman filter papers and exposed to films (Kodak X-Omat AR) at −70 °C. Fluorograms were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer, and densities were normalized using standard curves generated with autoradiographic 14C-labeled microscales. Membrane homogenates from cultured cells or cerebellum were suspended in 10 mmNaH2PO4 buffer containing 10 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin and solubilized with 1% SDS containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol by incubating at 90 °C for 2–3 min. The soluble fraction was diluted with 1% β-octyl glucopyranoside in 10 mmNaH2PO4 containing the above protease mixture to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and incubated with endoglycosidase H (15 milliunits) or N-glycosidase F (3 units) overnight at 37 °C. An equal volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer was added for SDS-PAGE analysis. Membrane homogenates or soluble extracts of granule cells or adult rat cerebella were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C, incubated with primary antibodies in TBST for 1.5 h, and washed three times for 15 min each. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h and washed three times, and bound antibodies were visualized by the chemiluminescence detection method. Cultured granule cells were washed four times with HBSS, and surface proteins were biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin or NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml) in HBSS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with HBSS four times and incubated in conditioned medium for 15 min at 37 °C in a humidified incubator before harvest. For determination of the cytoplasmic pool of the receptors, cells were harvested immediately after washing. KCl (25 mm) was included in all HBSS solutions for washing and biotinylation. Cells were harvested at various times as described above, by using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mglycine and protease mixture. Cells were stored at −70 °C. Pellets were solubilized with 2% SDS, diluted with 2% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitated using appropriate antibodies as described above, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transferring the gel to nitrocellulose membranes, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST, incubated for 1.5 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000) in TBST containing 0.5% milk, and washed three times for 15 min each. Biotinylated proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence. When NHS-SS-biotin was used, Ultralink-immobilized streptavidin beads were used to precipitate biotinylated proteins, and subunit proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Cultured cerebellar granule cells, 8–9 days in vitro, were chosen for this study because it has been shown previously that these cells express functional AMPA and NMDA receptors (37Bessho Y. Nawa H.

Using antibodies selective for AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and NR1 splice variants, Western blot analysis shows that multiple subunits and splice variants are expressed in these cultures (Fig. 1). It has been previously shown that NR2A and NR2C are the predominant NR2 subunits in granule cellsin vivo in the adult animal, while NR2B is the major subunit in granule cells at early developmental stages (20Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 23Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). This developmental change of the subunit expression also occurs in cultured granule cells (42Condorelli D.F. Dell'Albani P. Aronica E. Genazzani A.A. Casabona G. Corsaro M. Balázs R. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pattern of NR2 subunit expression in the present study is consistent with previous findings of mRNA analysis, where NR2A was the major subunit expressed and NR2B and NR2C were expressed in a lower abundance at 7–8 days in vitro(37Bessho Y. Nawa H. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 41Vallano M.L. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Rossier J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 631-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since all four alternatively spliced cassettes of NR1 are found in cultured granule cells, it is possible that they are differentially assembled and that multiple functionally distinct NMDA receptors are expressed. NR1 C2-containing receptors appear to be more abundant than those containing the other C-terminal cassette, C2′, as determined by using different antibodies selective for the two cassettes. This was confirmed in a separate experiment where NR1 PAN antibodies were used to probe receptors immunoprecipitated with NR1 C2 and C2′ antibodies (data not shown). At least three AMPA receptor subunits were expressed in granule cells, GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4 (the antibody to GluR2/3 recognizes both GluR2 and GluR3 (5Wenthold R.J. Yokotani N. Doi K. Wada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 501-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); mRNA for GluR2 and GluR3 subunits have been shown to be expressed (42Condorelli D.F. Dell'Albani P. Aronica E. Genazzani A.A. Casabona G. Corsaro M. Balázs R. Nicoletti F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). GluR1 is not expressed in granule cells in vivo in adult rats but is expressed in cultured cells, as previously reported by Hacket al. (39Hack N.J. Sluiter A.A. Balázs R. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 87: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who showed a greater than 3-fold increase in GluR1 between 2 and 9 days in culture, while GluR2/3 and GluR4 remained relatively constant. Because of these rapidly changing levels of GluR1, this subunit was not included in the turnover analyses. To measure the degradation rates of receptor subunits, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased in conditioned medium containing unlabeled methionine. Sufficient radioactivity was incorporated under these conditions to permit quantitation of receptor subunits immunoprecipitated with antibodies to NR1, NR2A, GluR2/3, and GluR4. Incubation with 2% SDS at 90 °C was used to ensure optimal solubilization of subunits; NMDA receptor subunits, in particular, have been reported to be only partially solubilized from the brain with nonionic or weaker ionic detergents (36Blahos II, J. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 43Lau L.-F. Mammen A. Ehlers M.D. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C.

Under the conditions used in the present study, about 90% of NR1 and 80% of NR2A immunoreactivities were present in the soluble fraction (data not shown). After a 20-min incubation with [35S]methionine, the predominant species of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits appeared to be mature, fully glycosylated forms (Fig.2), since molecular weights of pulse-labeled subunits are similar to those of subunits that are expressed in cultured cells and the brain as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Treatment of the culture with tunicamycin before and during pulse labeling resulted in the complete loss of the mature subunit and the appearance of lower molecular weight bands that migrate at a position consistent with that of the deglycosylated forms of subunits (44Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E. Sullivan J.M. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22663-22671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hall R.A. Hansen A. Andersen P.H. Soderling T.R. J.

The absence of significant lower molecular weight unglycosylated forms indicates a rapid glycosylation of the subunits, and this appears to occur for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits as well (48Claudio T. Paulson H.L. Green W.N. Ross A.F. Hartman D.S. Hayden D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2277-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49Ross A.F. Green W.N. Hartman D.S. Claudio T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 623-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To characterize the glycosylation properties of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits, membrane homogenates of cultured cells and the cerebellum were analyzed by Western blotting after treatment with endoglycosidase H, which recognizes N-linked high mannose carbohydrates or N-glycosidase F (Fig.3). Treatment with endoglycosidase H generated low molecular weight species of NR1 subunits, which comigrate with those that were treated with N-glycosidase F, indicating glycosylation of NR1 subunits is of the high mannose type. NR2A subunits showed significant sensitivity but were not completely sensitive to endoglycosidase H. GluR2/3 and GluR4 subunits appeared to be resistant; however, there was a slight shift in molecular weights, indicating that some glycosylation moieties have high mannose structures (Fig. 3).Figure 3Glycosylation properties of glutamate receptor subunits. Membrane homogenates from cultured cells (gr) and cerebellum (cb) were solubilized with 1% SDS in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Soluble extracts, after dilution with 1% β-octyl glucoside, were incubated with endoglycosidase H or N-glycosidase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Migration of glycosidase-treated samples is compared with that of the control samples, which were treated identically but without enzymes.View Large I"

A new MAP kinase termed big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1/ERK5) has been shown to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor MEF2C, which is highly expressed in EC. To determine the effects of shear stress on BMK1, bovine aortic EC were exposed to steady laminar flow (shear stress = 12 dynes/cm2). Flow activated BMK1 within 10 min with peak activation at 60 min (7.1 ± 0.6-fold) in a force-dependent manner. Flow was the most powerful activator of BMK1, significantly greater than H2O2 or sorbitol. An important role for non-Src tyrosine kinases in flow-mediated BMK1 activation was demonstrated by inhibition with herbimycin A, but not with the Src inhibitor PP1 or overexpression of kinase-inactive c-Src. BMK1 activation was calcium-dependent as shown by inhibition with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid/acetoxymethyl ester or thapsigargin. As shown by specific inhibitors or activators, flow-mediated BMK1 activation was not regulated by the following: intracellular redox state; intracellular NO; protein kinase A, C, or G; calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; or arachidonic acid metabolism. In summary, flow potently stimulates BMK1 in EC by a mechanism dependent on a tyrosine kinase(s) and calcium mobilization, but not on c-Src, redox state, or NO production.

Fluid shear stress of blood, which modulates vessel structure and function, is one of the most important hemodynamic forces recognized and transduced by endothelial cells. Shear stress is also important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis because atherosclerotic plaques occur preferentially at arterial locations that experience turbulent flow or low shear stress. Increases in shear stress stimulate rapid secretion of vasoactive molecules, including nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelin. Changes in shear stress also cause long-term alterations in vessel structure and function by regulating protein and gene expression. For example, shear stress stimulates expression of platelet-derived growth factor A- and B-chains, tissue plasminogen activator, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and endothelin (1Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Peterson T.E. Tseng H. J. Biomech. 1995; 28: 1439-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 2Takahashi M. Ishida T. Traub O. Corson M.A. Berk B.C. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which endothelial cells sense mechanical stimuli and convert them to biochemical signals are not well characterized. Much experimental evidence indicates that the cellular response to shear stress is similar to the response to G protein-coupled receptors and growth factor receptors, which involves activation of a complex array of phosphorylation cascades. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinases respond to diverse stimuli, including physical stress, oxidative stress, and UV light, and play pivotal roles in a variety of cell functions. Thus, MAP kinases are excellent candidates to mediate mechanotransduction in endothelial cells. MAP kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases. Four subfamilies of MAP kinases have been identified, including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase, and big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1 or ERK5) (3Abe J. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Each subfamily may be regulated by different signal transduction pathways and modulate specific cell functions (3Abe J. Berk B.C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 is activated by an upstream kinase (MEK1) via dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif, whereas JNK and p38 kinase are activated by MEK4 and MEK3 via TPY and TGY motifs, respectively. BMK1, a recently identified MAP kinase family member, shares the TEY activation motif with ERK1/2, but is activated by MEK5. More important, BMK1 has a unique long COOH-terminal tail, suggesting that its regulation and function may be different from other MAP kinases. BMK1 was recently shown to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor MEF2C (5Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). MEF2C is highly expressed in endothelial cells (EC) and is likely to regulate EC function as shown by the abnormal blood vessel development in MEF2C knockout mice (6Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory (7Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ.

The upstream regulatory pathways include Gαi2, Ras, a tyrosine kinase, and PKC (7Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8Ishida T.

JNK activity is also modulated by shear stress, although the effects of shear stress on JNK are controversial. Two groups reported that JNK was activated by shear stress in BAEC via a mechanism involving Gβγ, Ras, and a tyrosine kinase(s) (10Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol.

In contrast, our laboratory found that shear stress failed to activate JNK in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited tumor necrosis factor-mediated JNK activation. 2J. Surapisitchat and B. C. Berk, submitted for publication. No studies have been published regarding changes in p38 or BMK1 activity in response to shear stress. In this study, we show that shear stress is the most potent stimulus for BMK1 activation in EC. We further investigated the roles of tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, intracellular Ca2+, ROS, NO, PKA, PKC, PKG, CaM kinase, PI 3-kinase, and arachidonic acid metabolism in shear stress-induced BMK1 activation. BAEC were harvested from fetal calf aortas by collagenase as described previously (7Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. Cells used in experiments were at passages 2–6. HUVEC were isolated as described previously (14Takahashi M. Berk B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), heparin (Sigma), and endothelial cell growth factor. Cells were used at passages 1–3. Experiments were performed with growth-arrested cells (2 days after reaching confluence) to minimize basal BMK1 activity. BAEC were grown on 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Upon reaching 70–80% confluence, cells were incubated with 0.1 ml of M199 medium containing Ad.KI-Src or Ad.LacZ for 1 h at 37 °C in a 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were then incubated with 5 ml of M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 days. The construction and preparation of Ad.KI-Src, characterization of transfection efficiency, and controls for cell toxicity have been described separately in detail. 3M. Okuda, J. Suero, C. E. Murry, O. Traub, and B. C. Berk, submitted for publication. Two different devices were used to create fluid shear stress in vitro: the parallel plate chamber and the cone and plate viscometer (16Traub O. Yan C. Berk B.C. Lelkes P. Mechanical Forces and the Endothelium. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Berkshire, Great Britain1999Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 2 × 4-cm slides of tissue culture plastic cut from the bottom of tissue culture dishes (for the parallel plate chamber) or on 60-mm dishes (for the cone and plate viscometer). Upon reaching confluence, cells were fed fresh medium, and 2 days later, the cells were rinsed free of culture medium with Hanks' balanced saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mm glucose. For experiments, cells were either maintained under static conditions or exposed to flow at 37 °C as described previously (16Traub O. Yan C. Berk B.C. Lelkes P. Mechanical Forces and the Endothelium. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Berkshire, Great Britain1999Google Scholar). After exposure to flow, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3). Cell lysates were prepared by flash-freezing and thawing in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For drug treatment experiments, EC were pretreated with the drug for the indicated time and then exposed to flow in the continual presence of the same drug. Time course and dose-response experiments were performed with the parallel plate chamber, and the remainder of the flow experiments were performed with the cone and plate viscometer. Cell proteins (300–400 μg) from each sample were incubated with 1 μl of rabbit anti-BMK1 polyclonal antibody (17Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

Circulation. 1996; 94 (abstr.): I-280Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h on a roller system at 4 °C. The immune complex beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mm benzamidine, twice with 1 ml of LiCl buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and twice with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). BMK1 kinase activity was measured by autophosphorylation as described previously (17Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In brief, immune complex kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 20 min in a reaction mixture (30 μl) containing 15 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated with 8 μl of 6× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (HybondTM-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and autoradiographed. Kinase activities were determined by densitometry of bands at the correct molecular masses in the linear range of film exposure using a scanner and NIH Image 1.6. The membrane was blocked for at least 1 h at room temperature with a commercial blocking buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The blot was then incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-BMK1 antibody at room temperature, followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) colorimetric method was used to measure glutathione (19Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), the predominant soluble thiol in EC (20Ghigo D. Alessio P. Foco A.

In brief, cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes, and post-confluent monolayers (≈1 × 106 cells/dish) were preincubated in culture medium at 37 °C for 16 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of BSO or for 1 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of NAC. Cells were then subjected to flow for 20 min in the presence of fresh medium containing the same concentration of BSO or NAC. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and 600 μl of 2% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid was added for cell lysis and deproteinization. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and aliquots of 500 μl were mixed with 500 μl of solution containing 0.3 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). After a 5-min incubation, the absorbance was read at 412 nm, and the concentration of soluble thiols was quantified by comparison with GSH standards. All materials were from Sigma except where indicated. PP1 (CP-118,556) was from Pfizer.N G-Monomethyl-l-arginine, BAPTA/AM, and KN-62 (1-(N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl)-4-phenylpiperazine) were from Calbiochem. 8-Bromo-cAMP and 8-bromo-cGMP were from BIOMOL® Research Laboratories, Inc. Liposome-encapsulated superoxide dismutase was a kind gift from Dr. M. Tarpey (University of Alabama at Birmingham). To determine whether shear stress regulates BMK1 activity in BAEC, BAEC were exposed to steady laminar flow, and anin vitro immune complex kinase assay was performed based on BMK1 autophosphorylation, which we have shown correlates well with myelin basic protein phosphorylation (17Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the physiological range of shear stress (3.5–35 dynes/cm2 for 20 min), BMK1 activity increased in a force-dependent manner that was maximal (11.1 ± 2.2-fold) at 35 dynes/cm2 (Fig.1). Flow activated BMK1 within 10 min, and the maximal activation occurred at 60 min (7.1 ± 0.6-fold) (Fig. 2). Although H2O2 and sorbitol also stimulated BMK1 activity in BAEC, the magnitude of BMK1 activation by flow was significantly greater than by H2O2 or sorbitol (Fig.3). BMK1 was not activated by known BAEC agonists, including 10 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, 1 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor, 2 units/ml thrombin, 10 nmendothelin, and 10 μm bradykinin (data not shown). Flow also stimulated BMK1 in HUVEC (data not shown).Figure 2Time course of BMK1 activation by shear stress.

Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The flow-induced c-Src activation was blocked by herbimycin A, detected using both antibody clone 28 (a gift from Dr. J. Yano) (23Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Owada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5680-5685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which recognizes the activated form of Src (Fig.4 B), and an in vitro kinase assay using enolase as a substrate (data not shown). In addition, we demonstrated previously that activation of BMK1 by H2O2 in fibroblasts is dependent on c-Src because BMK1 activation by H2O2 was diminished in Src−/− fibroblasts (17Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we anticipated that c-Src would be required for BMK1 activation by flow (17Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). PP1 is a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor (24Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar) and has been shown to block H2O2-induced BMK1 activation, which is dependent on Src in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts (17Abe J. Takahashi M. Ishida M. Lee J.-D. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20389-20394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To test the effect of PP1 on flow-induced BMK1 activation in EC, we pretreated EC with 10 or 50 μm PP1 for 15 min. PP1 failed to block BMK1 activation by flow, suggesting that flow-induced BMK1 activation is independent of c-Src in BAEC (Fig. 4 C). As a control for PP1 uptake and Src inhibition, we showed that these concentrations of PP1 blocked flow-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig.4 C) and p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown), which are both dependent on c-Src (22Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).3 The effects of PP1 on in vivo Src activity stimulated by flow could not be evaluated by any available methods because PP1 is a competitive inhibitor of ATP for Src; thus, PP1 would not be present in sufficient concentrations to inhibit the enzyme after c-Src immunoprecipitation. 4J. H. Hanke, personal communication. To examine further the involvement of c-Src in BMK1 activation by flow, we overexpressed kinase-inactive, dominant-negative chicken Src in BAEC using a recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad.KI-Src).3 A recombinant adenovirus vector encoding β-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ) was used as a negative control. The transfection efficiency increased with increasing virus concentration3; at a multiplicity of infection of 500 for Ad.LacZ, transfection efficiency was >80% measured 48 h after transfection by β-galactosidase staining. Infection with Ad.KI-Src increased total Src expression in a concentration-dependent manner from a multiplicity of infection of 250 to 500 as measured by Western blotting (Fig.5). Inhibiting Src had no effect on BMK1 activity stimulated by flow (Fig. 5), consistent with the conclusion that c-Src is not involved in flow-stimulated BMK1 activation. As a positive control, we showed that Ad.KI-Src at a multiplicity of infection of 500 completely inhibited flow-stimulated p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation, which we have shown to be Src-dependent.3 These results indicate that a tyrosine kinase other than c-Src mediates BMK1 activation by flow. Flow stimulates a rapid increase in BAEC intracellular Ca2+ (25Ishida T. Takahashi M. Corson M.A. Berk B.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether the flow-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ is necessary for BMK1 activation, we used BAPTA/AM to chelate intracellular Ca2+. BMK1 activation by flow was completely blocked by 30 μmBAPTA/AM and by 30 μm BAPTA/AM plus 2 mm EGTA (Fig. 6), suggesting that flow activates BMK1 through Ca2+-dependent pathways in BAEC. Previous data suggest that flow stimulates both Ca2+ influx into the cells and Ca2+ release from internal stores (25Ishida T. Takahashi M. Corson M.A. Berk B.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine which Ca2+ source mediates BMK1 activation, we chelated extracellular Ca2+ by 2 mm EGTA or depleted internal Ca2+ stores by 10 μmthapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic Ca2+ pumps. Flow-induced BMK1 activation was completely blocked by thapsigargin, but not by EGTA alone (Fig. 6), suggesting that BMK1 activation is dependent on the mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores. To determine whether an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is sufficient for BMK1 activation, we treated cells with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. At A23187 concentrations known to increase intracellular Ca2+ to >1000 nm(1 and 10 μm), BMK1 activity was not stimulated (data not shown). These results suggest that increases in intracellular Ca2+ are necessary, but not sufficient, for BMK1 activation by flow. Flow increases intracellular ROS, as evidenced by increases in oxidized proteins (21Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and inhibition of aconitase activity. 5A. Wu, C. Yan, and B. C. Berk, unpublished observations. ROS production has been suggested to mediate mechanotransduction leading to MAP kinase activation in EC stimulated by flow (21Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). BMK1 is activated by flow and is also known to be activated by H2O2 (Fig. 3), suggesting that intracellular ROS generated by flow may mediate BMK1 activation in BAEC. To test this hypothesis, we utilized BSO (a selective inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) and NAC (a well known precursor of glutathione synthesis) to change the levels of GSH, the intracellular reduced form of glutathione, which is the most important cellular non-protein-reducing thiol antioxidant (20Ghigo D. Alessio P. Foco A. Bussolino F. Costamagna C. Heller R. Garbarino G. Pescarmona G.P. Bosia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C728-C732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with varying concentrations of NAC (3–30 mm) did not attenuate flow-induced BMK1 activation (Fig.7 A). In fact, a slight increase was observed (Fig. 7 A). Treatment of cells with BSO (0.1–1 mm) also did not significantly modulate flow-induced BMK1 activity (Fig. 7 B). However, as expected, exposure to BSO or NAC resulted in a dose-dependent depletion or accumulation of endothelial GSH, respectively (Fig.7 C), indicating that BSO and NAC were biologically active. The efficacy of treatment with BSO and NAC was shown by the findings that H2O2-induced BMK1 activation was altered by BSO and NAC in the anticipated manner, with a small enhancement by BSO and dramatic inhibition by NAC (Fig. 7 D). We also showed that NAC treatment inhibited phenylmethylsulfonate-stimulated superoxide production in EC (data not shown), indicating that NAC treatment increased antioxidant defenses toward both superoxide and H2O2. Finally, we introduced superoxide dismutase into BAEC using liposome-encapsulated superoxide dismutase as described previously (26Laursen J.B. Rajagopalan S. Galis Z. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 1997; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). However, there was no significant effect on BMK1 activation by flow (Table I). Taken together, these results indicate that flow-induced BMK1 activation is not mediated by ROS.Table ISummary of effects of various inhibitors and agonists on BMK1 activation by shear stressDrugs and agentsEffects on target moleculesaShown are presumed mechanisms of action for the agents used.BMK1 activitybShown are the effects of drugs on flow-induced BMK1 activity.Herbimycin AInhibition of tyrosine kinase(s)DecreasePP1 (10–50 μm)Inhibition of Src family kinasesNo ΔcNo significant change observed.Ad.KI-SrcInhibition of c-SrcNo ΔThapsigargin (1 μm)Depletion of internal Ca2+ storesDecreaseBAPTA/AM (30 μm)Decrease in intracellular Ca2+levelDecreaseEGTA (2 mm)Chelation of extracellular Ca2+No ΔNAC (3–30 mm)Glutathione precursorSlight increaseBSO (0.1–1 mm)Inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetaseNo ΔLiposome SODdSOD, superoxide dismutase; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; LNMMA,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine; LNA,N G-nitro-l-arginine; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; Br-, bromo-; NDGA, nordihydroguaiaretic acid.Increase in superoxide dismutaseNo ΔSIN-1 (100 μm)Generation of NO and O2−No ΔSNAP (100 μm)Generation of NONo ΔSNP (100 μm)Generation of NONo ΔLNMMA (100–300 μm)Inhibition of NOSNo ΔLNA (10–300 μm)Inhibition of NOSNo ΔPDBu (2 μm)Down-regulation of PKCNo ΔGö6850 (2 μm)Inhibition of PKCNo Δ8-Br-cAMP (100 μm to 1 mm)Activation of PKANo Δ8-Br-cGMP (100 μm to 1 mm)Activation of PKGNo ΔKN-62 (10 μm)CaM kinasesNo ΔWortmannin (10–100 nm)Inhibition of PI 3-kinaseNo ΔLY294002 (1–10 μm)Inhibition PI 3-kinaseNo ΔIndomethacin (10 μm)Inhibition of cyclooxygenaseNo ΔNDGA (1–30 μm)Inhibition of lipoxygenaseNo Δa Shown are presumed mechanisms of action for the agents used.b Shown are the effect"

One of the biochemical pathways for metabolism of arachidonic acid is the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathway, which results in formation of 4 regio- and stereoisomeric products; cis-5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs).1 Compared with our knowledge of the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways for arachidonic acid metabolism, relatively little is understood about the epoxygenase pathway. Numerous physiological roles have been suggested for the EETs and collectively, the EETs appear to have potent effects on ion channels (1Fitzpatrick F.A. Murphy R.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1989; 40: 229-241Google Scholar, 2Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 3Harder D.R. Roman R.J. Ma Y.H. Clark B.S. Masters B.S. Van Rollins M. Gebremedhin D. Blood Vessels. 1991; 28: 290-292Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms for regulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in response to hormones and other agonists is through the “capacitative pathway” as originally described by Putney (4Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 5Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway occurs through G protein receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate yielding inositol trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol. Ins(1,4,5)P3binds to its receptor on the intracellular calcium stores, initiating release of stored calcium (6Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6165) Google Scholar). As the stores are depleted of calcium, a second messenger termed “calcium influx factor” (CIF) is released (7Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). CIF induces influx of extracellular calcium through second messenger operated channels (SMOC) in the plasma membrane, thereby coupling calcium entry to depletion of internal stores. To date, the identity of CIF remains unknown. In previous work from our laboratory (8Rzigalinski B.A. Blackmore P.F. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we reported that capacitative calcium influx was linked to arachidonic acid release by activation of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in human U937 lymphoma cells and in rat cortical astrocytes (9Rzigalinski B.A. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: S717Google Scholar), suggesting that arachidonic acid, or a metabolite thereof, was a component of CIF. Recent work from several other groups has shown that the actions of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase may also be coupled to capacitative calcium influx (10Graier W.F. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Hoebel B.G. Kostner G.M. Graier W.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hoebel et al. (11Hoebel B.G. Kostner G.M. Graier W.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1579-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) recently reported that functional P450 activity was critical to regulation of store-operated calcium influx and proposed that an EET may constitute the driving force for capacitative calcium entry in endothelial cells. Graier et al. (10Graier W.F. Simecek S. Sturek M. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have presented evidence suggesting that 5,6-EET stimulates capacitative calcium influx in endothelial cells, consistent with CIF. However, if 5,6-EET is CIF or a component thereof, then it should have similar effects in all cells lines which signal through Ins(1,4,5)P3. Although CIF is hypothesized to have its primary actions at an intracellular level, it may also be released into the extracellular environment, acting as a paracrine signal for SMOC calcium influx independent of release of calcium from intracellular stores. In Jurkat cells, CIF was released to the extracellular medium upon stimulation with phytohemmaglutinin (7Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, which induces NO- and prostaglandin I2-independent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, is released in response to agonists operating through Ins(1,4,5)P3-dependent signaling (12Chen G.F. Yamamoto Y. Miwa K. Suzuki H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1888-H1889PubMed Google Scholar, 13Garland C.J. Plane F. Kemp B.K. Cooks T.M. Trends Pharmacol.

Narayanan J. Jefcoat C. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Roman R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2098PubMed Google Scholar) and Gebremedhin et al. (16Gebremedhin D. Ma Y. Falck J.R. Roman R.J. VanRollins M. Harder D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 32: H519-H525Google Scholar) reported that cat brain converted arachidonic acid to EETs, which dilated cerebral arteries, implying that endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor may be an EET. Hecker et al. (17Hecker M. Bara A.T. Bauersachs J. Busse R. J. Physiol. 1995; 481: 407-414Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar) reported an NO- and cyclooxygenase-independent relaxation of porcine aortic rings which was mediated by calcium-activated K+channels (K Ca) and required the combined actions of PLA2 and P450, precisely those systems which may mediate CIF. Additional reports indicate that K Ca are closely coupled to capacitative calcium influx (18Shah J. Pant H.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11789-11793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports lead to the speculation that endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor may represent a paracrine function of CIF. In the present report we present evidence suggesting that 5,6-EET is a CIF in astrocytes and when released into the extracellular environment may participate in regulation of local cerebrovascular tone. Young adult rats and rat pups (1–2 days old) were purchased from Hilltop Lab Animals (Scottdale, PA). Dulbecco's modified essential medium and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) with or without calcium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Arachidonic acid and EETs (free acids) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Fura-2 AM and calcium calibration buffers were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). SKF96365, arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AAOCF3), econazole, SKF525A, and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Indomethacin was obtained from Sigma.N-Methylsulfonyl-6-(2-propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH) was synthesized by Dr. J. R. Falck (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Astrocytes were prepared from 1–2-day-old rat pups as described previously (20Amruthesh S.C. Boerschel M.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, cortices were isolated, cleaned of white matter and meninges, minced, and trypsin-digested for 10 min. The dissociated tissue was diluted into Dulbecco's modified essential medium (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine) and seeded into 75-cm2 flasks at an initial density of 1–2 × 106 cells per flask. Flasks were cultured to confluency (10–14 days) in 5% CO2/air at 37 °C. Medium was changed every 2–3 days. During medium changes, flasks were forcefully shaken to remove microglia, which were decanted with the medium. On reaching confluency, flasks were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in saline) for 1 min. The trypsin/EDTA solution was aspirated and the cell monolayer (still adherent to the flask) was covered with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified essential medium and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, sufficient time to lift the cells from the flask bottom. Lifted cells were washed and plated onto collagen-coated 35 × 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 3.2 × 105 cells per dish. For arachidonic acid release assays, 0.5 × 105cells were plated into 25-mm diameter tissue culture wells (6 wells/plate). Cells were then cultured to confluency (2 weeks). Astrocyte cultures were characterized for purity as described previously (20Amruthesh S.C. Boerschel M.F. McKinney J.S. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and found to be >98% pure as assessed by the presence of glial fibrillary acidic protein. Cells were used for experiments at a total of 4 weeks after removal from the rat. [Ca2+]i was measured with the ratiometric dye, Fura-2, as described previously (21Rzigalinski B.A. Weber J.T. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were washed 3 times with DPBS supplemented with 2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 1 mm glucose and placed in 1.5 ml of this media for loading. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM for 50 min. at room temperature. This loading procedure resulted in complete dye hydrolysis as determined by scanning the excitation spectra of loaded cells, with negligible sequestration of dye in subcellular organelles (22Roe M.W. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of Fura-2 was monitored as described previously by Poenieet al. (23Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was measured at room temperature using a Ratiomaster (Photon Technologies Int., South Brunswick, NJ) microspectrophotometry system as described previously (24Zhang L. Rzigalinski B.A. Ellis E.F. Satin L.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1921-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Excitation light was provided by a xenon arc lamp coupled to a scanning monochrometer which alternated excitation light between 350 and 380 nm. Bandpass was set at ±2 nm. Excitation light was delivered to the cells via fiber optics through the epifluorescence port of a Zeiss Standard 16 microscope coupled to a Zeiss Achroplan 20× water immersion lens. Use of the water immersion lens allowedin situ measurements of the cells while in the culture dish and easy manipulation. However, the optical properties of the lens necessitated ratioing of Fura-2 at 350 and 380 nm. Emission was measured at 510 nm, via a microphotometer. The entire system for data collection and analysis was computer driven. After loading, astrocytes were washed twice and placed in 2 ml of DPBS supplemented with 1 mm glucose and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. For measurement of [Ca2+]i, a field of 1–2 astrocytes was selected using slit width adjustments on the microphotometer. Basal [Ca2+]i was recorded for several seconds, at a sampling rate of 1 ratio every 0.5 s. For experiments using agonists (arachidonic acid, 5,6-EET, and thapsigargin) or inhibitors (econazole, SKF96365, SKF525A, AAOCF3, and MS-PPOH), these agents were added to the tissue culture dish in a volume of 200 μl. This volume assured almost immediate mixing with the buffer, as determined by dye diffusion. For experiments using indomethacin, Fura-2-loaded astrocytes were incubated with 10 μm indomethacin for 15 min prior to measurement of [Ca2+]i. Each experiment was performed on a separate culture of astrocytes. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described previously (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a correction for intracellular viscosity (23Poenie M. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Autofluorescence at 350 and 380 was recorded from wells of astrocytes not loaded with Fura-2 and was subtracted from all measurements. Agonist-stimulated [Ca2+]i concentrations were normalized to the basal [Ca2+]i level in each experiment and are expressed as a percent of basal. Leakage of Fura-2 into the medium was monitored by measurement of intracellular Fura-2 concentration at the isobestic wavelength, 362 nm (25Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For calcium-free experiments, cells were placed in calcium-free DPBS containing 1 mm glucose and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin immediately prior to the experiment. EGTA (0.5 mm) was added to chelate any residual calcium. Astrocytes were not exposed to calcium-free conditions for longer than 15 min. As described previously, this treatment did not result in lifting of cells from the monolayer. Arachidonic acid release was measured as described previously (8Rzigalinski B.A. Blackmore P.F. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Lamb R.G. Harper C.C. McKinney J.S. Rzigalinski B.A. Ellis E.F. J.

Briefly, 1 × 106 cells grown in a 25-mm diameter well were radiolabeled by addition of 0.5 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid to the growth medium for 24 h prior to the assay. Incorporation of radiolabel was 95%. After labeling, the cells were washed three times and placed in DPBS supplemented with 1 mm glucose and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Next, cells were preincubated with 10 μm econazole, 5 μmAAOCF3, 1 μm MS-PPOH, or 10 μmSKF525A for 2 min in a final volume of 1.0 ml. Following preincubation, cells were stimulated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 2 min. Radioactivity released into the medium after thapsigargin stimulation was determined by scintillation counting. Controls consisted of unstimulated cells, or cells treated with inhibitors alone. Econazole, AAOCF3, MS-PPOH, and SKF525A did not significantly alter basal arachidonic acid release as compared with untreated controls. For experiments conducted under calcium-free conditions, calcium-free DPBS supplemented with 1 mm glucose, 1% fatty acid–free bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm EGTA was utilized for all incubations. Results are expressed as percent of control (unstimulated) cells. EETs are highly labile in the aqueous environment. Concentrated EET stock solutions were stored in aliquots at −70 °C in acetonitrile. A fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. Just prior to use, the acetonitrile solution was dried under N2 and EETs were resuspended in ethanol and kept on ice. Aliquots were removed and resuspended in DPBS as required for agonist stimulation. The final concentration of ethanol in all experiments did not exceed 0.1%. The acute cranial window technique andin vivo microscopy were utilized to examine the effect of 5,6-EET on rat cerebral arteriolar diameter, as described previously (27Hoffman S.W. Moore S. Ellis E.F. Stroke. 1997; 28: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with thiopental (75 mg/kg) and supplemented with pentobarbital. After completion of a tracheotomy, each rat was ventilated with room air. The end-expiratory CO2 of each rat was continuously monitored with a capnometer (Transverse Medical Monitors, model 2200) and was maintained at approximately 30 mm Hg by adjusting the respirator rate and volume. Arterial blood pressure was measured via a cannula inserted into the right femoral artery. Arterial samples were periodically analyzed with a Corning Blood Gas Analyzer to ensure normal PaO2, PaCO2, and blood pH. A cannula was also inserted into the right femoral vein for systemic administration of supplemental anesthetic. Pial arteries were visualized using a cranial window implanted into the scalp through a midline incision. The skin and fascia were retracted and a 3-mm diameter craniotomy was made over the left parietal cortex using a trephine. With the aid of a surgical microscope, microscissors were used to remove the dura and expose the pial surface of the brain. A 12-mm diameter cranial window frame with a 6.5-mm diameter glass window was implanted over the craniotomy. The cranial window was equipped with three openings. Two openings were used as an inlet and outlet for filling the space under the cranial window with test solutions. The inlet and outlet valves were positioned such that the test solutions flowed over the cortical surface as viewed through the cranial window. The third opening of the cranial window was connected to a Statham pressure transducer for continuous measurement of intracranial pressure. The outlet of the window was connected to plastic tubing whose open end was placed at a fixed level to give a constant intracranial pressure of 5 mm Hg throughout the experiment. The space under the window and the plastic tubing were filled with artificial CSF. This fluid was equilibrated with gas containing 5.9% CO2, 6.6% O2, and 87.5% N2, which produces pH and gas tensions in a normal range for CSF. The vehicle for all agents applied under the cranial window was artificial CSF. The diameter responses of three to five arterioles were studied in each rat using a Vickers image-splitting device as described previously (28Baez S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1966; 21: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The responses of the arterioles in a given rat were averaged, and this single number was used to compute the average for a group of rats. After implantation of the cranial window, baseline arteriolar diameter was established by washing the window with 1 ml of artificial CSF at 5-min intervals. At the end of each 5-min interval, baseline measurements of pial arteriolar diameter were recorded. Next, 5,6-EET was infused under the window in increasing concentrations (10−9-10−5m) in a total volume of 1 ml of artificial CSF at 5-min intervals. Pial arteriolar diameters were measured at 2 and 5 min after the infusion of each test solution. Both one-way and repeated measures ANOVA were performed and were followed by Tukey-Kramer comparisons to determine differences between the groups using Super Anova statistical software for Macintosh. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Basal [Ca2+]i in astrocytes was 88 ± 5 nm, consistent with published reports (21Rzigalinski B.A. Weber J.T. Willoughby K.A. Ellis E.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2377-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Exogenous arachidonic acid (1–100 μm) stimulated a dose-dependent elevation in [Ca2+]iin astrocytes (data not shown). A representative tracing of the [Ca2+]i elevation stimulated by arachidonic acid is shown in Fig. 1 A. Arachidonic acid (10 μm) stimulated an elevation in [Ca2+]i in rat cortical astrocytes to 265 ± 14% of basal (n = 6). The elevation in [Ca2+]i was not immediate, but appeared to require approximately 175 s for initiation. Although lag time after application of an agonist is often difficult to compare accurately, the lag time for the arachidonic acid response greatly exceeded the usual lag time for other agonists and was consistently observed in all experiments. This delay suggests that metabolism of arachidonic acid may be necessary to produce an elevation in [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 μm, 15 min) had no effect on either basal or arachidonic acid-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1 A, broken line), suggesting that a cyclooxygenase metabolite was not involved in arachidonic acid-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i. Removal of extracellular [Ca2+]i (Fig.1 B, broken line) completely blocked AA-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i, suggesting that AA-induced [Ca2+]i elevation in astrocytes is due to influx of extracellular Ca2+. Addition of the cytochrome P450 inhibitor econazole (10 μm) had no effect on basal [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1 B). However, a 2-min econazole pretreatment dramatically attenuated the arachidonic acid-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i to 130 ± 9% of basal (n = 6). Similar results were observed with a second inhibitor of P450, SKF525A (data not shown). These results suggest that the arachidonic acid-induced elevation in astrocyte [Ca2+]i may require cytochrome P450 metabolism of arachidonic acid. If a metabolite of arachidonic acid is a component of CIF, then arachidonic acid should be released in response to depletion of intracellular calcium stores. Using [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled astrocytes, we investigated the total release of arachidonic acid and metabolites in response to a 2-min stimulation with thapsigargin. Activation of the capacitative pathway with thapsigargin induced release of arachidonic acid (and/or metabolites) of 399 ± 43% of basal (Fig. 2 A, filled bars). In calcium-free medium supplemented with EGTA, thapsigargin-stimulated release of arachidonic acid (and/or metabolites) was reduced to 233 ± 13% of basal. Similar to our observations in U937 (8Rzigalinski B.A. Blackmore P.F. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), these results suggest that a portion of the thapsigargin-stimulated arachidonic acid release is coupled to influx of extracellular calcium, while a portion is also coupled to depletion of intracellular calcium stores. Thus, PLA2 activity may be associated with release of calcium from intracellular stores. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 with econazole, SKF525A, or MS-PPOH did not inhibit thapsigargin-induced arachidonic acid release. Inhibition of cPLA2 with AAOCF3 inhibited thapsigargin-stimulated arachidonic acid release to control levels. We have previously shown that capacitative calcium influx requires the action of cPLA2 and release of arachidonic acid in U937 cells (8Rzigalinski B.A. Blackmore P.F. Rosenthal M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results above suggest that arachidonic acid elevates [Ca2+]i in the astrocyte, possibly through a P450 metabolite. Therefore, we investigated whether cPLA2 and P450 were also linked to capacitative calcium influx in the astrocyte. Thapsigargin is a pharmacological agent that inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase of the intracellular calcium store and activates capacitative calcium influx independent of phospholipase C (29Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 43: 187-193Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The thapsigargin-stimulated elevation of [Ca2+]i is dependent on 2 sources of calcium, release from intracellular stores followed by capacitative influx of extracellular calcium. If capacitative calcium influx is mediated by release of arachidonic acid and subsequent metabolism via P450, then capacitative calcium influx should be inhibited by blockade of either cPLA2 or P450. To test this we utilized econazole, SKF525A (30Capdevila J. Gil L. Orellana M. Marnett L.J. Mason J.I. Yadagiri P. Falck J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and MS-PPOH (31Wang M.H. Brand-Schieber E. Zand B.A. Nguyen X. Falck J.R. Balu N. Schwartzman M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 966-973PubMed Google Scholar), inhibitors of cytochrome P450 and AAOCF3, a selective inhibitor of cPLA2 (32Riendeau D. Guay J. Weech P.K. Laliberte F. Yergey J. Li C. Desmaris S. Perrier H. Liu S. Nicoll-Griffith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15619-15624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A summary of these experiments appears in Fig. 2 A and representative tracings in Fig. 2 B. In the astrocytes, thapsigargin elevated [Ca2+]ito 432 ± 62% of basal (Fig. 2, A and B, trace 1). To further dissect this response, the relative size of thapsigargin-releasable intracellular calcium stores in astrocytes was determined by stimulation with thapsigargin in calcium-free DPBS supplemented with 0.5 mm EGTA. Under these conditions, thapsigargin elevated [Ca2+]i by only 196 ± 23% of basal (Fig. 2, A and B, trace 2), approximately half that observed in experiments where extracellular calcium was 1 mm. To assess the effect of cPLA2 or P450 inhibitors on capacitative calcium influx, astrocytes were pretreated with 5 μm AAOCF3, 10 μm econazole, 10 μm SKF525A, or 1 μm MS-PPOH for 2 min. Inhibition of cPLA2 with AAOCF3 or inhibition of cytochrome P450 with econazole or SKF525A had no effect on thapsigargin-stimulated elevation of [Ca2+]i in calcium-free medium, indicating that these compounds had no effect on release of calcium from intracellular stores (data not shown). In DPBS containing 1 mm extracellular calcium (Figs. 2,A and B, trace 5) inhibition of cPLA2with AAOCF3 blocked capacitative calcium influx and produced [Ca2+]i levels consistent with release of calcium from intracellular stores alone. In calcium replete medium, inhibition of cytochrome P450 with 10 μm econazole or 10 μm SKF525A also inhibited capacitative calcium influx (Fig. 2, A and B, traces 3 and 4). These two P450 inhibitors blocked the maximum thapsigargin-stimulated [Ca2+]i elevation to the same extent as calcium-free medium, suggesting that capacitative Ca2+influx was inhibited. However, the sustained phase of [Ca2+]i elevation was only partially inhibited. The cytochrome P450 enzymes comprise a large family of isoforms (33McGiff J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Tox. 1991; 31: 339-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) of which econazole and SKF5125A are generalized inhibitors which block many isoforms. We therefore used an additional inhibitor of cytochrome P450, MS-PPOH (31Wang M.H. Brand-Schieber E. Zand B.A. Nguyen X. Falck J.R. Balu N. Schwartzman M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 966-973PubMed Google Scholar). MS-PPOH is a “suicide substrate” inhibitor of P450 arachidonic acid epoxygenase, designed to resemble the substrate arachidonic acid and inactivate the enzyme. In rat renal microsomes, MS-PPOH was a potent and selective inhibitor of arachidonic acid epoxygenase activity (31Wang M.H. Brand-Schieber E. Zand B.A. Nguyen X. Falck J.R. Balu N. Schwartzman M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 966-973PubMed Google Scholar). In the astrocyte, 1 μm MS-PPOH inhibited thapsigargin-stimulated capacitative calcium influx to a level consistent with depletion of intracellular calcium stores only (Fig. 2, A and B, trace 6). Taken together, these results suggest that formation of CIF requir"

The regulated transcription of a typical eukaryotic gene is governed by the combined action of multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

The information provided by these proteins is ultimately communicated to RNA polymerase II, resulting in a precise transcription initiation frequency.Sp1 is a well characterized sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that plays a role in the transcription of many cellular and viral genes that contain GC boxes (KRGGMGKRRY) in their promoters (3Briggs M.R.

Additional human and rodent transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3, Sp4) similar in structural and transcriptional properties to Sp1 have been cloned, and form an Sp1 multigene family (6Hagen G. Muller S.

The ADH5/FDH promoter is very different from those of other ADH genes, which are expressed in different tissue-specific patterns. It is very rich in GC base pairs (73% up to −200 bp; 82% in the minimal promoter) and does not contain either a TATA or CCAAT box (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It thus has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene (25Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 26Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-28226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). The regulation of housekeeping genes is poorly understood.The very small DNA fragment extending to −34 bp of ADH5/FDHis a strong promoter in all cells tested (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Promoter elements from −38 bp to +22 bp, flanking the transcriptional start site, are footprinted by all nuclear extracts tested, and nearly the entire minimal promoter can be bound by Sp1 (Fig. 1) (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is an unusual configuration of GC boxes flanking the transcription start site. Although this may lead one to expect a simple promoter, theADH5 promoter is surprisingly complex and the regulation of this ubiquitously expressed gene is quite complicated (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Here we test whether the members of the Sp1 multigene family recognize the same cis-acting elements on the minimal promoter, and examine the roles they play in transcriptional regulation. Analyses of DNA-protein interactions in vitro and in vivodemonstrate that the members of this multigene family compete for binding, with different effects upon transcription. These data in part explain the ubiquitous expression of the gene and how different levels of expression are achieved in different tissues. This may have significant implications in understanding how many housekeeping genes can be regulated (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum.

Res. 1985; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe investigated the regulation of transcription of theADH5/FDH minimal promoter by members of the Sp1 multigene family member. DNase I footprinting analysis and EMSA showed that thecis-elements on the minimal promoter differ in their binding affinity toward Sp1 and related transcription factors; the affinities vary by as much as 5–10-fold. Sp1 can preferentially bind to the corecis-elements immediately flanking the transcription start site, sites B and C-1, extending from −22 bp to +20 bp. Sp1 is a strong transcriptional activator of this promoter, acting through these sites. Sp3 and Sp4 do not significantly activate this promoter, and compete with Sp1 for the key sites, leading to a reduction in transcription. These data provide the first demonstration that Sp4 can act as a repressor.Analyses of the DNA-protein interactions on the minimal promoter, using both purified proteins and HeLa cell nuclear extract, demonstrate that Sp1 is the major transcription factor binding to thecis-acting elements. Although virtually the entire promoter region can be footprinted by 0.5 fpu of Sp1, the corecis-elements flanking the transcription start site have the highest binding affinity toward Sp1 (5–10-fold higher than the other sites; Figs. 2 and 4). Binding of Sp1 or related factors to this unique arrangement of cis-acting elements may allow the nucleosome surrounding the minimal promoter to enter into an “open” state by actively displacing the histone (37Croston G.E. Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshack D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38Li B. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. J. Biol.

Since Sp3 and Sp4 were reported to bind to the same cis-elements that are bound by Sp1 (i.e. GC boxes), we examined the binding of Sp3 and Sp4 to this promoter. The zinc-finger DNA binding domains of both Sp3 or Sp4 can bind selectively to the core cis-elements, but not elsewhere in the minimal promoter (Figs. 4 and 5). Therefore it is very likely that competition among Sp1 multigene family members and the interaction among them are mainly occurring on the corecis-elements in vivo.To investigate the roles of Sp1 family members in transcriptional regulation, we carried out transient expression assays using the minimal ADH5/FDH promoter-CAT fusion constructs. In human Alexander cells, which contain endogenous Sp1, rat Sp1 but not human Sp1 stimulated transcription (Fig. 3), probably because there is already enough endogenous Sp1. Sp3 inhibited transcription, as might be expected given prior reports of its function as a repressor (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 14Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, given its usual function as a transcriptional activator (14Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), Sp4 also inhibited transcription (Fig. 3).To better analyze the transcriptional roles of the Sp1 family members, we carried out further assays in Drosophila SL2 cells, which do not express endogenous Sp1 (35Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 36Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCAT 5–2, a minimal promoter construct, was not able to drive transcription at all in these SL2 cells (Fig. 6). Addition of Sp1 (by cotransfection) potently activated transcription, more than 50-fold. This demonstrates that Sp1 is a critical factor in transcriptional initiation at this promoter. Mutations in the core cis-elements resulted in substantial reductions of the transcription (Fig. 8), indicating that these elements are critical for transcriptional initiation. Considering the particular location of Sp1 binding sites relative to the transcription start site and other reports on the interaction between Sp1 and TBP or TAF110 (11Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G.

Synergistic activation by Sp1 is often made possible by having two or more Sp1 sites located next to each other in a promoter (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 44Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, the two corecis-elements in the ADH5/FDH promoter did not show synergism (Fig. 8).Figure 9A hypothetical model of the transcriptional regulation by the Sp1 multigene family at the ADH5/FDHminimal promoter. B and C-1 are core cis-elements immediately flanking transcription start point (Tsp, marked by an arrow). TBP, TATA-binding protein. TAF110, TBP-associated factor 110.

Arrows under transcription indicate the degree of transcriptional activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We investigated whether Sp3 or Sp4 could activate transcription in the absence of Sp1, using SL2 cells. There was little or no transcription, even in the presence of the highest amount of cotransfected expression vectors (Fig. 6). This suggests that Sp3 and Sp4 lack the ability to interact with TBP or TAF110 in this promoter context. We also tested whether transcriptional activation by Sp1 can be affected by Sp3 or Sp4. Transcriptional activation by Sp1 was repressed by Sp3 or Sp4 (Fig. 7). The transcriptional repression by Sp3 or Sp4 is surprisingly similar to the results obtained with the mutant constructs where one of the two core cis-elements is destroyed by site-directed mutagenesis. Because Sp3 or Sp4 cannot themselves activate transcription on this particular promoter, the occupation of one of the two sites by Sp3 or Sp4 and the other by Sp1 is like the situation where only one site is occupied by Sp1 due to the mutation introduced. By having one site occupied by Sp3 (or Sp4), or by having one Sp1 binding site destroyed, a significant drop in transcription can result. The drop might be more dramatic if higher levels of Sp3 or Sp4 were induced by the expression vectors; others have reported that the levels achieved are not high (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In contrast, even at 20 ng of added DNA, pPac-Sp1 expresses Sp1 sufficiently to activate transcription strongly (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar).These data suggest that Sp3 and Sp4 can act as repressors by competing with Sp1 for binding to the core cis-elements and preventing the formation of the transcription initiation complex. Sp4 had not previously been shown to repress transcription. Based on these findings, we propose a hypothetical model on the transcriptional regulation at the ADH5/FDH minimal promoter (Fig. 9). The two core cis-elements are the critical center for transcriptional initiation and activation by Sp1. These elements can be preferentially bound by Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. If only Sp1 occupies these elements, it can interact with TBP or TAF110 and can promote strong transcription. By having two core binding sites for Sp1, transcription activation by Sp1 is ensured and strong transcription is made possible. If the core sites are occupied by Sp3 or Sp4 alone, the interaction between the transcription factor with one or more components of general transcription machinery is either absent or weak, which can result in little or no transcriptional activation. If one site is occupied by Sp1 and the other by Sp3 or Sp4, the transcription activation will be relatively low compared with the situation where two sites are occupied by Sp1 only.Therefore, the cellular content of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 and their interactions on the minimal promoter may be critical factors influencing transcription of the ADH5/FDH gene in various human tissues (22Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1984; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Duley J.A. Harris O. Holmes R.S. Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res. 1985; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This model may also be applicable to many housekeeping genes with GC boxes located either in the proximal promoter or around the transcription start site, as is the case in theADH5/FDH gene. The regulated transcription of a typical eukaryotic gene is governed by the combined action of multiple sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 316: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 799-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The information provided by these proteins is ultimately communicated to RNA polymerase II, resulting in a precise transcription initiation frequency. Sp1 is a well characterized sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that plays a role in the transcription of many cellular and viral genes that contain GC boxes (KRGGMGKRRY) in their promoters (3Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 4Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R.

Additional human and rodent transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3, Sp4) similar in structural and transcriptional properties to Sp1 have been cloned, and form an Sp1 multigene family (6Hagen G. Muller S.

Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 have a highly conserved zinc-finger DNA binding domain close to the C terminus and contain glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich amino acid stretches in the N-terminal region (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 can bind to the same recognition sequence (GC boxes) with identical affinity (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Sp1 and Sp4 generally act as transcriptional activators, while Sp3 generally acts as a repressor, and rarely as an activator (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

The Sp1 multigene family is an important regulator of the cell cycle, differentiation, and development (9Supp D.M. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Smith E.P Potter S.S. Dev.

Shafgat J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 372: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is important in the oxidation of various alcohols and of formaldehyde (in the presence of glutathione) (see Refs. 19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol.

ADH5/FDHis ubiquitously expressed, although to different levels in different cells (22Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum.

The ADH5/FDH promoter is very different from those of other ADH genes, which are expressed in different tissue-specific patterns. It is very rich in GC base pairs (73% up to −200 bp; 82% in the minimal promoter) and does not contain either a TATA or CCAAT box (18Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It thus has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene (25Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 26Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-28226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). The regulation of housekeeping genes is poorly understood. The very small DNA fragment extending to −34 bp of ADH5/FDHis a strong promoter in all cells tested (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Promoter elements from −38 bp to +22 bp, flanking the transcriptional start site, are footprinted by all nuclear extracts tested, and nearly the entire minimal promoter can be bound by Sp1 (Fig. 1) (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is an unusual configuration of GC boxes flanking the transcription start site. Although this may lead one to expect a simple promoter, theADH5 promoter is surprisingly complex and the regulation of this ubiquitously expressed gene is quite complicated (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we test whether the members of the Sp1 multigene family recognize the same cis-acting elements on the minimal promoter, and examine the roles they play in transcriptional regulation. Analyses of DNA-protein interactions in vitro and in vivodemonstrate that the members of this multigene family compete for binding, with different effects upon transcription. These data in part explain the ubiquitous expression of the gene and how different levels of expression are achieved in different tissues. This may have significant implications in understanding how many housekeeping genes can be regulated (19Hur M.-W. Edenberg H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9002-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum.

DISCUSSIONWe investigated the regulation of transcription of theADH5/FDH minimal promoter by members of the Sp1 multigene family member. DNase I footprinting analysis and EMSA showed that thecis-elements on the minimal promoter differ in their binding affinity toward Sp1 and related transcription factors; the affinities vary by as much as 5–10-fold. Sp1 can preferentially bind to the corecis-elements immediately flanking the transcription start site, sites B and C-1, extending from −22 bp to +20 bp. Sp1 is a strong transcriptional activator of this promoter, acting through these sites. Sp3 and Sp4 do not significantly activate this promoter, and compete with Sp1 for the key sites, leading to a reduction in transcription. These data provide the first demonstration that Sp4 can act as a repressor.Analyses of the DNA-protein interactions on the minimal promoter, using both purified proteins and HeLa cell nuclear extract, demonstrate that Sp1 is the major transcription factor binding to thecis-acting elements. Although virtually the entire promoter region can be footprinted by 0.5 fpu of Sp1, the corecis-elements flanking the transcription start site have the highest binding affinity toward Sp1 (5–10-fold higher than the other sites; Figs. 2 and 4). Binding of Sp1 or related factors to this unique arrangement of cis-acting elements may allow the nucleosome surrounding the minimal promoter to enter into an “open” state by actively displacing the histone (37Croston G.E.

Since Sp3 and Sp4 were reported to bind to the same cis-elements that are bound by Sp1 (i.e. GC boxes), we examined the binding of Sp3 and Sp4 to this promoter. The zinc-finger DNA binding domains of both Sp3 or Sp4 can bind selectively to the core cis-elements, but not elsewhere in the minimal promoter (Figs. 4 and 5).

Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshack D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38Li B. Adams C.C. Workman J.L. J. Biol.

Since Sp3 and Sp4 were reported to bind to the same cis-elements that are bound by Sp1 (i.e. GC boxes), we examined the binding of Sp3 and Sp4 to this promoter. The zinc-finger DNA binding domains of both Sp3 or Sp4 can bind selectively to the core cis-elements, but not elsewhere in the minimal promoter (Figs. 4 and 5). Therefore it is very likely that competition among Sp1 multigene family members and the interaction among them are mainly occurring on the corecis-elements in vivo. To investigate the roles of Sp1 family members in transcriptional regulation, we carried out transient expression assays using the minimal ADH5/FDH promoter-CAT fusion constructs. In human Alexander cells, which contain endogenous Sp1, rat Sp1 but not human Sp1 stimulated transcription (Fig. 3), probably because there is already enough endogenous Sp1. Sp3 inhibited transcription, as might be expected given prior reports of its function as a repressor (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 14Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, given its usual function as a transcriptional activator (14Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), Sp4 also inhibited transcription (Fig. 3). To better analyze the transcriptional roles of the Sp1 family members, we carried out further assays in Drosophila SL2 cells, which do not express endogenous Sp1 (35Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 36Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCAT 5–2, a minimal promoter construct, was not able to drive transcription at all in these SL2 cells (Fig. 6). Addition of Sp1 (by cotransfection) potently activated transcription, more than 50-fold. This demonstrates that Sp1 is a critical factor in transcriptional initiation at this promoter. Mutations in the core cis-elements resulted in substantial reductions of the transcription (Fig. 8), indicating that these elements are critical for transcriptional initiation. Considering the particular location of Sp1 binding sites relative to the transcription start site and other reports on the interaction between Sp1 and TBP or TAF110 (11Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 26Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-28226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 40Chen J.-L.

A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), Sp1 may play a critical role in the formation or recruitment of the transcription initiation complex onto the core promoter (Fig. 9). Synergistic activation by Sp1 is often made possible by having two or more Sp1 sites located next to each other in a promoter (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 44Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). However, the two corecis-elements in the ADH5/FDH promoter did not show synergism (Fig. 8). We investigated whether Sp3 or Sp4 could activate transcription in the absence of Sp1, using SL2 cells. There was little or no transcription, even in the presence of the highest amount of cotransfected expression vectors (Fig. 6). This suggests that Sp3 and Sp4 lack the ability to interact with TBP or TAF110 in this promoter context. We also tested whether transcriptional activation by Sp1 can be affected by Sp3 or Sp4. Transcriptional activation by Sp1 was repressed by Sp3 or Sp4 (Fig. 7). The transcriptional repression by Sp3 or Sp4 is surprisingly similar to the results obtained with the mutant constructs where one of the two core cis-elements is destroyed by site-directed mutagenesis. Because Sp3 or Sp4 cannot themselves activate transcription on this particular promoter, the occupation of one of the two sites by Sp3 or Sp4 and the other by Sp1 is like the situation where only one site is occupied by Sp1 due to the mutation introduced. By having one site occupied by Sp3 (or Sp4), or by having one Sp1 binding site destroyed, a significant drop in transcription can result. The drop might be more dramatic if higher levels of Sp3 or Sp4 were induced by the expression vectors; others have reported that the levels achieved are not high (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In contrast, even at 20 ng of added DNA, pPac-Sp1 expresses Sp1 sufficiently to activate transcription strongly (10Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Sp3 and Sp4 can act as repressors by competing with Sp1 for binding to the core cis-elements and preventing the formation of the transcription initiation complex. Sp4 had not previously been shown to repress transcription. Based on these findings, we propose a hypothetical model on the transcriptional regulation at the ADH5/FDH minimal promoter (Fig. 9). The two core cis-elements are the critical center for transcriptional initiation and activation by Sp1. These elements can be preferentially bound by Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. If only Sp1 occupies these elements, it can interact with TBP or TAF110 and can promote strong transcription. By having two core binding sites for Sp1, transcription activation by Sp1 is ensured and strong transcription is made possible. If the core sites are occupied by Sp3 or Sp4 alone, the interaction between the transcription factor with one or more components of general transcription machinery is either absent or weak, which can result in little or no transcriptional activation. If one site is occupied by Sp1 and the other by Sp3 or Sp4, the transcription activation will be relatively low compared with the situation where two sites are occupied by Sp1 only. Therefore, the cellular content of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 and their interactions on the minimal promoter may be critical factors influencing transcription of the ADH5/FDH gene in various human tissues (22Adinolfi A. Adinolfi M. Hopkinson D.A. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1984; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Duley J.A. Harris O. Holmes R.S. Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res. 1985; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This model may also be applicable to many housekeeping genes with GC boxes located either in the proximal promoter or around the transcription start site, as is the case in theADH5/FDH gene.

Upon cell adhesion, integrin engagement leads to downstream activation of focal adhesion kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and many other key signaling molecules (6Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). At the same time, integrin-dependent reorganization of cytoskeletal proteins and signaling complexes facilitates growth factor signaling (7Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M.

A distinctive property of integrins is that they not only deliver “outside-in” signals upon engagement with ligand but also their function is regulated by “inside-out” signals (9Lub M. Van Kooyk Y.

The cytoplasmic tails of integrin α and β subunits play critical roles in two-way signaling through integrins (18Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin.

For example, each of the four naturally occurring alternatively spliced forms of the β1 tail has distinctive functions (21Balzac F. Belkin A.M. Koteliansky V.E. Balabanov Y.V. Altruda F. Silengo L.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as proteins that may interact directly with the β1 tail. Many of these proposed direct interactions still need to be further explored in terms of biochemistry and functional relevance. We also have undertaken a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify β1 tail-associated proteins. In the yeast, we initially identified two candidate β1 tail-interacting proteins. These were (i) a fragment of RACK1 and (ii) a protein called ICAP-1 (integrin cytoplasmic tail associated protein). Additional yeast two-hybrid studies suggested that the RACK1 interaction was nonspecific. However, the ICAP-1 protein did show specific interaction with the β1 tail, both in yeast and in human cell lines. Furthermore, the site of ICAP-1 association was mapped to the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of β1 (which includes an NPXY motif); ICAP-1 phosphorylation was found to be regulated upon cell spreading on fibronectin, and ICAP-1 appeared to play a role in β1-dependent cell migration. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), monkey kidney (COS7), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12CA5 was from Dr. J. DeCaprio (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston), and rabbit anti-ICAP-1 polyclonal antibodies were either produced using purified full-length ICAP-1 polypeptide as immunogen or provided by Dr. D. Chang (UCLA). Other antibodies were as follows: anti-human integrin β1, mAb A-1A5 (45Hemler M.E. Ware C.F. Strominger J.L. J.

Integrin β1 subunit cDNA encoding for carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 750–798 (see Table I) was amplified from full-length β1 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This PCR product was ligated into plasmid pEG202N to generate the LexA-integrin fusion “bait” plasmid pEG202-β1. Host yeast strain EGY48 (MATα, his3, trp1, ura3–52, leu2::pLEU 2-LexAop6, constructed by E.

Also, by using the pJK101 reporter plasmid we confirmed that baits (LexA-integrin cytoplasmic tail fusions) could be expressed inside the nucleus of EGY48 yeast cells and bind to LexA operator.Table IAmino acid sequences of integrin cytoplasmic domains and integrin β1/β5 cytoplasmic tail mutants studied in the yeast two-hybrid systemIntegrin tailsSequencesaTail sequences from each integrin subunit include residues from the end of the transmembrane domain to the carboxyl terminus.

Open table in a new tab A yeast expression library with a complexity of 106 was generated from oligo(dT)-primed cDNA from HeLa (human cervical carcinoma cell line) mRNA. The cDNA was cloned unidirectionally into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of galactose-inducible, TRP+ yeast expression vector pJG4-5 (constructed by J. Gyuris, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). For genetic screening, yeast strain EGY48 was transformed sequentially with pEG202-β1, pSH18-34, and pJG4-5 using the lithium acetate method (51Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 yeast transformants were pooled and subjected to selections as described (49Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 50Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R.

Positive interaction is defined as (i) growth on leucine-deficient, galactose-conditioned medium but not on leucine-deficient, glucose-conditioned medium, and (ii) forming blue colonies on galactose X-gal plates but not on glucose X-gal plates. Plasmid DNAs from positive colonies were rescued usingEscherichia coli KC8. Retransformation of EGY48 with prey plasmid DNA, pSH18-34, and pEG202N-β1cyto plasmid DNA was done to confirm the interaction. As described above for pEG202-β1, other bait plasmids were constructed to encode for the various integrin cytoplasmic domains listed in Table I. Also constructed were bait plasmids containing chimeric β1/β5 integrin cytoplasmic domains (bottom of Table I). A human HeLa S3 5′-stretch plus cDNA library in bacterial phage lambda gt11 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was plated and transferred to Colony/Plaque Screen membrane (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The library was screened by in situ hybridization (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 6.1.1-6.6.1Google Scholar) with32P-labeled insert as a probe (obtained from Clone No. 4, Fig. 1). After an additional two rounds of purification, eight positive lambda phage clones were obtained, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced using a double-stranded DNA cycle sequencing kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). For prokaryotic expression of GST fusion proteins, the cytoplasmic domain of β1 was ligated into pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, New Jersey) and then expressed in E. coli DH5α. The GST-β1cyto fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (53Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Vectors pGEX-β2cyto, pGEX-β3cyto, and pGEX-β5cyto were provided by Dr. A. Arnaout (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston), Dr. E. Ruoslahti, and Dr. R. Pasqualini (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Production and purification of GST-β2cyto, GST-β3cyto, and GST-β5cyto fusion proteins was as described (53Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Full-length ICAP-1 cDNA was ligated intoEcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1, and the resulting pGEX-4T-1-ICAP-1 fusion protein was purified from E. coliBL21 (Novagen, Madison, WI). For stable eukaryotic expression, we used the pECE vector containing a full-length β1 insert (54Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) which is designated here as pECE-β1cyto1.1. The pECE-β1cyto5.5 construct codes for wild type β1 extracellular and transmembrane domains fused to the β5 cytoplasmic domain (25Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Additional β1/β5 cytoplasmic tail exchange mutants, in the pECE vector, were generated by sequential PCR (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 6.1.1-6.6.1Google Scholar). These contained β1 extracellular and transmembrane domains, fused to β1, β5, or β1/5 chimeric cytoplasmic tails listed at the bottom of Table I. CHO cells negative for dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr−) were grown in MEM α+ medium with 10% FCS, and then switched to MEM α− with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) after transfection. The dhfr+ p901 vector (55Kaufman R.J. Sharp P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 601-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. M. Rosa (Biogen Co., Cambridge, MA). For transfection, CHO cells were electroporated with a mixture of p901 dhfr+ plasmid DNA and pECE-β1 or -β1/β5 mutant plasmid DNA at a ratio of 1 to 10, using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 280 V and 960 microfarads. Growth of transfected CHO cells in MEM α− medium and selection of positive clones by flow cytometry were carried out as described (25Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The CHO-β1 and -β1/β5 mutants were selected to have comparable surface expression levels as measured by flow cytometry using anti-β1 mAb A-1A5. For eukaryotic transient expression, full-length ICAP-1 cDNA was ligated in frame into a modified pMT2HA vector (56Debant A. Serra-Pagés C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) to form pMT2HA-ICAP-1, which encodes for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen epitope just upstream of ICAP-1. Calcium phosphate (52Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 6.1.1-6.6.1Google Scholar) was used to transiently transfect pMT2HA-ICAP-1 into HEK293 or COS7 cells, and cells were analyzed after 48 h. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that ICAP was typically expressed in 20–40% of HEK293 cells, and transfection into COS7 was at least as efficient. The HEK293 cell line was labeled with ∼0.15 mCi [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml) in sodium phosphate-deficient DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS and antibiotics. Labeling was typically begun at 48 h after HEK293 cell transfection and continued for 3 h unless otherwise indicated. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed either in Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) or in RIPA buffer (Triton X-100 buffer supplemented with 0.2% SDS and 1% deoxycholate) at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, soluble material was precleared by incubation with normal rabbit serum immobilized on protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. Next, immune complexes were collected on protein A beads already pre-bound with rabbit anti-ICAP-1 antibodies and washed four times with cell lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then dried gels were exposed with O-Xar film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–7 days at −70 °C. For GST fusion protein assays, HEK293 and CHO cell lysates (prepared as above) were incubated with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h to remove background binding material. Lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST or GST fusion proteins pre-bound to glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free dried milk in PBS/Tween 20 buffer at 25 °C for 1 h and then sequentially blotted with specific mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, followed by four washes (15 min each) with PBS/Tween 20 buffer after each blot. Proteins were visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescent assay (NEN Life Science Products). Migration assays were performed essentially as described (25Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using 96-well chambers and framed polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). Filters were spotted with fibronectin, vitronectin, or poly-l-lysine diluted in 0.1 mNaHCO3, allow to dry, rinsed with PBS, and assembled with matrix-side down in the chamber. Lower wells of the chamber contained 33 μl of MEM α medium (for CHO cells) or DMEM (for COS7 cells) with 10% FCS, unless indicated otherwise. Cells harvested in PBS with 2 mm EDTA were labeled using BCECF-AM (2′,6′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min, pelleted, and resuspended at 3 × 105 cells/ml in 1% FCS (for CHO cells) or 0.1% FCS (for COS7 cells). After no preincubation (COS7 cells) or with anti-hamster α5β1 mAb PB1 for 30 min on ice (CHO cells), cells (suspended in 100 μl) were added to upper wells of the chamber and allowed to migrate at 37 °C for 4 h. After migration, cells attached to the upper side of the filter were mechanically removed by scraping, and cells on the lower side were quantitated using a Cytofluor 2300 fluorescence measurement system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Percent cell migration equals: (cell fluorescence on filter with matrix coating − control cell fluorescence on filter without matrix)/(total fluorescence of input cells) × 100. A HeLa cell library was expressed in 2 × 106 yeast transformants, selection for interaction with the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail protein was carried out, and 25 positive clones were obtained. Among these clones, 9 coded for protein fragments that included the carboxyl-terminal half of the receptor of activated protein kinase C (RACK1) protein. The carboxyl-terminal half of RACK1 interacted strongly with β1, weakly with β5, and not at all with β2 or β3integrin tail bait proteins. However, yeast 2-hybrid analyses also revealed interactions between the RACK1 carboxyl-terminal fragment and integrin αV and α4 cytoplasmic tail bait proteins (Table II). Because the αV and α4tail sequences show no obvious similarity to the β1 tail (Table I), the RACK1 interactions appeared to be nonspecific and were not pursued further.Table IIInteraction of ICAP-1, RACK1, and integrin cytoplasmic tails in yeastBaitsICAP-1RACK1,aThe clone B1–7 encoding RACK1 141–317 residues was used as a prey.InteractionbPositive interaction denotes growth of blue colonies only on X-gal indicator plates lacking leucine.InteractionbPositive interaction denotes growth of blue colonies only on X-gal indicator plates lacking leucine.β-Gal. activitycβ-Galactosidase (β-Gal) activity is the mean of four independent measurements.cβ1cyto (Cyto.11)+187 ± 32+Cyto.15−6 ± 3+Cyto.51+197 ± 13−β5cyto (Cyto.55)−3 ± 2+/−β2cyto−4 ± 3−β3cyto−4 ± 1−α2cyto−3 ± 3−α3cyto−4 ± 4−α4cyto−9 ± 6+α5cyto−3 ± 3−α6cyto−1 ± 1−αVcyto−7 ± 5+αLcyto−4 ± 3−a The clone B1–7 encoding RACK1 141–317 residues was used as a prey.b Positive interaction denotes growth of blue colonies only on X-gal indicator plates lacking leucine.c β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) activity is the mean of four independent measurements. Open table in a new tab Another 7 of the initial 25 positive clones coded for a related group of polypeptides, with identical carboxyl termini but variable amino termini (Fig. 1). These results suggest that regions essential for interaction with the integrin β1 tail reside within the 162 residues present in the shortest clones (clones 4 and 5). Two of the polypeptide sequences contained divergent amino termini (clones 6 and 7), which did not appear in full-length clones (as obtained below), and thus may be cloning artifacts. Open reading frames coding for the longest polypeptides did not include a methionine start site. Thus, to obtain a full-length sequence for the ICAP-1 protein, we used a cDNA probe corresponding to clone 4 to screen a bacteriophage lambda gt11-HeLa cell cDNA library. The result"

Genetic evidence suggests that members of this protein family are likely to function as calcium sensors in calcium-regulated events in neurons, although the precise molecular mechanism remains ill defined. Here we demonstrate that different synaptotagmin isoforms (Syt I, II, and IV) are present in the same synaptic vesicle population from rat brain cortex. In addition, Syt I and II co-localize on the same small synaptic vesicle (SSV), and they heterodimerize in the presence of calcium with a concentration dependence resembling that of the starting phase of SSV exocytosis (EC50 = 6 ± 4 μm). The association between Syt I and Syt II was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the native proteins and the recombinant cytoplasmic domains and by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although a subpopulation of SSV containing Syt I and IV can be isolated, these two isoforms do not show a calcium-dependent interaction. These results suggest that the self-association of synaptotagmins with different calcium binding features may create a variety of calcium sensors characterized by distinct calcium sensitivities. This combinatorial hypothesis predicts that the probability of a single SSV exocytic event is determined, in addition to the gating properties of the presynaptic calcium channels, by the repertoire and relative abundance of distinct synaptotagmin isoforms present on the SSV surface.

Neuronal communication depends upon the transduction of an electric nerve impulse for the release of neurotransmitters from their storage compartment, the small synaptic vesicles (SSV).1 This tightly regulated process is triggered by the rapid increase of the intracellular calcium due to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels at the active zones of the synaptic plasma membrane, which causes the activation of the SSV fusion machinery (1Matthews G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 219-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Goda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of the proteins involved in the physiological cycle of the SSV, the members of the synaptotagmin family represent the best candidates for the role of calcium sensors in neurotransmitter release and, more generally, in regulated exocytosis (3Littleton J.T.

Maienschein V. Volknandt W. Zimmermann H. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by a single membrane-spanning domain and by a large cytoplasmic portion containing two internal repeats that have homology with the C2 domain of protein kinase C (7Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This domain is known to regulate the calcium-dependent translocation of protein kinase C to membranes and is present in many proteins with different functions (5Schiavo G. Osborne S.L. Sgouros J.G.

In synaptotagmins, the two C2 domains are responsible for different interactions, both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent. The first C2 homology domain of synaptotagmin, termed C2A, whose structure has been recently solved (9Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R.

Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

The second C2 domain (C2B) of synaptotagmin I (Syt I) has recently been shown to interact with another class of acidic phospholipids, the phosphoinositides. The specificity of this interaction is strictly dependent on calcium as illustrated by the maximal binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate at calcium concentrations between 20 and 100 μm (20Schiavo G. Gu Q.-M. Prestwich G.D. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The C2B domain also shows calcium-independent interactions. Among these, its binding to the soluble phosphoinositide analogues, inositol polyphosphates, may be important in modulating the interaction of synaptotagmin with phosphoinositides (21Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and with β-SNAP, the neuronal isoform of a family of cytosolic proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment proteins (SNAPs) (25Schiavo G. Gmachl M.J. Stenbeck G. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin is also able to bind the other synaptic t-SNARE, SNAP-25. While the interaction with syntaxin is totally calcium-dependent, SNAP-25 binding to synaptotagmin is only partially modulated by calcium (26Metha P. Battenberg E. Wilson M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This interaction involves the calcium-dependent self-association of the C2B domain of Syt I and consequent synaptotagmin dimerization (46Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 47Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This result has suggested a model in which, following calcium rise at the nerve terminal, synaptotagmin first dimerizes and then associates with syntaxin, creating a protein complex involved in the calcium-dependent step(s) leading to SSV fusion with the active zones of the synaptic plasma membrane (47Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).In this paper, we present evidence for a broader distribution of some synaptotagmin isoforms than expected on the basis of the reported literature. We analyzed SSV preparations isolated from adult rat brain cortex for the presence of synaptotagmins I, II, and IV (Syt I, Syt II, and Syt IV) and found that the same population of SSV contains an overlapping distribution of these isoforms. In addition, both Syt I and II are present on the same SSV, and they heterodimerize efficiently with a concentration dependence for calcium resembling that of the starting phase of SSV exocytosis. This process was confirmed in vitro with the soluble cytoplasmic domains of Syt I and II using both immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. In contrast, the distribution of Syt IV on SSV only partially overlaps with that of Syt I and II, and the ability of Syt IV to associate with Syt I is low. Taken together, these results suggest that the self-association of synaptotagmins with different calcium binding features possesses a certain degree of specificity and may create a variety of calcium sensors characterized by distinct calcium sensitivities.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAnalyzing the roles of individual synaptotagmins is complicated by the large number of isoforms present in mammals, by their overlapping distributions, and by the difficulties in obtaining isoform-specific tools. In the past, isoform-specific antibodies have been extremely useful for the analysis of the subcellular distribution of several other synaptic proteins, including amphiphysin, syntaxin, SNAP-25, and VAMP/synaptobrevin (59Bennett M.K.

Cell. 1998; 94: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For the generation of isoform-specific antibodies, it is crucial to identify stretches of amino acids with relatively low homology. The comparison of the 13 synaptotagmin sequences presently available indicates that the regions of high similarity are restricted to the two C2 domains and the C terminus, while the hydrophilic neck region and the intravesicular N-terminal segment show only limited homology (4Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 5Schiavo G. Osborne S.L. Sgouros J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This last segment is particularly interesting because, as shown for Syt I, it is unlikely that an antibody directed against it will perturb the physiological function of the protein (64Matteoli M. Takei K. Perin M.S. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antibodies against the N terminus can be used to monitor cycles of SSV exoendocytosis in neurons (64Matteoli M. Takei K. Perin M.S. Südhof T.C. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 65Malgaroli A. Ting A.E. Wendland B. Bergamaschi A. Villa A. Tsien R.W. Scheller R.H.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4328-4342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore immunized rabbits with peptides corresponding to the N terminus of Syt I, II, and IV. After affinity purification on the corresponding immobilized peptide column, synaptic fractions were probed with the antibodies for specific Syt immunoreactivity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, each antibody recognized a single major band in both cortical synaptic vesicles and a membrane fraction from cerebellum, and this reactivity was abolished by preincubation with an excess of the correspondent generating peptide. In the case of the anti-Syt IV, the immunoreactivity was reduced significantly but not completely abolished (not shown). As complementary proof of specificity, preimmune and immune anti-Syt IV sera were tested against the same cortical and cerebellar membrane fractions. A single band with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa was detected only with the immune serum (Fig. 1 A).Fractions derived from the glycerol-coated size exclusion chromatography, the last step of the SSV purification, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed with the affinity-purified isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 1 B). As expected, the immunoreactivity corresponding to Syt I was localized with the second large peak of the chromatographic profile, previously referred to as CPG-II (49Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), which corresponds to a homogeneous vesicle population with an average diameter of 39 ± 3 nm, determined by electron microscopy (not shown). Syt II and Syt IV are also present in the cortical SSV preparation (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). The distribution of Syt II exactly overlaps the one observed for Syt I, while Syt IV immunoreactivity is slightly shifted. The presence of Syt II in a population of rat cortical SSV is particularly surprising, based on the relatively low abundance of Syt II at the mRNA level in the rat brain cortex and its specialized localization in cerebellum and spinal cord, suggesting a mutually exclusive Syt I and Syt II distribution (56Geppert M. Archer B.T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of multiple Syt isoforms in a homogeneous SSV preparation suggests two possible scenarios. The first implies the existence of SSV containing a single synaptotagmin isoform and characterized, in terms of calcium sensitivity, by the features of the unique synaptotagmin present on its surface. The entire neuronal SSV pool would then consist of distinct synaptotagmin-specific SSV subpopulations that could be mobilized by different calcium levels. This possibility is compatible with the recent finding that at least two populations of SSV can be distinguished biochemically in rat brain cortex (67Thoidis G. Chen P. Pushkin A.V. Vallega G. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The second possibility envisages the presence of multiple synaptotagmin isoforms on the surface of the same vesicle. In this case, the SSV calcium dependence would thus be determined by the repertoire and relative abundance of the different isoforms on its surface. To discriminate between these two possibilities, SSV immunoisolation experiments were carried out. This strategy, successfully used in the past to isolate glutamate-containing vesicles from brain homogenates, was chosen because it does not perturb the integrity of the SSV by avoiding the presence of detergents (52Burger P.M. Mehl E. Cameron P.L. Maycox P.R. Baumert M. Lottspeich F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. Neuron. 1989; 3: 715-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this condition, the N-terminal directed Syt I antibody presents its limits due to the inaccessibility of the lumen of the SSV. We therefore used a well established monoclonal antibody against synaptotagmin, termed M48 (50Matthew W.D. Tsavaler L. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), with no appreciable immunoreactivity against Syt II (not shown). After incubation of the immobilized M48 beads with the purified CPG-II fraction, beads were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Syt II or anti-Syt IV-specific polyclonal antibodies and, as a control, with antibodies against the v-SNARE VAMP-synaptobrevin, a protein specifically localized on SSV (61Rossetto O. Gorza L. Schiavo G. Schiavo N. Scheller R.H. Montecucco C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 68Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. De Camilli P. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, Syt I-specific beads immunopurified SSV containing the majority of the Syt II immunoreactivity; more than 65% of Syt II immunoreactivity was found in the pellet, as determined by quantitative Western blotting and scanning analysis. In contrast, less than half of the Syt IV is associated with the Syt I-positive SSV (≤45%), thus indicating the presence of this isoform in at least two populations of SSV, one of which lacks Syt I. This immunoisolation result has two important consequences. First, it confirms the finding that SSV populations with different biochemical features (i.e. specific membrane protein composition) can be identified (67Thoidis G. Chen P. Pushkin A.V. Vallega G. Leeman S.E. Fine R.E. Kandror K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and, second, that a single SSV is characterized by a specific panel of synaptotagmin isoforms present on its surface. No conclusions can be drawn at this point regarding the presence of other synaptic markers on Syt IV-positive vesicles. Future experiments characterizing the subcellular distribution of Syt IV are necessary to conclusively define the vesicular compartment containing this synaptotagmin isoform.Recently, Syt I was demonstrated to homodimerize via pairing of its C2B domain (46Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 47Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple synaptotagmin isoforms on the surface of the synaptic membrane raises the possibility that they could interact by forming heterocomplexes. To test this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on different membrane preparations (Fig. 3). N-terminal Syt I antibodies conjugated to protein G-Agarose beads were applied to membrane extracts obtained by solubilizing purified cortical SSV with 4% OG. After incubation, the immunoprecipitate was extensively washed and then analyzed as described in Fig. 2. The same experiments were performed in parallel on a crude vesicular fraction from cerebellum, a tissue enriched in Syt II. In both cases, co-immunoprecipitation between Syt I and II was observed (Fig. 3, upper panel). Experiments were also performed using immobilized anti-Syt II antibodies, and the same conclusion holds true (data not shown), thus suggesting that Syt I and II have an intrinsic ability to interact. In contrast, Syt IV exhibits very low binding to Syt I in membrane extracts from both cortex and cerebellum (5–10%; Fig. 3,lower panel). Even at calcium concentrations supporting maximal interaction between Syt I and Syt II (>100 μm calcium; see below), no significant calcium-dependent interaction between Syt I and IV can be detected. Under these conditions, only 5–12% of the total Syt IV is associated with Syt I (not shown). An interpretation of this result is that the pairing between different isoforms is characterized by a certain level of specificity and distinct calcium dependences, determined by the structure and binding properties of their C2B domains. This situation would be similar to that of the C2A domain of synaptotagmins, known to interact differently with phosphatidylserine and syntaxin in distinct isoforms (19Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C2A domain of Syt IV does not show any calcium-dependent binding of at least one of these ligands (69Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 70Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and it is therefore classified as a member of the calcium-independent synaptotagmin subfamily (4Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The existence of different classes of C2B domains is suggested by recent observations that distinct C2B domains have different binding activities for inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (23Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and phosphoinositides. 2C. Thomas and G. Schiavo, unpublished results. Future experiments investigating the heterodimerization abilities of different isoforms are needed to further clarify this point.Figure 3Co-immunoprecipitation of Syt I, Syt II, and Syt IV. Purified SSV from rat brain cortex (CTX) and a crude vesicular fraction from rat cerebellum (CBM) were solubilized with OG and then immunoprecipitated in the absence of externally added calcium by using immobilized anti-Syt I antibodies. The resulting pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were then probed with anti-Syt II (upper panel) or anti-Syt IV antibodies (lower panel). Association between Syt I and Syt II is detectable in both membrane fractions, while Syt I and Syt IV show only a minimal interaction (5–12% of the total).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently, findings from several laboratories have indicated that the C2B domain-dependent homodimerization of Syt I is calcium-dependent (46Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 47Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

To determine if this feature is shared by the interaction between Syt I and Syt II, solubilized proteins from purified cortical brain SSV were immunoprecipitated with immobilized anti-Syt I antibodies in the presence of different calcium concentrations. Calcium potently promotes the interaction between the two isoforms and, at equilibrium, more than 45% of Syt II is engaged in the binding with Syt I, as shown by Western blotting with anti-Syt II antibodies (Fig. 4, upper panel). The concentration of calcium triggering the half-maximal effect (EC50) is 6 ± 4 μm, while maximal association between Syt I and II i"

Despite intensive efforts to unravel the complex process of mRNA 3′-end formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the list of participating factors still awaits its completion. We have recently isolated a gene complementing the phenotype of two temperature-sensitive yeast mutants that were impaired in mRNA 3′-end formation. This gene, designated PTF1(processing/termination factor 1; identical with the previously described ESS1 (1Hanes S.D. Shank P.R. Bostian K.A. Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), encodes a protein that, by virtue of sequence similarity, was identified as a peptidylprolyl-cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase)1 (2Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PPIases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the interconversion fromcis to trans of peptide bonds preceding a proline and are thought to accelerate this often rate-limiting step in the folding of a number of proteins in vivo (3Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 4Galat A. Metcalfe S. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Schönbrunner E.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 25-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). PPIases are divided in three families, based on their sensitivities toward two clinically relevant immunosuppressants: the cyclosporin A-binding proteins (cyclophilins), the FK506-binding proteins, and a third family, named after the Escherichia coli protein parvulin, which is not inhibited by either of the two drugs (for review see Refs. 3Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 4Galat A. Metcalfe S. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Schönbrunner E.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 25-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, the members of each family are characterized by conserved but distinct amino acid domains. By this criterion, PTF1 was predicted to belong to the parvulin family of PPIases (2Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although disruption of PPIase genes did not generally impair cell growth (7Manning-Krieg U.C.

Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In fact, PTF1 is the only essential PPIase gene in S. cerevisiae as demonstrated more recently by the viability of a yeast mutant lacking the remaining 12 PPIases, members of the other two immunosuppressant binding families.

So far, the only other example of an essential PPIase is the recently discovered PIN1, a human protein, that is structurally and functionally related to Ptf1p (9Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the genetic screen that led to the isolation of PTF1 and the phenotypes of the two temperature-sensitive strains carrying mutations in this gene. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ptf1p displays PPIase activity in vitro and that this activity is drastically reduced in the two mutant PTF1 proteins isolated at nonpermissive temperatures. The intriguing observation that yeast cells harboring mutant PTF1 proteins are defective in the 3′-end formation of a plasmid-encoded pre-mRNA invites speculations on the possible role of a PPIase in mRNA 3′-end processing and/or transcription termination in budding yeast.

W303 (MATa/MATα,ade2/ade2 his3/his3,leu2/leu2, trp1/trp1,ura3/ura3) was used as a diploid control (14Myers A.M. Crivellone M.D. Tzagaloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3388-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The screening plasmid pJH702CEN was constructed with plasmid pPZ[LEU2] (15Straka C. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as basis vector in which the TRP1 gene was replaced by the LEU2gene. In the single BamHI site of pPZ[LEU2] the following fragments were inserted: a 730-bp longBamHI/BglII fragment containing theACT1 promoter plus flanking sequences, a modifiedADH1 terminator without stop codons, and a 3073-bpBamHI fragment from pMC1871 (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) containing the complete lacZ gene. The modifiedADH1 terminator consisted of a 97-mer synthetic DNA fragment with bases exchanged at the three stop codons to provide an open reading frame through the whole DNA fragment (see Fig. 4). The control plasmid pJH712CEN contained, instead of the modifiedADH1 terminator sequence, a 28-bp synthetic DNA fragment connecting in frame the ACT1 sequence with thelacZ gene (Fig. 4). For the generation of pGALPTF1, which contains the PTF1 gene under control of the GAL1 promoter, the EcoRI fragment of YIpH-GESS (1Hanes S.D. Shank P.R. Bostian K.A. Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) carrying the ESS1 gene underGAL1 control was purified and inserted into pBluescript II KS− (16Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 17Alting-Mees M.A. Short J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). From this construct, a 60-nt-long fragment which still contained a part of the 5′ non-transcribed region was deleted by site-specific mutagenesis according to Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). For the overexpression of a mutated parvulin gene, the corresponding DNA was amplified by PCR from pSEP38 (19Rahfeld J.-U. Rücknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) with the primer MP1 (5′-GCA GGA TCC GAT GAC GAT GAC AAA GCA AAA ACA GCA GCA GCA C-3′) which contains an enterokinase cutting site and a BamHI restriction site and the primer MP3 (5′-CGG GCG AGC TCG GTA AAG CTA-3′) which contains a SacI restriction site. The resulting 532-bp fragment was cloned into pKSII−. Site-specific mutagenesis was carried out as described by Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) with the oligonucleotide primers MP48 (5′-CAG GCA AAC GCG GCG ATG ATT TAG GTG AAT TCC-3′) and MP83 (5′-GCA CAC CCA GTT CTC ATA TCA CAT CAT TAA G-3′). The mutagenesis led to amino acid exchanges at position 48 from Gly to Asp (corresponding to the mutant Ptf1p-2) and at position 83 from Gly to Ser (corresponding to the mutant Ptf1p-5). The mutated DNA fragments were inserted into pQE30 which harbors a His6-tag coding sequence. The construction of the plasmids pHD509s (ACT1 terminator), pHD511s (CYC1 terminator), pHD512s (YPT1terminator), pSH101 (ADH1 terminator 143 nt), pSH102 (ADH1 terminator 80 nt) has been described in Heidmannet al. (20Heidmann S. Obermaier B. Vogel K. Domdey H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4215-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 3′-terminal fragments of ADH1had a length of 143 (pSH101) or 80 nt (pSH102). The 3′-terminal region of ACT1 consisted of a 354-nt-long Sau3AI fragment (pHD509s), the CYC1 region consisted of a 241-nt-long Sau3AI fragment (pHD511s), and theYPT1 region of a 494-nt-long Sau3AI fragment (pHD512s). EMS mutagenesis was performed as described by Lawrence (21Lawrence C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The production of diploid yeast cells, the sporulation analysis, and tetrad analysis were done according to Haber and Halvorson (22Haber J.E. Halvorson H.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 45-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Sherman and Hicks (23Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of YPM2 and of DH484 (200 ml), transformed with the selection plasmid pJH702CEN, were grown in selective medium to an A 600 = 1 at 23 °C. A 100-ml aliquot was removed for RNA preparation, and the remaining 100 ml were mixed with the same amount of medium prewarmed to 50 °C. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for 6 h when another 100 ml were removed for RNA preparation. The last aliquot of 100 ml was taken after another 13 h. Total RNA was prepared from the collected yeast cells by the hot phenol method as described by Köhrer and Domdey (24Köhrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with an mRNA purification kit purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Then all RNA aliquots were treated with RNase-free DNase to remove traces of remaining DNA. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of glyoxal-treated total RNA was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the quantitation of processed and unprocessed chimericACT1-ADH1-lacZ transcripts, RT-PCR products were generated with the primers JH24 (5′-AGA TTT TTC ACG CTT ACT G-3′), JH25 (5′-TAA GAA ATT CGC TTA TTG A-3′), JH26 (5′-AAG CGA ATT TCT TAT GAT T-3′), and JH27 (5′-GGT TAC GTT GGT GTA GAT G-3′) (see Fig.3) in the presence of [32P]dATP. Radioactivity on the nylon membrane was measured with a PhosphorImager. The coding region ofPTF1 was amplified by PCR with the synthetic oligonucleotides JH34 (5′-AGG AAC ATA TGC CAT CTG ACG TAG CAT CG-3′) and GS2 (5′-AGG AAG GAT CCG AGG TGG AGA AGC AAA TGC C-3′) and inserted into the E. coli expression vector pET15b (25Rosenberg A.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) which includes the codons for an oligohistidine tag (Novagen). The expressed protein therefore contained an oligohistidine tag at its N terminus, followed by a thrombin recognition site. For the production of authentic Ptf1p without the oligohistidine tag, the E. coliexpression vector pET11d was used (Novagen). For the production of the mutated proteins Ptf1-2p (corresponding to the mutant Ptf1p from YPM2) and Ptf1-5p (corresponding to the mutant Ptf1p from YPM5), the PCR-amplified construct was modified by site-specific mutagenesis according to Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) with the synthetic oligonucleotides JH37 (5′-TCT CCC GAA CCA GCC TAG GTC GTC GCC TCG CTT GTA TG-3′) for production of Ptf1-2p and JH38 (5′-ACC TAC CCG CTT GAT TAC ATG AAC ACT GCT TCC TGA TTC AAC-3′) for production of Ptf1-5p. E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) cells harboring the expression plasmids were grown at room temperature to anA 600 of 0.6 and then induced with 4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for another 4 h. For the purification of the oligohistidine-tagged fusion proteins, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 mm Tris buffer,pH 8.0, and ruptured in an SLM Aminco French pressure cell. The cell lysate was stirred with 0.1% (v/v) Benzonase for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (1 × 4 cm, Qiagen), equilibrated with 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer to remove unbound protein. Bound protein was eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m imidazole in 60 ml of 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The Ptf1p-containing fractions were detected by Coomassie stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and concentrated with a Filtron OMEGACELL, exclusion size 10,000 Da. Samples (1 ml) were applied to a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmdithioerythritol. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. Fractions containing Ptf1p were pooled, and protein was dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, at 6 °C. Ion exchange chromatography was performed for further protein purification using a Fractogel EMD SO3− 650(M) column (1 × 6 cm) (Merck). The column was equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Protein was applied to the column at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min, after which the column was washed with 100 ml of equilibration buffer. PPIase-containing fractions were obtained by running a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl in 100 ml of 35 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. The fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 3 h against 2 liters of 10 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and applied to a Fractogel TSK AF-Blue column (1 × 6 cm) equilibrated with dialysis buffer. Homogenous Ptf1p was obtained by running a linear gradient from 0 to 2 m KCl in 60 ml of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. For the purification of authentic heterologously expressed Ptf1p, the same procedure was used with the exception of the initial chromatographic step. The supernatant derived from ultracentrifugation was passed through a Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M) column (2.5 × 20), equilibrated with 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Ptf1p passed unbound through the column and was applied to gel filtration as described above. For the purification of the mutated recombinant parvulins, the harvested cells were resuspended in 2 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing a protease inhibitor mix as recommended by the manufacturer (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Boehringer Mannheim), lysed by French press, and ultracentrifuged as described for Ptf1p. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and His-tagged proteins were purified as described for Ptf1p. The eluted parvulin-containing fractions were dialyzed two times for 1 h against 3 liters of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and the protease inhibitor mix. Ion exchange chromatography using a Fractogel EMD SO3− 650(M) column (1 × 6 cm) (Merck) was carried out for further purification as described above. The recombinant proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 2m KCl in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Recombinant purified Ptf1p expressed in E. coliwas used for production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. The immunization was done according to the instructions supplied with the Ribi Adjuvant System. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose according to Haid and Suissa (28Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 6921-6927Google Scholar). Immunoreactions were carried out with the ECL Western blotting kit from Amersham Buchler. For the proteolytic assay, measurements were carried out as described previously (29Rahfeld J.-U. Schierhorn A. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), using Suc-Ala-Xaa-Pro-Yaa-4NA (where NA is nitroanilide) as enzyme substrate. Xaa and Yaa denote variable aminoacyl residues at this position. With respect to the prolyl bond, such peptide substrates exist in an equilibrium of about 5–20% cis- and 80–95%trans-confomers. Commonly known endopeptidases like chymotrypsin, trypsin, or subtilisin split off the C-terminal 4NA residue only in the trans population of these proline-containing substrates. Thus, in the presence of sufficient amounts of protease in the reaction mixture, the transpopulation is rapidly cleaved, whereas the cis population remains intact (first rapid phase). The following slow isomerization reaction is accelerated by PPIases, resulting in the cleavabletrans substrate (second, slow phase). The time course of 4-nitroaniline release was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 390 nm in a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer in 0.5-s intervals for a total of 4 min. Reported data are given as the mean value of three to five measurements. A disadvantage of the protease-coupled assay is the requirement for high concentrations of helper proteases in order to obtain the two-phase reaction described above. This assay could therefore only be used for proteins that proved to be resistant toward attack from these enzymes, at least for the duration of the experiment. The intactness of each putative PPIase after the reaction was examined on Western blots. In the case of recombinant Ptf1p, thrombin and trypsin cleaved off the oligohistidine tag at the inserted thrombin cleavage site but did not further digest Ptf1p. Subtilisin did not attack the protein under the conditions of PPIase measurements, whereas chymotrypsin digested Ptf1p completely within 2 min of incubation (2Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, in the PPIase assay of Ptf1p, trypsin (0.08 and 0.02 mg/ml) was used for cleavage of the Lys-4NA and Arg-4NA bonds, respectively, and subtilisin (0.04 mg/ml), for cleaving the Phe-, Tyr- Leu- and Met-4NA bonds. Substrates were purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg) or synthesized according to Schutkowski et al. (30Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.-U. Lu K.P. Fischer G.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of various substrates were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. For inhibition studies, the Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-4NA was used as substrate for parvulin and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-4NA as substrate for Ptf1p. FK506 was a gift from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka. Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared in 50% ethanol. The incubation time was 5 min for FK506 and 15 min for cyclosporin A. Three independent experiments were performed. Because of the unexpected sensitivity of the mutant proteins Ptf1-2p and -5p toward proteases, PPIase activity was measured using a modification of the assay described by Kofron et al. (31Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Colón-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and others (32Garcia-Echeverria C. Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Rich D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 2B. Janowski, S. Wöllner, M. Schutkowski, and G. Fischer, submitted for publication. This assay exploits the difference in the absorption coefficients of cis andtrans conformers of the substrates Suc-Ala Ala Pro-(NO2)Tyr-4-fluoranilide at 430 nm. In an effort to identifytrans-acting factors participating in the 3′-end processing reaction of yeast pre-mRNAs, a genetic selection system was established, in which a defect in this reaction could be recognized by the appearance of blue-colored colonies. The system was based on a fusion construct, pJH702CEN, composed of a 3′-end truncatedACT1 gene joined to the lacZ gene by a minimum-sized ADH1 3′-end formation site in a centromere vector (Fig. 1). TheADH1-derived sequences had been modified such that an open reading frame was maintained throughout the originally noncoding 3′-region of the ADH1 gene and that translation of read-through transcripts would result in a lacZ fusion protein. Stable read-through transcripts were expected to occur only in plasmid-carrying cells in which the formation of mRNA 3′-ends was impaired. Transformation of wild type yeast with pJH702CEN (Fig. 1) yielded, as expected, white colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside-containing medium, as the plasmid-derived transcripts were processed and polyadenylated at theADH1 3′-end formation site. In contrast, a positive control construct (pJH712CEN, Fig. 1), in which the 3′-end truncatedACT1 gene was directly connected with the lacZgene, gave rise to blue colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside containing selective medium (data not shown). After EMS mutagenesis of 1.9 million yeast cells containing the selection plasmid pJH702CEN, three viable mutants (yeastprocessing mutants YPM2, YPM3, and YPM5) that displayed the expected blue-color phenotype were isolated at 23 °C. Two of them, YPM2 and YPM5, additionally showed temperature-sensitive growth at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. The results of several control experiments demonstrated that the mutations leading to the specific phenotypes were chromosomal mutations (data not shown) as follows. (i) The plasmids isolated from the mutants and retransformed into wild type yeast led to a wild type phenotype, i.e. white colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl b-d-galactopyranoside-containing plates. (ii) The DNA sequence of the ADH1 3′-end formation site and the beginning of the lacZ gene was not altered in the mutants. (iii) Mutants, which had been grown on non-selective medium until they had lost their plasmid, turned blue again after re-transformation with the original selection plasmid. Shifting the YPM2-mutant cells from 23 °C to the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C led to a significant decrease of the amount of poly(A)+ RNA within 2 h after the shift (Fig.2). To demonstrate that the blue phenotype of the mutants coincided with the presence of the chimeric ACT1-ADH1-lacZread-through transcripts in the mutant cells, RT-PCR was performed with total RNA isolated from the mutant YPM2 and wild type yeast grown at 23 and 37 °C, respectively. As a positive control, RNA from wild type yeast DH484, which had been transformed with the test plasmid, was isolated under identical conditions. Two sets of primer pairs were used as follows: the primers JH24 and JH25 amplified allACT1-ADH1-lacZ-derived transcripts (Fig. 3 A, product I), whereas the primers JH26 and JH27 were designed to amplify only those transcripts that had not been cleaved at the ADH1-derived polyadenylation site (Fig. 3 A, product II). The radioactively labeled RT-PCR products, separated on agarose gels (Fig.3 B) were quantitated by scanning with a PhosphorImager. In wild type cells, read-through transcripts (Fig. 3 A, product II) comprised only 2.5 and 1.5% of the total amount of plasmid-encodedACT1 transcripts (Fig. 3 A, product I) at 23 °C and 37%, respectively. In contrast, 10-fold higher levels of read-through transcripts, i.e. 30%, were detected in the mutant cells at 37 °C, with 13% already present at the permissive temperature of 23 °C. In order to test whether the observed increase in the amount of read-through transcripts from the selection plasmid in YPM2 was restricted to the special template, the transcripts of three other yeast genes, ACT1, CYC1, and YPT1, were examined on Northern blots. To facilitate the analysis, YPM2 cells were transformed with plasmids containing 3′-terminal fragments of these genes inserted between the ACT1 promoter and the terminator of either ACT1 or ADH1 (Fig.4 (20Heidmann S. Obermaier B. Vogel K. Domdey H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4215-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). As a control, ADH1was included with either a complete or truncated version of its 3′-terminal region (Fig. 4). The latter was very similar to the one used in the mutant screen. The plasmid constructs and positions of the oligonucleotide probes SH16 and SH18 are shown schematically in Fig. 4. The two probes enabled the distinction between transcripts ending in the inserted fragment and unprocessed products ending within the downstream adjacentADH1 or ACT1 terminal region. Additionally, both probes could also detect endogenous ACT1mRNA. The corresponding signal was used as a standard for the amount of RNA isolated from YPM2 cells that differed only in the DNA constructs with which they had been transformed. Northern blot analysis was carried out with total RNA from cells that had been grown at either the permissive or the nonpermissive temperature (Fig.5). The same blot was successively probed with SH16 (Fig. 5 A) and SH18 (Fig. 5 B). Hybridization performed with SH16 and RNA that had been synthesized at 23 °C resulted mostly in strong signals, corresponding well in size to transcripts that had initiated at the plasmid-derivedACT1 promoter and ended at the polyadenylation sites within the respective, gene-specific 3′-end insertions (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–5, and legend). In each lane, the endogenous ACT1mRNA appeared above those signals. As judged by this internal standard, the amount of total RNA in lanes 3 and8 had apparently been underestimated, resulting in only weak signals for the YPT1 transcript at both temperatures. Hybridization of RNA isolated from cells cultured at 37 °C with the same probe led to generally less intense signals for each of the gene-specific transcripts and also for the endogenous ACT1mRNA (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6–10). As the amount of total RNA loaded was kept the same, this result reflected again the significant reduction of poly(A)+ RNA in mutant cells grown at the non-permissive temperature (see Fig. 2). Any read-through transcripts that extended into the second 3′-terminal insertion of each DNA construct was expected to hybridize also to SH18 (Fig. 4), as this probe, in addition to endogenous ACT1mRNA, could only light up transcripts that had failed to be processed within the gene-specific 3′-end insertions. To facilitate the evaluation, the blot in Fig. 5 B was drastically overexposed as exemplified by the increased intensity of the internalACT1 standard. The presence of a disproportionally strong signal at the position of the endogenous ACT1 mRNA in lane 8 of Fig.5 B clearly demonstrated that the YPT1 transcript, present in mutant cells grown at 37 °C, was a genuine read-through transcript. A similarly clear result was obtained for theADH1 transcript expressed from the DNA construct carrying the truncated ver"

Immunoblotting experiments using a specific antiserum recognized both the A and B chains of calcineurin. Neutrophils treated with cyclosporin A or FK 506 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of calcineurin activity. The effect of oxidant compounds on calcineurin activity was also investigated. Neutrophils treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), where catalase was inhibited with aminotriazole, exhibited a specific inhibition of calcineurin activity. However, the addition of reducing agents to neutrophil extracts partially reversed the inhibition caused by H2O2. A similar inhibitory effect of H2O2 on calcineurin activity was observed to occur in isolated lymphocytes. This is the first demonstration that redox agents modulate calcineurin activity in a cellular system. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of NF-κB in human neutrophils is inhibited by cell pretreatment with H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that calcineurin activity regulates the functional activity of lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB/Rel proteins in human neutrophils. These data indicate a role of peroxides in the modulation of calcineurin activity and that the H2O2-dependent NF-κB inactivation in neutrophils occurs in concert with inhibition of calcineurin.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8348-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Human CN possesses a Fe-Zn active center. The assignment of stoichiometric amounts of Zn2+and Fe3+ in the CNA center is based on atomic absorption experiments (15King M.M. Huang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8847-8856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same assignments were made for the di-metal site in the structure of some CNA (16Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E.

Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar).The central role of CN in T cell signaling was appreciated by its identification as the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK 506 (1Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 2Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J.

The phosphatase activity of CN is inhibited by either drug when complexed to intracellular binding proteins (immunophilins), i.e. CsA to cyclophilin and FK 506 to the FK 506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), respectively. Neither drug nor immunophilin alone bind to or affect the activity of CN (1Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). This phosphatase is expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells. In mammals, CN is most abundant in the brain (17Stemmer P. Klee C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) but has also been detected in T cells (1Liu J.

On the other hand, it is known that NF-AT-mediated transactivation depends on the CN activity (18Liu J. Albers M.W. Wandless T.J. Luan S. Alberg D.G. Belshaw P.J. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. Klee C.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Other findings suggest that NF-κB activity is also under CN control (20Schmidt A. Hennighausen L. Siebenlist U. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Frantz B. Nordby E.C. Bren G. Steffan N. Paya C.V. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7088-7093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, only indirect evidence has been presented on the occurrence of the phosphatase CN. The treatment of these cells with inhibitors of CN (e.g. CsA and FK 506) inhibited the neutrophils chemokinesis on vitronectin matrix (23Hendey B. Klee C.B. Maxfield F.R. Science. 1992; 258: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Hendey B. Maxfield F.R. Blood Cells. 1993; 19: 143-161PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, intracellular calcium and CN regulate neutrophil motility on vitronectin through a receptor identified by antibodies against the integrins αv and β3 (25Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 26Hendey B. Lawson M. Marcantonio E.E. Maxfield F.R. Blood. 1996; 87: 2038-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first purpose of the present work was to assess the presence of CN in neutrophils using as a substrate a specific peptide corresponding to the phosphorylation site of the RII subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Additionally, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) have been implicated in mediating signal transduction by a variety of stimuli in lymphoid cells, and transcription factors seem to be responsible for the inducible expression of a number of genes in response to oxidative stress (27Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 39-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 28Gomez del Arco P. Martinez-Martinez S. Calvo V. Armesilla A.L. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26335-26340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this context, the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium has been shown to activate NF-κB (29Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals produced from H2O2 cannot function as diffusible intracellular messengers, since they can react with the nearest molecule in a nonspecific fashion. A more suitable ROI messenger would be the less reactive H2O2. However, arguments against ROI involvement in NF-κB activation have been published (30Brennan P. O'Neil L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 1670-1675Google Scholar, 31Suzuki Y. Mizuno M. Parker L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 40: 537-541Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Suzuki Y.J. Mizuno M. Packer L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5008-5015PubMed Google Scholar), and despite the fact that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent NF-κB stimulation is cancelled by antioxidants, it has been recently shown that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate does not increase intracellular ROI (33Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxide-mediated stimulation of NF-κB appears to be cell line-specific, sinceN-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, elicited up-regulation of NF-κB binding activity in monocyte-derived macrophages (34Nottet H.S.L.M. Moelans I.I.M.D. de Vos N.M. de Graaf L. Visser M.R. Verhoef J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, NF-κB is not the only nuclear factor whose activity is altered by H2O2. In a fashion opposite to that observed for NF-κB, NF-AT has been shown to be actively suppressed by H2O2 in Jurkat T cells (35Beiqing L. Chen M. Whisler R.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 160-169PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the development of stabilized peroxovanadium compounds has provided the opportunity to more fully characterize the action of oxidants within the cell (36Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of lymphocytes with sodium oxodiperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)vanadate (V), pV(phen), results in a large increase in intracellular oxidation, which correlates with a strong induction of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of kinases. The same authors (37Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11541-11549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have documented that antioxidant treatment does not prevent the activation of NF-κB by pV(phen). Therefore, we have also used pV(phen) as another tool to study the effect of oxidative stress on calcineurin activity. In summary, previous data suggest that, first, CN modulates the DNA binding activity of essential transcription factors (e.g.NF-AT and NF-κB), and second, ROI regulates positively or negatively those transcription factors. However, a link between both signals, that is CN and ROI, is lacking. In this paper we address this question and the implications of the ROI as universal messenger to activate NF-κB. Neutrophils were isolated from fresh heparinized blood of healthy human donors by dextran sedimentation, followed by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation and hypotonic lysis of residual erythrocytes as indicated (38Monteseirin J. Camacho M.J. Montaño R. Llamas E. Conde M. Carballo M. Guardia P. Conde J. Sobrino F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2571-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), suspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in HBSS supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% O2 for 1–2 h. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from heparinized venous blood of normal volunteers by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation. Dextran T-500 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech (Barcelona, Spain). Ficoll-Paque, HBSS, and RPMI 1640 were obtained from BioWhittaker (Verviers, Belgium). CsA and FK 506 were kindly provided by Dr. S. F. Borel (Sandoz Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) and Fujisawa GmbH (München, Germany), respectively. Chemicals were of analytical grade from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Dithiothreitol (DTT) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Barcelona, Spain). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), okadaic acid, trifluoroperazine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), hydrogen peroxide (30% v/v), 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (aminotriazole, AMT), soybean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, aprotinin, Nonidet P-40, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma (Madrid, Spain). Rabbit anti-bovine calcineurin IgG was kindly provided by C. B. Klee. The synthetic peptide used as a substrate for calcineurin was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Bellmont, CA). pV(phen) was synthesized as described previously (37Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11541-11549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 2-Mercaptoethanol, SDS, acrylamide,N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and blotting nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Luminol (5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) were purchased from Serva (Madrid, Spain), and 4-iodophenol was from Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). Molecular weight standards (Rainbow markers) was obtained from Amersham Corp. (London, UK); Sephadex G-25 was from Pharmacia (Barcelona, Spain); and double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (5′-AGTTGAG GGGACTTTCC CAGGC-3′) containing NF-κB sites was from Boehringer Mannheim Gmbh (Mannheim, Germany). 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Untreated neutrophils (1 × 108 cells/ml) were lysed for 30 min on ice in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and disrupted by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid (crude extract) was separated from low molecular weight material by passage through a 0.5 × 10-cm Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors as above (39Stemmer P.M. Wang X. Krinks M.H. Klee C.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fractions containing most of the A 280 nmmaterial eluting with the void volume of the column were pooled and used to measure CN activity. Immunosuppressive agents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a concentration 1000-fold higher than that used for cell treatments. Neutrophils (7 × 106 cells/ml) were suspended in 1 ml of HBSS supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml BSA in microcentrifuge tubes, 1 μl of Me2SO or CsA or FK 506 was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. For experiments with H2O2 and other stimuli, neutrophils were incubated at 37 °C. The incubation times and concentration of agents are indicated in the figure legends. After incubation, the cells were washed once with 1 ml of HBSS on ice and lysed in 60 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 12,000 ×g, and supernatant was used as the source of CN. CN phosphatase activity was measured using an assay adapted from Hubbard and Klee (40Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 135-137Google Scholar), basically as described (22Gualberto A. Marquez G. Carballo M. Youngblood G.L. Hunt III, S.W. Baldwin A.S. Sobrino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7088-7093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (7 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of drugs as indicated in the text. Reaction mixtures containing 2 μm32P-labeled phosphopeptide, 500 nm okadaic acid (added to inhibit PP-1A and PP-2A type phosphatase activities), and 20 μl of cell lysate (about 80 μg of protein) were incubated in a total volume of 60 μl of assay buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, as indicated in the figures) for 15 min at 30 °C. After this time, reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixture was passed through a 500-μl column of activated Dowex cation-exchange resin, and free inorganic phosphate was quantitated in the eluate by scintillation counting. It was verified that at 15 min of incubation time the assay was linear. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the counts/min measured in blank assay lacking cell lysate were subtracted. Data are expressed as the number of picomoles of 32PO4released in 15 min per mg of protein. The synthetic peptide (Asp-Leu-Asp-Val-Pro-Ile-Pro-Gly-Arg-Phe-Asp-Arg-Arg-Val-Ser-Val-Ala-Ala-Glu), corresponding to a segment of the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase (41Blumenthal D.R. Takio K. Hansen R.S. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8140-8145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was phosphorylated on the unique serine residue by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase using [γ-32P]ATP, essentially as described (40Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Wheal H. Chad J. Molecular Neurobiology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 135-137Google Scholar), and used as phosphatase substrate. The specific activity of fresh preparations of32P-labeled phosphopeptide was about 500 μCi/μmol peptide. Cells (7 × 106cells/ml) were lysed for 30 min on ice in 100 μl of buffer A (see above). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 2 min at 12,000 × g. Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by the Bradford method (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using BSA as a standard. For the Western blot analysis of CN subunits A and B, neutrophil lysates were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose using the Bio-Rad Mini-blotting apparatus. Filters were blocked for 1 h in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 3% BSA. Furthermore, they were rinsed twice with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and they were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-bovine calcineurin IgG diluted 1:1000 in TBST. After three washes in TBST, the filters were incubated for 90 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, final dilution). Filters were then washed twice with TBS and then twice with TBST for 10 min each time. The bound secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (43Carballo M. Vilaplana R. Márquez G. Conde M. Bedoya F.J. González-Vı́lchez F. Sobrino F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were incubated for 1 min in 10 ml of fresh luminescent reagent solution, composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.25 mm luminol, 0.015% (v/v) H2O2, and 0.45 mm 4-iodophenol, the latter acting as an enhancer of the chemiluminescence reaction (44Hodgson M. Jones P. J. Biolum. Chemilumin. 1989; 3: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These concentrations of luminol, H2O2, and 4-iodophenol were determined to be optimal for maximum light production. 2M. Carballo and F. Sobrino, unpublished data. Luminol and 4-iodophenol were freshly prepared in 10 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. Luminol was previously dissolved in 50 μl of 1m NaOH. The use of Me2SO as solvent should be avoided since in alkaline/Me2SO conditions, luminol autoxidizes with emission of intense luminescence (45White E.E. Zafirion O.C. Kagi H.M. Hill J.H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 940-941Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After 1 min of incubation, the membranes were placed on paper filter, covered with Saran Wrap, and exposed to x-ray films (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.) in the dark for 1–5 min. Human neutrophils whose viability exceeded 98% after 3 h in culture, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, were resuspended at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 3 h, with occasional shaking in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml LPS, 1 μg/ml CsA, or H2O2 at the concentrations indicated in each experiment. Then nuclear extracts were prepared basically as described by McDonald et al. (46McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With this purpose, cell suspensions were transferred into pre-cooled tubes containing an equivalent volume of ice-cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with DFP (2 mm, final concentration). After centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold relaxation buffer, consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 30 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmDTT, supplemented with an antiprotease mixture composed of 2 mm DFP, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and captopril. Cells were disrupted by short sonication (1 s), and the lysates were spun at 3,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet unbroken cells and intact nuclei. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold relaxation buffer, again subjected to short (1 s) sonication, and respun as above to pellet intact nuclei. These were resuspended in 200 μl of relaxation buffer, and after new centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold relaxation buffer, additionally containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 380 mm NaCl. Following a 20-min incubation on ice with occasional mixing, the samples were spun at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were stored at −70 °C. EMSA was performed by using as a probe the double-stranded 22-base pair NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide indicated above, which was labeled with DIG using the labeling kit from Boehringer Mannheim. The nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were assayed for κB binding activity using the DIG gel shift assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim, GmbH). The reactions were performed in 15 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol) and allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. For competition assays, binding reactions were performed in the presence of the unlabeled oligonucleotide (100-fold molar excess) for 20 min at room temperature. Supershift assays including anti-p50 and anti-p65 were carried out as described previously (46McDonald P.P. Bald A. Cassatella M.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3421-3433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were finally electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide native gels at 4 °C in 0.25× TBE. CN is a well characterized phosphatase that plays an important role in T cell activation pathways (1Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar, 2Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3686-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 3O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 4Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). In this work we have characterized the presence of CN activity and immunoreactive CN protein in human neutrophils. In crude neutrophil lysates, specific CN activity was observed, and a linear appearance of product during the assay was obtained in the range of 20–75 μg of lysate proteins (Fig.1 A). The time course of CN activity is shown in Fig. 1 B. Clearly, 32P release increased linearly along assay time until 15 min, and then a slow activity was found. Fig. 1 (inset) illustrates an immunoblotting analysis of CN expression in lymphocytes (lane 1) and different amounts of human neutrophil lysates (lanes 2–4). We used an antiserum that recognizes both the A (59 kDa) and B (19 kDa) chains of CN, confirming that both subunits are expressed in human neutrophils. As shown, neutrophil CNB migrates as a 16-kDa band in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and it is detected along with a predominant CNA band migrating at 59 kDa. A third band, detected at 57 kDa in lymphocytes extracts, is probably a proteolytic fragment of CNA generated during preparation of the cell lysates. In some preparations of neutrophil lysates, a similar band of 55–57 kDa was also found (data not shown). Next experiments were addressed to analyze the regulation of CN activity in crude neutrophil lysates. Fig.2 illustrates that the dephosphorylation of the CN-specific substrate peptide by crude neutrophil lysates was Ca2+-dependent, as well as insensitive to okadaic acid, a potent and specific inhibitor of phosphatases 1A and 2A (reviewed in Ref. 47Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). When 500 nm okadaic acid was included in the assays, nearly all of the remaining phosphatase activity was Ca2+-dependent and could be eliminated by substituting 5 mm EGTA for Ca2+(Fig. 2). In contrast, the okadaic acid-sensitive component was resistant to EGTA, which is consistent with the reported Ca2+ independence of phosphatases 1A and 2A (17Stemmer P. Klee C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CN activity was abrogated in nominally calcium-free medium and in the presence of a known inhibitor of calmodulin, trifluoroperazine (48Stewart A.A. Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Eur. J.

However, trifluoroperazine did not inhibit calcium-independent, okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases from neutrophil lysates (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data indicate that a specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase activity is present in the neutrophil lysates.Figure 2Effect of calcium, okadaic acid, and trifluoroperazine on calcineurin activity from crude neutrophil lysates.

We have used the PC12 cell line to study the possible intracellular pathways that can be activated by calcium influx. Previously, we observed that membrane depolarization-induced calcium influx was able to activate the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and most of this activation was calmodulin-dependent. We demonstrated that a part of the ERK activation is due to the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Here, we show that both the epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and the Shc-Grb2-Ras activation are not calmodulin-modulated. Moreover, dominant negative mutant Ha-ras (Asn-17) prevents the activation on ERKs by membrane depolarization, suggesting that Ras and calmodulin are both necessaries to activate ERKs by membrane depolarization. We failed to observe any significant induction and/or modulation of the A-Raf, B-Raf or c-Raf-1 kinase activities, thus suggesting the existence of a MEK kinase different from the classical Raf kinases that directly or indirectly can be modulated by Ca2+/calmodulin.

Several studies have reported that chronic depolarization of plasma membrane prevent the cell death that occurs after deprivation of neurotrophic factors in many populations of neurons in culture. This effect is mediated by a sustained increase of the intracellular-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)1that enters the cell through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) (1Collins F. Lile J.D. Brain Res. 1989; 502: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Collins F. Schmidt M.F. Guthrie P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2582-2587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Larmet Y.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 643-664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. M. Johnson's laboratory conceptualized this phenomenon in the “Ca2+ set-point hypothesis,” which postulates that moderate increases in the [Ca2+]i (less than 100 nm above the basal values) can promote the survival of neurons in culture even in the absence of trophic support (for review, see Ref. 5Franklin J.L. Johnson E.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 15: 500-508Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis relevant for the depolarization-induced neuronal survival have been shown to be controversial and remain to be elucidated (6D'Mello S.R. Borodezt K. Soltoff S.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Miller T.M. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Creedon D.J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible mechanism by which membrane depolarization could promote survival is by activating signaling pathways similar to those activated by neurotrophic factors. Among these, the Ras/MAP kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathways have been shown to be the most relevant (9Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 10Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Although membrane depolarization and subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i is not able to promote cell survival or differentiation in PC12, in low serum medium some effects of increased [Ca2+]i have been described. For example, membrane depolarization induced by adding KCl (high-K+) to the culture medium is able to preserve priming and preexisting neurites induced by NGF treatment (11Teng K.K. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3124-3135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It can also induce differentiation in cells sensitized with levels of NGF, which alone are insufficient to induce morphological differentiation (12Solem M. Mcmahon T. Messing R.O. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5966-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that potassium combined with Bay K induces long term survival and differentiation of PC12 cells (13Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Variations in the [Ca2+]i has been shown to be determinant in the regulation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway through mechanisms not completely understood (14Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) demonstrated that an increase in [Ca2+]i directly or indirectly induces Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, which in turn associates with Grb2 and Sos, resulting in the activation of Ras. Moreover, membrane depolarization is able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR to a sufficient extent to activate the ERK/MAP kinase pathway (16Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 17Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Zwick E.

Chem. 1998; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and this activation seems to be necessary to activate this signaling pathway (18Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PYK2, an intracellular tyrosine kinase related to the focal adhesion kinase, is also activated by increases in the [Ca2+]i that can in turn activate Ras through a Src-dependent pathway (19Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). As Ca2+ ions enter the cytosol, they encounter a number of proteins that regulate their biochemical effects. Central among them is calmodulin (CaM), a small Ca2+-binding protein, which can bind up to four Ca2+ ions. After binding to Ca2+, CaM changes its conformation and it is able to regulate the activity of many different proteins. In several cell types, CaM has been shown to modulate Ras either directly or indirectly. Farnsworth et al. (20Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Felg L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Ca2+ stimulation of Ras can be mediated by CaM through a Ras-GTP exchange factor which contains an IQ motif, referred to as Ras-GRF (20Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Felg L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Moreover, some CaM-binding Ras-like GTPases have been described (21Lee C.-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zacks D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wes P.D. Yu M.J. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), even though its functional activity on MAP kinase activation has not yet been tested. These include RIT, which is widely distributed in human tissues, and RIN, whose expression is unusually confined to the nervous system. However, none of these proteins has been shown to be present in the PC12 cell line. Additionally, CaM has been shown to be able to regulate several CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaM-K) being CaM K II and IV the best characterized. CaM-K IV has been linked to the activation of several MAP kinases (including JNK-1, p38, and to a lesser extent ERK2) (23Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, CaM-K IV has been shown to be absent in PC12 cells and therefore the involvement of this kinase in the activation of ERK MAP kinase is controversial (23Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.S. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that PI 3-kinase can be involved in the regulation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway although its implication seems to be cell type- and ligand-specific (24Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For example, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, PI 3-kinase seems to regulate the prolonged activation of the ERK MAP kinases (25Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that integrin-dependent activation of the ERK MAP kinases is reverted by wortmannin and LY294002, two selective PI 3-kinase inhibitors (26King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Moreover, a report from the laboratory of Sacks (27Joyal J.L. Burks D.J. Pons S. Matter W.F. Vlahos C.J. White M.F. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28183-28186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) has shown that CaM is able to bind and modulate the activity of the PI 3-kinase. The relevance of these results in the PC12 cell system remains to be proved. Our laboratory has previously shown that membrane depolarization of PC12 cells (17Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and chicken motoneurons (8Soler R.M. Egea J. Mintenig G.M. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Iglesias M. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is able to activate the ERK MAP kinase pathway through a Ca2+/CaM-dependent mechanism. In the present work, we have investigated more precisely the level at which CaM is acting on the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. We show here that this modulation is located lower to Ras but upstream of MEK. Moreover, our results suggest that CaM action is independent of the classical forms of Raf (c-Raf-1, A-Raf, or B-Raf) indicating the existence of a MEK kinase, different from Raf and activated by a Ras-dependent mechanism after membrane depolarization, that would be regulated directly or indirectly by Ca2+/CaM. PC12 cells were grown on 75-cm2 tissue culture dishes (Corning) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 6% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was further supplemented with 10 mm Hepes. The M-M17–26 PC12 subline was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Culture medium from two cell lines was further supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin and 20 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturating humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For experiments, PC12 and M-M17–26 cells were allowed to proliferate in polyornithine precoated tissue culture dishes (Corning) until they reached 80% confluence. Before acute stimulation with NGF (100 ng/ml), KCl (75 mm), or PMA (1.6 μm), cells were washed three times and cultured for an additional 15–20 h in serum-free medium. Before acute stimulations, the indicated cultures were exposed to different protein inhibitors: the CaM inhibitors calmidazolium chloride (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA), trifluoperazine dimaleate (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.), W5 and W7 (Sigma), and W12 and W13 (Sigma); the PKC inhibitor BIM I (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.); the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.); or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.). After stimulation, cells were rinsed rapidly in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.2 and solubilized at 4 °C in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (see below). After 15 min of incubation on ice, cells were scraped from the dishes and cell lysates were orbitally rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by microcentrifuge centrifugation at 10,000 ×g and 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentration in the supernatant was quantified by a modified Lowry assay as described by the provider (Bio-Rad DC protein assay). Western blot assay was performed with immunoprecipitates or cell lysates by resolving the proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Pharmacia semidry Trans-Blot (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2, MEK1/2 and Akt (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), pan-ERK and c-Raf-1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), pan-MEK (New England Biolabs, Inc.), MEK1 (UBI, Lake Placid, NY), PLCγ (Transduction Laboratories), EGFR, A-Raf and B-Raf (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or pan-Shc (Transduction Laboratories) were used according to the supplier instructions. After incubation with specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Pierce) Immunoprecipitation of Shc, PLCγ, or c-Raf-1 (Transduction Laboratories) and EGFR, A-Raf, or B-Raf (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was performed with specific antibodies according to the supplier's instructions. Immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed, transferred, and detected essentially as described above. To detect Grb2 association in Shc immunoprecipitates, membranes were blocked with TBS-T20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk, probed with a polyclonal anti-Grb2 antibody diluted in TBS-T20 containing 0.2% nonfat milk and, finally, incubated with a specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. To detect tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ and EGFR, membranes were blocked with TBS-T20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin, probed with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (anti-Tyr(P)) and incubated with a specific peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. To immunoprecipitate the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase, extracts from NGF-treated or depolarized PC12 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody 4G10 (1/100). Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose coupled to rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal antibody. p85 was detected using an specific anti-p85 antibody (UBI) as described by the supplier. MEK in vitrokinase assay was performed in MEK immunoprecipitates by using recombinant GST-ERK2 (UBI) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as substrates. After treatment, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). After the removal of nuclei and cellular debris, cell lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl (v/v) of protein A-Sepharose. Five hundred μg of protein of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the anti-MEK1 antibody was added (1/250) (UBI). After 2 h at 4 °C, immunocomplexes were precipitated with 40 μl (v/v) of protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and three more times with assay kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Precipitates were resuspended in 50 μl (final volume) of assay kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 15 mmMgCl2, 6 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 400 ng of GST-ERK2 (UBI). Kinase assay was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE. After drying the gel, the phosphorylation signal was quantified on a PhosphorImager (Boehringer Mannheim). Radioactive spots were also detected by autoradiography by exposing the TLC plate to Fuji medical x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) overnight at –70 °C. Raf kinase activity was measured by using wild-type MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and [γ-32P] ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as substrates. After treatments, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). After the removal of nuclei and cellular debris, cell lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 μl (v/v) of protein G-Sepharose. Seven hundred and fifty μg of protein of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 1 μg of anti-c-Raf-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-B-Raf antibody, or anti-A-Raf antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added. After 2 h at 4 °C, immunocomplexes were precipitated with 40 μl (v/v) of protein G-Sepharose for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and three more times with assay kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Precipitates were resuspended in 25 μl (final volume) of assay kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 50 mmMgCl2, 6 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 120 ng of wild type MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Kinase assay was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. Reaction was stopped with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and products were separated by SDS-PAGE. After drying the gel, the phosphorylation signal was quantified and detected as described above. After stimulation, cells were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation, and approximately 750 μg of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody, 4G10. Immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose preconjugated with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody and sequentially washed with lysis buffer, LiCl buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate), and TNE buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Immunocomplexes were incubated with a mixture of l-α-phosphatidylinositol and l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml each) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP. Incubation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. Phosphorylated lipids were then extracted and resolved by TLC usingn-propanol:H2O:acetic acid (66:33:2, v:v:v) as solvent. Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography by exposing the TLC plate to Fuji medical x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.) overnight at –70 °C. Ras activity was measured with a non-radioactive method as described previously (28de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were solubilized for 15 min in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1%N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmbenzamidine, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Nuclei and cellular debris were removed, and 50 μg of the recombinant GST-RBD protein previously coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to approximately 750 μg of protein. Protein complexes were allowed to form for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer withoutN-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Finally precipitates were resuspended with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and denatured proteins were loaded in a 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection was done using an anti-pan-Ras antibody (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) and a anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Blots were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system described above. The rest of biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. Anti-Grb2 was a gift from Dr. J. Ureña (University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain), anti-pan-Ras was from Dr. O. Bachs and Dr. N. Agell (University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain), anti-EGFR was from Dr. G. Capellà and Dr. C. Garcı́a (Hospital de Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain), and anti-Tyr(P) (4G10) were from Dr. D. Martin-Zanca (CSIC-University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain). The GST-RBD construct was obtained from Dr. F. McKenzie (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) through Dr. O. Bachs and Dr. N. Agell. The PC12 subline M-M17–26, kindly provided by Dr. G. M. Cooper (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) through Dr. A. Aranda (CSIC, Madrid, Spain), was obtained after transfection with the dominant negative mutant Ha-ras (Asn-17). 7 S NGF was prepared in our laboratory from salivary glands as described previously (29Mobley W.C. Schenker A. Shooter E.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5543-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that ERK MAP kinase activation induced by high-K+ in PC12 cells is specifically blocked by the CaM antagonist W13, but not by its structural analogue W12, which is about 5 times less potent (17Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Hidaka H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka T. Endo T. Ohno S. Fujii H. Nagata Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the present report, this result has been extended to other CaM inhibitors that include W7/W5 (30Hidaka H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka T. Endo T. Ohno S. Fujii H. Nagata Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 D). In all cases, these inhibitors showed a similar effect to that elicited by W13, i.e. when PC12 cell were pretreated with the inhibitors, they prevented the activation of the ERK MAP kinase induced by high-K+ (Fig. 1). The blockade of high-K+-induced ERK activation was dose-dependent (data not shown) and specific, since structural homologues (W5 and W12) of active inhibitors (W7 and W13, respectively) were not able to block the ERK activation (Fig. 1,A and B). Moreover, prevention of ERK activation exerted by the CaM inhibitors was not mediated by an alteration of the calcium currents after membrane depolarization, i.e. these drugs did not alter the kinetics of Ca2+ entry into the cytoplasm (data not shown) (8Soler R.M. Egea J. Mintenig G.M. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Iglesias M. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that transactivation of receptors with tyrosine kinase activity such the EGFR in PC12 cells by membrane depolarization seems to be necessary to reach a complete activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway (16Rosen L.B. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 17Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J.

Chem. 1998; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These data suggested us the possibility that CaM inhibitors may exert its effects on the high-K+-induced activation of ERKs indirectly through the blockade of the kinase activity of the EGFR. To test this hypothesis, the EGFR was immunoprecipitated from 2- and 5-min depolarized cells pretreated or not with the CaM antagonists W12 and W13. To study the kinase activity of the receptor, immunoprecipitates were analyzed on Western blot with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody. As shown in Fig.2, high-K+ was able to activate the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR although to a much lesser extent than EGF. However, in cell lysates where the ERK phosphorylation due to membrane depolarization was completely prevented by W13 (data not shown), neither W13 nor W12 pretreatment was able to modify the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 2). Therefore, the observed lack of ERK phosphorylation in the W13-treated cultures after membrane depolarization could not be attributed to an inhibition of the kinase activity of the EGFR. The ERK MAP kinase cascade is usually initiated by the interaction of trophic factors with their corresponding tyrosine kinase receptors resulting in the autophosphorylation of the receptor. Phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors activate Ras by a mechanism that requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (for review, see Ref. 9Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The ability of Shc to activate Ras is mediated by the association of Shc to Grb2 and Sos. It has been previously reported that depolarization-induced ERK activation can result from a direct depolarization-induced phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors such as the EGFR (18Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the activation of EGFR was not sensitive to W13 (see above). Shc has also been reported to play a central role in the Ca2+-induced ERK activation after membrane depolarization (15Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the possibility that the W13 CaM antagonist can modulate the ERK activity through the function of Shc. To test this possibility, we have studied the effects of CaM antagonists over the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its association to Grb2 after membrane depolarization. For this, PC12 cells were pretreated with W13 and then the cells were depolarized for 2 and 5 min with 75 mm KCl. The structurally related W12 homologue was included in the experiments to assess the specificity of the W13 effects. Extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Shc antibody that recognizes the 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa isoforms of this protein. Immunoprecipitates were resolved in SDS-PAGE,"

The TSH receptor (TSHR) differs from the latter by the presence of an additional specific segment in the C-terminal part of its ectodomain. We show here that this insertion is excised in the majority of receptor molecules. Preparation of specific monoclonal antibodies to this region, microsequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunoblot studies have provided insight into the mechanisms of this excision. In the human thyroid gland, N termini of the transmembrane receptor β subunit were found to be phenylalanine 366 and leucines 370 and 378. In transfected L cells a variety of other more proximal N termini were found, probably corresponding to incomplete excisions. The most extreme N terminus was observed to lie at Ser-314. These observations suggest that after initial cleavage at Ser-314 the inserted fragment of TSHR is progressively clipped out by a series of cleavage reactions progressing up to amino acids 366–378. The impossibility of recovering the excised fragment from purified receptor, cell membranes, or culture medium supports this interpretation. The cleavage enzyme has previously been shown to be inhibited by BB-2116, an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases. However, we show here that it is unaffected by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases. The cleavage enzyme is very similar to TACE (tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme) in both these characteristics. However, incubation of the TSH receptor with the purified recombinant catalytic domain of TACE, co-transfection of cells with TACE and TSHR expression vectors, and the use of mutated Chinese hamster ovary cells in which TACE is inactive suggested that the TSHR cleavage enzyme is different from TACE.

These were used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments which showed that the TSH receptor in human thyroid membranes underwent a post-translational cleavage event yielding two subunits: a ∼53-kDa α extracellular subunit and a ∼38-kDa broad β membrane spanning subunit. The subunits are held together by disulfide bridges (9Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This maturation is unique among G protein-coupled receptors.In human thyroids, cleavage of the TSHR is almost complete. By contrast, in heterologous transfected cells monomeric uncleaved precursors may also be observed. They consist either of the mature ∼120-kDa uncleaved receptor present on the cell surface or of a ∼95-kDa mannose-rich precursor which can be identified by its sensitivity to specific endoglycosidases (10Misrahi M.

The latter form accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum.The cleavage of the TSHR has been disputed by different authors (11Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B.

Thyroid. 1995; 5: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, due to the low concentration of the TSHR in thyroid tissue, nearly all studies have been performed in transfected cells where the monomeric precursors and specially the mannose-rich form have in many cases been mistaken for the mature receptor. Recently, however, a consensus has emerged and most authors now agree on the existence of a physiological cleavage of the TSH receptor (17Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32209-32213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Graves P.N. Vlase H. Bobovnikova Y. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Very recently the group of Rapoport reported the existence of two cleavage sites in the TSHR extracellular region, suggesting the existence of a third polypeptide fragment (“C peptide” by homology with insulin) released during intramolecular cleavage of the receptor into two subunits (19Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In this work we show that no third fragment of the TSHR is produced during its maturation, but rather that cleavage occurs initially at a first site, followed by the processive digestion and excision of a whole region of the receptor ectodomain. The region which is deleted is located in an additional segment specific to the TSHR which shows no homology with the gonadotropin receptors (5Misrahi M. Loosfelt H. Atger M. Sar S. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, besides the similarities that we had previously observed between pro-TNFα (pro-tumor necrosis factor α) and TSHR convertases (22Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A. Hai M.-T.V. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we provide here new information concerning the protease involved in the maturation of the TSHR and show that it may correspond to a novel enzyme.DISCUSSIONA group of anti-TSHR monoclonal antibodies were obtained which recognized an epitope cleaved-off from the majority of molecules of the mature receptor. This epitope was localized in a specific segment of the TSHR ectodomain characterized by its non-homology with gonadotropin receptors. The excised TSHR fragment was not shed into the cell culture medium, and did not remain associated with the cell membrane or the mature receptor. These observations suggest that the excision produced multiple small undetectable fragments.This hypothesis was confirmed by the determination of TSHR cleavage sites. Mature β subunits were isolated from human thyroid glands and from transfected L cells, and extended β subunits (incompletely processed) were purified from transfected L cells. In transfected cells cleavage of the receptor has previously been shown to be incomplete (10Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Multiple cleavage sites located within the excised region were detected. The most N-terminal site observed was located at Ser-314 while a group of C-terminal sites recognized in thyroid tissue were located at Phe-366, Leu-370 and -378. Furthermore, the existence of a single discrete α subunit in the thyroid, or in transfected L cells, in contrast to the heterogeneity of the β subunits strongly suggested sequential cleavages. A first N-terminal cleavage reaction probably occurs around Ser-314, followed by a series of downstream cleavages up to amino acids 366–378.It has previously been proposed that two cleavage sites in the TSHR extracellular domain release a C peptide by a mechanism similar to the processing of pro-insulin (19Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We show here that no C peptide is actually produced, but that a series of sequential cleavage reactions lead to the excision of this segment of the TSHR ectodomain. The exact location of the TSHR cleavage sites could not be determined by mutagenesis (20Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28296-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Tanaka K. Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1959-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This concords with the hypothesis that several sites, in close proximity to each other, can be cleaved. These could thus be used alternatively if one of them was mutated. The cleavage of β amyloid protein precursor has also been shown to occur at several sites in a region of the precursor close to the cell surface (30Zhong Z. Higaki J. Murakami K. Wang Y. Catalano R. Quon D. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 627-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sequential proteolysis of the tyrosine kinase ErbB4 receptor has been described (31Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, sequential cleavages of the ErbB4 receptor are due both to an exofacial metalloprotease, inhibited by hydroxamic acids, and to the cytoplasmic proteasome (31Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).The cleavage sites within the THSR do not exhibit primary sequence similarity. It is possible that their location is dictated by their position relative to the cell membrane. Indeed, for several membrane proteins cleavage occurs at a site located a fixed distance from the membrane (32Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 33Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev E.E. Batkin M. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Furthermore, mutational analysis has shown a lack of strict sequence specificity for the cleavage of β amyloid precursor protein (32Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), the TNFα receptor (33Brakebusch C. Varfolomeev E.E. Batkin M. Wallach D. J. Biol.

In addition, a mechanism involving a recognition of secondary structure in the juxtamembrane region has been suggested by the domain swap experiments of J. Arribas (38Arribas J. Lopez-Casillas F. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The precise determination of the most N-terminal cleavage site of the TSHR would necessitate the determination of the C-terminal sequence of the α subunit. We have submitted the purified α subunit to cyanogen bromide digestion, chromatographic separation of peptides, and microsequencing. However, the amounts of protein which could be purified have proved insufficient to date to give meaningful results.The TSHR β subunits produced by receptor cleavage are very heterogeneous in size. This is especially true in transfected cells where cleavage is incomplete. But even in human thyroid glands, 25% of receptor molecules undergo incomplete cleavage and are of larger molecular weight. In the majority of receptor molecules the N termini of β subunits cluster from amino acids 366 to 378.We have shown that TSHR cleavage is inhibited by BB-2116 (22Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A. Hai M.-T.V. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a synthetic hydroxamic acid which was initially claimed to inhibit specifically matrix metalloproteases (MMP) (26Gearing A.J.

Wood L.M. Wooley K. Nature. 1994; 370: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). This compound also inhibits the cleavage of pro-TNFα. This led to the conclusion that the enzymes involved in the maturation of TNFα (TACE) and TSHR belong to the MMP family. However, pro-TNFα (28Black R.A. Durie F.H. Otten-Evans C. Miller R. Slack J.L.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that pro-TNFα and TSHR convertases are not bona fide MMPs. Furthermore, TACE has recently been cloned (25Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N.

These enzymes are characterized by the presence of a metalloprotease domain and of a disintegrin domain. The latter may interact with integrins and in some mammalian adamalysins may mediate cell fusion (42Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).The recombinant catalytic domain of TACE failed to cleave immunopurified TSHR at the physiological site. It could be that the correct action of this enzyme depends on its location, and that of its substrate, in the cell membrane. This has proven to be the case for the angiotensin-converting enzyme secretase (43Parvathy S. Oppong S.Y. Karran E.H. Buckle D.R. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility we performed co-transfection experiments with TACE and TSHR expression vectors. However, this did not result in cleavage of the TSHR at the physiological site.Another argument suggesting that TACE and TSHR convertase are different enzymes was provided by the use of a mutant CHO cell line. This cell line is defective in the shedding of several membrane proteins (23Arribas J. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Arribas J. Coodly L.

Fernandez-Larrea J. Reddy P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24955-24962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is not known if the defect is due to the alteration of a single protease that acts on all these proteins, or if it is due to an alteration of a common regulatory mechanism necessary for the activation of several proteases. In either case, these cells do not express active TACE but they do properly cleave the TSHR.We conclude that TACE and TSHR convertases are very likely to be distinct enzymes, although related to each other as shown by their common location at the cell surface, their inhibition by hydroxamic-based metalloprotease inhibitors and their lack of inhibition by TIMPs. Further experiments will be needed to establish the functional role of the cleavage of the TSHR, its possible involvement in receptor autoimmunity, and to identify precisely the corresponding protease.

These were used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments which showed that the TSH receptor in human thyroid membranes underwent a post-translational cleavage event yielding two subunits: a ∼53-kDa α extracellular subunit and a ∼38-kDa broad β membrane spanning subunit. The subunits are held together by disulfide bridges (9Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Jolivet A. Misrahi M. Caillou B. Jamous M. Vannier B. Milgrom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3765-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This maturation is unique among G protein-coupled receptors. In human thyroids, cleavage of the TSHR is almost complete. By contrast, in heterologous transfected cells monomeric uncleaved precursors may also be observed. They consist either of the mature ∼120-kDa uncleaved receptor present on the cell surface or of a ∼95-kDa mannose-rich precursor which can be identified by its sensitivity to specific endoglycosidases (10Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The latter form accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. The cleavage of the TSHR has been disputed by different authors (11Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B.

Thyroid. 1995; 5: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, due to the low concentration of the TSHR in thyroid tissue, nearly all studies have been performed in transfected cells where the monomeric precursors and specially the mannose-rich form have in many cases been mistaken for the mature receptor. Recently, however, a consensus has emerged and most authors now agree on the existence of a physiological cleavage of the TSH receptor (17Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32209-32213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Graves P.N. Vlase H. Bobovnikova Y. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Very recently the group of Rapoport reported the existence of two cleavage sites in the TSHR extracellular region, suggesting the existence of a third polypeptide fragment (“C peptide” by homology with insulin) released during intramolecular cleavage of the receptor into two subunits (19Chazenbalk G.D.

In this work we show that no third fragment of the TSHR is produced during its maturation, but rather that cleavage occurs initially at a first site, followed by the processive digestion and excision of a whole region of the receptor ectodomain. The region which is deleted is located in an additional segment specific to the TSHR which shows no homology with the gonadotropin receptors (5Misrahi M. Loosfelt H. Atger M. Sar S. Guiochon-Mantel A. Milgrom E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, besides the similarities that we had previously observed between pro-TNFα (pro-tumor necrosis factor α) and TSHR convertases (22Couet J. Sar S. Jolivet A. Hai M.-T.V. Milgrom E. Misrahi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4545-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we provide here new information concerning the protease involved in the maturation of the TSHR and show that it may correspond to a novel enzyme. DISCUSSIONA group of anti-TSHR monoclonal antibodies were obtained which recognized an epitope cleaved-off from the majority of molecules of the mature receptor. This epitope was localized in a specific segment of the TSHR ectodomain characterized by its non-homology with gonadotropin receptors. The excised TSHR fragment was not shed into the cell culture medium, and did not remain associated with the cell membrane or the mature receptor. These observations suggest that the excision produced multiple small undetectable fragments.This hypothesis was confirmed by the determination of TSHR cleavage sites. Mature β subunits were isolated from human thyroid glands and from transfected L cells, and extended β subunits (incompletely processed) were purified from transfected L cells. In transfected cells cleavage of the receptor has previously been shown to be incomplete (10Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Multiple cleavage sites located within the excised region were detected. The most N-terminal site observed was located at Ser-314 while a group of C-terminal sites recognized in thyroid tissue were located at Phe-366, Leu-370 and -378. Furthermore, the existence of a single discrete α subunit in the thyroid, or in transfected L cells, in contrast to the heterogeneity of the β subunits strongly suggested sequential cleavages. A first N-terminal cleavage reaction probably occurs around Ser-314, followed by a series of downstream cleavages up to amino acids 366–378.It has previously been proposed that two cleavage sites in the TSHR extracellular domain release a C peptide by a mechanism similar to the processing of pro-insulin (19Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We show here that no C peptide is actually produced, but that a series of sequential cleavage reactions lead to the excision of this segment of the TSHR ectodomain. T"

The subsequent dysregulation of αI(I) collagen gene expression is a central pathogenetic step during the development of cirrhosis. Our recent study in rat HSCs (Davis, B. H., Chen, A., and Beno, D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 11039–11042) found that ERK1,2 activation might be required for maximal αI(I) collagen gene expression. However, the role of the parallel JNK cascade in regulating αI(I) collagen gene expression was unknown. In this study, we initially found that UV irradiation of HSCs activated JNK but not ERK1,2. Furthermore, UV irradiation increased endogenous α I(I) collagen mRNA abundance and stimulated α I(I) collagen gene transcription in HSCs. The effect of the activation of JNK and Jun on α I(I) collagen gene expression was further evaluated via transfection of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmids with various sizes of truncated 5′ upstream promoter sequence (UPS) of the αI(I) collagen gene. This revealed that dominant negative transcription factor JUN suppressed α I(I) collagen gene transcription in HSCs maintained in media with 20% serum and constitutively activated JUN increased αI(I) collagen gene transcription in HSCs cultured in media with 0.4% serum. UV activated JNK utilized a distal GC box in the 5′-UPS of the collagen gene to regulate gene transcription. This observation was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. In co-transfection experiments, the col-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter with a mutagenized GC box was not suppressed by dn-JUN and was not stimulated by activated JUN or by UV irradiation. Southwestern blotting analyses and gel shift assays with basic transcription element-binding protein antiserum suggested that the GC box was bound by basic transcription element-binding protein, a recently described DNA-binding protein. In conclusion, the current study combined with our previous report suggests that ERK1,2 and JNK cascades regulate αI(I) collagen expression in HSCs through different regions of the 5′-UPS of the gene. The distal GC box in the 5′-UPS of the αI(I) collagen gene may play a central role in receiving extracellular signals through the JNK pathway.

Eukaryotic cells have developed specific signal transduction pathways to respond to and integrate extracellular stimuli. Three of these pathways that have been elucidated in eukaryotic cells can be simplified as follows: 1) raf → MEK1,2 → ERK1,2; 2) MEKK1 → SEK1 → JNK/SAPK; and 3) MEKK1 → SEK1 → p38 (1Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In each of these kinase cascade pathways, the upstream kinase phosphorylates and activates its immediate downstream substrate kinase. Extracellular signals are thereby transduced through these cytoplasmic kinase cascades to reach their nuclear targets and regulate gene expression. Recent studies indicate that the raf → ERK1,2 pathway has significant effects on αI(I) collagen gene expression in rat-derived hepatic sinusoidal stellate cells (HSCs),1 the major effector cells during the overproduction of collagen which typifies hepatic fibrogenesis and cirrhosis (2Davis B.H.

Gressner A.M. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 204-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The response elements for the cascade involved a NF-1 site in the proximal promoter of the collagen gene, as well as a region within −1620 to −1630 in the distal promoter of the αI(I) collagen gene (2Davis B.H. Chen A. Beno D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11039-11042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The importance of the NF-1 site in regulating collagen gene expression is in agreement with other studies using non-HSCs (6Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. Veloz L.

Activated JNK can phosphorylate and activate its target protein, JUN, and transduce a signal from cytoplasm to nucleus (10Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birre M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar, 11Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

JNKs are activated by a variety of stimuli, such as UV irradiation, heat shock, and osmotic imbalance (14Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2947) Google Scholar, 15Shapiro P.S. Evans J.N. Davis R.J. Posada J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5750-5754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HSCs have been shown to contain the JNK cascade, which can be activated by fibronectin, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (16Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Bisceglie A.M.D. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are classic compounds associated with tissue injury and may also be present in serum (16Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Bisceglie A.M.D. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current report studied the effects of UV irradiation of HSCs on activation of JNK and on αI(I) collagen gene expression. It was found that exposure of HSCs to UV light activated JNK but not ERK1,2, and the activation of JNK by UV irradiation increased αI(I) collagen mRNA abundance. Further studies indicated that activated JNK regulated αI(I) collagen gene expression through a distal GC box located in the 5′-UPS of the αI(I) collagen gene. This response element was distinct from that utilized by the ERK1,2 cascade. A 32-kDa protein, designated basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB), was found to bind to the GC box. BTEB DNA binding activity was up-regulated in activated stellate cells. The potential mechanism(s) utilized by UV-induced activation of JNK to stimulate αI(I) collagen gene transcription is further discussed.DISCUSSIONThe sinusoidal HSCs represent the major effector cells during hepatic fibrogenesis. During this process, the normal quiescent, vitamin A-storing HSCs transform into actively proliferating, collagen-producing cells. The HSCs excessive collagen matrix production and increased cellular proliferation lead to the collagenization and disruption of the space of Disse and formation of the fibrous septae seen in cirrhosis. Eukaryotic cells have developed specific signal transduction pathways to respond to and integrate extracellular stimuli. A recent study of HSCs found that fibronectin and tumor necrosis factor α activated both JNK and ERK1,2 and increased AP-1 DNA binding ability and α I(I) collagen mRNA abundance (16Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Bisceglie A.M.D. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, that study could not clearly indicate the effects of JNK or ERK1,2 on α(I) collagen gene expression because fibronectin and tumor necrosis factor α activated both pathways. Our previous studies found that activation of ERK1,2 induced by serum was important for the maximal expression of αI(I) collagen gene in passaged HSCs (2Davis B.H. Chen A. Beno D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11039-11042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The function of activated JNK in regulating αI(I) collagen gene expression was studied in the present report. It was found that UV irradiation activated JNKs, but not ERK1,2 (Fig. 1 A) and that UV irradiation increased endogenous αI(I) collagen mRNA abundance in passaged HSCs (Fig. 1 B). Both activated ERK1,2 and activated JNK have the capacity to translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate transcription factors (31Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 32Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). The current transfection studies indicated that activated JNK induced by UV irradiation increased the ability of AP-1 to induce gene transcription in HSCs (Fig. 2 A). Additional studies suggested that the active form of JUN increased αI(I) collagen gene transcription (Fig.2 B) and, as expected, dominant negative JUN inhibited αI(I) collagen gene transcription in cultured HSCs (Fig.2 C). The response element mediating UV induction of αI(I) collagen gene expression was located in a distal GC box in the 5′-UPS of the collagen gene.A previous study found that an AP-1 binding site in the first intron of the αI(I) collagen gene played a critical role in the stimulation of the αI(I) collagen gene by transforming growth factor (TGFβ) (33Armendariz-Borunda A. Simkevich C.P. Roy N. Raghow R. Kang A.H. Seyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another recent report indicated that the first intron of the αI(I) collagen gene had a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated function in transcription of the gene (34Hormuzdi S.G. Penttinen R. Jaenisch R. Bornstein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, HSCs transfected with plasmid p1.7/1.6 or p1.7 (GC box mut)/1.6 showed significant differences in the CAT activity in their responses to dominant negative JUN (Fig. 3 A), to the constitutively active form of JUN (Fig. 3 B), and to UV irradiation (Fig.3 C). All of these experiments utilized plasmids containing the intact wild-type AP-1 binding site in the first intron. The only difference between the two plasmids was the distal GC box in the 5′-UPS. Five nucleotides inside the GC box were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis in the plasmid p1.7 (GC box mut)/1.6. The current study does not support the contention that the AP-1 binding site in the first intron is directly involved in the induction of αI(I) collagen gene transcription by exposure of HSCs to UV light. Further studies demonstrated that the GC box in the 5′-UPS of the αI(I) collagen gene was bound by BTEB, a recently described GC box DNA-binding protein. A GC box sequence could be bound by either Sp-1 or BTEB (26Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). BTEB does not share sequence similarity to Sp-1, except for a zinc finger domain of Cys-Cys/His-His motif that is repeated three times with 72% sequence similarity to Sp-1. The study by Imatakaet al. (24Chen A. Beno D.W.A. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25994-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggested that BTEB exerted different effects on gene transcription with differing numbers and positions of the GC box sequence in the promoter region. Further studies are needed to understand the relationship between BTEB functions and flanking nucleotides of the GC box. It is likely that BTEB binding to the GC box plays a role in regulating αI(I) collagen gene expression because 1) the GC box plays a contributory role in stimulating αI(I) collagen gene expression (see Fig. 3), 2) BTEB appears to be the major protein binding to the GC box at periods of increased αI(I) collagen gene expression (Fig. 4), and 3) the appearance of BTEB was coincident with activation of HSCs in both in vitro and in vivosettings as demonstrated by the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Additional studies are needed, such as co-transfections of HSCs with colCAT plasmids and BTEB overexpression construct and experiments involving BTEB overexpression and the measurement of endogenous collagen gene expression in stable transfectants in non-HSC models. There is little known about BTEB gene expression and regulation, and its relationship to fibrosis and liver injury remains unclear. One speculation is that activation of JNK and subsequent activation of JUN directly transduces signals to the promoter of the BTEB gene through JUN-JUN dimerization and then BTEB gene expression is stimulated. BTEB could then bind to the GC box in the 5′-UPS of the α I(I) collagen gene and stimulate gene transcription. These speculations will require further studies. Eukaryotic cells have developed specific signal transduction pathways to respond to and integrate extracellular stimuli. Three of these pathways that have been elucidated in eukaryotic cells can be simplified as follows: 1) raf → MEK1,2 → ERK1,2; 2) MEKK1 → SEK1 → JNK/SAPK; and 3) MEKK1 → SEK1 → p38 (1Treisman R. Curr.

HSCs have been shown to contain the JNK cascade, which can be activated by fibronectin, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (16Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Bisceglie A.M.D. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are classic compounds associated with tissue injury and may also be present in serum (16Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Bisceglie A.M.D. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current report studied the effects of UV irradiation of HSCs on activation of JNK and on αI(I) collagen gene expression. It was found that exposure of HSCs to UV light activated JNK but not ERK1,2, and the activation of JNK by UV irradiation increased αI(I) collagen mRNA abundance. Further studies indicated that activated JNK regulated αI(I) collagen gene expression through a distal GC box located in the 5′-UPS of the αI(I) collagen gene. This response element was distinct from that utilized by the ERK1,2 cascade. A 32-kDa protein, designated basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB), was found to bind to the GC box. BTEB DNA binding activity was up-regulated in activated stellate cells. The potential mechanism(s) utilized by UV-induced activation of JNK to stimulate αI(I) collagen gene transcription is further discussed. DISCUSSIONThe sinusoidal HSCs represent the major effector cells during hepatic fibrogenesis. During this process, the normal quiescent, vitamin A-storing HSCs transform into actively proliferating, collagen-producing cells. The HSCs excessive collagen matrix production and increased cellular proliferation lead to the collagenization and disruption of the space of Disse and formation of the fibrous septae seen in cirrhosis. Eukaryotic cells have developed specific signal transduction pathways to respond to and integrate extracellular stimuli. A recent study of HSCs found that fibronectin and tumor necrosis factor α activated both JNK and ERK1,2 and increased AP-1 DNA binding ability and α I(I) collagen mRNA abundance (16Poulos J.E. Weber J.D. Bellezzo J.M. Bisceglie A.M.D. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Baldassare J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G804-G811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, that study could not clearly indicate the effects of JNK or ERK1,2 on α(I) collagen gene expression because fibronectin and tumor necrosis factor α activated both pathways. Our previous studies found that activation of ERK1,2 induced by serum was important for the maximal expression of αI(I) collagen gene in passaged HSCs (2Davis B.H. Chen A. Beno D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11039-11042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The function of activated JNK in regulating αI(I) collagen gene expression was studied in the present report. It was found that UV irradiation activated JNKs, but not ERK1,2 (Fig. 1 A) and that UV irradiation increased endogenous αI(I) collagen mRNA abundance in passaged HSCs (Fig. 1 B). Both activated ERK1,2 and activated JNK have the capacity to translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate transcription factors (31Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 32Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar). The current transfection studies indicated that activated JNK induced by UV irradiation increased the ability of AP-1 to induce gene transcription in HSCs (Fig. 2 A). Additional studies suggested that the active form of JUN increased αI(I) collagen gene transcription (Fig.2 B) and, as expected, dominant negative JUN inhibited αI(I) collagen gene transcription in cultured HSCs (Fig.2 C). The response element mediating UV induction of αI(I) collagen gene expression was located in a distal GC box in the 5′-UPS of the collagen gene.A previous study found that an AP-1 binding site in the first intron of the αI(I) collagen gene played a critical role in the stimulation of the αI(I) collagen gene by transforming growth factor (TGFβ) (33Armendariz-Borunda A. Simkevich C.P. Roy N. Raghow R. Kang A.H. Seyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another recent report indicated that the first intron of the αI(I) collagen gene had a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated function in transcription of the gene (34Hormuzdi S.G. Penttinen R. Jaenisch R. Bornstein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3368-3375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, HSCs transfected with plasmid p1.7/1.6 or p1.7 (GC box mut)/1.6 showed significant differences in the CAT activity in their responses to dominant negative JUN (Fig. 3 A), to the constitutively active form of JUN (Fig. 3 B), and to UV irradiation (Fig.3 C). All of these experiments utilized plasmids containing the intact wild-type AP-1 binding site in the first intron. The only difference between the two plasmids was the distal GC box in the 5′-UPS. Five nucleotides inside the GC box were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis in the plasmid p1.7 (GC box mut)/1.6. The current study does not support the contention that the AP-1 binding site in the first intron is directly involved in the induction of αI(I) collagen gene transcription by exposure of HSCs to UV light. Further studies demonstrated that the GC box in the 5′-UPS of the αI(I) collagen gene was bound by BTEB, a recently described GC box DNA-binding protein. A GC box sequence could be bound by either Sp-1 or BTEB (26Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). BTEB does not share sequence similarity to Sp-1, except for a zinc finger domain of Cys-Cys/His-His motif that is repeated three times with 72% sequence similarity to Sp-1. The study by Imatakaet al. (24Chen A. Beno D.W.A. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25994-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggested that BTEB exerted different effects on gene transcription with differing numbers and positions of the GC box sequence in the promoter region. Further studies are needed to understand the relationship between BTEB functions and flanking nucleotides of the GC box. It is likely that BTEB binding to the GC box plays a role in regulating αI(I) collagen gene expression because 1) the GC box plays a contributory role in stimulating αI(I) collagen gene expression (see Fig. 3), 2) BTEB appears to be the major protein binding to the GC box at periods of increased αI(I) collagen gene expression (Fig. 4), and 3) the appearance of BTEB was coincident with activation of HSCs in both in vitro and in vivosettings as demonstrated by the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Additional studies are needed, such as co-transfections of HSCs with colCAT plasmids and BTEB overexpression construct and experiments involving BTEB overexpression and the measurement of endogenous collagen gene expression in stable transfectants in non-HSC models. There is little known about BTEB gene expression and regulation, and its relationship to fibrosis and liver injury remains unclear. One speculation is that activation of JNK and subsequent activation of JUN directly transduces signals to the promoter of the BTEB gene through JUN-JUN dimerization and then BTEB gene expression is stimulated. BTEB could then bind to the GC box in the 5′-UPS of the α I(I) collagen gene and stimulate gene transcription. These speculations will require further studies.

https://openalex.org/W2037564173,"Calcium-binding S100 proteins are thought to play a central role in calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. They consist of two helix-loop-helix, calcium-binding EF-hand domains. A characteristic feature is their tendency to form homo- and/or heterodimeric complexes. This report presents for the first time a functional “in vivo” approach to the analysis of S100 protein dimerization. Using the two-hybrid system we analyzed the dimerization of MRP8 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9), two S100 proteins expressed in myeloid cells. It is reported that the MRP8-MRP14 heteromer is the clearly preferred complex in both man and mouse. The ability to homodimerize, however, appears to be restricted to the murine MRPs. Interaction analysis of chimeric murine/human MRP14 proteins indicates, that the C-terminal EF-hand domain plays a prominent role in MRP8-MRP14 interaction and determines the specificity of dimerization. Site-directed mutagenesis of four evolutionary conserved hydrophobic amino acids, which have been recently supposed to be essential for S100 protein dimerization, suggests that at least one of these, namely the most N-terminal located residue, is not critical for dimerization.

S100 proteins comprise a family of low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins, which are specifically expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types. It is thought that they are primarily involved in Ca2+-mediated signal transduction. Changes in intracellular calcium levels alter the structure and function of these proteins. However, the specific functions of individual members of the S100 protein family in cell metabolism are not yet clear. They have been frequently described in association with cell growth and differentiation, with cell cycle regulation and with several human diseases as cancer and skin disorders (see Refs. 1Niki I. Yokokura H. Sudo T. Kato M. Hidaka H.J. J. Biochem . (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem.

Recent investigations have given much emphasis on the structure of S100 proteins (5Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1041-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The primary sequence, around 90–100 amino acids long, consists of two calcium-binding EF-hand domains bridged by a so called hinge region. Particularly the sequences of the N-terminal 14-amino acid variant EF-hand and the 12-amino acid C-terminal invariant EF-hand are highly conserved within the family and among family members of different species (3Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 4Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of calcyclin (S100A6), a typical S100 protein, has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (5Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1041-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These data revealed, that a single monomer is composed of two calcium-binding helix-loop-helix motifs and forms a globular monomer containing four helices (helix I, II, III, and IV). Two monomers are oriented in an antiparallel fashion forming a noncovalent antiparallel homodimer. Dimerization, which is a characteristic feature for the S100 proteins, appears to be mediated by several evolutionary conserved hydrophobic residues located in helix I and IV, which contribute to the dimer interface. This interface has been called a homodimeric fold and appears to be unique among calcium-binding proteins (5Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1041-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The dimeric complex is widely regarded as the biologically active form of most S100 proteins. The S100 proteins MRP8 and MRP14 (calgranulin A and B; S100A8 and S100A9) are expressed in myeloid cells and in epithelial cells like keratinocytes upon inflammatory activation (see Refs. 4Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 7Sorg C. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1992; 91: 126-137PubMed Google Scholar, and 8Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, for review). There is overwhelming evidence that they are involved in inflammatory processes (4Hessian P.A. Edgeworth J. Hogg N. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1993; 53: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 7Sorg C. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1992; 91: 126-137PubMed Google Scholar, 9Odink K. Cerletti N. Brüggen J. Clerc R.G. Tarcsay L. Zwadlo G. Gerhards G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Nature. 1997; 330: 80-82Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar). On the amino acid level the sequences show 60% homology among different species (10Lagasse E. Weissman I.L. Blood. 1992; 79: 1907-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the conserved amino acid sequence, the structural similarities, their tissue-specific expression pattern, and their ability to form dimeric complexes (11Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) they are regarded as typical members of the S100 protein family. MRP8 and MRP14 represent an ideal model system to study the dimerization of S100 proteins. MRP8 and MRP14 homologues are known from a number of species, which facilitate the identification of important residues by sequence comparison and “domain swap” experiments. Additionally, a naturally occurring “deletion derivative” is known from human MRP14, the so-called MRP14* isoform, which is 4 amino acids shorter using a second ATG encoding methionine at position 5 as alternative translational start site (12van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, different MRP14 isoforms were observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in murine cells. 1J. Roth, unpublished data. With respect to the biological relevance of these isoforms it might be interesting to know whether the dimerization properties of the two proteins are different. Last, these S100 proteins are members of a subgroup of the S100 family, which are all coexpressed in the myeloid cell lineage as well as in activated and/or fetal keratinocytes. Beside MRP8 and MRP14 two other proteins belong to this group, namely human S100A12 (homologous to bovine CAAF1) (13Wicki R. Marenholz I. Mischke D. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Yamamura T. Hitomi J. Nagasaki K. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Saito S. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and psoriasin (S100A7, homologous to bovine CAAF2) (15Hitomi J. Maruyama K. Kikuchi Y. Nagasaki K. Yamaguchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Leffers H. Honore B. Dejgaard K. Olsen E. Kiil J. Walbum E. Andersen A.H. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Ratz G.P. Celis A. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 701-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these four S100 proteins are expressed by the same cells and are structurally highly homologous, they do not randomly interact with each other. Despite the potential biological relevance of the interaction specificity nothing is known about how this specificity is mediated in S100 proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system (17Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) this report presents evidence that the C-terminal domain of S100 proteins is primarily involved in protein-protein dimerization. The results are discussed with respect to recently published structural data (6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and may have implications for S100 proteins in general. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2-amplified cDNA fragments encoding the entire murine and human MRP's were fused in-frame to either the DNA-binding domain or activation domain of yeast plasmids pAS2-1 or pACT2 (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Vector pAS2-1 encodes the C-terminal GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1 to 147) and the TRP1 selection marker. pACT2 encodes the N-terminal acidic GAL4 activation domain (amino acids 768 to 881) and the LEU2 selection marker. To facilitate directional cloning of the PCR products into the yeast expression vectors the 5′-primers contained either a NcoI orNdeI restriction site and the 3-primer contained aBamHI restriction site. This resulted in the in-frame fusion of each MRP to the 3′ end of either the GAL4 (1–147) DNA-binding domain (pAS2–1), or the GAL4 (768–881) activation domain (pACT2). To construct a vector encoding a chimeric S100A12/mMRP14 a PCR fragment of the N-terminal domain of human S100A12 was generated, which contained an EcoRI site at the 3′ end. The murine MRP14 fragment was restricted with EcoRI (human S100A12 amino acid lysine, position 32, murine MRP14 position 39, amino acid phenylalanine) before ligation (Fig. 1). The chimeric murine/human MRP14 encoding constructs hm14-pAS2-1 and mh14-pAS2-1 were also cloned by enzymatic restriction of the PCR-amplified fragments of human MRP14 and murine MRP14 with EcoRI and subsequent ligation of the fragments. The desired chimeric fragments were isolated via PCR with the corresponding primers and cloned into pAS2-1 (Fig.1). Deletion mutants (Fig. 2) were cloned into the pAS2-1 yeast expression vectors as described above. The deletions were generated by PCR using the murine MRP14 cDNA as template and the corresponding primer pairs. Amino acid substitutions located at the very ends of the MRP14 molecule were generated by using mutated primers for the PCR reaction. Construction of the internal MRP14 substitution mutants (Fig. 2) were achieved with the QuickChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg). Briefly, two oligonucleotide primers, which encode the mutation and are complementary to each other, extend the entire plasmid during temperature cycling by means of Pfu DNA polymerase. Parental DNA was digested with DpnI endonuclease (target sequence: 5′-Gm6ATC-3′), while the unmethylated PCR-amplified DNA could not be restricted by DpnI. The PCR-generated plasmid DNA was then transformed into Escherichia coli and the inserts of several clones analyzed. The integrity of all constructs has been verified by sequence analysis. To exclude nonspecific interactions, each vector was also solely transformed into yeast. Additionally, yeast containing human or murine MRP8 and MRP14 encoding vectors and the corresponding two-hybrid vector encoding human S100A12 were transformed as negative control. Transformation was performed by the high-efficiency lithium acetate method modified by Gietz et al. (20Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar) using yeast strain Y190 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–20, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4D, gal80D, cyhr2, LYS2::Gal1UAS-His3TATA-His3, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ). Generally, vectors were sequentially transformed into yeast. A human leukocyte MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH) was transformed into yeast Y190 carrying human MRP14 as bait. Screening procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blue colonies were isolated, inserts amplified via PCR, and sequenced according to standard methods. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed on plates and in liquid following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Colony filter lifts were performed by submersion of nitrocellulose transfer membranes lifted from each plate into liquid. Subsequently filters were incubated at 30 °C for up to 8 h upon Whatman filter paper, which was presoaked in Z-buffer (60 mmol/liter Na2HPO4 × 7H2O, 40 mmol/liter NaH2PO4H2O, 10 mmol/liter KCl, and 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, pH 7.0) supplemented with 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol and 1.67% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside in 100-mm Petri dishes. To evaluate the β-galactosidase activity quantitatively, a single yeast colony was inoculated into 5 ml of SD medium without tryptophan and leucine and agitated overnight at 30 °C. Then, 2 ml were added to 8 ml of YPD liquid and grown until the OD600 was 0.5 to 0.7. The yeast cells were processed for quantification of β-galactosidase activity following the CLONTECHprotocol. Briefly, 1.5 ml of the culture was centrifuged, resuspended in Z-buffer, and the cells were lysed. SubsequentlyO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the protein extract, incubated at 30 °C, and the OD420 was measured. The β-galactosidase activity is expressed in units according to Miller (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Calculations were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH), also described by Ausubel et al. (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. J. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). At least five independent colonies per mutant were measured; mean values and standard errors were calculated. Differences between values, which were above background (S100A12 as negative control), but below 10 units were not quantitatively interpreted. In order to confirm that each desired fusion protein was properly expressed in yeast, Western blot analysis with the appropriate GAL4 mAb were performed. The GAL4 activation domain and GAL4 DNA-binding domain monoclonal antibodies (CLONTECH), which bind specifically to the major activation domain (amino acid 768–881) or the DNA-binding domain (amino acid 1–147) of the GAL4 protein, were used. The preparation of yeast protein extracts and performing of the Western blot followed the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). For immunodetection an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was used. The yeast two-hybrid system (17Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar) was used to investigate the interaction between MRP8 and MRP14 qualitatively and quantitatively. Both human MRP8 and MRP14 and murine MRP8 and MRP14 coding regions were cloned in-frame with the corresponding GAL domains of the two-hybrid vectors. Additionally, the coding region of the human S100A12 cDNA was cloned in-frame with the GAL-activating domain serving as a negative control. We could not detect any Gal activity (values <1 unit) with any mutant or wild type MRP alone or in combination with S100A12. Furthermore, Western blot experiments with protein extracts from yeast clones containing the constructs described below could confirm the integrity of the construct and proved the proper expression of the fusion proteins (data not shown). Analysis of all possible combinations of MRP8 and MRP14 encoding plasmids revealed that the heterodimerization of MRP14/MRP8 is strongly preferred over any homodimerization. This was true for both the human and murine MRP proteins. Surprisingly, human and murine MRPs appear to behave differently with respect to homodimerization. The mouse MRP8 and MRP14 readily form homodimeric molecules, although this interaction was significantly weaker than the heterodimeric complex formation. We could not detect homodimerization of the human MRPs (Fig. 3). To test the possibility that human MRP14 may interact with so far unknown MRP14 isoforms, deletion derivatives, or other members of the S100 family, which occur in leukocytes, a leukocyte library was screened to search for such human MRP14 interacting proteins. Sixteen blue colonies were analyzed in detail and all of them encoded the human MRP8 protein. The amino acid sequence of the MRP8 and MRP14 proteins are highly homologous to each other among mouse and man. We therefore examined whether mouse and human MRPs are able to form hybrid heterodimers. We could neither detect human MRP8-murine MRP14 nor murine MRP8-human MRP14 nor any hybrid homodimeric complex formation. Thus, the structural difference is obviously big enough to prevent any protein-protein contact between a human and murine MRP. To investigate which region of the MRP14 protein determines the specificity of protein-protein interaction, we constructed chimeric mouse/human MRP14 molecules (Fig. 1). The hmMRP14 (N-terminal domain human/C-terminal domain murine) interacts with murine MRP8 and murine MRP14, but not with any human MRP. On the other side the mhMRP14 (N-terminal murine/C-terminal human) complexed with human MRP8, but we could neither detect any significant β-galactosidase activity with human MRP14 nor with the murine MRPs (Fig. 4). Thus mhMRP14 behaved like a human MRP14 and hmMRP14 like a murine MRP14 with respect to their dimerization specificity. Surprisingly, the complex stability of the chimeric molecules with wild type MRP14 or MRP8, respectively, was only slightly reduced compared with stability of the wild type MRP14 hetero- or homodimer (TableI). A human S100A12/murine MRP14 chimeric molecule did not dimerize with any human or murine MRP.Table IQuantitative analysis of MRP8-MRP14 interactionVector encoding GAL4-DNA-BDVector encoding GAL4-ADmMRP8mMRP14β-GAL units%β-GAL units%mMRP1492 ± 20100 ± 2228 ± 1030 ± 11mMRP832 ± 935 ± 10109 ± 17118 ± 18mMRP14 (1–101)37 ± 1240 ± 1314 ± 415 ± 4mMRP14 (1–85)<1<1<1<1mMRP14 (1–69)<1<1<1<1mMRP14 (9–113)20 ± 922 ± 1012 ± 313 ± 3mMRP14-I17A23 ± 825 ± 96 ± 27 ± 2mMRP14-F20A4 ± 14 ± 1<1<1mMRP14-F89A2 ± 12 ± 1<1<1mMRP14-L95A<1<1<1<1mhMRP142 ± 12 ± 1<1<1hmMRP1464 ± 1070 ± 1116 ± 417 ± 4S100A12mMRP142 ± 12 ± 1<1<1S100A12<1<1<1<1Vector encoding GAL4-ADhMRP8hMRP14β-GAL units%β-GAL units%hMRP1484 ± 13100 ± 154 ± 15 ± 1hMRP87 ± 48 ± 589 ± 8106 ± 10hMRP14-C3S18 ± 621 ± 72 ± 12 ± 1hMRP14 (5–114)16 ± 519 ± 62 ± 12 ± 1mhMRP1452 ± 858 ± 92 ± 12 ± 1hmMRP142 ± 12 ± 13 ± 14 ± 1S100A12mMRP14<1<1<1<1S100A12<1<1<1<1Overview about β-galactosidase activities of all combinations, which were tested for homo- and heterodimerization in the two-hybrid system.

To investigate the role of the C- and N-terminal residues, a number of deletion constructs were tested in the yeast system. Deletions of the N-terminal 8 amino acids of murine MRP14 reduced the stability of the interaction (Fig. 2), but complex formation was still detectable. This deletion mutant corresponds to a potential murine MRP14* isoform. The corresponding deletion mutant was also tested for the naturally occurring human MRP14* isoform, which is 4 amino acids shorter using a second methionine in position 5 as translational start site. Deletion of these four N-terminal amino acids of the human MRP14 also did not abolish the interaction with MRP8, but again significantly decreased β-galactosidase activity. A single amino acid exchange at position 3 from cysteine to serine (C3S) led to a nearly identical reduction of interaction intensity (Table I). A set of C-terminal deletions was constructed (Fig. 2). It is known that the MRP14 molecule contains a C-terminal tail of about 12 amino acids, which is unusual among S100 proteins. A deletion of these 12 C-terminal amino acids in murine MRP14 weakened, but did not inhibit homo- or heterodimerization. Further deletions, however, namely mMRP14 (1–85) and mMRP14 (1–69), which affect helix IV located in the C-terminal EF-hand domain, completely destroyed the ability to interact with mMRP8 or mMRP14 (Fig. 2). Recent publications investigated the dimeric structure of S100 protein calcyclin via NMR spectroscopy (6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based upon these data a limited number of evolutionary conserved amino acid residues in helix I and IV seem to be responsible for the S100 protein dimerization. To investigate the functional relevance of these residues several murine MRP14 mutants were constructed by exchanging single amino acids (Fig. 2): phenylalanine at position 89 to alanine (F89A), leucine at position 95 to alanine (I95A), isoleucine at position 17 to alanine (I17A), and phenylalanine at position 20 to alanine (F20A). Each amino acid exchange resulted in a dramatic decrease or complete loss of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2). Only mutant (I17A) was still able to dimerize significantly with MRP8 (Table I). Complex formation is regarded to be an essential prerequisite for the biological functions of S100 proteins. We therefore used the two-hybrid system to analyze the dimerization of the S100 proteins MRP8 and MRP14. In contrast to the recently published data, which describe the biophysical structure of S100 proteins in detail (6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21Hunter M.J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12427-12435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) the two-hybrid system allows a functional “in vivo” approach to the molecular analysis of S100 dimers. Numerous studies have shown that the two-hybrid system can be used to characterize and/or detect protein-protein interactions (22Luban J. Goff S.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This report demonstrates that it may also complement and enlarge our knowledge about the S100 protein dimerization. We investigated the interaction between the murine and human MRP8 and MRP14. Evidence is presented that heterodimerization is strongly preferred to homodimerization in both species. This is in good agreement with previous data, which suggest that the human MRPs form preferentially heterodi- and –oligomers (11Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biophysical data confirm, that there is a “unique complementarity in the interface of human MRP8-MRP14 complex that cannot be fully reproduced in the MRP8 and MRP14 homodimers” (21Hunter M.J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12427-12435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the formation of homodimers could be demonstrated in vitro, if only one MRP species is used. In mixtures of both proteins the heterodimer is at least preferred 10:1 (21Hunter M.J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12427-12435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). According to our data, it seems questionable, whether in vivo human MRP homodimers occur at all. Murine MRPs are able to associate to homodimers, although the stability of the homodimeric complexes is markedly reduced compared with the heterodimer (Table I). This difference in homodimerization behavior between human and murine MRPs is unexpected, because the primary structure of the MRPs of both species is highly homologous. It would be interesting to find out which structural property of the murine MRPs provides the necessary flexibility that enables both homodimerization and heterodimerization. In the case of murine MRP8, homodimerization could recently be verified in vitro by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and cross-linking experiments. Unfortunately, heterodimerization was not investigated in this report (23Raferty M.J. Geczy C.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1998; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We conclude, that also in mouse the heteromer is the naturally occurring form at least in cells, which express both MRPs. Nevertheless the difference between human and murine MRP8/MRP14 dimerization characteristics suggests, that there are not only structural, but also functional differences. In this context it is worth noting that the murine MRP8 displays a strong chemotactic activity on myeloid cells (24Lackmann M. Rajasekariah P. Iismaa S.E. Jones G. Cornish C.J. Hu S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2981-2991PubMed Google Scholar), a property which has not been observed with human MRP8. It needs further investigation to clarify the structural basis and a potential functional relevance of this difference between human and murine MRPs. A comparison of the primary structure of S100 proteins reveals that the MRP14 sequence contains a C-terminal tail, which is unique among S100 proteins (Fig. 2). It was speculated that this glycine and histidine-rich peptide sequence is involved in target protein recognition and subsequent to phosphorylation might exhibit neutrophil immobilizing activity (25Edgeworth J. Freemont P. Hogg N. Nature. 1989; 342: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To study the influence of this moiety on dimerization a set of C-terminal deletion experiments were carried out. The deletion of the terminal 12 residues containing the His/Gly-rich tail does not prevent murine MRP14 homo- and heterodimerization. Further deletions which affect helix IV completely abolish MRP interaction confirming the importance of this region for MRP complex formation. This result implies that the unique tail is not essential for MRP14/MRP8 association, and may argue for the hypothesis that this region might be involved in interaction with target protein(s) other than MRP8. There is a second MRP14 form present in human myeloid cells, the so-called MRP14* isoform lacking four N-terminal amino acids. It was speculated that MRP14* may fulfil different biological functions (12van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion experiments reported here demonstrate that the naturally occurring human MRP14* (MRP14 (5–114)) is able to dimerize with human MRP8. However, complex stability is reduced (Table I). The analysis of the mutant MRP14 C3S implicates that the cysteine at position 3 of the full size MRP14 is involved in complex formation (Table I). This finding is surprising since other studies demonstrate that disulfide bridges do not contribute to the S100 complex formation (11Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hunter M.J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12427-12435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, the N-terminal deleted murine MRP14, the potential murine MRP14*, is also able to form homo- and heterodimers. The murine MRP14 N terminus does not encode a cysteine. Whether the reduced stability may be of biological relevance remains to be clarified. We conclude that neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal residues of MRP14 are critical for the quality of MRP dimerization. Despite their structural similarity the murine and human MRPs are not able to interact across species borders. Analysis of chimeric mouse/human MRPs indicate that the C-terminal domain determines the specificity of interaction with respect to species specificity as well as homodimerization characteristics (Fig. 4). Even the intensity of protein-protein association is only slightly weaker using the chimeric molecules (Table I). The chimeric human S100A12/murine MRP14 molecule did not dimerize with MRPs in yeast, suggesting that not any N-terminal S100 domain can substitute the homologous one. Structural models indicate that several conserved hydrophobic residues located in both the N-terminal EF-hand domain (helix I) and the C-terminal EF-hand domain (helix IV) mediate the S100 dimer formation (6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Consequently, we mutated the corresponding amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3). The analysis of three of these mutants, F20A, F89A, and L95A, seems to confirm the importance of these residues. Only with mutant I17A could a considerable β-galactosidase activity (20 units) be detected in the assay (Table I). Thus, one of these evolutionary conserved residues located in the C-terminal domain which were recently identified by NMR spectroscopy to be directly involved in S100 protein-protein association (6Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is not essential for MRP8-MRP14 complex formation. The data obtained with the chimeric MRP14 and the single amino acid substitutions suggest that the structural prerequisites for dimerization seem to be far more relaxed for the N-terminal domain of S100 proteins. We conclude, that the C-terminal domain, most likely residues of helix IV, determines the specificity of interaction and is the critical domain for S100 protein dimerization. We thank B. W. Schafer for providing the S100A12 cDNA clone. T. Vogl, C. Kerkhoff, F. Schönlau, and M. Klempt for critical reading the manuscript and helpful discussions."

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), subunit e, like subunit g, has not been identified yet in the purified ATP synthase enzyme. A yeast homologue to bovine subunit F6 (19Fang J.-K. Jacobs J.W. Kanner B.I. Racker E. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6603-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) so far has not been reported. Conversely, a novel subunit, subunit h, has been found recently in yeast ATP synthase (20Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20284-20290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which appears not to be related to any of the known subunits of bovine or other ATP synthases. The experiments described in this paper focus on the reassessment of the polypeptide composition of the yeast ATP synthase using a different isolation technique, namely blue native electrophoresis (BN-PAGE).2 BN-PAGE is a microscale technique for the separation of the multiprotein complexes of oxidative phosphorylation directly from isolated mitochondrial membranes (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Combined with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in a second dimension, an overview on the protein subunits of all oxidative phosphorylation complexes is obtained in a two-dimensional gel (22Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Using this two-dimensional electrophoretic technique, we observed in the ATP synthase the presence of a previously undetected protein in the 6–7-kDa range. N-terminal protein sequencing revealed it to be a novel subunit of the ATP synthase, subunit j (Su j). Su j is encoded by a gene termed here ATP18 and has no apparent bovine counterpart. Aminocaproic acid (6-aminohexanoic acid) and imidazole were from Fluka, Tricine and Serva Blue G (Coomassie Blue G-250) were from Serva, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite was prepared as described recently (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Schägger H. A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 107-124Crossref Google Scholar). For construction of the Δsu j::HIS3 yeast strain, introduction of the HIS3 gene resulting in a partial deletion and disruption of the ATP18/Su j gene was performed as follows. The HIS3 gene was amplified from the plasmid pFA6a-HIS3MX6 (24Wach A. Brachat A. Poehlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar) using the following primers: S1, 5′-GTTTAACATACGACGACAGATTAATTGATTGGATTGTACTGCCATGCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides −43 to +3 of theATP18/Su j gene locus and 18 nucleotides of the multiple cloning site of pFA6a-HIS3MX6 from the 5′ flanking region of the HIS3 gene); and S2, 5′-TGGATCATTGATAAATTCCTTCGTGTTAGAAGAAAGGTCAGCAGCATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides +90 to +132 of theATP18/Su j gene and 19 nucleotides of the multiple cloning site of pFA6a-HIS3MX6 from the 3′ flanking region of the HIS3 gene). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was transformed into the haploid yeast strain W303-1A using the lithium acetate method (25Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar), and HIS3 positive clones were selected. Correct integration of the HIS3 marker into theATP18/Su j locus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides that primed upstream and downstream of the disrupted ATP18 gene. The resulting yeast strain Δsu j, the corresponding wild-type W303-1A, and Δsu f were grown in YPGal medium supplemented with 0.5% lactate at 30 °C (26Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,800 × g, washed three times with sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm6-aminohexanoic acid, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0), and used directly for preparation of mitochondrial membranes. About 5 g (wet weight) of sedimented cells, 5 ml of glass beads (0.25–0.5 mm), and 5 ml of sucrose buffer were vortexed for 10 min in a 50-ml tube. After dilution with sucrose buffer, the sedimented glass beads were removed, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 1,250 ×g. Mitochondrial membranes were then collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 × g, taken up with sucrose buffer at a protein concentration of 10–30 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. For the analysis of the submitochondrial localization of Su j, intact mitochondria were isolated according to previously published methods (26Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis D.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 538-544Google Scholar). BN-PAGE was performed as described previously (22Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Mitochondrial membranes (400 μg of protein) were sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet was suspended with 40 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmimidazole HCl, pH 7.0, and 1.0 μl of 0.5 mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in Me2SO was added. Membrane protein complexes were solubilized by the addition of Triton X-100 (9.6 μl from a 10% (w/v) stock solution, 2.4 g of Triton X-100/g of protein). After centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 ×g, the supernatant was supplemented with 5 μl of a Coomassie Blue G-250 dye suspension (5% Serva Blue G (w/v) in 750 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid) and immediately applied to a 1.6-mm acrylamide gradient gel for analytical BN-PAGE (1-cm gel well, linear 4–13% acrylamide gradient gel overlaid with a 4% sample gel). For SDS electrophoresis, the Tricine-SDS-PAGE (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) or the Laemmli system (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was used. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (BN-PAGE/Tricine-SDS-PAGE), staining, and densitometric quantification were performed as described previously (29Schägger H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Schägger H. A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 59-79Crossref Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C, and the pH values of all buffers were adjusted to 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Mitochondrial membranes from the W303-1A strain (50 mg of protein) were washed with a 4-fold volume of buffer 1 (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mmimidazole HCl, pH 7.0) and collected by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet was homogenized in 2.35 ml of buffer 1, and 0.6 ml of Triton X-100 (20% w/v) was added (2.4 g of Triton X-100/g of protein). After centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant (2.6 ml) was adjusted to 150 mm Na+ phosphate and loaded onto a 3-ml hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with buffer 2 (0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 mmNa+ phosphate, pH 7.7). Hydroxyapatite-bound ATP synthase was washed at room temperature with 1 column volume of buffer 3 (0.1% Triton X-100, 333 μm egg yolk phospholipid, 200 mm Na+ phosphate, pH 7.3) and eluted with buffer 4 (0.1% Triton X-100, 333 μm egg yolk phospholipid, 300 mm Na+ phosphate, pH 7.3). One ml of the fraction with highest ATP hydrolysis activity (about 30% of the total yield, 0.5 mg of total protein) was supplemented with 200 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid and loaded onto a 3-mm-thick preparative gel for BN-PAGE. The major blue band comprising ATP synthase, which was visible during BN-PAGE, was excised and cut into 4 pieces. A stack of these 4 pieces was processed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE in a second dimension and electroblotted onto Immobilon P membranes (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Schägger H. A Practical Guide to Membrane Protein Purification. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1994: 59-79Crossref Google Scholar). The transferred proteins were sequenced directly using a 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) or after incubation in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and methanol (24 h at 37 °C) for deformylation (31Gheorghe M.T. Jörnvall H. Bergman T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Oligomycin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was measured at 25 °C using an assay coupled to the oxidation of NADH. Shortly before the test, 0.25 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 units/ml pyruvate kinase were added to the test buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm NaCN, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The reaction was started with protein without detergent and stopped by the addition of 25 μg of oligomycin from a 5 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO. Antisera against the C-terminal region of Su j were raised in rabbits against a chemically synthesized peptide CRFAKGGKFVEVD that had been coupled to activated ovalbumin (Pierce). Hypotonic swelling and carbonate extraction of mitochondria were performed as described previously (32Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Pfanner N. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed according to Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and a Lowry protocol in the presence of SDS (35Helenius A. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3656-3661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP synthase binds stronger to hydroxyapatite than most other mitochondrial proteins of yeast. Therefore hydroxyapatite chromatography is an efficient technique for its isolation. After this first purification step, some of the known ATP synthase subunits can already be recognized in SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A, lanes 3–5). The same fractions of the hydroxyapatite column were also applied to a gel for BN-PAGE. The S. cerevisiae ATP synthase (Fig.1 B, lanes 3–5) is slightly smaller than the bovine ATP synthase that was loaded in parallel. BN-PAGE was then repeated on the preparative scale using the hydroxyapatite fraction with the highest amount of ATP synthase complex (Fig. 1 B,lane 4). The band of ATP synthase was excised, and the subunit composition of this complex was analyzed further by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal protein sequencing of the resolved proteins (Fig.1 C) showed the presence of known subunits of the ATPase and one additional protein that was termed subunit j, Su j. To exclude the possibility that this protein may represent a contamination of the ATP synthase, a two-dimensional resolution of the sample from Fig. 1,lane 4, was performed. The two-dimensional gel clearly shows that Su j fits the pattern of established subunits of the complex (Fig.1 D). Because no streaking of this protein was observed, we conclude that Su j is a true constituent of the ATP synthase complex. Subunit j could not be removed from the ATP synthase isolated by hydroxyapatite chromatography by adding 7 g of Triton X-100/g of protein and application to BN-PAGE. After the addition of Triton X-100 and 2 m urea and application to BN-PAGE, most of the ATP synthase was dissociated into the individual subunits. The residual fraction of holo-ATP synthase still contained Su j (data not shown). Direct Edman degradation of the proteins transferred to Immobilon P or after deformylation (Su 8 and Su 9) confirmed the presence of known subunits of ATP synthase. The mature subunits α and β were found to be 4 and 14 amino acids, respectively, shorter than described in protein data bases (Table I). The presence of subunit 6 was confirmed by Western blotting and subsequent immunodecoration using a specific antiserum. The novel Su j was directly accessible to Edman degradation, and a sequence of 13 N-terminal amino acids could be obtained (Table I).Table IProteins identified in isolated ATP synthase of S. cerevisiaeBand in SDS gelAssignmentGeneN-terminal sequenceMature protein AAMassSWISS-PROT accessionDa1Su 9 oligomerATP9MQLVLA(*)767,759P008412Su αATP1ASTKAQPTEV51054,952P072513Su βATP2ASAAQSTPIT47851,254P008304Su γATP3ATLKEVEMRL27830,614P380775Su 4 or Su bATP4MSSTPEKQTD20923,249P056266Su 5 or OSCPATP5ASKAAAPPPV19520,870P094577Su 6 or Su aATP6No sequence24927,956P008548Su dATP7sLAKsAANKL(‡)17319,677P309029Su δATP16AEAAAASSGL13814,553Q1216510Su hATP14DVIQDLYLRE9210,408Q1234911Su fATP17VSTLIPPKVV9510,565Q0640512Inhibitor proteinINH1sEGsTGtPRG637,383P0109713Su εATP15sAwRKAGI616,611P2130614Su jATP18MLKRFPTPILKVY596,687P8145015Su 8ATP8MPQLVPFYF(*)485,822P00856Proteins were identified by direct Edman degradation or after deformylation (*), except Su 6, which was identified by Western blotting.

The masses of the mature proteins do not include N-terminal modifications. AA, number of amino acids. Using the obtained N-terminal sequence of Su j, a search for an open reading frame corresponding to a 6.5-kDa protein in the yeast genome data base was performed. A 177-base pair sequence on chromosome XIII was identified with the potential to encode for a protein of 59 amino acid residues (Fig.2 A). This gene encoding for Su j was termed ATP18. We identified a potential homolog inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, a hypothetical protein of 6.8 kDa. This potential Su j homolog in S. pombe was 51% identical to the Su j of S. cerevisiae. The hydropathy plots for both proteins were very similar and suggested them to be membrane proteins with a single transmembrane domain (Fig. 2 B). A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of the protein was used to raise antibodies against Su j. Su j was localized to mitochondria by immunostaining. It was inaccessible to added protease in intact mitochondria (Fig. 2 C). Disruption of the outer membrane by hypotonic swelling rendered Su j sensitive to the added protease. In addition, Su j was resistant to alkaline extraction and therefore most likely is an integral membrane protein (Fig.2 C). In summary, Su j is a protein anchored to the inner membrane by a single transmembrane segment at its N terminus and has an Nin-Cout orientation. To test whether the presence of Su j is essential for the activity of the F1F0-ATP synthase, the gene encoding Su j was deleted. The resulting yeast strain Δsu j was respiratory incompetent, as it could no longer grow on the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol, in contrast to its isogenic wild-type strain (Fig.3). Enzymatic measurement of the F1F0-ATP synthase activity confirmed the loss of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in isolated Δsu jin contrast to the wild-type control (results not shown); therefore Su j seemed to be an essential subunit of the yeast F1F0-ATP synthase. However, comparison of the mitochondrial proteins of the Δsu j and Δsu fstrains by BN-PAGE (Fig. 4) and two-dimensional resolution (not shown) revealed that not only the ATP synthase but also cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (complexIII) were below the limit of detection (<10% as compared with wild-type W303-1A). The reduced levels of complex III and IV can be explained by the fact that a spontaneous transition of the Δsu j cells to the rho− state was observed. 3I. Arnold, K. Pfeiffer, W. Neupert, R. A. Stuart, and H. Schägger, unpublished observations. Interestingly a similar formation of rho− cells was observed in the Δsu f strain, as reported by Spannagel et al.(16Spannagel C. Vaillier J.

BHM, bovine heart mitochondria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nature of the association of Su j with the inner membrane and its predicted orientation in the membrane would suggest Su j to be a subunit of the F0 sector of the F1F0-ATP synthase. We therefore asked whether the expression of Su j was required for the stable expression of other F0 sector subunits. Mitochondria from the Δsu j strain were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of various subunits of the ATP synthase (Fig.5). In the absence of Su j, subunits 6 and f of the F0 sector were not detectable. The α-subunit of the F1 sector was reduced in the Δsu jstrain. Levels of other mitochondrial marker proteins, such as cytochrome c peroxidase and Mge1p, were not altered in the absence of Su j. The subunit composition of the yeast mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase was analyzed using the combined techniques of BN-PAGE and high resolution Tricine-SDS-PAGE. We present evidence here for the existence of a novel ATP synthase subunit, Su j. A homologue in the purified bovine ATP synthase complex has so far not been reported. The presence of an open reading frame inS. pombe with 51% amino acid sequence identity to theS. cerevisiae Su j suggests that Su j represents a general component of eukaryotic ATP synthases. The novel Su j protein appears to represent a bona fide subunit of the ATP synthase. Su j purified with the ATP synthase after BN-PAGE. As this technique resolves proteins by their native molecular mass (22Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), Su j is unlikely to be a contaminant of the ATP synthase; this would require it to have the same native size. No other polypeptides, which could not be assigned to the ATP synthase complex according to the amino acid sequence, were present in the purified ATP synthase fractions. Su j was observed to be tightly bound to the ATP synthase. Treatment of the isolated complex under conditions that led to its almost complete dissociation resulted in a residual fraction of holo-ATP synthase, which still contained Su j. We therefore suggest that Su j is required for the structural integrity of the ATP synthase complex. Consistent with this view, Su j appears to be an essential subunit of the yeast ATP synthase complex. Deletion of the gene encoding Su j (ATP18) gave rise to a respiratory-deficient phenotype and loss of measurable oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthase activity. The tight binding of subunit j to the isolated yeast ATP synthase raises the question as to why subunit j was not previously identified in other ATP synthase preparations. The previous use of SDS gels probably did not yield sufficient resolution of the smaller subunits of the complex. As shown here, the use of high resolution Tricine-SDS-PAGE has optimized the separation of the yeast ATP synthase subunits in the molecular mass range of Su j. Furthermore, although we used mild solubilization with Triton X-100 and BN-PAGE as a one-step procedure, subunits g and e (Tim11) or a potential homologue of bovine subunit F6 were not found in association with the ATP synthase complex. Notably, recent variation of the conditions for protein solubilization and BN-PAGE led to the isolation of an ATP synthase with three more bound proteins, including subunits e (Tim11) and subunit g. The analysis of the role of these proteins for the structure and function of ATP synthase will be discussed separately (37Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; (in press): 17Google Scholar). In conclusion, we demonstrate here that Su j is an integral inner membrane protein, spanning the membrane once in an Nin-Cout orientation. The membrane association of Su j is compatible with it being a subunit of the F0sector of the ATP synthase. We are currently investigating the association of Su j with other known F0 sector subunits. We are grateful to Dr. Jean Velours (Université Bordeaux, France) for the generous gift of the antisera against ATPase subunits f and 6 and the Δsu fyeast strain. We thank Sandra Weinzierl and Monika Krampert for excellent technical assistance."

However, it is not known whether Rap1A phosphorylation is involved in regulation of its cellular functions, including suppression of Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. We have previously shown that this suppressive activity of Rap1A is attributable to its greatly enhanced ability to bind to the cysteine-rich region (CRR, residues 152–184) of Raf-1 compared with that of Ras. Here, we show that phosphorylation of Rap1A by PKA abolished its binding activity to CRR. Furthermore, a mutant Rap1A(S180E), whose sole PKA phosphorylation residue, Ser-180, was substituted by an acidic residue, Glu, to mimic its phosphorylated form, failed to suppress Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation in COS-7 cells. These results indicate that the CRR binding activity and the Ras-suppressive function of Rap1A can be modulated through phosphorylation and suggest that Rap1A may function as a PKA-dependent regulator of Raf-1 activation, not merely as a suppressor.

In addition to RBD, we and others have recently found that CRR (residues 152–184) of Raf-1 also interacts with Ras and shown that this novel interaction is essential for activation of Raf-1 (Refs. 14Hu C.-D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ras, Rap1A cannot activate Raf-1. Instead, Rap1A inhibits Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. Because Rap1A has the identical effector region to that of Ras and associates well with RBD (8Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), we speculated that it would have a defect in association with CRR. However, to our surprise, we found that Rap1A has a greatly enhanced ability to associate with CRR compared with Ras (21Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, the enhanced CRR binding property of Rap1A resulted in formation of a ternary complex with Ras and Raf-1 in which Rap1A and Ras independently associate with CRR and RBD of Raf-1, respectively. Raf-1 in this complex cannot be activated by Ras, presumably because interaction of CRR with Ras is hampered by Rap1A tightly bound to CRR. Association with CRR seems to involve the C-terminal region of Rap1A, because it was shown that the association was dependent on the C-terminal posttranslational modification of Rap1A (21Hu C.-D.

We therefore reasoned that phosphorylation of Rap1A at its C-terminal Ser-180 might affect its ability to associate with CRR. Here we report that the phosphorylation specifically abolished the activity of Rap1A to bind to CRR. Further, a Rap1A mutant mimicking the phosphorylated form was found to have lost the activity to suppress Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. MBP-Raf-1(51–131), MBP-Raf-1(132–206), and MBP-Raf-1(48–206) are MBP fusion proteins containing the indicated residues of human Raf-1 described before (14Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K.

The MBP fusion proteins in the resulting supernatant fractions were immobilized on amylose resin and used for the in vitrobinding assays as described below. cDNAs encoding Rap1AV12(S180E) and Rap1AV12(S180A), carrying a substitution of Glu or Ala, respectively, for Ser at residue 180 in addition to an activating mutation of Gly to Val at residue 12, were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers carrying the corresponding mutations and the Rap1AV12cDNA as a template (21Hu C.-D.

Expression of a GST fusion Ha-Ras (GST-Ha-Ras) in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector was described before (21Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

The in vitro binding reactions were carried out by incubating 20–30 μl of amylose resin carrying various immobilized MBP fusion proteins with GTPγS- or GDP-loaded Rap1A in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% Lubrol PX) as described (14Hu C.-D.

After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the resin was washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoblot detection with anti-Rap1A polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, California). The ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for signal development. For examination of the ternary complex formation, GST-Ha-Ras in Sf9 cell lysate was first immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin and then loaded with GTPγS. The resin was subsequently incubated with GTPγS-loaded Rap1A in the presence of MBP-Raf-1(48–206). The experimental condition was the same as described above, except that the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in buffer A. The eluate was probed with anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13–259 (Oncogene Science Inc., Manhasset, New York), anti-MBP polyclonal antibody, or the anti-Rap1A antibody. For examination of the effect of phosphorylation of Rap1A, 5–10 pmol of Rap1A were incubated with 5–10 units of recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) at 25 °C for 30 min. After termination of the phosphorylation reaction by the addition of 0.1–0.2 μg of a synthetic peptide (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD) corresponding to the active site of the rabbit PKA inhibitor (24Cheng H.-C.

COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For the activation of Raf-1 by Ras or Rap1A, cells in 60-mm dishes (50% confluency) were cotransfected with a combination of a Raf-1 expression vector pH8-Raf-1 (25Tamada M. Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Okada T. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and either one of pcDNA3.1-Ha-RasV12, pSRα-Rap1AV12, pSRα-Rap1AV12(S180E), or pSRα-Rap1AV12(S180A) by using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). For examination of suppression of the Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation by Rap1A or its mutants, cells were cotransfected with a combination of pcDNA3.1-Ha-RasV12, pH8-Raf-1, and either one of pSRα-Rap1AV12, pSRα-Rap1AV12(S180E), or pSRα-Rap1AV12(S180A). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free media and further cultured for 18 h. The membrane extract in 0.4 ml of the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) was prepared from each dish as described (25Tamada M. Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Okada T. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One-half of the total membrane extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Raf-1 antibody and protein A-agarose. The Raf-1 kinase activity was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitates in the presence of GST-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (0.3 μg) and GST-KNERK2 (2 μg) in 30 μl of the kinase reaction mixture {20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (4,000 cpm/pmol)} for 20 min at 25 °C (25Tamada M. Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Okada T. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2959-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After the incubation, proteins in the reaction mixture were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were either visualized by autoradiograph or quantitated by using BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). In parallel, a 20-μl aliquot of the membrane extract was used for examination of the amounts of the expressed proteins by Western immunoblotting with the anti-Ras, anti-Rap1A, and anti-Raf-1 antibodies. Signals from the corresponding endogenous proteins were negligible (data not shown). In the previous studies (14Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we found that both Ha-Ras and Rap1A in posttranslationally modified form boundin vitro to MBP-Raf-1(132–206) containing CRR in a GTP-independent manner. This was in contrast to their GTP-dependent binding to MBP-Raf-1(51–131) containing RBD. In the present study, we tested the effect of phosphorylation of Rap1A on its binding activities toward RBD and CRR in the same in vitro binding assay. First, we incubated Rap1A with a recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA and confirmed its quantitative phosphorylation by observing its mobility shift on SDS-PAGE as reported (4Quilliam L.A. Mueller H. Bohl B.P. Prossnitz V. Sklar L.A. Der C.J. Bokoch G.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). After inactivation of PKA by the protein kinase inhibitor peptide, Rap1A was loaded with GTPγS and incubated with MBP-Raf-1(132–206). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the phosphorylated Rap1A exhibited no detectable activity to bind to CRR in a sharp contrast to the unphosphorylated Rap1A. The same result was obtained with the phosphorylated Rap1A loaded with GDP (data not shown). In contrast, when tested with MBP-Raf-1(51–131), the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated Rap1A did not exhibit any significant difference in their RBD binding activities (Fig.1 C). GTP dependence of the RBD binding was unaffected also. These results indicate that the phosphorylation of Rap1A specifically impaired the Rap1A-CRR association. In addition to Raf-1, we examined the effect of Rap1A phosphorylation on interaction with other Ras effectors, RalGDS (9Albright C.F. Giddings B.W. Liu J. Vito M. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11089-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.-H. Chen Y.-W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and PLC210 (12Shibatohge M. Kariya K. Liao Y. Hu C.-D. Watari Y. Goshima M. Shima F. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6218-6222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, we observed GTP-dependent binding of Rap1A to both the Ras-interacting domain of rat RalGDSb and the Ras-associating domain of C. elegans PLC210, which were produced as MBP fusions. However, we did not observe any difference of binding between the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated forms of Rap1A (Fig. 1, D andE). These results further indicate that the effect of Rap1A phosphorylation is specific to Raf-1 CRR. We next examined the effect of Rap1A phosphorylation on its ability to form a ternary complex with Ras and Raf-1. In this complex, Ras and Rap1A were independently associated with RBD and CRR, respectively. When Rap1A in the unphosphorylated form was incubated with GST-Ha-Ras immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin in the presence of MBP-Raf-1(48–206) containing both RBD and CRR, all three proteins were trapped on the resin and thereby co-eluted with 10 mm glutathione (Fig. 1 F, lane 1). In contrast, when the phosphorylated Rap1A was used in the same reaction in place of the unphosphorylated form, no Rap1A was detectable in the eluate even though a similar amount of MBP-Raf-1(48–206) was co-eluted with GST-Ha-Ras (Fig. 1 F,lane 2). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of Rap1A abrogates its ability to form a ternary complex with Ha-Ras and Raf-1. Accumulated evidences indicate that Ser-180 is a sole phosphorylation site of Rap1A by PKA examined both in vivo and in vitro (1Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). To prove that phosphorylation at Ser-180 was responsible for the observed effect of PKA treatment of Rap1A, we examined the effect of substitution of Ala for Ser-180. Rap1AV12(S180A) exhibited an activity to associate with Raf-1 CRR comparable with wild-type Rap1AV12 (Fig.2 A). In contrast to the case with wild-type Rap1AV12, no visible mobility shift was observed after treatment of this Rap1A mutant by PKA, suggesting that it was not phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the PKA treatment of Rap1AV12(S180A) did not affect its activity to bind to CRR (Fig. 2 C). This result indicates that Ser-180 is indeed the sole phosphorylation site responsible for the loss of the CRR binding activity of Rap1A. Because we previously found that the tight association of Rap1A with CRR is responsible for the Ras-suppressive activity of Rap1A, the above findings prompted us to test the effect of Rap1A phosphorylation on its cellular function, in particular suppression of Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation (1Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, we could not employ the conventional approach of stimulating cells with cAMP-elevating agents or overexpressing PKA catalytic subunit, because it has been shown that Raf-1 is phosphorylated by PKA and thereby rendered insensitive to activation by Ras (26Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we turned to test the feasibility of using a mutant Rap1AV12(S180E) in which the phosphorylation residue Ser-180 was replaced by an acidic residue Glu. This mutant is similar to the reported mutant Rap1A(S180D), which was shown to mimic the phosphorylated Rap1A (5Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Rap1AV12(S180E) was expressed in Sf9 cells, purified, and examined for its activity to associate with CRR. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the mutant exhibited no binding activity toward CRR, which is similar to the case with the phosphorylated Rap1A. This convinced us that Rap1AV12(S180E) can mimic the phosphorylated Rap1AV12. As expected, PKA treatment of this mutant did not alter its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2 B) or its CRR binding property (Fig. 2 C), further supporting that Ser-180 is the sole phosphorylation site. Then, we first examined the activities of the Rap1A mutants to stimulate the kinase activity of Raf-1 (Fig.3 A). Rap1AV12(S180E) as well as Rap1AV12(S180A) were found to be incapable of activating Raf-1 like wild-type Rap1AV12. This result further supports our hypothesis that association of Ras with CRR at an appropriate strength is required for Raf-1 activation. Abnormally enhanced or attenuated binding to CRR is detrimental to Raf-1 activation (14Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the activities of these Rap1A mutants to antagonize the Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. When Rap1AV12(S180E) was co-expressed in COS-7 cells with Raf-1 and Ha-RasV12, no significant suppression of the Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation was observed, in sharp contrast to nearly 70% suppression observed with wild-type Rap1AV12 (Fig. 3 B) even though they were expressed in a similar amount (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, Rap1AV12(S180A) was as active as wild-type Rap1AV12 in suppressing the Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. Considering that Rap1AV12(S180E) had its CRR binding activity greatly attenuated and that Rap1AV12(S180A) retained the greatly enhanced CRR binding activity, these results are consistent with our hypothesis that the tight association of Rap1A with CRR, which results in blockade of Ras access to CRR, accounts for the Ras-suppressive activity of Rap1A (21Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Further, the data obtained with Rap1AV12(S180E), taken together with the loss of CRR binding activity of the phosphorylated Rap1A, strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of Rap1A abrogates its activity to suppresses the Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. Rap1A has been reported to associate with almost all Ras effectors and other proteins in cells. Although it is assumed that phosphorylation of Rap1A may be a physiological event, regulating its interaction with other proteins based on the observation that phosphorylated Rap1A does not associate with cytochrome b(7Bokoch G.M. Quilliam L.A. Bohl B.P. Jesaitis A.J. Quinn M.T. Science. 1991; 254: 1794-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), there has been no report that phosphorylation also affects the association of Rap1A with Ras effectors. In the present study, we have shown that the phosphorylated Rap1A lacks its ability to bind to CRR of Raf-1. This represents the second direct evidence that phosphorylation of Rap1A affects its interaction with other proteins. Consistent with our previous finding that CRR binding requires the C-terminal lipid modification of Rap1A (21Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), this result provides further support to the idea that the C-terminal region of Rap1A is involved in CRR binding. Significantly, we have shown that the S180E mutant, mimicking the phosphorylated Rap1A, can no longer suppress Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. This result not only agrees well with our hypothesis that the enhanced CRR binding is involved in suppression of Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation by Rap1A but also, to our knowledge, represents the first clear demonstration that the cellular function of Rap1A is controlled by phosphorylation. The first indication of Ras-antagonizing activity of Rap1A came from its ability to induce reversion of Ras-transformed fibroblasts (28Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this antagonizing activity of Rap1A was also observed in nontransformed cells (1Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 2Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies employed expression of a large amount of Rap1A, it has recently been shown that expression of Rap1AV12 at levels similar to the endogenous wild-type protein also efficiently inhibits activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by growth factors (29Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because this mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was found dependent on Ras, the observation suggested that a physiological amount of endogenous Rap1A may be sufficient for its antagonistic effect on Ras during normal cell growth (29Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Based on the present results that the antagonizing activity of Rap1A can be controlled by phosphorylation, we propose further that Rap1A may function as a PKA-dependent regulator of Raf-1 activation, not merely as a suppressor. In addition to Rap1A, PKA phosphorylates many cellular proteins including Raf-1 (26Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Raf-1 by PKA renders it incapable of associating with Ras, thereby precluding its activation by Ras. Taken together with our present finding, one can hypothesize that PKA may exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation. Although these ambivalent effects appear puzzling, they may be required for fine-tuning the signal output from Raf-1 in different cell-type or developmental contexts. It should also be pointed out that there exists a possibility that a protein kinase other than PKA may specifically phosphorylate Rap1A, but not Raf-1, under control of a certain extracellular signal. Identification of such a protein kinase might provide a further insight into the regulatory mechanism of Raf-1 activity by Rap1A. We thank A. Kikuchi at Hiroshima University School of Medicine for providing GST-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, GST-KNERK, and rat RalGDSb cDNA and X.-H. Deng for her skillful technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2076618119,"We recently reported that the heparin (Hep) III domain of fibronectin contains the H2 cell adhesion site in repeat III5 which binds activated α4 integrins. We have now further characterized the heparin and cell binding activities of this domain. A recombinant fragment containing repeats III4-III5 (FN-III4–5) induced Jurkat cell adhesion upon integrin activation with Mn2+ or TS2/16 monoclonal antibody (anti-β1). Adhesion of Mn2+-treated cells to FN-III4–5 or FN-III5 fragments was inhibited by chondroitinase ABC and ACII but not by the anti-α4 monoclonal antibody HP2/1. In contrast, HP2/1 completely blocked adhesion of TS2/16-treated cells while chondroitinase had a partial (FN-III4–5) or minor (FN-III5) effect. Thus, the role of each receptor depended on the stimulus used to activate α4β1. The combination of HP2/1 and chondroitinase at dilutions which did not inhibit when used individually abolished adhesion of Mn2+ or TS2/16-treated cells to both fragments, indicating a cooperative effect between α4β1 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG). Furthermore, we have identified a 20-amino acid sequence in III5 (HBP/III5) which binds heparin and induces cell adhesion via CSPG exclusively. Although soluble HBP/III5 was a poor inhibitor, when combined with H2, it abolished adhesion to FN-III4–5 and FN-III5 fragments. These results establish that adhesion to the Hep III domain involves the cooperation of activated α4β1 and CSPG and show that HBP/III5 is a novel heparin and CSPG-binding site contributing to cell adhesion to this domain. We recently reported that the heparin (Hep) III domain of fibronectin contains the H2 cell adhesion site in repeat III5 which binds activated α4 integrins. We have now further characterized the heparin and cell binding activities of this domain. A recombinant fragment containing repeats III4-III5 (FN-III4–5) induced Jurkat cell adhesion upon integrin activation with Mn2+ or TS2/16 monoclonal antibody (anti-β1). Adhesion of Mn2+-treated cells to FN-III4–5 or FN-III5 fragments was inhibited by chondroitinase ABC and ACII but not by the anti-α4 monoclonal antibody HP2/1. In contrast, HP2/1 completely blocked adhesion of TS2/16-treated cells while chondroitinase had a partial (FN-III4–5) or minor (FN-III5) effect. Thus, the role of each receptor depended on the stimulus used to activate α4β1. The combination of HP2/1 and chondroitinase at dilutions which did not inhibit when used individually abolished adhesion of Mn2+ or TS2/16-treated cells to both fragments, indicating a cooperative effect between α4β1 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG). Furthermore, we have identified a 20-amino acid sequence in III5 (HBP/III5) which binds heparin and induces cell adhesion via CSPG exclusively.

Fibronectin (Fn)1 is a plasma and extracellular matrix protein which interacts with other macromolecules and with cells via specific binding sites present in well defined structural and functional domains (reviewed in Ref. 1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). Fn contains two main cell adhesion domains located in the central and COOH-terminal regions, respectively. The active sites in the central domain are RGD in repeat III10 and its synergistic sequence PHSRN in repeat III9 (Refs. 1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar and 2Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, see Fig. 1). These sites bind mainly α5β1 integrin although RGD is also a ligand for activated α4β1 (3Sánchez-Aparicio P. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal cell-binding region comprises the active sites CS-1 and CS-5 within the alternatively spliced segment IIICS, as well as H1 (IDAPS) in the high affinity heparin-binding domain or Hep II (Fig. 1). CS-1, CS-5, and H1 are ligands for α4β1 integrin (4Wayner E.A. Garcia-Pardo A. Humphries M.J. McDonald J.A. Carter W.G. J.

Besides the H1 α4β1-binding site, the Hep II domain contains several well characterized sequences which bind heparin and cell surface proteoglycans (PG) (10McCarthy J.B. Chelberg M.K. Mikelson D.J.

Opthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 153-164Google Scholar) which mediates cell adhesion via PG and promotes focal adhesion formation (13Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

There is now extensive evidence showing that PG may modulate the function of α4β1 and that cell adhesion to the COOH-terminal region of Fn involves the cooperation between both types of receptors (11Iida J.

It is also well established that integrin function can be up-regulated by external factors including the divalent cation Mn2+ and certain anti-β1 mAbs such as TS2/16 (19Gimond C. Sonnenberg A. Eble J.A. Kühn K. Integrin-Ligand Interaction. Springer-Verlag, New York1997Google Scholar). Whether these reagents are mimicking the effects of physiologic regulators such as PG remains to be determined. These previous studies have clearly established an important role for the Hep II domain of Fn in the adhesion of many cell systems including melanoma (11Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L. Wayner E.A.

Cell Res. 1997; 233: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, it is now becoming evident that other heparin-binding regions also contribute to cell adhesion. Fn contains 2–3 additional heparin-binding domains located at the NH2-terminal (Hep I) and central (Hep III) part of the molecule (see Fig. 1). These domains differ in their binding affinity and sensitivity to divalent cation regulation (22Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5263-5267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gold L.I. Frangione B. Pearstein E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4113-4119Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Siri A. Balza E. Carnemolla B. Castellani P. Borsi L. Zardi L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Hep I domain was recently shown to induce cell adhesion via interaction with the α5β1 integrin (25Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is not known if this region also interacts with cell surface PG, although it binds several uncharacterized molecules at the cell surface (26Zhang Q. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33284-33292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also recently reported that a recombinant fragment containing the Fn III5 repeat, which is part of the Hep III domain, mediates lymphoid cell adhesion due to the interaction of the KLDAPT sequence with α4β1 and α4β7 integrins previously activated with TS2/16 mAb or Mn2+, respectively (27Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcı́a-Gila M. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Leprini A. Querzé G. Zardi L. Garcı́a-Pardo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24832-24836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our previous observations therefore reveal a novel function for this domain and highlight the importance of heparin-binding regions for the overall cell binding activity of Fn. In the present study we have further characterized the heparin and cell binding properties of the Hep III domain of Fn. By preparing recombinant fragments containing type III repeats from this region, we show that adhesion of Jurkat T cells to a fragment containing Fn III4-III5 repeats involves the cooperation of activated α4β1 integrin and chondroitin sulfate (CS) but not heparan sulfate (HS) PG. We also show that the contribution of each receptor depends on whether Mn2+ or TS2/16 are used to activate α4β1 and that CSPG is crucial when Mn2+ is the reagent of choice. Furthermore, we have identified a novel 20-amino acid sequence in repeat III5, structurally similar to FN C/H V, which binds heparin and induces cell adhesion via CSPG exclusively. These results therefore establish novel interactions that regulate cell adhesion to the Hep III Fn domain. Recombinant fragments containing type III homology repeats 4–5-6 (FN-III4–5-6), 4–5 (FN-III4–5), 4 (FN-III4), and 5 (FN-III5) were produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification using UlTma DNA-polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), cDNA from FN-III1/22–11 clones and appropriate primers as described previously (27Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcı́a-Gila M. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Leprini A. Querzé G. Zardi L. Garcı́a-Pardo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24832-24836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pQE-12 or pQE-3/5 vector using the QIAexpress kit and expressed in Escherichia coli. All cloned cDNAs were sequenced using a Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemicals Corp., Cleveland, OH). Fragments were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the specific mAbs (see below) IST-3 (FN-III4, FN-III4–5, and FN-III4–6) or IST-4 (FN-III5) conjugated to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). None of the fragments contained a 6xHis tag. Purity of recombinant fragments was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (15% acrylamide; see Fig. 1). The recombinant fragment H0, comprising the Hep II domain (repeats III12–14) and repeat III15 was prepared exactly as described (28Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Garratt A.N. Clements J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27224-27230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides KLDAPT (H2), WTPPRAQITGYRLTVGLTRR (HBP/III5), WTPQARPITGYRLTVGLTRR (scrambled HBP/III5 or HP/III5.sc), WTPPRAQITGY (HBP/III5-N11), WTPPRAQITGYRLT (HBP/III5-N14), YRLTVGLTRR (HBP/III5-C10), and YQLTVGLTRR (HBP/III5-C10.sc) were synthesized on an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (AMS 422, ABIMED, Langenfeld, Germany) using standard solid phase procedures and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides were covalently conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, Calbiochem-Novabiochem Int., La Jolla, CA) with glutaraldehyde (29Morris R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) by mixing KLH and peptide at a molar ratio of 1:3000 in phosphate-buffered saline. Glutaraldehyde was added dropwise to the peptide-KLH solution and the mixture incubated at room temperature for 2 h with gentle stirring; after extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, peptide coupling efficiency was determined by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis using a Biochrom 20 analyzer (Pharmacia). IST-3 and IST-4 mAbs reactive with FN-III4 and FN-III5 repeats, respectively, were produced as reported (30Borsi L. Carnemolla B. Castellani P. Rosellini C. Vecchio D. Allemanni G. Chang S.E.

Activating anti-β1 mAb T2/16 (purified Ab) and function blocking anti-α4 HP2/1 (culture supernatant) were generously donated by Dr. Francisco Sánchez-Madrid (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain). Chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) and heparinase III (heparitinase I, EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Sigma. Chondroitinase AC II (EC 4.2.2.5) and heparitinase (a mixture of 95% heparitinase I and 5% heparitinase II, EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Seikagaku America Inc. through ams Biotechnology (Oxon, United Kingdom). The human T cell line Jurkat was obtained from Dr. Margarita López-Trascasa (Hospital La Paz, Madrid). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA), and 24 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Middlesex, UK). Flat bottom 8-well strips withN-oxysuccinimide amine binding surface (Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight with recombinant fragments or peptides diluted in 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5. Adhesion assays were carried out as described (3Sánchez-Aparicio P. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Garcia-Pardo A. Wayner E.A. Carter W.G. Ferreira O.C. J.

Quantitation of cell attachment was done using calibration curves as described (31Arroyo A.G. Garcia-Pardo A. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9863-9868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and optical density at 620 nm was found to be practically a linear function of the number of cells attached. Total cellular input was calculated in these assays by spinning wells with the original number of cell aliquots, then fixing, staining, and measuring optical density. Integrin activation was performed by incubating the cells (total volume 250 μl) with 5 μl of TS2/16 mAb (0.28 mg/ml) in RPMI 1640, 10 mm Hepes, 1% bovine serum albumin, or 10 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm Mn2+, pH 7.2, for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the attachment assay. For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated in a total volume of 300 μl, with appropiate dilutions of HP2/1 supernatant (1:5 or 1:50), chondroitinase ABC (0.3 or 1.0 Sigma units/ml), chondroitinase AC II (1 Seikagaku units/ml), heparinase III (0.3 or 1 Sigma units/ml), heparitinase (2 Seikagaku milliunits/ml), or synthetic peptides (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C on a rotary shaker; the cell suspension was then diluted to 7 × 105 cells/ml and 100 μl were added to each substrate-coated well. The assay was then continued as explained above. To rule out the possibility of protein degradation by protease contaminants present in the enzyme preparations, digestions were performed in the presence of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.36 mm pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Recombinant Fn fragments were applied to columns containing heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia) in 25 mm Tris, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, buffer. After washing the columns with this buffer, bound fragments were eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 30 to 450 mm NaCl. Synthetic peptides (1 mg each) were dissolved in 0.4 ml of 25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.6, buffer and incubated with 0.3 ml of heparin-Sepharose matrix for 1 h at room temperature under mild shaking. Unbound material was determined by reading the absorbance of the solution at 280 nm after centrifugation. The beads were washed with the same buffer until the absorbance was zero and bound peptides were eluted using 25 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, buffer and monitored by optical density at 280 nm. Further identification of the bound material was achieved by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry using a REFLEX time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) operated in the positive mode. Previous studies have identified a low affinity heparin/DNA-binding domain (Hep III) in the central region of Fn (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins.

Biochem. 1986; 154: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To further analyze the binding properties of this domain, we prepared recombinant fragments spanning Fn repeats III4–6, III4–5, III4, and III5, respectively (Fig.1), and tested their ability to bind to heparin-Sepharose affinity matrices. As shown in TableI, all fragments bound to heparin but the conditions for elution from the matrix were different. The FN-III4–5 fragment showed the highest heparin-binding avidity and bound more strongly than the larger FN-III4–5-6 fragment. Full activity of FN-III4–5 apparently requires both repeats to be present since recombinant fragments containing single repeats (FN-III4 and FN-III5) bound to heparin with lower affinity (Table I).Table IHeparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography of recombinant fragments derived from the Hep III domain of FnFibronectin fragmentsNaCl concentration required for elutionnmFN-III4–5-6220FN-III4–5300FN-III4150FN-III5180 Open table in a new tab We have recently shown that the FN-III5 fragment mediates cell adhesion via interaction of the KLDAPT sequence (H2) with activated α4 integrins (27Moyano J.V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24832-24836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To establish a possible correlation between the heparin binding activity of FN-III4–5 repeats and cell binding, we first tested whether the FN-III4–5 fragment also mediated cell adhesion. As shown in Fig.2, resting Jurkat T cells did not bind to this fragment; however, upon incubation with 2 mmMn2+ or the activating anti-β1 mAb TS2/16, cells attached to this fragment in a dose dependent manner. This suggested the implication of a β1 integrin as the receptor for FN-III4–5, possibly α4β1 which is the receptor for FN-III5 (27Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcı́a-Gila M. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Leprini A. Querzé G. Zardi L. Garcı́a-Pardo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24832-24836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since FN-III4–5 bound heparin with high avidity (Table I), we studied the contribution of both, α4β1 integrin and cell surface PG for attachment to this fragment. For these experiments, Jurkat cells were treated with either 2 mm Mn2+ or TS2/16 mAb and then incubated with anti-α4 mAb HP2/1, chondroitinase ABC, heparinase III, or the combination of mAb and enzymes prior to the attachment assay. As shown in Fig. 3, the contribution of α4β1 and PG to cell adhesion to FN-III4–5 or FN-III5 fragments was different depending on whether the cells had been treated with Mn2+ or TS2/16. For cells incubated with Mn2+, HP2/1 (1:5 dilution) had little effect on adhesion to either FN-III4–5 (27% inhibition) or FN-III5 fragments (8% inhibition). However, treatment with chondroitinase ABC (1.0 units/ml) completely inhibited adhesion to both fragments (92 and 95% inhibition, respectively). Treatment with heparinase III (0.3 or 1 units/ml) or heparitinase (2 milliunits/ml, not shown) had no effect. Since chondroitinase ABC also degrades dermatan sulfate, we tested the effect of chondroitinase ACII which is specific for CS. At 1.0 units/ml, this enzyme inhibited adhesion to FN-III4–5 (91% ± 8.3) and FN-III5 (93% ± 2.1, mean of four experiments, data not shown), therefore indicating that the receptors for these fragments were CSPG. Fig. 3 also shows that further dilutions of HP2/1 (1:50) or chondroitinase ABC (0.3 unit/ml), used individually, did not affect adhesion to either fragment (0–3% inhibition) of cells incubated with Mn2+. Interestingly, when both reagents were combined at these concentrations, they inhibited cell adhesion to FN-III4–5 (65%) and FN-III5 (98%), thus suggesting a cooperation between both types of receptors. The residual binding to FN-III4–5 could not be inhibited under these conditions. As expected, the combination of HP2/1 (1:50) and heparinase III had no effect (Fig. 3). Incubation of Jurkat cells with TS2/16 mAb resulted in a different pattern of adhesion to both fragments. As shown in Fig. 3, HP2/1 (1:5 dilution) efficiently inhibited (92%) adhesion to FN-III4–5 fragment and induced partial inhibition (62%) at 1:50 dilution. Chondroitinase ABC had a minor effect at 0.3 unit/ml (10% inhibition) and produced 60% inhibition at 1.0 unit/ml. Similar results were obtained with chondroitinase ACII (not shown). As observed for cells treated with Mn2+, treatment with heparinase III (or heparitinase) did not affect adhesion. The combination of HP2/1 (1:50) and chondroitinase ABC (0.3 unit/ml) completely inhibited (99%) adhesion to the FN-III4–5 fragment while the combination of HP2/1 and heparinase III had no effect (Fig. 3). The HP2/1 mAb also completely (100%, 1:5 dilution) or partially (45%, 1:50 dilution) inhibited adhesion to FN-III5 as we had previously reported (27Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcı́a-Gila M. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Aparicio P. Leprini A. Querzé G. Zardi L. Garcı́a-Pardo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24832-24836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase ABC (1.0 unit/ml) had little effect in attachment to this fragment (22% inhibition) but when combined with 1:50 dilution of HP2/1 mAb, produced 100% inhibition (Fig. 3). Heparinase III, either alone or combined with HP2/1 (1:50 dilution), did not affect adhesion to the FN-III5 fragment (Fig. 3). To confirm that the heparinase enzymes were active in our assays, we tested their effect on cell adhesion to the H0 Fn fragment. H0 contains the Hep II domain and interacts with α4β1 integrin, CSPG, and HSPG (11Iida J. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L. Wayner E.A. McCarthy J.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In results not shown, heparinase III (1 unit/ml) or heparitinase (2 milliunits/ml) had a minor effect when used alone but when combined with 1:100 dilution of HP2/1 mAb (which did not inhibit by itself) they produced >95% inhibition (mean of three experiments), indicating that the enzymes were active under the conditions used. Altogether these results indicate that adhesion to FN-III4–5 or FN-III5 fragments involves the cooperation of α4β1 and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of CSPG. CSPG play an important role when α4β1 is activated with Mn2+ while this integrin is the major receptor when activation is induced with TS2/16 mAb. The preceding results indicated that the FN-III4–5 fragment binds heparin and CSPG. To further define the specific sites(s) involved in these interactions, we compared amino acid sequences in repeats III4-III5 with previously characterized heparin or PG-binding sites in Fn. The sequence WTPPRAQITGY in III5 was highly homologous to WQPPRARITGY or FN-C/H V, previously shown to bind heparin and HSPG (12Mooradian D.L. McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Cameron J.D. Furcht L.T. Invest. Opthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1993; 34: 153-164Google Scholar, 13Woods A. McCarthy J.B. Furcht L.T. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We therefore prepared several synthetic peptides spanning the WTPPRAQITGY sequence in III5 (Fig. 4) and tested their capacity to bind to heparin-Sepharose matrices and to mediate cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the synthetic peptides WTPPRAQITGY (HBP/III5-N11) and WTPPRAQITGYRLT (HBP/III5-N14) did not bind to heparin. However, the 20-residue peptide WTPPRAQITGYRLTVGLTRR (HBP/III5) as well as HBP/III5.sc, in which the sequence PPRAQIT was replaced by PQARPI, bound heparin very efficiently and >90% of the applied material was recovered in the 0.5m NaCl fraction (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, peptide HBP/III5-C10, containing the C-terminal half of HBP/III5 (see Fig. 4), retained the heparin binding ability and approximately 41% of peptide eluted in the bound fraction (Fig. 5 A). Substitution of the first arginine of C-10 by glutamine (peptide HBP/III5-C10.sc, Fig. 4) reduced the amount of bound peptide to 23% (Fig. 5 A). The identity of peptides HBP/III5 and HBP/III5-C10 as the heparin-bound material was confirmed by amino acid analyses (not shown) as well as mass spectrometry analyses (Fig. 5 B) of the 0.5m NaCl eluted fractions. These results therefore show that the heparin-binding site contained in HBP/III5 resides in the C-terminal sequence YRLTVGLTRR and that all three arginine residues appear to be important for the interaction. To determine whether the HBP/III5 peptide also mediated cell adhesion, resting, Mn2+-treated, or TS2/16-treated Jurkat cells were added to wells containing increasing concentrations of peptide covalently coupled to KLH. As shown in Fig.6, in all three cases Jurkat cells attached to HBP/III5 in a dose-dependent manner. Cells also attached similarly to the HBP/III5.sc peptide but not to the shorter HBP/III5-N11 or HBP/III5-N14, and attached only minimally (<20%) to HBP/III5-C10 and HBP/III5-C10.sc peptides (results not shown). Cell adhesion to HBP/III5 was completely inhibited by chondroitinase ABC and ACII (1.0 unit/ml) and by soluble HBP/III5 peptide (0.5 mg/ml), regardless of the stimulus used for activation, while heparinase III (1 unit/ml), heparitinase (2 milliunits/ml, not shown), HP2/1 mAb (1:5 dilution) or 0.5 mg/ml of soluble H2 peptide (see Fig. 4) had no effect (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the full 20-residue sequence contained in HBP/III5 is necessary for an efficient adhesion and that adhesion to this sequence is exclusively mediated by CSPG. The preceding results had identified a novel sequence in Fn III5 repeat, HBP/III5, which mediates cell adhesion via CSPG. Since III5 contains another sequence, KLDAPT (peptide H2) which binds activated α4 integrins (27Moyano J.V. Carnemolla B. Domı́nguez-Jiménez C. Garcı́a-Gila M. Albar J.P. Sánchez-Aparicio P.

The attachment of Jurkat cells to the previously described H2 peptide was first studied. As shown in Fig.8, adhesion of Mn2+-treated cells to H2-KLH was completely inhibited by mAb HP2/1 or soluble H2 peptide while heparinase III had no effect. Interestingly, chondroitinase ABC and ACII also completely inhibited adhesion to H2 while soluble"

Continuing interest in structure and function of iron-sulfur proteins (1Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) has recently been extended to the biosynthetic problem of how the Fe-S cluster moieties are introduced into the proteins. Genetic studies on the biosynthesis of the nitrogenase metalloclusters inAzotobacter vinelandii revealed nifS as essential for assembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the iron protein component (2Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NifS protein was subsequently identified as al-cysteine desulfurase, yielding alanine and sulfur as products (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A specific cysteinyl residue of NifS serves as the primary sulfur acceptor (4Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and has been suggested as persulfidic sulfur donor compound for nitrogenase apo-iron protein. A more general role for the NifS-type chemistry might be indicated by the fact that genes homologous to nifS have been found in a variety of organisms (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is an oxidation sensitive [4Fe-4S] enzyme. Our work, designed to identify proteins involved in ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly with the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6714 as a model led to the straightforward purification of a l-cysteine/cystine C-S-lyase (7Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This lyase, named C-DES,1 is distinguished from NifS in being monomeric, insensitive to thiol-alkylating reagents and in producing pyruvate and sulfide from cysteine (instead of alanine and sulfur). Remarkably, C-DES was isolated from Synechocystisextract by use of a holoferredoxin formation assay (7Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) despite the occurrence of 3 nifS-type sequences in the genome as proven for the related strain Synechocystis PCC 6803 (8Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). With the assay system employed, 1 mol of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin was formed per 2 mol of cysteine utilized (Equation 1; Ref. 7Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol.

Investigation of the lyase reaction per se revealed that C-DES strongly preferredl-cystine to l-cysteine (7Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). β-Elimination of cystine should yield cysteine persulfide as an unstable, substrate-derived S0 compound. For accumulation and chemical characterization of the postulated persulfide molecule substantial amounts of C-DES were required. We here report the cloning and sequencing of the C-DES gene and the overproduction of the gene product in E. coli. Using the recombinant enzyme we have investigated the specificity of C-DES with respect to the cyst(e)ine substrate. Formation of a substrate-derived persulfide was established using desaminocystine (S-(2-carboxyethylthio)-l-cysteine). The resultant 3-(disulfanyl)-propionic acid became stable by cyclization and was identified as 1,2-dithiolan-3-one. Part of this work was reported at the GBM Fall Meeting (Tübingen, Federal Republic of Germany, Ref. 9Lang T. Leibrecht I. Kessler D. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: S118Google Scholar). E. coli strain XL1Blue MRF′ was from Stratagene, strain PR745 was from New England Biolabs. Plasmid pUC19 and the pUC/M13 reverse sequencing primer were from Boehringer-Mannheim. The oligonucleotide probe was synthesized by R. Frank (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie, Heidelberg) and was 3′-end labeled by reaction with terminal transferase and digoxigenin-ddUTP using the labeling kit from Boehringer-Mannheim. l-Cystine was from Serva,l-cysteine·HCl·H2O from Fluka, andS-ethylcysteine, S-methylcysteine,l-djenkolic acid, and l-cystathionine were from Sigma. Other (bio)chemicals and enzymes were from Boehringer-Mannheim, New England Biolabs, Sigma, or Aldrich. Various peptides were HPLC purified from a tryptic digest of 200 pmol of C-DES from Synechocystis PCC 6714 and subjected to Edman degradation by R. Frank (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie, Heidelberg). A gas-phase sequenator and on-line identification of the phenylthiohydantoins by HPLC was employed. NH2-terminal sequencing of C-DES expressed in E. coli employed the chromatofocused fractions (see below). In general, standard procedures as described by Sambrook et al. (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used. Starting with 50 μg of total Synechocystis DNA the 7.6-kbp size fraction of a HindIII digest was ligated into pUC19. After transformation of XL1Blue MRF′ cells and growth on LB agar plates containing 80 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline, positive clones were identified on replicas using Hybond-N Nylon membranes (Amersham). Immunological detection of colonies hybridizing to the digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe was performed following the protocol provided by Boehringer-Mannheim. Subcloning of a 4.5-kbp HindIII-BamHI fragment was performed by filling in the termini followed by blunt-end ligation into pUC19 cut with SmaI. Plasmids corresponding to both orientations of the insert were obtained. They were used (after cutting at the unique SphI and XbaI sites of pUC19) to generate two subclone series by exonuclease III treatment. Partial DNA sequences of these subclones were obtained by the Sanger method employing the DNA sequencing kit (Sequenase version 2.0) and [35S]dATPαS purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham. The expression plasmid pSA16 was obtained by insertion of the 1.6 kbpSspI-AvaI fragment comprising the C-DES open reading frame plus 142 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region and 317 base pairs of the 3′-flanking region in pUC19 oriented such that C-DES gene transcription starting from the lacpromoter was permitted (see Fig. 1). E. coliPR745/pSA16 cells were grown in LB medium plus 80 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, and 10 μg/ml kanamycin with aeration for 16 h at 37 °C. The purification procedure described forSynechocystis cells as starting material was used (7Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but simplified as follows. The DEAE-Sephadex A-25 passage of the crude extract was replaced by precipitation of the nucleic acids using Polymin G-35 (BASF); chromatography on DE52 cellulose could be dispensed. Starting with 10 g of wet cells 64 mg of C-DES with a purity of ≥75% were obtained before the final chromatofocusing step, which partially resolved two C-DES species of about equal purity (≥95% by SDS-PAGE analysis) and specific activity (7 units/mg when assayed for l-cystine lyase); together they amounted about 22 mg of C-DES. Protein determination of purified C-DES was by UV absorption, using A 280 (1%) = 14.5. Cystine lyase was measured in 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.3, at 30 °C by a coupled optical assay using 0.15 μmol of PLP, 0.25 μmol of NADH, 10 μg of l-lactate dehydrogenase (500 units/mg), and 3–20 μg of C-DES in 1 ml final volume. The reaction was initiated by addition of 0.2 μmol of l-cystine. One unit was defined as the amount catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol of pyruvate/min. Where appropriate substrates other than cystine were used to initiate the reaction and the substrate amounts were varied as required. Lyase assays with l-cysteine as substrate were performed with 15 nmol of PLP; with this amount the background absorbance change which was observed after addition of l-cysteine to control samples without C-DES was avoided. Activity of C-DES with cystine as substrate was not changed with this condition. Based on the synthetic strategy described in Ref. 11Endo T. Tasai H. Ishigami T. Chem. Lett. 1975; : 813-814Crossref Google Scholarthe activated cysteine derivativeS-(2,4-dinitrophenylthio)-l-cysteine was reacted with equimolar amounts of silver acetate and the appropriate thiol component. The detailed procedure is given below for the synthesis of desaminocystine using mercaptopropionic acid; essentially the same conditions were used for cysteamine and d-cysteine. l-Cysteine·HCl·H2O (1.56 g) was colloidly dissolved in acetone (30 ml) under argon; 2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenylchloride (2.21 g) in 60 ml of acetone was added and the reaction was stirred for 15 min with precipitation of the productS-(2,4-dinitrophenylthio)-l-cysteine·HCl. The pale yellow cristals (3 g) melted at 181 °C. Silver acetate (735 mg) was stirred with dimethylformamide (30 ml) under argon. Mercaptopropionic acid (385 μl) was added and during 30 min of stirring a voluminous white solid was formed.S-(2,4-Dinitrophenylthio)-l-cysteine·HCl (1.56 g) partially dissolved in 40 ml of dimethylformamide was added which resulted in a red solution. After 2 h the solution was mixed with 130 ml of ice-cold water, stirred on ice for 30 min, and filtered. The filtrate was dried and the residue was dissolved (after several washings with dimethylformamide) in 10 ml of boiling water. The sample was filtered hot. Upon cooling, product crystals developed (80 mg) which melted at 190–192 °C with decomposition (12Schöberl A. Gräfje H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1958; 617: 71-88Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MS and1H NMR data (not shown) confirmed the expected structure.C6H11NO4S2(Mr225.28)Calculated:C31.98H4.92N6.21Found:C31.91H4.93N6.43 Yields were 14.2% for desaminocystine, 6.1% for decarboxycystine (m.p. 176–178 °C with decomposition, Ref. 12Schöberl A. Gräfje H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1958; 617: 71-88Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and 28.6% for meso-cystine (m.p. 200–220 °C with decomposition, Ref.13Loring H.S. du Vigneaud V. J. Biol. Chem. 1933; 102: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A method described for preparation of arylsulfane compounds (14Langer H.J. Hyne J.B. Can. J. Chem. 1973; 51: 3403-3411Crossref Google Scholar) was adopted. Cl2(g) was bubbled through 65 ml of CS2 at −5 °C to yield a yellow solution. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (2.19 ml in 10 ml of CS2) was dropwise added such that the solution remained yellowish. The reaction sample was concentrated to 20 ml and stored at −20 °C overnight. A dense and yellowish oil (2.2 ml) separated which was diluted with 10 ml of CS2 and added dropwise to 10 ml of liquified H2S at −78 °C. After stirring for 1 h with constant addition of H2S, the H2S stream was stopped and the reaction sample was allowed to attain room temperature. A white solid had precipitated which was recovered by centrifugation, washed with hexane, and dried (yield 0.5 g). The material was fractionated by preparative C18 reversed-phase HPLC on a Waters instrument using a Hibar RT 250-10 column (Merck) and an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (6 ml/min, 0% to 70% acetonitrile in 30 min); 3 main products (1–3, see Scheme FSI) were detected via their 210-nm absorbance. These products (130 mg of 1, 65 mg of 2 and 110 mg of3) were recovered by ether extraction and were chemically analyzed. The data and structure assignments were as follows. 1,2-Dithiolan-3-one (1), m/z 120 (M+), IR absorption (KBr) 1688 cm−1 (C=O), UV-VIS λmax(in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at 206 and 295 nm, uncharged at pH 5, m.p. 98–100 °C;C3H4OS2·0.75H2O(Mr133.69)Calculated:C27.05H4.07S47.9Found:C26.84H3.81S45.863,3′-tetrathiobispropionic acid (2), m/z274 (M+), IR 1697 cm−1 (C=O), anionic at pH 5; 3,3′-trithiobispropionic acid (3), m/z 242 (M+), IR 1698 cm−1 (C=O), anionic at pH 5. 3,3′-Dithiobispropionic acid was identified as a further component (m/z 210 (M+), IR 1699 cm−1 (C=O), anionic at pH 5) probably because oxidation of mercaptopropionic acid by Cl2 was not complete (see SchemeFSI). MS was performed on a VG ZAB-2F or a Jeol JMS-700 instrument (electron impact ionization). GC-MS analyses employed a Hewlett-Packard instrument type 5890 equipped with a HP-5 column (30 m) programmed from 40 °C (2 min) to 240 °C at 10 °C/min. The mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV. The molecular ion of 1could be observed in GC-MS analyses only (splitless injection of ≥100 nmol) since the compound decomposed upon direct MS analyses (presumably due to the water content of the preparation). Extinction coefficients (mm−1 cm−1) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were determined as follows: ε206(1) = 6.2; ε210(1) = 5.6, ε295(1) ≈ 0.9; ε210(2) = 8.6; ε210(3) = 9.4. Reactions were performed at 5 °C under argon for 2–25 min. The reaction mixtures (0.75 ml) consisted of 0.1 to 1 mm desaminocystine in 0.1 m Mes/NaOH, pH 6, containing 0.25 mm PLP; the reaction was started by addition of 0.02 to 0.2 mg of C-DES and terminated by addition of 13 μl of 2 n HCl followed by 1 ml of ether. Extraction was performed for 20 min at 0 °C under argon with vigorous stirring. After centrifugation and phase separation the aqueous phase was brought to 75 mm HClO4, neutralized with KOH, and analyzed for its pyruvate content by use of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction; the residue of the ether phase was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (ET 250/8/4 Nucleosil 5C18 column from Macherey-Nagel, 1 ml/min, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient; see Fig. 4). Compounds were identified by co-chromatography with chemically synthesized reference samples and quantified via their absorbance at 210 nm. The assignment of enzymatically formed 1,2-dithiolan-3-one was verified by GC-MS analysis as described for the chemically synthesized sample. To clone the C-DES gene from Synechocystis PCC 6714 we attempted to gain some sequence data for the purified protein. NH2-terminal sequencing failed, suggesting a blocked terminus, but some information could be obtained from tryptic peptides (see Fig. 2). Based on the peptide sequence Glu-Val-Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Ala- a 64-fold degenerate pool of oligonucleotides (17-mers) was synthesized. This probe was labeled with digoxigenin and used to analyze Southern transfers of restricted totalSynechocystis DNA. One signal for each digest was detected and the 7.6-kbp HindIII fragment was selected for the cloning experiments. After ligation into the HindIII site of pUC19 and transformation into E. coli XL1Blue MRF′, about 3000 colonies were screened to obtain two positive clones. Southern analysis of the restricted plasmids showed that they contained identical HindIII fragments. The hybridization site of the oligonucleotide probe was mapped to a 1.1-kbp EcoRI subfragment internal to a 4.5-kbp HindIII-BamHI fragment (Fig. 1). This 4.5-kbp segment was inserted in both orientations into pUC19. Using the resulting plasmids two subclone series were generated by exonuclease III treatment (see Fig. 1) from which the nucleotide sequence of the C-DES gene was obtained. An open reading frame comprising 393 amino acid residues was identified (Fig. 2), which harbored the sequence segments obtained from tryptic peptides and matched the molecular mass expected (43 kDa). A search through the data bases employing a FASTA routine (15Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) revealed only limited homologies except for the corresponding gene product (slr2143) of strain Synechocystis PCC 6803 (8Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar) which displayed 92% identity (Fig. 2). Next to the slr2143 protein the closest relatives detected were isopenicillin N-epimerases (gene name cefD; about 30% identity, 55% similarity) and NifS proteins (about 25% identity, 50% similarity). In fact the C-DES gene of Synechocystis PCC 6803 had been namedcefD (8Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar) because of this similarity, which places C-DES into the NifS family of proteins using the relaxed definition introduced by Ouzounis and Sander (16Ouzounis C. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, C-DES does not show the consensus pattern of NifS proteins in strict terms (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) because of an extra residue inserted in the PLP binding motif and lack of a cysteinyl residue located in the equivalent position to the covalent catalytic residue (Fig. 2). To express C-DES in E. coli, the 1.6-kbpSspI-AvaI fragment was cloned downstream of thelac promoter of pUC19 in the appropriate orientation to yield plasmid pSA16 (Fig. 1). Soluble C-DES was found to make up about 5% of the extract proteins obtained from pSA16 transformed E. coli PR745 cells; its cystine lyase activity (liberating pyruvate) was conveniently measured by a coupled optical assay using the lactate dehydrogenase reaction as indicator. Starting with 10 g of wet cells about 22 mg of pure C-DES were obtained which displayed UV-VIS absorption characteristics consistent with the expected content of PLP (A 420(1%) = 1.4; Ref. 17Metzler D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 485-490Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the preparation consisted of two closely related species which could be partially separated by chromatofocusing. The major species (higher pI, about 80%) showed the NH2-terminal sequence Met-Asn-Leu-Ile-Pro-, which implies usage of the GTG codon of Val-5 in the open reading frame as start codon. Preceded by 5′-CT and followed by A-3′, this GTG codon fits the known preference for initiation in Synechocystis at sites with the consensus 5′-YY(initation codon)R-3′ (18Sazuka T. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This site is most probably also used in Synechocystis cells. The minor protein species (about 20%) showed the NH2-terminal sequence Ala-Asp-Pro-Val- which implies usage of the ATG codon of Met1 in the open reading frame as start codon; the mature protein lacks the initiator methionine. Using a chromatofocused preparation of the major species theA 280 ratio of C-DES without or with 6m guanidinium chloride was found to be 1.05. Based on a molecular mass of 42,772 Da and a calculatedA 280(1%) of 13.8 for a 6 mguanidinium chloride solution (19Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar) this gives anA 280(1%) value of 14.5 for the native C-DES (major species). Both enzyme species were found to be equally active whether assayed for cystine lyase in the coupled optical assay (7 units/mg) or holoferredoxin formation (8 mg of holoferredoxin h−1mg−1). These data are congruent with the specific activity determined for the Synechocystis isolate (7Leibrecht I. Kessler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10442-10447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate the substrate requirements of C-DES, several compounds related to l-cystine were examined for pyruvate formation in the coupled optical lyase assay (TableI). Besides l-cystine,l-djenkolic acid (which also harbors twol-cysteinyl-moieties) finally yielded 2 mol of pyruvate per mol of substrate. This stoichiometry indicates further enzymatic (and possibly also spontaneous) reactions of the primary elimination products. With our attention directed to the initial reaction of C-DES with l-cystine, asymmetric derivatives thereof were considered as useful. Desaminocystine, decarboxycystine, and meso-cystine were all synthesized by reaction of the appropriate thiol with S-(2,4-dinitrophenylthio)-l-cysteine and were found to be readily accepted as substrates yielding 1 equivalent of pyruvate (Table I).Table ISubstrate properties of l-cystine and related compoundsSubstrateStructureal-Cy-S-/d-Cy-S- denotel-cysteinyl and d-cysteinyl moieties.Stoichiometric yieldKinetic parametersKmk catk cat/K mmol pyruvate/mol substratemms−1mm−1s−1l-Cystinel-Cy-S2.01.03636‖l-Cy-Sd-Cystined-Cy-S00bBelow detection limit of 0.01 s−1.‖d-Cy-SMeso-cystinel-Cy-S1.02.22913‖d-Cy-Sl-Djenkolic acidl-Cy-S2.00.75071‖l-Cy-S-CH2Desaminocystinel-Cy-S1.00.52958‖COOH-CH2-CH2-SDecarboxycystinel-Cy-S1.10.81418‖NH2-CH2-CH2-Sl-Cystathioninel-Cy-S1.01.276‖COOH-CHNH2-CH2-CH2(l)S-Ethyl-l-cysteinel-Cy-S1.17.3375‖CH3-CH2S-Methyl-l-cysteinel-Cy-S1.25.7203.5‖CH3l-Cysteinel-Cy-SH1.0—cConcentration dependence on l-cysteine as substrate did not display Michaelis-Menten characteristics.0.15dMeasured with 2 mm cysteine.Data refer to the total amount or the initial rate of pyruvate formation observed with the lactate dehydrogenase indicator reaction in the coupled optical lyase assay of C-DES (see “Experimental Procedures”).a l-Cy-S-/d-Cy-S- denotel-cysteinyl and d-cysteinyl moieties.b Below detection limit of 0.01 s−1.c Concentration dependence on l-cysteine as substrate did not display Michaelis-Menten characteristics.d Measured with 2 mm cysteine. Open table in a new tab Data refer to the total amount or the initial rate of pyruvate formation observed with the lactate dehydrogenase indicator reaction in the coupled optical lyase assay of C-DES (see “Experimental Procedures”). Besides djenkolic acid, further non-disulfidic compounds structurally related to l-cystine were examined (Table I). This revealed that C-DES activity is confined to compounds with at least onel-cysteinyl moiety and various S-substituents but not necessarily disulfides. However, l-cysteine was by far the least efficient of the compounds tested; withl-cystathionine and S-(m)ethylcysteine moderate efficiency was observed which argues against identity of C-DES with cystathionase or S-alkylcysteine-lyase. Toward identification of a persulfide product desaminocystine with its favorable kinetic properties (Table I) was selected among the substrates tested. The stoichiometric yield of 1 equivalent of pyruvate suggested formation of 3-(disulfanyl)-propionic acid which was supposed to cyclize spontaneously affording 1,2-dithiolan-3-one (1; see SchemeFSI and Fig.3) as a stable derivative of the linear persulfide. Since only small amounts of products were available from enzymatic reactions their identification was deduced by chromatographic analyses referring to chemically synthesized reference compounds. Synthesis of 3-(disulfanyl)-propionic acid from mercaptopropionic acid, as outlined in Scheme FSI, furnished a crude CS2-insoluble product which was fractionated by C18 reversed-phase HPLC and found to contain principally three components depicted in Scheme FSI: the dithiolanone1, the tetrathiobis propionic acid 2, and the trithiobis propionic acid 3. Formation of byproducts2 and 3 can be explained by bimolecular reactions of the persulfide molecules (see Scheme FSI). These latter reactions should be largely suppressed by low temperature and dilution of the reactants in the enzymatic reactions. The enzymatic conversion of desaminocystine was carried out at 5 °C and pH 6. This pH value was chosen to suppress disproportionation of the asymmetric disulfide substrate and to favor the cyclization reaction of the presumed linear persulfide product; it compromised between the stabilizing effects mentioned and the lyase activity of C-DES which is optimal at pH 8 and decreases to 6% at pH 6.0 or 9.6. The reactions were stopped by additions of HCl and ether. After thorough mixing, the phases were separated and their content analyzed (see Fig. 3). Remarkably, the sulfur-containing products (which were routinely detected and quantified by HPLC analysis) were found to be identical with chemically synthesized compounds 1 to3 (Scheme FSI and Fig. 3) despite the entirely different reaction conditions. To verify the identity of the enzymatically formed key compound 1 with 1,2-dithiolan-3-one a HPLC-purified sample of 105 nmol was analyzed by GC-MS. It proved to be indistinguishable from the chemically synthesized reference compound affording the molecular ion m/z 120 and fragmentsm/z 64 [S-S]+ and m/z 55 [O=C=CH-CH2]+ for the equivalent GC-fraction at 8.2 min of the temperature program. An approximately constant fractional amount (see below) of dithiolanone1 was found in five experiments with the initial concentration of desaminocystine being varied from 0.1 to 1 mm, the concentration of C-DES varied from 0.03 to 0.27 mg/ml and with reaction times from 2 to 10 min. (Conversion of desaminocystine was between 11 and 100% complete for these experiments.) However, shift of the reaction temperature to 25 °C with otherwise identical conditions lowered the fractional amount of1 by a factor of 1.6. Control reactions without C-DES did not yield any product. A typical experiment performed at 5 °C is presented in Figs. 3 and4. With this reaction an amount of pyruvate corresponding to complete conversion of desaminocystine was found in the aqueous phase (Fig. 3). HPLC analysis (Fig. 4) of the ether phase revealed that 71% of the sulfur-containing products (referring to"

At the molecular level, much more is known about the state of native proteins than that of their denatured counterparts. The three-dimensional structures of more than 4200 proteins have now been determined, and the number is rising rapidly (1Blundell T.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the first case of molecular structure of a denatured protein has yet to be solved. The striking disparity of our knowledge about the native and denatured proteins is hardly surprising. Unlike the native protein, which usually adopts a well defined conformation, a denatured protein consists of a collection of highly heterogeneous conformational isomers that exist in a state of equilibrium (2Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 3Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 4Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 1-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Experimentally, it will be a daunting task to isolate and analyze pure conformational isomers, not only because of the exceedingly large number of isomers that may exist but also because of their instability and rapid interconversion. Without the isolation of conformational isomers, the average of their chemical properties has been measured by most conventional methods, including gel filtration, intrinsic viscosity, light scattering, and various spectroscopic techniques (5Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. Hooker Jr., T.M. Zarlengo M.H. Salahuddin A. Aune K.C. Takagi T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Kuwajima K. Ogawa Y. Sugai S.

Eloeve G.A. Englander S.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Therefore, development of methods that may group and fractionate denatured species will represent a crucial step in the study of denatured states of proteins. In addition, there are two important issues relating to the denatured proteins that still need to be further clarified. One is the extent of unfolding of denatured proteins. There is a distinction between denaturation and unfolding (or between denatured and unfolded) (2Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Traditionally, denaturation is defined simply as conversion of the native structure to non-native (or active to inactive) structures. Measurement of denaturation curves does not really tell us the extent of unfolding of denatured proteins (7Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar, 10Shirley B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies by Tanford and colleagues (5Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. Hooker Jr., T.M. Zarlengo M.H. Salahuddin A. Aune K.C. Takagi T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1921-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that proteins denatured in the presence of 6 m GdmCl1assume a near random coil conformation (13Greene Jr., R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mounting evidence now indicates that denatured proteins do not always unfold as extensively as was once thought, even in the presence of strong denaturing conditions (14Bierzynski A. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15McWherter C.A. Hass E. Leed A.R. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Amir D. Hass E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8889-8893Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The extent of denaturation and unfolding also varies from protein to protein under the same set of denaturing conditions. The situation can be further complicated with disulfide-containing proteins. The extent of unfolding of such proteins hinges upon whether the native disulfide bonds become reduced or remain intact (17Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Evans P.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 18Houry W.A. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another issue of long standing interest is the difference between denatured states of a protein induced by heating (2Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar,3Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 19Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 233: 167-241Crossref Scopus (2201) Google Scholar) and denaturants (urea, GdmCl, or organic solvents, etc.). These differences may underline mechanisms and various forces that stabilize native proteins. In this report, I have attempted to address these issues by application of a novel method for analyzing reversible denaturation of disulfide-containing proteins (20Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the presence of denaturant and thiol catalyst, the native protein denatures by shuffling its native disulfides to form a mixture of scrambled isomers. Scrambled species are denatured structures that contain at least two non-native disulfide bonds. For proteins that contain 3 disulfide bonds, there are 14 possible denatured states of scrambled isomers. In some cases, they could be completely separated by reversed phase HPLC (21Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Chang J.-Y. Schindler P. Chatrenet B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11992-11997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A major advantage of this technique is that the scrambled isomers can be trapped by acidification, purified by HPLC, and structurally characterized. This allows quantitative analysis of the composition of various denatured species and permits a more detailed identification and description of the state of unfolding that has not been afforded with conventional methods. This novel system has been used here to examine and compare the denatured states of the tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) generated by urea, GdmCl, GdmSCN, organic solvents, and elevated temperature. TAP is a factor Xa-specific inhibitor (23Waxman L. Smith D.E. Arcuri K.E. Vlasuk G.P. Science. 1990; 248: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It includes 3 disulfides (24Sardana M. Sardana V. Rodkey J. Wood T. Ng A. Vlasuk G.P. Waxman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13560-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has a size (60 amino acids) similar to that of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Both TAP and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor belong to the Kunitz-type inhibitor and share close structural homology in terms of disulfide patterns and three-dimensional conformation (25Antuch W. Güntert P. Billeter M. Hawthorne T. Grossenbacher H. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Lim-Wilby M.S.L. Hallenga K. De Maeyer M. Lasters I. Vlasuk G.P. Brunck T.K. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TAP (CGP-55099) is a recombinant protein produced by Novartis. The protein is more than 95% pure as judged by HPLC and N-terminal sequence analysis. GdmCl, GdmSCN, urea, acetonitrile, ethanol, and 2-mercaptoethanol were products of Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) with purity of greater than 99%. The protein (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in the Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea, GdmCl, GdmSCN, or organic solvents) or subjected to selected denaturing conditions (elevated temperature). When using denaturants, the reaction was typically performed at 23 °C for 20 h. In the case of heat denaturation, the reaction was carried out within 90 min (55 °C) and 45 min (69 °C). To monitor the kinetics and intermediates of unfolding, aliquots of the sample were removed in a time course manner, quenched with 4% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by HPLC. The denatured sample was subsequently acidified with an equal volume of 4% trifluoroacetic acid and stored at −20 °C. The completion of denaturation, under a given denaturing condition, implies that conversion of the native species to the scrambled species has reached a state of equilibrium. This state of equilibrium also includes those among scrambled species. Two major criteria are applied here to ensure that denaturation has reached equilibrium. One is time course kinetics analysis, which indicates that conversion of the native TAP to a scrambled species has reached a plateau and the ratio of scrambled to native species remains constant during prolonged incubation. These results have revealed that denaturation of TAP by denaturants (in the presence of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was completed generally within 4–6 h. Nonetheless, the reaction has been routinely allowed to proceed overnight (20 h). In the case of thermal denaturation, there are inherent difficulties in performing prolonged kinetic analysis because of the heat-induced decomposition of disulfide bonds. Another method to verify the completion of denaturation is to renature (refold) fully reduced/denatured TAP under the same conditions that denature the native TAP. Both renaturation and denaturation are expected to reach the same state of equilibrium and generate end products that consist of the same ratio of scrambled to the native species (20Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25661-25666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of denaturation at every given condition was simply calculated from the fraction of TAP (using HPLC peak area integration) that is converted to the scrambled species. These data were then used to construct the denaturation curves. Isolated fractions of scrambled TAP (∼10 μg) were treated with 1 μg of thermolysin in 30 μl of N-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.4). Digestion was carried out at 23 °C for 16 h. Peptides were then isolated by HPLC and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the disulfide-containing peptides. The disulfide content of scrambled proteins was determined by the dabsyl chloride precolumn derivatization method (27Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which permits direct quantification of the disulfide bonds of proteins. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed with a Hewlett-Packard G-1000A sequencer. The matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometer was a home-built time of flight instrument with a nitrogen laser of 337-nm wavelength and 3-ns pulse width. The calibration was performed either externally or internally, by using standard proteins (hypertensin, M r1031.19 and calcitonin, M r 3418.91). To simplify the description of scrambled species of TAP, they are designated by the following: X-TAP-(species assigned on HPLC), where X stands for scrambled. For instance, X-TAP-a represents speciesa of scrambled tick anticoagulant peptide. Denaturation and unfolding (denatured and unfolded) are not synonymous terms. In this report, denaturation defines only the conversion of the native structure to the non-native structure (scrambled species), whereas unfolding describes the state of the denatured protein. For instance, the potency of a denaturant to denature TAP is determined by the fraction of TAP that is converted to scrambled species after the reaction has reached equilibrium. On the other hand, the potency of a denaturant to unfold TAP is determined by the composition of scrambled species and specifically by the recovery of the most extensively unfolded scrambled species (X-TAP-a). In addition, potency and efficiency have been used alternatively to compare GdmCl and urea. Potency of a denaturant is defined by the extent of protein denaturation (and unfolding) as the reaction has reached a state of equilibrium. Efficiency is related to the kinetics (rate constant) of unfolding. Along the reversible pathways of unfolding and refolding of TAP (21Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 69-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), 11 fractions of X-TAP have been detected as intermediates. Among them, there exist seven major fractions that constitute more than 90% of the total concentration of X-TAP. Four of them were structurally characterized (28Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11702-11709Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An additional three fractions, e,h, and i, have been isolated here. They were digested by thermolysin at pH 6.5. Peptides were then isolated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry. Each was shown to consist of a single species. Their disulfide structures, presented in Fig. 1, are the basis for the examination of denatured states of TAP. Denaturation of the native TAP was analyzed in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea, GdmCl, and GdmSCN. The resultant denaturation curves are shown in Fig.2. GdmSCN is more potent than GdmCl and urea. Based on the concentration that is required to achieve the same extent of denaturation, GdmSCN is about 2.5-fold more potent than GdmCl, whereas urea and GdmCl display almost indistinguishable potency in denaturing native TAP. Indeed, at a low concentration of denaturant (3 m), urea is actually more potent than GdmCl. The comparable potency of urea and GdmCl in denaturing native TAP provides a useful case for further analysis of the kinetics of denaturation. TAP can be almost fully denatured (>94%) by both urea and GdmCl at concentrations ranging from 6 to 8 m (Fig. 2). However, the kinetics of its denaturation are dependent upon the concentration of the denaturant. At 8 m urea, the rate constant of denaturation, which was measured to be 0.0137 min−1, is about 1.5- and 3-fold greater than that performed at 7 and 6 m urea. With GdmCl, the rate constants differ only slightly: 0.0138 min−1, 8 m GdmCl; 0.0163 min−1, 7 m GdmCl; and 0.0115 min−1, 6 m GdmCl. Surprisingly, the rate constant of TAP denaturation at 7 m GdmCl is somewhat greater than that performed at 8 m GdmCl. This marginal difference is well reproducible. Examination of the composition of denatured TAP reveals the differential potency and distinct mode of actions of urea and GdmCl (Fig. 3). Using GdmCl and GdmSCN as the agents, denatured TAP consists of four well populated scrambled species, a, d, g, and e. In contrast, only two of them, d and g, predominate in the urea solution. In comparing these two sets of denatured structures (urea versus GdmCl), one notices that the composition of urea-denatured TAP resembles that of the folding intermediates of GdmCl-denatured TAP (Fig.4). When X-TAP produced by 6m GdmCl was allowed to refold, X-TAP-a and X-TAP-e decreased rapidly. This suggests that TAP adopts a more advanced state of unfolding in the GdmCl and GdmSCN solutions and that X-TAP-a and X-TAP-e are highly unfolded species that become well populated only under these conditions. Furthermore, the pattern of X-TAP does not always remain constant under the same denaturant. The relative yield of X-TAP-a/X-TAP-g increases from 0.16 to 0.4 as the concentration of urea doubles from 4 to 8 m. At the same time, the concentration of X-TAP-a as a fraction of the total X-TAP increases almost linearly from 9 to 16.5% (Fig.5). The increase of X-TAP-a is even more dramatic in the cases of GdmCl and GdmSCN denaturation (Fig.5). The results thus indicate that the recovery of X-TAP-ais related to the strength of denaturing conditions and can be used to plot the unfolding curves of TAP (Fig. 5). These unfolding curves are distinguished from the denaturation curves shown in Fig. 2.Figure 4Renaturation (refolding) of X-TAP that are generated by 6 m GdmCl (top panel) and heating (55 oC, l h) (bottom panel). The denatured samples were acidified with 4% trifluoroacetic acid, desalted, and freeze-dried. To initiate folding, the samples were reconstituted in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.25 mm). The folding intermediates were trapped in a time course manner with 4% trifluoroacetic acid and were analyzed by HPLC using the conditions described in the legend of Fig.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Recoveries of X-TAP-a as a fraction of the total denatured TAP under different denaturing conditions.

The data should be allowed a standard deviation of ±5%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Organic solvents promote denaturation of proteins presumably through association with the hydrophobic residues of the protein, thereby disrupting hydrophobic bonding. As for urea and GdmCl, the potency of organic solvents in denaturing proteins depends on their concentration. Therefore, denaturation of TAP was also characterized in the presence of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile and ethanol. The denaturation curves obtained with both organic solvents are included in Fig. 2. The denaturation potency of acetonitrile is about 2–3-fold that of ethanol. Although the maximum extent of TAP denaturation in the presence of a high concentration of acetonitrile (9.6 m, 50% by volume) reaches 90%, it is only close to 60% in the buffer containing 8.6 m (50% by volume) ethanol. Beyond 50% content of acetonitrile or ethanol (by volume) in the buffer, TAP will increasingly precipitate. Several important features can be concluded from the composition of X-TAP generated by organic solvents (Fig.6). 1) The denatured TAP comprises only two well populated species of scrambled isomers, X-TAP-d and X-TAP-g. 2) The recovery of X-TAP-a, similar to the cases of urea and GdmCl unfolding, is dependent upon the concentration of the organic solvent. The content of X-TAP-aas a percentage of the total X-TAP increases from 2 to 14% as the concentration of acetonitrile rises from 4 to 8 m (Fig. 6). 3) In the case of ethanol or at low concentration of acetonitrile, small but significant amounts of X-TAP-h and X-TAP-i are detected (Fig. 6). These two species contain disulfide loops that are twice the size of that of X-TAP-dand X-TAP-g (Fig. 1). X-TAP-h and X-TAP-i accumulate during the pathway of refolding of GdmCl-denatured TAP (Fig. 4). Apparently, they adopt structures more compact than that of X-TAP-d, X-TAP-g, or X-TAP-a. 4) The denaturation curve and the composition of X-TAP generated by acetonitrile resemble those produced by urea. A time course denaturation of the native TAP at 55 °C is shown in the left panel of Fig. 6. The extent of TAP denaturation reaches a plateau after about 1 h. Prolonged incubation leads to the decomposition of scrambled species, as judged by their HPLC patterns. The rate of denaturation increases by 3-fold as the temperature rises from 55 to 69 °C (Fig. 6). The process of thermal denaturation is reversible. As the sample was removed from the heating block and placed at room temperature, X-TAP renatured spontaneously to form the native structure (Fig. 4). The composition of heat-induced X-TAP is different from those generated by denaturants. It comprises all seven identified X-TAPs. Aside from the presence of X-TAP-h and X-TAP-i, the recovery of X-TAP-a is surprisingly high. For the samples that are denatured at 55 and 69 °C, the content of X-TAP-aaccounts for 17 and 21% of the total X-TAP, respectively. These are 60 and 90% higher than the content of X-TAP-a found in the sample denatured by 7.7 m acetonitrile. Another characteristic of heat-induced X-TAP is the existence of approximately 4% X-TAP-e, which populates well only in the presence of GdmCl and GdmSCN but is barely detectable in solutions containing urea or acetonitrile. Furthermore, a systematic study has been performed to investigate the combined effect of denaturant and temperature. In every case, the addition of high temperature has resulted in a dramatic increase of the yield of X-TAP-a to the extent that a sequential denaturation by 6 m GdmSCN (7 h at 23 °C) and elevated temperature (69 °C, 15 min) denatured more than 99.5% of the native TAP with 85% of the denatured species adopting the disulfide structure of X-TAP-a. Protein stabilizers are compounds (salts, sugars, amino acids, etc.) used to preserve the native conformation of proteins in solution (29Timasheff S.N. Arakawa T. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 331-345Google Scholar). Their presence is known to shift the equilibrium constant of N (native)/D (denatured) in favor of the native structure. Two commonly used protein stabilizers, NaCl and lysine, were examined here. They were compared specifically for their ability to inhibit the denaturation of TAP by urea (8 m), GdmCl (6 m), acetonitrile (7.7m), and high temperature (55 or 69 °C). The results show that NaCl and lysine are able to effectively inhibit all denaturing conditions, with the exception of GdmCl (Fig.7). The extent of inhibition is, in general, inversely related to the potency of denaturing conditions. For instance, in the presence of 1 m NaCl, the extent of TAP denaturation by 8 m urea and 7.7 m acetonitrile is reduced by 42 and 81%, respectively, whereas the denaturation by 6m GdmCl remains practically unaffected (Fig. 7). Indeed, even at 4 m GdmCl that denatures only 50% of TAP, the inhibitory effect of NaCl (1 m) is still undetectable. The patterns of X-TAP denatured by urea and acetonitrile are not affected by the presence of NaCl. In both cases, X-TAP-d and X-TAP-g remain as predominant species. Further experiments demonstrate that NaCl not only inhibits but also reverses the denaturation of TAP. For instance, X-TAP renatures spontaneously in the presence of 6 m urea and thiol catalyst to form the native structure as NaCl (1 m) is added in the solution (data not shown). Denatured TAP consists of disulfide isomers that exist in equilibrium and adopt varied degrees of unfolding. There is a remarkable variation in the size of disulfide loops among the seven species of X-TAP that have been isolated and structurally characterized (Fig. 1). The order of the combined size of the three disulfide loops (calculated by the number of amino acid residues separating the two cysteines that form the disulfide) is as follows: N-TAP (100 amino acids) = X-TAP-i (100 amino acids) = X-TAP-h (100 amino acids) > X-TAP-f (88 amino acids) > X-TAP-e (56 amino acids) = X-TAP-g (56 amino acids) > X-TAP-d (52 amino acids) > X-TAP-a (20 amino acids). Those with large disulfide loops (X-TAP-i, -h, and -f) presumably assume a more compact conformation and thermodynamically might be stabilized by additional noncovalent interactions (either native or non-native like). This proposition is supported by two key observations. 1) The concentrations of X-TAP-i, -h, and -f become significant only under mild denaturing conditions (Figs. 6). 2) X-TAP-i, h,and f are the three major species that accumulate along the pathway of the refolding of GdmCl-denatured TAP (Fig. 4). In contrast, X-TAP-a, which contains the smallest disulfide loops, represents the most extensively unfolded form of scrambled TAP. When GdmCl is removed from the sample, the concentration of X-TAP-a decreases precipitously along the pathway of refolding (Fig. 4). Most strikingly, the recovery of X-TAP-a, as a fraction of the total X-TAP, is invariably determined by the strength and concentration of the denaturant. This has been observed with all denaturants investigated here (Fig. 5). Thus, recovery of X-TAP-a signals the extent of unfolding of the denatured TAP. This work therefore provides a useful method for measuring the extent of unfolding of the denatured protein. However, it is important to point out that the property observed with TAP may not necessarily apply to other disulfide-containing proteins. Proper spacing of cysteines in the sequence of a protein will probably be a major prerequisite. Another important finding of this study is the demonstration that different denaturants each produce a unique pattern of the structure of denatured TAP (see Figs. 3 and 6). The differences reflect both their relative potency to denature the native TAP, as well as their relative ability to unfold the denatured species. The results are best illustrated by the comparison of urea and GdmCl. 1) Both GdmCl and urea denature the native TAP not only with similar potency (Fig. 2) but also with nearly indistinguishable kinetics. This property is somehow unexpected because of the general experience that GdmCl is more potent than urea (7Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). Indeed, some disulfide-containing proteins, such as hirudin and epidermal growth factor, can be practically denatured only with GdmCl. For hirudin, GdmCl is 9-fold more potent than urea (data not shown). In the widely investigated case of ribonuclease A, the potency of GdmCl as a denaturant exceeds that of urea by 2.5–3-fold. These results, therefore, demonstrate that the relative potency of GdmCl and urea in denaturing the native structures can vary substantially from protein to protein. 2) Despite their comparable potency to denature native TAP, GdmCl is definitely more potent than urea in unfolding TAP. This is illustrated by the distinctive compositions of X-TAP generated by both denaturants (Fig. 3) and by the significantly higher recovery of X-TAP-a with GdmCl denaturation (Fig. 5). 3) Urea and GdmCl also differ in their interactions with protein stabilizers (co-solvents). Whereas NaCl (1m) can drastically inhibit the denaturation of TAP by 8m urea, it does not interfere with the TAP denaturation by 6 m GdmCl at all. These results thus indicate that NaCl is able to counteract the destabilizing effect of urea but not that of GdmCl. Urea and GdmCl are the two commonly used denaturants in protein chemistry (3Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 7Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar, 10Shirley B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 40: 177-190PubMed Google Scholar, 13Greene Jr., R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the chemical mechanism is not fully understood, it is known that GdmCl and urea act by disrupting noncovalent interactions that stabilize the native protein (2Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The existing evidence suggests that they cause water to become a better solvent for nonpolar amino acids and thus weaken the hydrophobic interaction, a dominant force of protein folding and stability (30Dill K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). GdmCl, being a salt, also suppresses electrostatic interactions among charged groups of proteins. Pace and co-workers (31Pace C.N. Laurents D.V. Thomson J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2564-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) have further shown that the unfolded states of proteins in urea and GdmCl solutions differ significantly in the extent of their interaction with denaturants. Liepinsh and Otting (32Liepinsh E. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 9670-9674Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that urea binds preferentially to the pockets and grooves on the surfaces of proteins. The data presented here further indicate that urea and GdmCl act with two distinct modes of mechanism. These differences most likely reflect a differential capacity in neutralizing various noncovalent forces (hydrogen bonding, ion pairing, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions) that stabilize native proteins. Thermal unfolding has not been widely applied in the experiments of reversible denaturation of proteins because of the risk of disrupting covalent structures that often leads to the irreversible denaturation of proteins (33Zale S.E. Klibanov A.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5432-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For disulfide-containing proteins, it has been shown that the combination of high temperature and alkaline pH can induce base-catalyzed β-elimination of disulfide bonds (34Volkin D.B. Klibanov A.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Function. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 1-24Google Scholar). This side reaction, which may occur even at mild alkaline pH of 8–9, causes native proteins to form a mixture of highly heterogeneous polymers that are intra- and intermolecularly cross-linked by lanthionine and lysinoalanine (35Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10839-10843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of TAP, denaturation at 55 and 69 °C is preferably carried out within 20 and 90 min, respectively, to avoid possible destruction of disulfide bonds. Conditions selected here allow the reversible renaturation of heat-denatured TAP. The molecular composition of heat-denatured X-TAP is distinguished from that produced by various denaturants. The most intriguing aspect about the structure of heat-denatured TAP is the simultaneous presence of extensively unfolded isomers (X-TAP-a and X-TAP-e) and compact isomers (X-TAP-h and X-TAP-i). In solutions containing strong denaturants (GdmSCN and GdmCl), the denatured TAP attains a more advanced stage of unfolding. Therefore, X-TAP-a and X-TAP-epopulate well , but X-TAP-h and X-TAP-i are absent (Fig. 3). In solutions with mild denaturants (e.g.6.9 m ethanol), X-TAP-h and X-TAP-iappear, and the concentrations of X-TAP-a and X-TAP-e decrease accordingly. Coexistence of these four X-TAPs as found in heat-denatured TAP is somehow unique. Again, these data imply the complexity of noncovalent interactions that stabilize native TAP and indicate that the mechanism of thermal denaturation clearly differs from that of denaturants. The conclusion of this study is based on the premise that the relative distribution of scrambled isomers of TAP reflects merely the relative degree of unfolding of the conformational ensemble present in the selected denaturing condition. It is important to mention that the chemistry of the disulfide interchange is thermodynamically linked to the conformational ensemble, and this thermodynamic linkage could potentially alter the preferred conformational ensemble that exists in the absence of a disulfide interchange. It is also relevant to point out that disulfide bonding signals only a small fraction of the total conformational states of denatured proteins. A given disulfide isomer, such as X-TAP-g, may still consist of many conformational isomers. Nonetheless, the ability to fractionate unfolded disulfide isomers, as demonstrated here with the case of TAP, provides a very useful tool to differentiate the state of denatured proteins and permits quantitative analysis of the denaturation curve and unfolding curve separately. I appreciate the critical and useful comments of Dr. Dietmar G. Braun on this manuscript. I am also grateful to the insightful comment of the reviewer on the fundamental premise that this study is based upon.

Transposable DNA elements occur widely in nature and have important roles in evolution, chromosome mutagensis, and gene transfer. Common to all transposable elements is a need to fix transposition at low levels to avoid excessive mutagenesis of the host genome. Transposition is a multistep process involving nucleoprotein intermediates which is catalyzed by an element-encoded transposase (Tnp).1 The first step is the specific binding of Tnp to short transposon DNA end sequences that are inverted repeats. Synapsis follows such that Tnp-Tnp interactions bridge the ends. Subsequently, the DNA cutting and joining reactions of transposition occur (for a review, see Ref. 1Mizuuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21273-21276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of transposon Tn5, Tnp completely releases the element from the donor DNA molecule before inserting it into a target DNA site (2Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Tn5 is a 5.8-kilobase composite transposon found in Gram-negative bacteria which consists of two insertion sequences, IS50R and IS50L (for reviews, see Refs. 3Berg D.E. Berg D.E. Howe M.H. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 186-212Google Scholar and 4Reznikoff W.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 945-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insertion sequences, 1.5 kilobases in length, are very nearly identical and are arranged in inverted orientation flanking a central region containing antibiotic resistance genes. The outermost ends of the Tn5 transposon overall are 19-bp inverted repeats called outside ends (OE). IS50R encodes a 53-kDa Tnp protein, 476 amino acids in length, and a 48-kDa inhibitor protein (Inh), 421 amino acids in length. Inh is encoded in the same reading frame as Tnp but is transcribed from a separate promoter and is translated from a distinct initiation codon such that Inh lacks the first 55 amino acids of Tnp. Inh, apparently, does not bind to OE DNA, as does Tnp (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it can participate in a three-molecule complex with an OE-bound Tnp monomer (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6York D. Reznikoff W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whereas Tnp acts in cis (i.e. acts on local DNA sequences relative to its own gene), Inh is a trans-acting factor that functions post-translationally to form nonproductive complexes with Tnp (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tnp has also been shown to function as a self-inhibitor intrans (7DeLong A. Syvanen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8Wiegand T.W. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Tnp and Inh are folded similarly in terms of gross secondary and tertiary structure (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and thus the convention for numbering the primary amino acid sequence of Inh is based on the Tnp primary sequence (i.e. the initiating methionine of Inh is referred to as residue 56). Tnp and Inh share two distinct dimerization domains 2D. R. Davies, L. A. M. Braam, H. Holden, W. S. Reznikoff, and I. Rayment, in preparation.2D. R. Davies, L. A. M. Braam, H. Holden, W. S.

Biol. 1994; 241: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), one of which is located at the COOH terminus and the other near amino acids 114–314. Correlating with the fact that Inh-DNA binding has not been detected, the NH2 terminus of Tnp has been implicated in OE DNA recognition (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Weinreich M.D. Mahnke-Braam L. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol.

A series of NH2-terminal point mutations at residues 41, 47, and 54 in Tnp has been shown to enhance OE DNA binding affinity or specificity (11Zhou M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also, OE DNA can protect the first 113 amino acids of Tnp against proteolysis (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the deletion of a very short part of the NH2 terminus disrupts Tnp-DNA binding (10Weinreich M.D. Mahnke-Braam L. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additionally, a predicted helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif is present in the NH2-terminal region at residues 35–54. 3A. S. Silbergleit, V. A. Lanzov, and N. Benuch, personal communication.3A. S. Silbergleit, V. A. Lanzov, and N. Benuch, personal communication. Tnp regions constituting a conserved catalytic domain have been predicted and verified within proteolysis-resistant segments spanning amino acids 93–217 (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1283-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).2 Part of the catalytic domain, therefore, overlaps with the more NH2-terminal of the two known dimerization regions.In vitro, Tnp is the only protein necessary for the catalysis of transposition in the presence of divalent metal ions (2Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Many transposition systems are regulated negatively by repression of transcription, regulation of translation, innate Tnp instability or inactivity, or by accessory protein competition for DNA binding; however, transposase inhibition by nonproductive multimerization may be unique to Tn5, especially in prokaryotic systems. Here, the molecular mechanism of Tn5 inhibition is explored. We demonstrate a critical importance of the COOH terminus of Tnp/Inh for inhibition in vitro. Because the two proteins are nearly identical, the structure of the inactive complex bound to DNA could provide clues to the nature of functional transposition complexes. An alternative hypothesis separates the inhibitory and synaptic functions of the Tnp protein into distinct regions, inhibition at the COOH terminus and synapsis at an unknown location. Furthermore, we find that the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of either Tnp or Inh are in close contact or proximity, and we discuss possible functional consequences of this structural arrangement. The overexpression and purification of Inh and Tnp in Escherichia coli have been described previously (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TnpEK54/LP372 was purified similarly except Heparin HyperD (BioSepra) was used during the heparin chromatography step. Based on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, Inh was >95% pure, Tnp was >90% pure, and TnpEK54/LP372 was >95% pure. The proteins were stored in 0.4m NaCl TEG (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) at −70 °C. Fusion protein vectors encoding a 41-amino acid leader sequence with a His6 tag and a protein kinase recognition site were constructed for Inh, InhEQ451, InhAD466, InhΔ430 (a COOH-terminal deletion), and Tnp using tailed EcoRI-containing primers with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) polymerase chain reactions (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The template for the InhEQ451 construct was pRZ622 (13Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 63: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For InhAD466, the A466D mutation was introduced as a mismatch in one of the primers. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Research Genetics. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested withEcoRI and were ligated into the EcoRI site in pET33b(+) (Novagen). The fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and were purified as described previously (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). His6-Inh, InhEQ451, and InhAD466 protein samples were >95% pure based on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. His6-InhΔ430 was partially purified. The proteins were stored in 0.4 m NaCl HEG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) at −70 °C. The in vitro assay for Tn5 transposition has been described (2Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar); however, we used modified OE with mutations at positions 10, 11, 12, and 15 which are hyperactive (14Zhou M. Bhasin A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in conjunction with a modified DNA substrate useful for the detection of cleavage events. This 4-kilobase DNA substrate, pUC19 (15Yanishch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar)-based pGRST2, contains 1.3 kilobases of “transposon” DNA consisting of the kanamycin resistance gene from Tn903flanked by the modified OE 19-bp ends. A unique XhoI restriction site is located 180 bp from one transposon end within the transposon. The functional version of Tnp used in this assay has a double mutation, E54K/L372P, which renders a hyperactive,trans-active transposition phenotype. Transposition reactions contained 0.1 m potassium glutamate, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mmMg2+, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm spermidine, 100 μg/ml tRNA, 50 mm NaCl, 34 nm pGRST2 supercoiled plasmid DNA, 0.21 μm TnpEK54/LP372, and various concentrations of Inh, His6-Inh, or His6-InhAD466. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. XhoI (Promega) was added, and the reactions were incubated further at 37 °C for 1 h. SDS was added to 0.5%, and the reactions were heated to 68 °C for 15 min. Loading dyes were added, and the reactions were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE electrophoresis buffer. The gels were stained with SYBR Green (Molecular Probes) and were analyzed by fluoroimaging. The potential for homodimerization of Tnp or Inh was assayed by gel filtration. In the presence of 10% glycerol, Inh was tested in 0.1 m and 0.4m NaCl, whereas Tnp was tested in 0.4 m NaCl only because of its tendency to precipitate at lower salt concentrations. For these studies, a Toyopearl TSK HW 55 superfine (Supelco) 200-ml column was equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl or 0.4 m NaCl TEG and was calibrated with molecular weight markers (Sigma). 1 ml of a 0.5 mg/ml protein sample was applied to the column, and each sample was chromatographed at 0.5 ml/min. An additional study was conducted in which Inh was chromatographed at low salt concentrations in the absence of glycerol. For this experiment, a Bio-Gel P-100 (Bio-Rad) 150-ml column was equilibrated with 0.1m NaCl TE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA) and was calibrated with molecular weight markers (Sigma). A 2-ml sample of 0.5 mg/ml Inh was chromatographed at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by Bradford assay, and logarithmic plots of elution volume/void volume versus peak fraction were used for molecular weight calculations. 9 μl of His6-protein samples of Inh, Tnp, InhEQ451, or InhAD466, 0.1 mg/ml in 0.4 m NaCl HEG each, were mixed with 1 μl of freshly diluted 0.1% or 1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma). The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for various times. 1 μl of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added along with 3 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 68 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad) (analyzed by fluoroimaging) or Coomassie Blue. A GST-Tnp fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli DH5α using expression vector pRZ4779 4Constructed by M. D. Weinreich. based on pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As a negative control, GST was expressed from pGEX-2T. 1-liter cultures containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase, and protein synthesis was induced with 300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1.5 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of 0.3 m NaCl TEG and were lysed using a French Press at 16,000 p.s.i. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 0.5-ml samples of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in 0.4 mNaCl TEG, were added to 2.5 ml of the lysates, and the reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed five times with 0.1% milk powder, 0.4 m NaCl TEG. 100 μl of 1.0 mg/ml Inh was added to 50% bound-bead suspensions, and the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The beads were washed with 0.4m NaCl TEG, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 1 min. Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For qualitative comparisons with and without DNA, His6-Inh was labeled at the fusion kinase site with [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 200 μl of 50% suspensions of GST-Tnp-bound beads (approximately 5 μg/ml in GST-Tnp) equilibrated in 0.2 m NaCl TEG was mixed with 90 μl of 200 mm potassium glutamate. 10 μl of a 29-bp OE-containing DNA fragment (9Braam L.A.M.

The beads were washed twice with 0.2 m NaCl TEG, then they were resuspended with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE loading dyes and boiled for 1 min. Supernatants were analyzed with 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried, imaged, and quantitated by PhosphorImaging. 1 μl of His6-Inh, His6-InhAD466, or His6-InhEQ451, 0.1 mg/ml each, or 1 μl of a partially purified His6-InhΔ430 preparation (0.1 mg/ml in fusion protein) or mock preparation was incubated in 20-μl reactions containing 0.7 μg/ml of a32P-labeled, 60-bp, OE-containing DNA fragment (10Weinreich M.D. Mahnke-Braam L.

The gels were analyzed by autoradiography. An in vitro assay for Tn5 transposition has been developed which utilizes two point mutations in Tnp, E54K and L372P, to promote both general andtrans activities of the otherwise inactive transposasein vitro (2Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and we tested Inh for inhibitory activity in this system. The results of an in vitro transposition assay performed in the presence of various concentrations of Inh are shown in Fig. 1. We show that the addition of increasing amounts of Inh produces increasing inhibition. As the molar ratio of Inh:Tnp approaches 1, transposition, as measured by donor backbone excision, is near zero. Moreover, the inhibitory effect is strong; 50% inhibition is achieved with a molar ratio of approximately 1:3 to 1:4, Inh:Tnp. We know that the inhibition is not the result of nonspecific effects because a mutant Inh protein (InhAD466), added in equal concentrations relative to Inh, was found to have no inhibitory effect (this result is discussed below). If we assume that functional synapsis is required for cleavage and that synapsis is the result of one monomer of Tnp binding to each OE followed by Tnp-Tnp dimerization, then the inhibition experiment suggests inhibition before synapsis because one molecule is capable of inhibiting multiple molecules of Tnp. For example, one Inh monomer should be sufficient to prevent the formation of one synapse if it can heterodimerize with one Tnp monomer that is bound to one transposon end, even if the other end is bound by another Tnp monomer. This hypothesis assumes that the nonproductive complex is relatively strong, and it does not rule out Inh-Tnp interactions prior to Tnp-OE binding which might contribute to inhibition. The potential for homodimerization of Inh or Tnp was addressed by both gel filtration and covalent protein-protein cross-linking to probe the role of multimerization in transposition or inhibition. The results of gel filtration experiments conducted under various solution conditions are presented in Table I. We have found that in the presence of glycerol (with buffer containing 0.1 mNaCl) Inh can homodimerize, as has been shown previously (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the absence of glycerol (with buffer containing 0.1 mNaCl) Inh is predominantly monomeric. At higher salt concentrations (with buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and glycerol) Inh homodimerizes, whereas Tnp is predominantly monomeric. Glutaraldeyde cross-linking was used to confirm the homodimerization of Inh. Fig.2 demonstrates that in the presence of 0.01% glutaraldehyde (with buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and glycerol) His6-Inh cross-links into homodimers, whereas in 0.1% glutaraldehyde, His6-Inh cross-links into a mixture of homodimers and higher order multimers (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 5). Next, we tested His6-Tnp in a glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiment and found that, in contrast to His6-Inh, His6-Tnp did not cross-link into dimers and remained relatively monomeric while exhibiting some aggregation, as deduced by the appearance of His6-Tnp in the wells of the polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2 B). The relative instability of Tnp and its propensity for aggregation have been observed by us and by others and correlates with a tendency toward precipitation at lower salt concentrations. In summary, both the gel filtration and cross-linking experiments indicate that Inh homodimerizes whereas Tnp is monomeric. Furthermore, the dimerization of Inh is facilitated by glycerol and is relatively insensitive to salt, suggesting that hydrophobic effects may be important at the dimer interface. Finally, because Inh lacks a short part of the Tnp NH2 terminus, we speculate that the NH2-terminal region of Tnp interferes with Inh-like homodimerization.Table IGel filtration results of Inh or Tnp analyzed under various conditionsTris-HCl bufferMajor peakResultkDaInh0.1 mNaCl52MonomerInh0.1 mNaCl, 10% glycerol109DimerInh0.4 m NaCl, 10% glycerol110DimerTnp0.4 m NaCl, 10% glycerol54MonomerThe expected molecular masses are as follows: Inh monomer, 47.6 kDa; Inh dimer, 95.2 kDa; Tnp monomer, 53.3 kDa; Tnp dimer, 106.6 kDa. Open table in a new tab The expected molecular masses are as follows: Inh monomer, 47.6 kDa; Inh dimer, 95.2 kDa; Tnp monomer, 53.3 kDa; Tnp dimer, 106.6 kDa. Interactions between Inh and Tnp have been reported using a gel shift assay in which Tnp is bound to one molecule of OE DNA (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6York D. Reznikoff W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); here, we have sought any heterodimer interactions that might occur in the absence of DNA. We used a pull-down assay in which GST-Tnp was immobilized onto glutathione beads before incubation with Inh. Then, the beads were washed and analyzed for retained protein. The assay was performed under the same conditions in which Inh is known to dimerize, whereas Tnp is monomeric (0.4m NaCl with glycerol). Fig.3 A shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins recovered from this assay. We find that Inh is immobilized only in the presence of GST-Tnp, and we conclude that Inh heterodimerizes with Tnp. Because two modes of heterodimerization have now been observed (free and DNA-bound heterodimers), we repeated the pull-down assays to reveal any differences between dimerization in the presence of OE DNA and dimerization in the absence of DNA. To accomplish this, immobilized GST-Tnp was incubated with or without a 3-fold molar excess of OE DNA before the addition of 32P-labeled His6-Inh. The amount of resulting immobilized 32P-labeled His6-Inh was then measured and was found to be consistently higher in the presence of OE DNA (Fig. 3 B) (variability was observed between experiments probably because of differential washing times; the error in independent experiments conducted in duplicate was 3%). Nonspecific DNA also increased the immobilization of32P-labeled His6-Inh (data not shown) although to a lesser extent than OE DNA. In summary, because more Inh was found to bind to GST-Tnp in the presence of DNA, we hypothesize that the DNA-bound heterodimer is relatively more stable than the free heterodimer. To address whether Inh could heterodimerize with TnpEK54/LP372 (the mutant protein used in thein vitro transposition/inhibition assay), a gel mobility shift experiment was performed in which Inh was added to Tnp-DNA binding reactions (the Inh was added last, but the order of addition has no effect on complex formation 5D. York and W. S. Reznikoff, unpublished data.In such assays, Tnp exhibits little or no monomeric binding, except in cases in which a COOH-terminal truncation of Tnp is present (6York D. Reznikoff W.S.

However, the addition of Inh is known to promote strongly the binding of Tnp into a heterodimeric complex that contains one DNA molecule (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6York D. Reznikoff W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In Fig.4, the results of a gel shift assay with radiolabeled OE DNA are presented. The heterodimeric complex bound to one molecule of DNA is stimulated in the presence of the Inh fusion protein (compare lanes 2 and 3, Fig.4). This experiment confirms that Inh heterodimerizes with TnpEK54/LP372 in a DNA-bound complex, and we suspect that this complex may be important for inhibition. The addition of Inh also appears to increase the complexes remaining in the well. This is a variable result that is thought to be an artifact of Tnp aggregation. A hypertransposing mutation in Tnp and Inh, E451Q, has been identified previously in vivo (13Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 63: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) which, because of its location near one of the known dimerization domains, was predicted to function through a reduction in inhibitory regulation of Tn5 transposition (9Braam L.A.M. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We studied this mutation in the context of His6-Inh for dimerization and for inhibitory activity. Gel shift analysis with TnpEK54/LP372 (data not shown) revealed that His6-InhEQ451 could heterodimerize with Tnp-DNA as efficiently as His6-Inh. In addition, cross-linking experiments indicated that His6-InhEQ451 could homodimerize (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4and 6). Furthermore, His6-InhEQ451 was found to inhibit TnpEK/LP in vitro to the same extent as His6-Inh (data not shown). Thus, residue 451 is apparently not involved in either Inh-like homodimerization, Inh-Tnp-DNA heterodimerization or inhibition, as thought previously. However, recent structural studies of Inh may explain why E451Q does not disrupt dimerization. These studies reveal a COOH-terminal dimerization domain in which Glu-451 is not part of the dimerization interface itself but resides near the beginning of a long helix whose end forms the basis of the interface (discussed further below).2 We hypothesize that the E451Q mutation in Tnp influences transposition during some step other than regulatory inhibition, perhaps during transposon DNA end binding or during the capture of target DNA. We wished to mutagenize the COOH-terminal dimerization domain of Inh at the recently discovered dimer interface2 to test for functional effects. The dimer interface is formed predominantly by the close interaction of two helices in which the β-carbon of alanine 466 faces the interface, adjacent to the corresponding β-carbon of residue 466 in the dimer partner.2 Thus, the substitution of aspartic acid for alanine at this position should disrupt the close interaction of the dimer helices by steric occlusion and electrostatic repulsion. We introduced the Ala → Asp mutation at position 466 by site-directed mutagenesis and found the overexpressed His6-InhAD466 protein to be stable, as judged by relative expression levels and the absence of detectable degradation fragments during purification (data not shown). His6-InhAD466 was compared with His6-Inh for inhibitory activity and, as shown in anin vitro transposition assay in Fig.5, was found to be inactive for inhibition at all protein concentrations tested. We note that the His6-Inh protein was slightly less active for inhibition than Inh itself (this may reflect NH2-terminal fusion and COOH-terminal domain interactions; the importance of the COOH terminus for inhibition and evidence for the close proximity of NH2and COOH termini is discussed below). Furthermore, His6-InhAD466 did not homodimerize when tested in a cross-linking experiment (Fig. 6), nor did it heterodimerize in gel shift assays with DNA-bound Tnp (data not shown) or TnpEK54/LP372 (Fig. 4, lane 4), in contrast to His6-Inh. We conclude that the A466D mutation disrupts the dimer interface at the COOH terminus of the protein and that this interface is critical for inhibition.Figure 6Glutaraldehyde protein-protein cross-linking. His6-Inh or His6-InhAD466 was cross-linked for various times in 0.01% glutaraldehyde. The reactions were analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE; the gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad) and were analyzed by fluoroimaging.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study further the effects of mutating the COOH terminus of Inh, a truncation was introduced which deletes all residues COOH-terminal to residue 430. His6-InhΔ430 was found to have relatively low expression levels in E. coli compared with His6-Inh. We tested partially purified preparations in DNA binding assays (in the absence of Tnp). Because Inh has not been previously reported to bind to DNA, we were surprised to find that His6-InhΔ430 could bind to OE DNA (Fig.7). Mock preparations did not show OE DNA binding activity (data not shown), nor did His6-Inh (Fig.7). The shifted complex consists of a bound His6-InhΔ430 monomer, as judged by comparison with the monomeric binding of a previously characterized protein, TnpΔ387 (6York D. Reznikoff W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3790-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Weinreich M.D. Mahnke-Braam L. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, the COOH-terminal deletion in Inh has apparently exposed a previously unknown DNA binding region. Here we find that purified Inh strongly inhibits Tn5 transposition in vitro such that one molecule of Inh apparently inhibits multiple molecules of TnpEK54/LP372. This effect suggests that inhibition occurs prior to synapsis because the present model of transposition requires two or more functional Tnp molecules for every synapse, and therefore the nonproductive complexation of one Tnp molecule at one transposon end would block synapsis and effectively inactivate a second Tnp molecule at the other end. Corresponding to our in vitro data, Inh has been demonstrated to inhibit TnpEK/LP in vivo whereas InhAD466 (see below) does not. 6M. Steiniger-White, L. A. M. Braam, and W. S. Reznikoff, unpublished data. Inh and Tnp heterodimers were detected both free in solution and within a DNA-bound complex, raising the possibility that either of these heterodimeric complexes may be important for inhibition. Because the DNA-bound heterodimer is more abundant than the free heterodimer in immobilization assays we suspect that the DNA-bound complex is highly stable. Correspondingly, we confirmed that Inh heterodimerizes with TnpEK54/LP372 in a gel shift experiment. Although the shift experiment and our in vitro inhibition experiments were performed under different conditions using different OE DNA substrates (short OE-containing fragments and mutated OE-containing DNA supercoiled circles, respectively), we are able to correlate DNA-bound heterodimerization with inhibition. Further evidence that the DNA-bound heterodimer is more stable than the free heterodimer has been found in gel shift experiments in which the DNA-bound heterodimer product was neither reduced nor enhanced by premixing Tnp and Inh.5Therefore, it appears that monomers of Tnp bind to DNA, that heterodimerization occurs after DNA binding, and that free heterodimerization has only minimal effects on DNA-bound heterodimer complex formation. In summary, we suspect that DNA-bound heterodimers may be the major mediators of inhibition. In support of the hypothesis described above, we find that monomers of Tnp are abundant. In gel filtration studies, Tnp was found to be predominantly monomeric, whereas Inh could homodimerize. In addition, no Tnp-Tnp dimers were detected in cross-linking studies although Inh-Inh dimers were found. As discussed above, monomer-DNA binding is probably prerequisite to dimer complex formation with Inh and could also be important for synapsis, even though monomeric, untruncated Tnp apparently binds slowly or with low affinity to OE DNA. Mutation of the recently discovered dimerization interface in Inh at the COOH terminus by site-directed mutagenesis abolishes not only in vitro inhibition but also homodimerization and OE-bound Tnp-Inh heterodimerization. We conclude that this domain represents the critical dimerization main for inhibition. The point mutation, A4660D, is not predicted to expose unfavorable side chains to solvent upon disruption of the dimer interface,2 and we correspondingly found that the mutant protein was stable during overexpression and purification. Evidence that the COOH-terminal region can be disrupted without disturbing other functional regions in Inh is also found in our studies of InhΔ430 because this protein can bind to DNA. A second COOH-terminal mutated protein, InhEQ451, was found to be active for inhibition and could homodimerize and also heterodimerize with OE-bound Tnp. Although residue 451 is located near the COOH-terminal dimerization domain, this result confirms that the critical dimer interface is located at the end of the long COOH-terminal helices of the dimer.2 In summary, Inh COOH-terminal homodimerization reflects the mechanism of Tn5 inhibition, and this mechanism likely occurs through Inh heterodimerization with Tnp, probably via DNA-bound complexes. The COOH-terminal regulatory dimerization exerted by Inh is a functional consequence of the deficiency of the first 55 amino acids of Tnp, perhaps uncovering the COOH-terminal domain and making it available for dimerization. This hypothesis explains the monomeric nature of Tnp in contrast to Inh and suggests that the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of Tnp are in close proximity or close contact. In much the same manner, dominant-negative mutants of the maize Activator transposase have been found by mutating the NH2-terminal DNA binding region of the protein; these mutants act by nonproductive oligomerization with functional transposase (16Kunze R. Behrens U. Courage-Franzkowiak U. Feldmar S. Kuhn S. Lutticke R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7094-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There could be a purpose for the interaction of NH2 and COOH termini in Tn5 Tnp and, perhaps, other transposases, at least in bacterial cells; usually the NH2 terminus is associated with DNA binding, and because it is produced first during translation it might bind to DNA before the inhibitory COOH terminus can be produced. Perhaps such self-regulation contributes to the cis phenotype of transposases in prokaryotic cells, including that of Tn5, where transcription and translation are coupled, and thus the nascent protein is physically close to transposon end sequences. In fact, the COOH terminus of Tn5 Tnp does appear to inhibit DNA binding activity, as discussed below. Interactions between NH2- and COOH-terminal regions probably also occur in Inh, even though Inh is missing a short part of the corresponding Tnp NH2 terminus. When we removed 46 amino acids from the Inh COOH terminus we uncovered a secondary DNA binding region that we suspect may be located near the NH2terminus of the protein. In fact, structural studies show that the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions are spatially close in a three-dimensional structure of Inh,2 and nearby is a disordered region containing a predicted helix-turn-helix, 107–124 amino acids.3 We can also expect the NH2terminus of Tnp to be situated near this region, and it contains a second predicted helix-turn-helix DNA binding region, amino acids 35–54.3 If this arrangement exists, it may resemble the dual helix-turn-helix DNA binding motifs that have been identified in protein-DNA structural studies of the Tc3 transposase (17van Pouderoyen G. Ketting R.F. Perrakis A. Plasterak R.H.A. Sixma T.K. EMBO. 1997; 16: 6044-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the MuA transposase (18Schumacher S. Clubb R.T. Cai M. Mizuuchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Just as a COOH-terminal deletion uncovered a DNA binding function in Inh, such deletions have also been found to stablize monomeric Tnp binding to OE DNA (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7DeLong A. Syvanen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10908-10913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), presumably via the known NH2-terminal DNA binding domain. Thus, the COOH terminus of Tnp partially interferes with DNA binding. Tnp-DNA binding is also stabilized by heterodimerization with Inh (5de la Cruz N.B. Weinreich M.D. Wiegand T.W. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6932-6938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could be caused by removal of a hinderance of the COOH terminus via COOH-terminal heterodimerization. A somewhat similar situation is found in theDrosophila transposable P element system in which a KP repressor, an internal deletion of transposase, binds DNA more readily than the transposase and utilizes dimerization for high affinity binding (19Lee C.C. Mul Y.M. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5616-5622Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

In bacteriophage T4 infection, GroES is substituted by the gene31-encoded cochaperonin, Gp31. Using a genetic selection scheme, we have identified a new set of mutations in gene31 that affect interaction with GroEL; all mutations result in changes in the mobile loop of Gp31. Biochemical analyses reveal that the mobile loop mutations alter the affinity between Gp31 and GroEL, most likely by modulating the stability of the GroEL-bound hairpin conformation of the mobile loop. Surprisingly, mutations ingroEL that display allele-specific interactions with mutations in gene 31 alter residues in the GroEL intermediate domain, distantly located from the mobile loop binding site.

The mutantgroEL44(E191G) allele has been shown to block bacteriophage T4 growth at the level of capsid head assembly, i.e. ingroEL44(E191G) mutant cells, Gp23, the major capsid protein, aggregates into amorphous lumps (17Georgopoulos C. Hendrix R.W. Kaiser A.D. Wood W.B. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The same phenotype was previously observed during infection of a wild type host by a bacteriophage T4 defective in gene 31 (18Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol.

The mobile loops mediate GroEL-GroES binding through a central hydrophobic tripeptide (Ile25-Val26-Leu27) as shown by NMR studies and confirmed by the crystal structure of the GroEL·ADP·GroES complex (8Xu Z.

Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).All mutations identified thus far in either groES or gene31, which result in defective GroEL interaction, alter amino acid residues in the mobile loop. Interestingly, most of these GroES substitutions do not affect the IVL tripeptide. Rather, the best characterized groES mutant alleles affect either of the two glycine residues preceding the IVL residues (25Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6558-6565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that participate in formation of a β-hairpin turn (24Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C. van der Vies S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Bacteriophage T4 gene31 mutant alleles affect a number of residues in the mobile loop including residue Leu35, corresponding to Ile25 in the GroES mobile loop (26Keppel F. Lipinska B. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Gene. 1990; 90: 19-25Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Mutations in groEL, originally identified on the basis of blocking bacteriophage growth, affect residues that are distant from the mobile-loop binding site. The affected residues lie in the intermediate domain that links the ATP binding equatorial domain with the substrate and GroES binding apical domain (23Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The GroEL·ADP·GroES crystal structure revealed that the intermediate segment, in fact, provides two hinges that allow for the large en bloc movements in GroEL, which are captured by GroES binding (8Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses have revealed that groEL mutations fall into two classes on the basis of their allele-specific interaction with groES (25Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. J.

New Biol. 1972; 239: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) mutations. The study concerning GroEL-Gp31 interaction revealed that of twogroEL mutants that block bacteriophage λ growth,groEL44(E191G) and groEL515(A383T), only the former blocks bacteriophage T4 growth. Surprisingly, mutations in gene31, that restore bacteriophage T4 growth ongroEL44(E191G), simultaneously prevent plaque formation on groEL515(A383T).Understanding how specific mutations in these genes affect chaperone function is the overall aim of the work described in this paper. Taking advantage of a simple genetic selection system, we have identified new mutations in gene 31 of bacteriophage T4 that switch the phenotype from suppression of groEL44(E191G) to suppression of groEL515(A383T). Biochemical analyses reveal that these gene 31 mutations exert their effects primarily by altering the affinity of Gp31 for GroEL. Chaperonin-assisted folding of certain substrates depends on the coordinated interaction of GroEL, ATP, and GroES (1Hartl F.U.

Through transfection experiments three Ets-1 cis-elements are identified within the first 152 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start in thefreac-4 promoter. These sites are confirmed in a DNase Iin vitro protection assay using recombinant Ets-1 protein. In cotransfection experiments using an Ets-1 expression vector, the induction of freac-4 reporter gene activity is attenuated approximately 6-fold when the three Ets-1 binding sites are mutated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of Ets-1 in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 is sufficient to increasefreac-4 mRNA levels. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that Ets-1 acts as an upstream regulator of FREAC-4 expression during kidney development.

The ecdysone responsive unit, controlling the stage-specific responses of sgs-4 (salivary glandsecretion protein gene) to 20-hydroxyecdysone, interacts with the gene product of fkh in vivo (22Lehmann M. Korge G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4825-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, forkhead proteins have been implicated as nuclear targets for transforming growth factor-β and insulin-like signaling (23Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 24Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 25Ogg S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) andfreac-9 (27Ernstsson S. Betz R. Lagercrantz S. Larsson C. Ericksson S. Cederberg A. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. Genomics. 1997; 46: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are two human forkhead genes that are predominately expressed in the kidney. The mouse homologue offreac-4, BF-2, has been shown to be essential for stromal mesenchyme differentiation during kidney morphogenesis (28Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that the kidney expressed transcription factor Ets-1 is essential for regulation of freac-4. We also discuss a possible role for Ets-1 as an upstream regulator offreac-4 during kidney development.DISCUSSIONThe Ets-1 proto-oncogene, the founding member of the Ets-family of transcription factors, was originally described as the cellular homologue of the v-ets oncogene, which is translated as a 135-kDa gag-myb-etsfusion protein from the replication-deficient retrovirus E26 in chickens (38Radke K. Beug H. Kornfeld S. Graf T. Cell. 1982; 31: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39Leprince D. Gegonne A. Coll J. de Tasine C. Schneeberger A. Lagrou C. Stehelin D.

Members of this family play important roles in regulating gene expression in response to multiple developmental and mitogenic signals (41Macleod K. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 42Lai Z.C. Rubin G.M.

Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Previous studies in mammals have demonstrated that Ets-1 is a transcription factor important during development of lymphoid cells and their subsequent activation (44Bath N.K. Komschlies K.L. Fujiwara S. Fisher R.J. Mathieson B.J. Gregorio T.A. Young H.A. Kasik J.W. Ozato K. Papas T.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 672-678PubMed Google Scholar, 45Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Other sites of Ets-1 expression are vascular structures, the central nervous system (including the closed neural tube) as well as the developing kidney (32Maroulakou I.G. Papas T.S. Green J.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1551-1565PubMed Google Scholar, 33Queva C. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar).Freac-4 and its mouse homologue BF-2 have a more restricted expression pattern, as compared with Ets-1, including testis, spinal cord, brain, and the developing kidney (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Hatini V. Huh S.O.

Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1293-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,47Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 1354: 5002-5012Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar).In this paper we have demonstrated the presence of at least three Ets-1 binding sites within the freac-4 promoter (Figs.3 B and 4). When an Ets-1 expression plasmid is cotransfected with various freac-4 promoter reporter constructs a clear induction is noted (∼15–40-fold; Figs. 1 and 2). When the three Ets-1 binding sites present on the −152-luc construct are mutated, the Ets-1 induction is reduced by a factor of ∼6 as compared with the wild type promoter (Fig. 5). This is consistent with Ets-1 as a major regulator/activator of freac-4 gene expression, othercis-elements and trans-activators are also likely to contribute, because we have previously shown that both p53 and WT-1 (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1) are involved in the regulation offreac-4 (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).In transfection assays, for practical reasons, only limited amounts of promoter sequence can be used. The expression level of transactivators used in cotransfection assays is also a factor to consider when interpreting the results of such experiments. To investigate whether or not an increased level of wild type Ets-1 mRNA expression would be sufficient to up-regulate freac-4 expression, we stably transfected the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 with an Ets-1 expression vector. Total RNA was then used in a RNase protection assay, and we could demonstrate an increased level of freac-4mRNA in cell clones with an increased level of Ets-1 mRNA (Fig.6). We would also like to point out that untransfected 293 cells have a low level of Ets-1 expression (a faint band in lane A of Fig. 6). Taken together, these experiments show that it is possible that Ets-1 could act as an upstream regulator of FREAC-4 expression in kidney cells. This notion gains further support from the fact that Ets-1 is expressed during early kidney development in the tubular structures of mesonephros day E10.5 pc (33Queva C. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the early stages of kidney development in BF-2 −/− mice remain unaffected (28Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). BF-2 is expressed at E12.5 pc in a population of cells that surround the condensation of nephrogenic mesenchyme (28Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Thus the temporal appearance of Ets-1 and BF-2 in the developing kidney does not exclude Ets-1 as a possible upstream regulator in the BF-2/Freac-4 pathway. In Fig. 7 we have outlined a hypothetical regulative pathway in which Ets-1, p53, WT-1, and BF2/freac-4 participate. This pathway is based on the experiments described in this paper as well as work by others: (i) p53 is known to repress expression of both Ets-1 (48Iotsova V. Crepieux P. Montpellier C. Laudet V. Stehelin D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2331-2337PubMed Google Scholar) andfreac-4 (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); (ii) p53 is expressed in the developing kidney during embryogenesis (49Schmid P. Lorenz A. Hameister H. Montenarh M. Development. 1991; 113: 857-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) transgenic mice expressing wild type p53, under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, undergo progressive renal failure due to defective kidney differentiation with small kidneys with about half of the normal number of nephrons (50Godley L.A. Kopp J.B. Eckhaus M. Paglino J.J. Owens J. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); (iv) WT-1 up-regulates freac-4 expression (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and (v) in WT-1 −/− mice metanephrogenic mesenchyme remains uninduced and no kidney is formed (51Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Clearly more research is needed to elucidate the pathway through which BF-2/FREAC-4 participates in the regulation of nephrogenesis, and we hope that the results presented in this paper will contribute to a better understanding of this regulative pathway. The forkhead family of transcription factors belongs to the “winged helix” superfamily of DNA binding proteins (1Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 3307: 13509-13516Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Liang H. Olejniczak E.T. Mao X. Nettesheim D.G. Yu L. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Forkhead proteins bind to DNA through a highly conserved region of some 105 amino acids, the forkhead motif (4Hacker U. Grossniklaus U. Gehring W.J. Jackle H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This domain was first identified in a Drosophila gene, forkhead(fkh), named after a homeotic mutation in which proper formation of terminal structures, most striking gut formation, is affected (5Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jackle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The forkhead motif has since been identified in over 40 genes isolated from a vast range of organisms, among them man (6Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech.

Highly complex functions, such as specification of visual projection maps in the retina, have been shown to depend on correct spatial expression of the forkhead genes CBF-1 and CBF-2 (21Yuasa J.

Previous studies in mammals have demonstrated that Ets-1 is a transcription factor important during development of lymphoid cells and their subsequent activation (44Bath N.K. Komschlies K.L. Fujiwara S. Fisher R.J. Mathieson B.J. Gregorio T.A. Young H.A. Kasik J.W. Ozato K. Papas T.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 672-678PubMed Google Scholar, 45Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Other sites of Ets-1 expression are vascular structures, the central nervous system (including the closed neural tube) as well as the developing kidney (32Maroulakou I.G. Papas T.S. Green J.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1551-1565PubMed Google Scholar, 33Queva C. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar).Freac-4 and its mouse homologue BF-2 have a more restricted expression pattern, as compared with Ets-1, including testis, spinal cord, brain, and the developing kidney (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Hatini V. Huh S.O.

Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1293-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,47Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 1354: 5002-5012Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In this paper we have demonstrated the presence of at least three Ets-1 binding sites within the freac-4 promoter (Figs.3 B and 4). When an Ets-1 expression plasmid is cotransfected with various freac-4 promoter reporter constructs a clear induction is noted (∼15–40-fold; Figs. 1 and 2). When the three Ets-1 binding sites present on the −152-luc construct are mutated, the Ets-1 induction is reduced by a factor of ∼6 as compared with the wild type promoter (Fig. 5). This is consistent with Ets-1 as a major regulator/activator of freac-4 gene expression, othercis-elements and trans-activators are also likely to contribute, because we have previously shown that both p53 and WT-1 (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1) are involved in the regulation offreac-4 (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In transfection assays, for practical reasons, only limited amounts of promoter sequence can be used. The expression level of transactivators used in cotransfection assays is also a factor to consider when interpreting the results of such experiments. To investigate whether or not an increased level of wild type Ets-1 mRNA expression would be sufficient to up-regulate freac-4 expression, we stably transfected the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 with an Ets-1 expression vector. Total RNA was then used in a RNase protection assay, and we could demonstrate an increased level of freac-4mRNA in cell clones with an increased level of Ets-1 mRNA (Fig.6). We would also like to point out that untransfected 293 cells have a low level of Ets-1 expression (a faint band in lane A of Fig. 6). Taken together, these experiments show that it is possible that Ets-1 could act as an upstream regulator of FREAC-4 expression in kidney cells. This notion gains further support from the fact that Ets-1 is expressed during early kidney development in the tubular structures of mesonephros day E10.5 pc (33Queva C. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2511-2520PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the early stages of kidney development in BF-2 −/− mice remain unaffected (28Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). BF-2 is expressed at E12.5 pc in a population of cells that surround the condensation of nephrogenic mesenchyme (28Hatini V. Huh S.O. Herzlinger D. Soares V.C. Lai E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Thus the temporal appearance of Ets-1 and BF-2 in the developing kidney does not exclude Ets-1 as a possible upstream regulator in the BF-2/Freac-4 pathway. In Fig. 7 we have outlined a hypothetical regulative pathway in which Ets-1, p53, WT-1, and BF2/freac-4 participate. This pathway is based on the experiments described in this paper as well as work by others: (i) p53 is known to repress expression of both Ets-1 (48Iotsova V. Crepieux P. Montpellier C. Laudet V. Stehelin D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2331-2337PubMed Google Scholar) andfreac-4 (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); (ii) p53 is expressed in the developing kidney during embryogenesis (49Schmid P. Lorenz A. Hameister H. Montenarh M. Development. 1991; 113: 857-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) transgenic mice expressing wild type p53, under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, undergo progressive renal failure due to defective kidney differentiation with small kidneys with about half of the normal number of nephrons (50Godley L.A. Kopp J.B. Eckhaus M. Paglino J.J. Owens J. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); (iv) WT-1 up-regulates freac-4 expression (26Ernstsson S. Pierrou S. Hulander M. Cederberg A. Hellqvist M. Carlsson P. Enerbäck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21094-21099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and (v) in WT-1 −/− mice metanephrogenic mesenchyme remains uninduced and no kidney is formed (51Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Clearly more research is needed to elucidate the pathway through which BF-2/FREAC-4 participates in the regulation of nephrogenesis, and we hope that the results presented in this paper will contribute to a better understanding of this regulative pathway. We thank Barbara Graves for kindly sharing Ets-1 plasmids with us."
https://openalex.org/W2088088438,"The glucose-6-phosphatase system was investigated in fetal rat liver microsomal vesicles. Several observations indicate that the orientation of the catalytic subunit is different in the fetal liver in comparison with the adult form: (i) the phosphohydrolase activity was not latent using glucose-6-phosphate as substrate, and in the case of other phosphoesters it was less latent; (ii) the intravesicular accumulation of glucose upon glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis was lower; (iii) the size of the intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate pool was independent of the glucose-6-phosphatase activities; (iv) antibody against the loop containing the proposed catalytic site of the enzyme inhibited the phosphohydrolase activity in fetal but not in adult rat liver microsomes. Glucose-6-phosphate, phosphate, and glucose uptake could be detected by both light scattering and/or rapid filtration method in fetal liver microsomes; however, the intravesicular glucose-6-phosphate and glucose accessible spaces were proportionally smaller than in adult rat liver microsomes. These data demonstrate that the components of the glucose-6-phosphatase system are already present, although to a lower extent, in fetal liver, but they are functionally uncoupled by the extravesicular orientation of the catalytic subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2075855239,"The mammalian spongiform encephalopathies gave rise to the concept of infectious proteins, proteins that can transmit an infection without an essential nucleic acid. This concept is now identified with the term “prion.” These diseases, including scrapie of sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (and its variants), are believed to be the result of a self-propagating change of PrP, a cell surface protein. The minireview in this issue by Charles Weissmann (1Weissmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) examines the spongiform encephalopathies and summarizes work from a number of laboratories. In 1994, it was suggested that two non-chromosomal genetic elements of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, [URE3] and [PSI], were infectious protein (prion) forms of Ure2p and Sup35p. These findings have been particularly exciting because these systems will permit the application of the powerful genetic methods available in yeast to the study of the prion problem. Recently, [Het-s], a non-Mendelian genetic element of the filamentous fungusPodospora anserina has been identified as another likely prion. In each case, the evidence points to an altered form of a chromosomally encoded protein that has acquired the ability to convert the normal form of the protein into the same altered (prion) abnormal form. These new developments will be summarized in a second minireview by Reed Wickner et al. (2Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Maddelein M.-L. Taylor K. Moriyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), focused on the evidence that prions of yeast and fungi can serve as genetic material, and a third by Susan Liebman and Irina Derkatch (3Leibman S.W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) discussing the yeast [PSI+] prion in detail, including its interactions with chaperones and other proteins. Although the epidemic of “mad cow disease” has brought this field to the headlines, its scientific excitement rests more on the notion that altered protein conformations can impart disease and the somewhat revolutionary concepts of infection and heredity that have come out of this work."
