https://openalex.org/W2015615030,"Inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is critical for transcription of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) by β-adrenergic receptors in cardiac myocytes. We examined the mechanism by which GSK3β regulates ANF transcription. Stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors induced nuclear accumulation of GATA4, whereas β-adrenergic ANF transcription was suppressed by dominant negative GATA4, suggesting that GATA4 plays an important role in β-adrenergic ANF transcription. Interestingly, GATA4-mediated transcription was markedly attenuated by GSK3β. GSK3β physically associates with GATA4 and phosphorylates GATA4 in vitro. Overexpression of GSK3β suppressed both basal and β-adrenergic increases in nuclear expression of GATA4, whereas inhibition of GSK3β by LiCl caused nuclear accumulation of GATA4, suggesting that GSK3β negatively regulates nuclear expression of GATA4. The nuclear exportin Crm1 reduced nuclear expression of GATA4, and the reduction was enhanced by GSK3β but not by kinase-inactive GSK3β. Leptomycin B, an inhibitor for Crm1, increased basal nuclear GATA4 and suppressed GSK3β-induced decreases in nuclear GATA4. These results suggest that GSK3β negatively regulates nuclear expression of GATA4 by stimulating Crm1-dependent nuclear export. Inhibition of GSK3β by β-adrenergic stimulation abrogates GSK3β-induced nuclear export of GATA4, causing nuclear accumulation of GATA4, which may represent an important signaling mechanism mediating cardiac hypertrophy.

Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Understanding of the signaling mechanism of cardiac hypertrophy is important, because the continued presence of hypertrophy with structural alteration in the myocardium (cardiac remodeling) leads to development of congestive heart failure (2Mann D.L. Circulation. 1999; 100: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). A series of phosphorylation or de-phosphorylation events in myocardial signaling molecules mediated by protein kinases or protein phosphatases play an important role in cardiac hypertrophy by many stimuli, including mechanical forces, myocardial ischemia, catecholamines, and autocrine/paracrine factors (reviewed in Refs. 3Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 5Olson E.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy is characterized not only by increases in the cell size but also by changes in gene expression, including reactivation of the fetal gene program, as well as by cytoskeletal reorganization (6Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Changes in gene expression seen in cardiac hypertrophy are in many cases mediated by changes in nuclear transcription. However, only few studies have shown thus far that the protein kinases or phosphatases activated by hypertrophic stimuli regulate activities of specific nuclear transcription factors (7Kariya K.

Although the cardiac phenotype of hypertrophy by β-adrenergic receptor (βAR)1 stimulation is similar to that caused by other hypertrophic stimuli, such as mechanical stretch and agonists for Gq protein-coupled receptors (angiotensin II, phenylephrine, and endothelin-1), the signaling mechanism of hypertrophy by βARs differs from that by other hypertrophic stimuli (10Iwaki K.

We have previously shown that, in β-adrenergic cardiac hypertrophy, the Akt-GSK3β pathway, rather than the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, plays an essential role in transcription of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a “fetal type” gene that is commonly activated in many types of cardiac hypertrophy (13Morisco C.

It is unknown, however, which transcription factor is regulated by the Akt-GSK3β pathway. Members of the GATA family zinc finger transcription factor regulate critical steps of cellular differentiation during vertebrate development (reviewed in Ref. 15Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Among the GATA family, GATA-4, -5, and -6 are expressed in the heart and gut. GATA-4 is essential for survival of cardioblasts and terminal differentiation of cardiac myocytes (15Molkentin J.D. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that GATA transcription factors also mediate cardiac gene transcription in response to hypertrophic stimuli, including pressure overload, leukemia inhibitory factor, phenylephrine, endothelin-1, and electrical stimulation (see Refs. 20Grepin C.

A number of genes, whose expression is altered during cardiac hypertrophy, including ANF, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), α- and β-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin I, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, angiotensin II type 1a receptor, and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, are critically regulated by GATA4 and other GATA-binding proteins (20Grepin C.

However, the mechanism as to how transcriptional activities of GATA4 are regulated by hypertrophic stimuli has not been fully understood. The present studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism by which the Akt-GSK3β pathway regulates nuclear transcriptional events in cardiac myocytes, leading to expression of ANF. We have identified that GATA4 plays an important role in βAR-regulated ANF transcription and that the Akt-GSK3β pathway regulates transcription through GATA4 in cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, we have obtained evidence that GSK3β physically interacts with GATA4 and decreases nuclear expression of GATA4 possibly through direct phosphorylation and subsequent stimulation of nuclear export via nuclear exportin Crm1. We propose that GATA4 is an important downstream effector of GSK3β and inhibition of GSK3β by hypertrophic stimuli mediates cardiac hypertrophy at least in part by removing its negative constraint upon GATA4. Lithium chloride and leptomycin B were purchased from Sigma. Primary cultures of cardiac ventricular myocytes from 1-day-old Crl:(WI)BR-Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) were prepared as described previously (30Aoki H. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 1998; 81: 666-676Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In brief, ventricular myocytes were dispersed from the ventricles by digestion with collagenase type IV (Sigma), 0.1% trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 15 µg/ml DNase I (Sigma). Cell suspensions were applied on a discontinuous Percoll gradient as described (10Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the cardiac myocyte culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 4 µg/ml transferrin, 0.7 ng/ml sodium selenite (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 g/liter bovine serum albumin (fraction V), 3 mm pyruvic acid, 15 mm HEPES, 100 µm ascorbic acid, 100 µg/ml ampicillin, 5 µg/ml linoleic acid and 100 µm5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma). We obtained myocyte cultures in which more than 95% were myocytes, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric myosin (MF20). Culture media were changed to serum-free at 24 h. Myocytes were cultured under serum-free conditions for 48 h before experiments. Mammalian expression plasmids encoding constitutively active Akt (Akt(E40K)), NF-AT3, and Crm1 were provided by Drs. G. Condorelli (31Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and M. Yoshida (33Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), respectively. Plasmids encoding wild type GSK3β, kinase-inactive GSK3β (GSK3βKI, K85M,K86I), and Akt-insensitive GSK3β (GSK3β (S9A)) have been described (13Morisco C. Zebrowski D.C. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding GATA4 has been described (34Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To make mammalian expression plasmid encoding dominant negative GATA4 (34Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8515-8524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), GATA4-(199–440) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), and the entire open reading frame was sequenced to confirm the correct sequence. Adenovirus harboring wild type GSK3β (Ad5 GCK-GSK3β) was generated by the COS-TCP method (36Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instruction (adenovirus construction kit, Takara). Adenovirus harboring β-galactosidase (Ad5.CMV-lacZ) was used as control. The method of adenovirus transduction has been described (37Aoki H. Richmond M. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, myocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 106 per well in 6-well plates. Twenty four hours after plating, the medium was changed to DMEM/F-12 without supplement. Transfections were carried out using 10 µl/ml of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml/well DMEM. To determine the activity of the ANF promoter, a plasmid (1 µg/ml) containing a 638- or 3003-base pair fragment of the rat ANF promoter linked to firefly luciferase (ANF-Luc-(638), courtesy of Dr. K. R. Chien, University of California, San Diego (10Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); ANF-Luc-(3003) (13Morisco C. Zebrowski D.C. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)) was used. In addition, a series of 5′ truncations of the ANF promoter were generated by PCR and subsequently subcloned into pGL3 (Promega). Construction and characterization of the ANF-Luc-(638) reporter genes (GM1 and GM2), which have mutations at the GATA4-binding sites, have been previously described (34Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The GATA4 reporter gene (GATA4-Luc) in the pGL2-Promoter (Promega) vector is composed of the duplicate GATA4 target sequence from the αMHC gene (22Molkentin J.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. Markham B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4947-4957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) linked to the SV40 promoter and fused to the luciferase gene (34Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To determine the activity of the transcription activation domains of GATA4, a plasmid containing one or two GATA4 activation domains fused to the DNA binding domain of yeast transcription factor GAL4 (pFA-GATA4-(2–116) and pFA-GATA4-(2–205)) and another plasmid containing 5 copies of the GAL4-binding sequence fused to the firefly luciferase gene (pFR-Luc, Stratagene) were co-transfected. To evaluate the transcriptional activity of NF-ATs, the NF-AT-dependent reporter gene (NF-AT-Luc, Stratagene), which is composed of four NF-AT-binding sites upstream of the TATA box and the luciferase gene, was used. In some experiments, myocytes were co-transfected with various doses of expression plasmid encoding signaling molecules. Total amounts of DNA were adjusted to 2 µg/ml by adding appropriate empty vectors. Twenty four h after transfection, media were changed to the cardiac myocyte culture media without serum. Myocytes were further cultured in the presence or absence of isoproterenol (ISO, 10 µm), an agonist for the βARs, or phenylephrine (10 µm), an agonist for the α1-adrenergic receptors, for an additional 24 h. Myocytes were then lysed with the Reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities were measured. An SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase construct (SV40-β-galactosidase, 0.5 µg/ml) was co-transfected, and β-galactosidase activities were determined using Lumi-Gal 530 (Lumigen). The luciferase values were divided by the β-galactosidase values to correct for differences in the transfection efficiency. Some transient transfection experiments were performed in COS7 cells by using the LipofectAMINE Plus. A day before transfection, COS7 cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes at 40% confluency. 2–2.4 µg of DNA was mixed with 6 µl of Plus reagent and 9 µl of LipofectAMINE in serum-free and antibiotics-free OPTI-MEM and incubated with COS7 cells for 5 h. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3913) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and scraped with Tris-buffered saline. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 200 µl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF) by gentle pipetting and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were lysed by adding 12.5 µl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and vortexing vigorously for 10 s, followed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm) for 30 s. Supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm AEBSF) and rocked for 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction. The entire procedure was carried out at 4 °C. The samples were stored at −85 °C. The gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (34Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3120-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 39Sadoshima J. Jahn L. Takahashi T. Kulik T.J. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing the DNA sequence around the GATA consensus binding site in the rat proximal ANF promoter and the mouse BNP promoter or their mutants (Table I) were labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The labeled probe was purified by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gels. Samples of 15 µl containing 5 µg of nuclear extract were incubated with 3 µg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 ng of probe (50,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides for 20 min at room temperature. Some samples were incubated with anti-GATA4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min at room temperature before adding probe. Binding reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and visualized by autoradiography. To determine if the equal amount of nuclear extracts are quantitated for GATA binding, the same nuclear extracts were subjected to another gel shift assay, in which radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the SP-1 and NF-κB consensus binding sequences (Promega and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively, Table I) were use as probes for COS7 cell and cardiac myocyte nuclear extracts, respectively.Table IDouble-stranded oligonucleotide probes used in gel mobility shift assays To detect GATA4 transcript in cardiac myocytes, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out as described previously (40Malhotra R. Sadoshima J. Brosius III, F.C. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated and subjected to reverse transcription with a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The PCR primers were designed on the basis of published cDNA sequence for mouse GATA4 and rat GAPDH as follows: sense for GATA4, AAGACGCCAGCAGGTCCTGCTGGT; antisense for GATA4, CGCGGTGATTATGTCCCCATGACT; sense for GAPDH, GGAAAGCTGTGGCGTGATGG; antisense for GAPDH, GTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCA. The following conditions were chosen for the PCRs in a volume of 50 µl: reverse transcription products from 1 µg of RNA, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 33 cycles of amplification for GATA4 or 20 cycles for GAPDH, and 250 nm each of sense and antisense primers. The amplification was carried out as follows: denaturation, 30 s at 94 °C; annealing, 30 s at 54 °C; extension, 30 s at 72 °C. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described above. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-GATA4 or anti-GSK3β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as secondary antibody. The bound secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or ECL Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA encoding the amino acid residues 2–116, 2–205, and 206–440 of GATA4 were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T-3 to generate pGEX-GATA4-(2–116), pGEX-GATA4-(2–205), and pGEX-GATA4-(206–440). Note that PCR primers for GATA4 were made by using the updated mouse GATA4 sequence (GenBankTM accession number NM008092). Bacterially expressed GST-GATA4 or GST alone was purified on glutathione-Sepharose and used at 1 µg of recombinant protein per 10 µl of bead slurry. The fusion proteins were pre-phosphorylated on Sepharose by addition of 5 units of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (New England Biolabs) per µg of fusion protein at 30 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 mm ATP for 2 h and then thoroughly washed (with kinase buffer without ATP) to remove cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP. For kinase assays, fusion protein (1 µg) on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 100 µm ATP and 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) in 50 µl of kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Beads were incubated with 2.5 units of purified GSK3 (New England Biolabs). Kinase reactions were terminated by washing the Sepharose beads twice with 1 ml of TEN (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) to remove free ATP and enzyme. Phosphorylated GATA4 was eluted by boiling with 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 10 min, fractionated on SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie to ensure that the substrate was not degraded. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation of GSK3β, total cell extracts (1 ml) were prepared by using the cell lysis buffer C, containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm AEBSF. The samples were incubated with 1 µg of anti-GSK3β antibody (Transduction Laboratory) for 2 h and then with 30 µl of protein A/G-Sepharose slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Cardiac myocytes were grown on glass coverslips. After stimulation, myocytes were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min followed by a brief dip in acetone at −20 °C. For staining of GATA4 and GSK3β, anti-GATA4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1 µg/ml) and anti-GSK3β antibody (Transduction Laboratory, 1 µg/ml) were used, respectively. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline. Methods of immunostaining and subsequent light microscopic observations have been described (30Aoki H. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 1998; 81: 666-676Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To confirm nuclear localization of GATA4, confocal microscopic analyses were performed in some experiments as described previously (30Aoki H. Izumo S. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 1998; 81: 666-676Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Data are given as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using the analysis of variance. The post-test comparison was performed by the method of Tukey. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05 levels. We have shown previously that ISO, an agonist for βARs, stimulates transcription of ANF in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in vitro and adult heart in vivo(14Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Vatner D. Vatner S. Sadoshima J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 561-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In order to identify the cis-acting element that is critical for βAR-stimulated ANF transcription, we transfected ANF-Luc reporter gene constructs, in which the 5′ region of the rat ANF promoter is progressively deleted. Commonly used ANF promoter luciferase constructs having −3003 and −638 bp upstream of the transcription start site responded to ISO stimulation by 3–4-fold, consistent with our previous observations (13Morisco C. Zebrowski D.C. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Deletion to −294 as well as that to −134 caused a modest decrease in ISO responsiveness (2.3- and 2.4-fold induction versus respective controls) compared with ANF-Luc-(−3003), whereas deletion to −109 abolished ISO-induced increases in the promoter activities (Fig.1). Since the ANF-Luc reporter construct deleted to −109 remained inducible to stimulation by phenylephrine, an agonist for α1-adrenergic receptor and a well established hypertrophic stimulus, the loss of inducibility in this construct was not nonspecific. These results suggest that sequences −134/−109 in the rat ANF promoter play a critical role in ANF transcription by βAR stimulation. The rat ANF promoter sequences −134/−109 contain the functional serum-response element (SRE) and the proximal GATA element (20Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol.

To understand how talin recognizes integrin β cytoplasmic domains, we configured surface plasmon resonance methodology to measure the interaction of talin with the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain. Here we report that the N-terminal ∼47-kDa talin head domain (talin-H) has a 6-fold higher binding affinity than intact talin for the β3tail. The affinity difference is mainly due to a difference ink on. Calpain cleavage of intact talin released talin-H and resulted in a 16-fold increase in apparentK a and a 100-fold increase in apparentk on. The increase in talin binding after cleavage was greater than predicted for stoichiometric liberation of free talin-H. This additional increase in binding was due to cooperative binding of talin-H and talin rod domain to the β3 tail. Talin resembles ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins in possessing an N-terminal FERM (band four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain. These data show that the talin FERM domain, like that in the ERM proteins, is masked in the intact molecule.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Integrins are non-covalent heterodimers of type I transmembrane protein subunits termed α and β. Each subunit has a large (>700 residue) N-terminal extracellular domain. A single membrane-spanning domain links this extracellular domain to a generally (with the exception of β4) short (13–70 residues) cytoplasmic domain (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Integrins bind to insoluble ligands (e.g. collagen fibrils) and link them to the intracellular cytoskeleton. In addition to forming these physical linkages, integrins regulate cell growth, survival, and differentiation (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). These signaling activities and cytoskeletal linkages depend on the integrin cytoplasmic domains (3Calderwood D.A.

Conversely, integrin-mediated adhesion is rapidly and precisely regulated by changes in integrin affinity for ligand (activation) (4Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin.

Thus, integrin-cytoskeletal linkages play a pivotal role in their regulation and in their signaling properties. Talin is an actin-binding protein that links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton (10Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Talin co-localizes with clustered integrins in all known species that possess these receptors. Furthermore, genetic and cell biological analyses show that talin is required for integrin clustering into focal adhesions (11Priddle H. Hemmings L. Monkley S. Woods A. Patel B. Sutton D. Dunn G.A. Zicha D. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1121-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Talin-integrin interactions can also regulate integrin activation (12Calderwood D.A. Zent R.

Talin consists of an N-terminal ∼47-kDa globular head domain (talin-H)1 and a ∼190-kDa C-terminal rod (talin-R) domain (13Rees D.J.G. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O.

It is an elongated (60 nm), flexible protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domains of integrins β1A and β1D (but not β1B and β1C) (14Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

However, there has been no direct quantitative comparison of the affinities of the two domains of talin for integrin β tails. In sum, the binding of talin to integrin β cytoplasmic domains is crucial for integrin function and is involved in the regulation of integrin activation and clustering. Talin binding to integrin β tails is important in governing integrin activation and clustering, events responsible for rapid dynamic changes in integrin function. Consequently, it is likely that physiological mechanisms exist to regulate the binding of talin to integrin β tails. Talin contains a FERM domain that is involved in its binding to the β3 tail. The talin FERM domain is similar to those present in ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM proteins (23Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar)), which mediate the binding of the ERM proteins to the cytoplasmic domains of certain transmembrane receptors (24Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In ERM proteins, the membrane protein binding site in the FERM domains are masked in the intact molecule by interactions with the C-terminal tail domain (23Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The binding activity of the FERM domain can be unmasked by phosphorylation or the interaction of ERM proteins with polyphosphoinositides (see Ref.24Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar and references therein). In the present work, we have made real time measurements of the binding of talin and its two domains to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain by use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Here, we report that talin-H, which contains the FERM domain, has a 6-fold higher binding affinity than intact talin for β3. The affinity difference is mainly due to a difference in the on-rate of binding, indicating that the β3cytoplasmic domain binding site(s) is masked in intact talin. Furthermore, calpain cleavage of intact talin resulted in an apparent 16-fold decrease in K d and an apparent 100-fold increase in k on. The increase in talin binding after cleavage was due to both the generation of free talin-H and the cooperative binding of talin-R to the talin-H-β3 tail complex. These data establish that talin resembles ERM proteins in the intramolecular masking of its FERM domain. Thus, physiological modification of the interaction of the talin FERM domain with integrins is likely to be an important control mechanism in cell adhesion. Furthermore, calpain activity is involved in the control of integrin activation and clustering (25Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S. Du X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The present data strongly implicate talin as a substrate that could account for some of the effects of calpain on integrin function. Thrombin, p-aminobenzamidine-agarose beads, and biotin maleimide were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant calpain II (high purity, 1500 units/mg protein) from rat was purchased from Calbiochem, and calpain inhibitor, E-64, were purchased from Peptide Research Foundation. Talin was purified from outdated human platelets according to previously published procedures (26Isenberg G. Goldmann W.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Kaufmann S. Piekenbrock T. Goldmann W.H. Barmann M. Isenberg G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and was at least 90% homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1A). To obtain the rod domain of talin, purified talin in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) was digested by thrombin (0.5 units/mg of protein) at room temperature. After a 40-min digestion, benzamidine (final concentration 10 mm) was added, and the cleavage products were separated by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column (Fig. 1 A). A cDNA encoding amino acids 1–435 of mouse talin was cloned into the bacterial expression vector, pCEX-2T. GlutathioneS-transferase-talin fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified (12Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J.G. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) as described using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thrombin (∼1 unit/mg of protein) was added to the glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein-coated beads, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight.p-Aminobenzamidine beads were added to the mixture to remove the thrombin from the eluted talin-H (Fig. 1 A). Recombinant integrin cytoplasmic domain model proteins consisting of four modified heptad repeat coiled-coil sequences joined to the tails (Fig. 1 C) were expressed, purified, and characterized as described previously (14Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, polymerase chain reaction was used to create cDNA encoding the heptad repeat protein sequences. The cDNAs were ligated into aNdeI-HindIII-restricted modified pET15b vector (Novagen). β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain cDNAs were joined to the helix, and recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified as described (Fig.1 B). A control model protein containing the N-terminal seven amino acid residues (KLGFFKR) of the α5 tail (αT) was also produced in the same way. Product masses were routinely determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using an API-III quadrupole spectrometer (Sciex) and varied by less than 0.1% from that predicted by the desired sequence. Integrin tail model protein (0.8 mg/ml) was solubilized in 0.1m acetate buffer, pH 4.6. The model protein was then reduced by the addition of 3 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, 10 mmbiotin-maleimide (100 mm stock in Me2SO) was added into the solution, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Unreacted biotin-maleimide was removed by extensive dialysis in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.6, at 4 °C. Biotin-modified β3 Tail Model Protein was desalted on a reverse phase C18 high performance liquid chromatography column (Vydac) and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on an API-III quadrupole spectrometer (Sciex; Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Peptide mass fingerprinting with MALDI-TOF MS was used to identify the biotinylated residue as described previously (28Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, modified proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the band corresponding to the model proteins was subjected to trypsin in-gel digestion. The digest mixture was analyzed by MALDI TOF MS, as described previously (28Yan B. Hu D.D. Knowles S.K. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7249-7260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but with the use of a linear detector mode. Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analyses were done with an electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer (Finni-gan-MAT LCQ). Peptide mixtures were separated on 5 µm of C18 MetaChem 150 × 1.0-mm column at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. A gradient of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (B) was distributed as follows: 0% B in the first 5 min; 0–30% B in 3–30 min; 30–60% B in 30–100 min; 60–99% B in 100–120 min. Spectra were acquired by scanning over the specified range in 2 s. If an ion present in the scan and the calculated ion abundance exceeded a specified threshold, then product ion spectra were acquired using them/z value of the base peak in the last mass spectrum. Using the m/z value and the assumption that the parent is doubly charged, the MALDI TOF MS program calculated the scan range and the collision offset. Product ion spectra were generated using argon as the collision gas (3–4 millitorr) and collision energies (laboratory frame) on the order of 10–30 eV. The collision offset varied in a linear manner with anm/z value. SPR analysis was performed using a BIA Core 3000 instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CM5 sensor chips were activated using the amine coupling kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Then streptavidin (5–20 µg/ml in 10 mm acetate, pH 4.5) was injected. Non-reacted activated groups were blocked by injection of 1m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Typically, the resonance unit (RU) value increase after this procedure was 200–1500. Biotin-labeled β3 tail model protein was then bound to the streptavidin-derivatized surface. Free streptavidin was blocked by the addition of 5 mm biotin. The surfaces of the sensor chips were regenerated by injection of 2 m NaCl. The chips were used for about 2 weeks in multiple experiments. All of the parameters were measured at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. Sensorgrams for the interaction of talin and integrin tail were analyzed with BIAlogue kinetics evaluation software, as described in the standard mode (29Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). The kinetics data were interpreted in the context of a first order kinetic model: A + B = AB (30Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 31Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The association rate constants (k on) were calculated from the association phases of the sensorgrams at various concentrations of the analyte using Equation 1. Rt=konCRmax(1−e−kst)/ks(Eq. 1) where R t is the response at timet, R max is the maximum response,C is the concentration of analyte on solution, andks=konC+koff(Eq. 2) where k s the slope of thedRU/dt versus RU plot. The dissociation rate constants (k off) values obtained from Equation 2 may not be reliable for low ranges (29Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Therefore, k off values were calculated from the dissociation phases of the sensorgrams using Equation 3.ln(Rt/R0)=−koff(t−t0)(Eq. 3) where R t and R 0 represent the SPR signal expressed in RU at time t and at the starting time of dissociation, t 0, respectively. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, K d, was determined from the ratio of these two kinetic constants(k off/k on). Affinities were calculated from rate constants and from analysis of equilibrium binding. By measuring equilibrium resonance units (R eq) as a function of ligand concentration, binding data can be analyzed by Scatchard plots using the equation,Req/C=Rmax/Kd−Req/Kd(Eq. 4) where R eq is the equilibrium resonance units, R max is the resonance signal at saturating concentrations of analyte, and C is the concentration of free protein. 500 µg of purified recombinant β3cytoplasmic domain proteins was dissolved in a mixture of 5 ml of 20 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, and 1 ml of 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 3.5, and bound overnight to 80 µl of Ni2+-saturated His-bind resin (Novagen). In control experiments (data not shown) we found that these conditions resulted in saturation of the resin with recombinant protein. Resins were washed twice with 20 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8, and stored at 4 °C in an equal volume of this Pipes buffer containing 0.1% NaN3 as a preservative. 35 µl of such a suspension was added to equal molar amounts of talin-H or talin-R or a mixture of the two. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, resins were washed five times with this buffer and finally heated in 20 µl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Talin-integrin interactions were studied by immobilizing integrin cytoplasmic domain model proteins on the sensor chip. To ensure that the β3 tails were in a unique orientation, we immobilized the tails via a biotin-avidin linkage. Since each model protein has a single cysteine, that cysteine was modified by biotinyl maleimide. To confirm that the appropriate modification had occurred, modified proteins were analyzed. Electrospray ionization MS showed increments of 449 Da, indicating the presence of 1 mol of biotin/mol of tail protein. When tryptic digests of the modified tail were analyzed by MALDI TOF MS, all detected fragments containing the Cys residue (GSMCSK) were biotin-modified (TableI). Furthermore, all other detected peptides were at the mass predicted for the unmodified peptide (TableI), indicating that they were not biotinylated. Further analysis of the 1169.6-Da biotinylated fragment, GSMCSK, by LC-MS/MS demonstrated that the cysteine residue was modified (Fig.2). In particular, all expected b ions and y ions derived from the Cys modification were present in the spectrum (Fig. 2). Thus, the β3 tail model protein was biotinylated on the single Cys residue.Table IMass fingerprints of the biotin-maleimide-modified β3 tailPeak No.PredictedObservedCorresponding peptide11768.81769.11GSSHHHHHHSSGLVPR162719.3ND17GSHMCGK233787.4787.724LEALEGR304745.4745.531LDALEGK375816.4816.638LEALEGGK456916.5916.746LDALEGGGGK557980.6980.956LLITIHDR638709.3109.669FEEEER7391221.61222.178WDTANNPLYK87101403.71404.288EATSTFTNITYR99111169.81169.617GSHMC(modified)GK23The protein was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by MALDI TOF MS.

Therefore, these missing peptides resulted in a noncontiguous amino acid sequence. ND, not detected. The biotinylated β3 tail was immobilized by binding to a streptavidin-coupled sensor chip. To minimize nonspecific binding and mass transfer, we first tested four streptavidin coupling concentrations leading to refractive index changes of ∼200, ∼500, ∼950, and 1500 RU, respectively. The biotinylated β3tail model protein was then immobilized at a saturating concentration (16 µm), resulting in an increase in refractive index directly proportional to the initial streptavidin-coupling concentration. Initial experiments at each of these β3-coating concentrations were conducted with talin-H at concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 nm. Initial estimates of k off using Equation 3 showed a concentration dependence at streptavidin-coupling levels of 950 and 1500 RU (details not shown). At these coupling levels (950 and 1500 RU),k off values decreased as the initial amount of the head domain bound to the sensor chip decreased, indicating mass transfer effects. However, a coupling level of ∼500 RU resulted in clear responses and concentration independence ofk off at flow rates ranging from 10 to 30 µl/ml (data not shown). Consequently, these conditions were chosen for the remaining experiments. Real time measurement of the talin-H-β3 interaction revealed a typical association and dissociation phases (Fig.3A). Binding was specific, since negligible binding of talin-H was seen to a chip coated with αT, a construct that lacks the β3 cytoplasmic domain sequence (Fig. 3 D). At all concentrations of talin-H employed, k off values were nearly constant (4.8 × 10−3s−1) (Table II), as estimated using Equation 3 (Fig.4A). This indicates negligible rebinding of talin to the β3 tail during the dissociation phase. k on values were calculated to be 5.3 × 104m−1s−1 using Equation 2 . K s versus concentration plots for 10–300 nmtalin-H were linear (Fig. 4 B), indicating that thek on values are not affected by talin concentration. The dissociation constant, K d, was then calculated from these kinetic constants to be 9.1 (±0.4) ×10−8m−1. This value is in good agreement with that obtained from equilibrium binding Scatchard plots (1.1 × 10−7m−1) using Equation 4 (Fig.4 C). Thus talin-H binds to the β3 cytoplasmic domains reversibly, with a K d of ∼100 nm.Table IIKinetics of the binding of talin to β3 tailLigandAnalytekonkoffKd(kinetics)Ka (kinetics)Ka(equilibrium)M−1s−1s−1mm−1m−1m−1β3Full-length talin1.3 (±0.4) × 1037.2 (±0.5) × 10−45.5 (±0.3) × 10−71.8 (±0.4) × 1061.4 × 106Talin head domain5.3 (±0.2) × 1044.8 (±0.3) × 10−39.1 (±0.4) × 10−81.1 (±0.5) × 1079.0 × 106Talin rod domain3.8 (±0.5) × 1021.3 (±0.2) × 10−33.4 (±0.5) × 10−62.9 (±0.4) × 1052.1 × 105Experiments were performed on a BIACore 3000 instrument using a flow rate of 20 µl/min.

The affinity constants (Ka) were calculated askon/koff as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kinetic constants presented here are the mean values of at three separate experiments. Sensorgrams of intact talin or talin-R binding to β3revealed dissociable binding. Estimation of kinetic and equilibrium parameters (Table II) indicated that intact talin bound with a 6-fold lower affinity than its head domain (K d = 91 nm for talin-H = and 550 nm for intact talin). This difference was primarily due to a difference in on-rates between the two molecules (k on = 5.3 × 104m-1s-1 for talin-H and 1.3 × 103m-1s-1 for intact talin). Furthermore, talin-R bound with a 37-fold lower affinity than talin-H (Table II). Thus, talin-H binds β3 with a 6-fold higher affinity than intact talin. The difference in affinity of talinversus talin-H could be due to the source of the two proteins, platelets versus a recombinant protein, respectively. Alternatively, it could reflect a constraint on the interaction of talin-H with β3 in intact talin. To test this possibility, we digested talin with calpain, a cleavage known to liberate talin-H from talin-R (33Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol. Cell.

Digestion of talin with calpain (0.1 µg of calpain/mg of protein) resulted in complete cleavage as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.5A, inset). After cleavage there was a dramatic increase in talin binding to the β3 tail (Fig. 5, A and B). Kinetic analysis indicated that cleavage resulted in a 100-fold increase in the apparent k on, 1.4 × 105 versus 1.3 × 103m−1 s−1, and a 7-fold increase in the apparent k off, 5.4 × 10−3 versus 7.2 × 10−4 s−1, relative to intact talin. Consequently, the apparent K d for this mixture of cleavage products is 3.9 × 10−8m, a 16-fold dec"

One of the gene products, which promoted processing of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP was claudin-5, a major component of endothelial tight junctions. Expression of claudin-5 not only replaced TIMP-2 in pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP but also promoted activation of pro-MMP-2 mediated by all MT-MMPs and MT1-MMP mutants lacking the transmembrane domain (ΔMT1-MMP). A carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of pro-MMP-2 (proΔMMP-2) was processed to an intermediate form by MT1-MMP in 293T cells and was further converted to an activated form by introduction of claudin-5. In contrast to the stimulatory effect of TIMP-2 on pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP, activation of pro-MMP-2 by ΔMT1-MMP in the presence of claudin-5 and proΔMMP-2 processing by MT1-MMP were both inversely repressed by expression of exogenous TIMP-2. These results suggest that TIMP-2 is not involved in cluadin-5-induced pro-MMP-2 activation by MT-MMPs. Stimulation of MT-MMP-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation was also observed with other claudin family members, claudin-1, claudin-2, and claudin-3. Amino acid substitutions or deletions in ectodomain of claudin-1 abolished stimulatory effect. Direct interaction of claudin-1 with MT1-MMP and MMP-2 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analysis. MT1-MMP was co-localized with claudin-1 not only at cell-cell borders, but also at other parts of the cells. TIMP-2 enhanced cell surface localization of MMP-2 mediated by MT1-MMP, and claudin-1 also stimulated it. These results suggest that claudin recruits all MT-MMPs and pro-MMP-2 on the cell surface to achieve elevated focal concentrations and, consequently, enhances activation of pro-MMP-2.

The active form of MT1-MMP first binds TIMP-2 through its catalytic domain, thus docking soluble TIMP-2 to the cell surface. This TIMP-2·MT1-MMP complex subsequently functions as a receptor, allowing pro-MMP-2 to form a ternary complex through the interaction of its carboxyl-terminal domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of TIMP-2. The propeptide of pro-MMP-2 is cleaved by an adjacent TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP between Asn37 and Leu38, generating an activated intermediate form. This MMP-2 intermediate form is further processed to the fully activated form by an intermolecular auto-cleavage when present at a sufficiently high concentration on the cell surface. When TIMP-2 exists in excess relative to MT1-MMP, the first step of this activation process is blocked (22Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

However, this pro-MMP-2 activation model has not been established in a living cell system due to a lack of information on the molecules regulating cell-surface localization of MT1-MMP. In this study we have used an expression cloning strategy to screen for genes that modulate the activation of MMP-2 by MT1-MMP. And endothelial cell-specific, tight junction (TJ) protein claudin-5 was identified, which not only replaced TIMP-2 for mediating pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP, but also promoted the activation of pro-MMP-2 by all MT-MMPs so far reported.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. A human placenta cDNA library constructed in pEAK8 expression vector was provided as unamplified bacterial clones. An aliquot of 30 bacterial clones was grown in 2 ml of MMI broth (4 mm Tris-HCl, 1.25% tryptone, 2.5% yeast extract, 125 mm NaCl, 0.4% glycerol; pH 7.2) at 37 °C overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted by a modified alkaline method followed by polyethylene glycol precipitation. 293T cells (5 × 104) were plated into each well of a 96-well microplate in 0.1 ml of culture medium 24 h before transfection. Plasmid DNA from the cDNA library (100 ng) was co-transfected with expression plasmids for pro-MMP-2 (20 ng), pro-MMP-9 (3 ng), and MT1-MMP (30 ng) using TransIT LT1 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mirus, Madiso, WI). At 48 h post-transfection culture medium was removed by aspiration, and cells were dissolved in 50 µl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue; pH 6.8) with the aid of mild sonication, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and were subjected to gelatin zymography as described previously (32Kadono Y.

A pool of cDNA, transfection of which promoted pro-MMP-2 processing, was used to transform Escherichia colistrain XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Individual bacterial colonies were grown in 2 ml of MMI broth, and plasmid DNA from each clone was extracted and analyzed as above. A single clone of cDNA, expression of which promoted activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP, was selected, and the cDNA nucleotide sequence was determined on the LI-COR DNA sequencer Model 4200L(S)-2. A DNA fragment containing the multiple cloning site and FLAG-epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) coding region was PCR amplified from pFLAG-CTC plasmid DNA (IBI FLAG Biosystems, Rochester, NY) with primers N26 and C24 (IBI FLAG Biosystems) and was inserted in the cloning site of pSG5 after digestion withHindIII and BglII (designated as pSG-FLAG). FLAG-epitope-tagged claudin-5 expression plasmid was constructed to detect claudin-5 protein by anti-FLAG M2 antibody. A claudin-5 cDNA fragment, which has BglII restriction site in place of the stop codon, was generated by PCR using T7 forward primer and flanking reverse primer with an extra BglII site (underlined) starting at nucleotide 774 (GenBankTM accession number NM_003277) (GGA GAT CTG ACG TAG TTC TTC TTG TCG TAG T). The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI andBglII and was inserted at EcoRI andBglII sites of pSG-FLAG vector (designated as pSG-claudin-5-FLAG). Claudin-5-GFP chimeric protein was generated to monitor claudin-5 localization under confocal laser microscopy. The GFP coding region was PCR-amplified with a flanking forward primer, which had the BglII site in place of the ATG start codon and a flanking reverse primer starting downstream of stop codon with an extraBglII site. The amplified fragment was digested withBglII and inserted at the BglII site located between the claudin-5 cDNA fragment and the FLAG-coding region in pSG-claudin-5-FLAG plasmid (designated as pSG-claudin-5-GFP). cDNA was synthesized by ReverTra Ace reverse transcriptase (TOYOBO, Japan) from total RNA of human placenta tissue using 8-mer random primers. The following primers were used to obtain claudin-1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF134160): flanking forward primer starting at nucleotide 202 (5′-Cl-1: CCG AAT TCT GCA CCT GCC ACC); flanking reverse primer starting at 886 with an extra EcoRI site (underlined) (3′-Cl-1: TGA ATT CGA CAG ATC ACA CGT AG). The amplified cDNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI site of modified pEAK8 expression vector (pEAK-MI). The pEAK-MI vector was generated by inserting linker oligonucleotides (antisense, AAG CTT GAA TTC GGC GCG CCA GAT ATC GCA TGC; sense, CGC CGG CGC CAT GGC GAT CGG CTA GCA GAT CT) into the pEAK8 expression vector digested with HindIII andNotI. Inserts for a series of the claudin-1 mutants were generated by a two-step PCR strategy utilizing the wild-type claudin-1 construct described above as a template. The first step involved two separate reactions, using sense and antisense primers incorporating specific mutations from the wild-type sequence and either 5′-Cl-1 or 3′-Cl-1 primers. In this manner, 5′-Cl-1 and the appropriate antisense primer amplified the upstream half of the fragment (containing the mutation), and 3′-Cl-1 and the corresponding sense primer amplified the downstream half. The products were then mixed and used as a template for the second round of PCR, using 5′-Cl-1 and 3′-Cl-1 only as primers. Full-length constructs were only amplified if the upstream and downstream halves annealed, thereby generating the mutant constructs. Following PCR, the fragments were digested with EcoRI and cloned into pEAK-MI. The mutant constructs were generated using the following mutagenesis primers: Δ38–67, antisense CAA GGA GTC GCC GGC ATA GGA GTA; sense GCC GGC GAC TCC TTG CTG AAT CTG: Δ55–64, antisense GAC TTT GCA GGA CAT CCA CAG CC; sense ATG TCC TGC AAA GTC TTT GAC TC: Δ142–155, antisense CCT GGC ATT GCC ATA CCA TGC TGT G; sense TAT GGC AAT GCC AGG TAC GAA TTT G: C54S, antisense CTC TGC GAC ACG GAG GAC ATC; sense CTG TGG ATG TCC TCC GTG TCG: C64S, antisense TCA AAG ACT TTG GAC TGG ATC; sense GGC AGA TCC AGT CCA AAG TCT. The ΔYV mutant with a disrupted carboxyl-terminal PDZ motif, was generated by PCR using a primer set consisting of: antisense CCG AAT TCT GCA CCT GCC ACC, sense GAC GGA TTC CAC TTA GTC TTT CC. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pEAK-MI expression vector digested withHindIII and EcoRI. The Δ1–101 mutant, which lacks the amino-terminal half, was generated by PCR using a primer set consisting of: antisense CAA GCT TGG CAT GAA GTG TAT GA, sense TGA ATT CGA CAG ATC ACA CGT AG. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pEAK-MI expression vector digested with HindIII andXbaI. 293T cells were plated into 24-well microplate 24 h before transfection. MMP-2 (80 ng) and MT-MMP (220 ng) plasmids were co-transfected with genes of interest using TransIT LT-1. Total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 500 ng with pSG5 plasmid DNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were dissolved in 150 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 15-µl aliquots of cell lysates were analyzed by gelatin zymography. 293T cells cultured in 24-well culture plates were transfected with expression plasmid, and at 24 h post-transfection culture medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium for another 16 h. TIMP-2 concentrations in culture medium were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (33Fujimoto N. Zhang J. Iwata K. Shinya T. Okada Y. Hayakawa T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1993; 220: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with 2 µg each of MT1-MMP, MMP-2, or claudin-1 plasmid using TransIT LT-1 in a 60-mm plastic plate using the appropriate vector controls for 48 h, and then metabolically labeled with 50 µCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h. Cells were solubilized with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4, with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the supernatants were obtained after centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000 rpm. An aliquot (1 µg) of each polyclonal antibody against claudin-1 or a monoclonal antibody against either MT1-MMP or MMP-2 was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Antigen·antibody complex was collected with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer. Materials bound to the beads were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 2 min, and separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels. 35S-Labeled materials were detected by Bioimage analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). An MT1-MMP cDNA fragment was cloned in pCEP4 (Invitrogen). The stop codon of MT1-MMP was mutated to an in-frameBglII site by PCR method, and a GFP fragment with theBglII site as described above was inserted (pCEP4-MT1-GFP). 293T cells were plated into 35-mm diameter dishes with 0.2-mm-thick glass bottoms (Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and were co-transfected with 100 ng of pCEP4-MT1-GFP, 100 ng of MMP-2, and 100 ng of claudin-5 plasmids. Total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 2 µg with pSG5 plasmid DNA. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a monoclonal antibody against MMP-2 (gift from Dr. K. Iwata, Fuji Chemical Ind. Ltd., Toyama, Japan) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against claudin-1. Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG and TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were used as second antibodies. Fluorescence was monitored using inverted confocal laser microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Plasmid DNA from the human placenta cDNA library was co-transfected with MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP cDNA into 293T cells, and cell lysates were analyzed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1). Transfection with MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP cDNA generated a 92-kDa band of latent pro-MMP-9, a 68-kDa band of latent pro-MMP-2, and a 64-kDa band of the MMP-2-activated intermediate form. Co-transfection of a pool of cDNA promoted pro-MMP-2 activation to generate the fully activated form (lane 8 is marked). A single cDNA clone, expression of which promoted pro-MMP-2 processing, was obtained by second screening, and the nucleotide sequence of the 1.4-kb cDNA fragment was determined. Homology search analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that this cDNA clone is derived from the human gene for claudin-5/transmembrane protein deleted in velo-cardio-facial syndrome (GenBankTM accession number NM_003277) (34Morita K. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Effects of claudin-5 expression on activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT-MMPs were examined in 293T cells (Fig.2A). Expression of claudin-5 alone did not have any effect on pro-MMP-2 processing. Transfection of either MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP cDNA converted pro-MMP-2 from latent to an activated intermediate form. Introduction of cDNA into these cells stimulated processing to generate the fully activated form. Expression of MT2-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5-MMP, or MT6-MMP alone did not induce processing of pro-MMP-2, however, pro-MMP-2 activation was observed when claudin-5 cDNA was co-transfected with each of these MT-MMPs. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that expression of MT-MMPs was not affected by claudin-5 expression (Fig. 2 B). Expression of TIMP-2 induced accumulation of the 57-kDa form of MT1-MMP, however, this was not observed with the expression of claudin-5. The transmembrane domain of MT1-MMP is important for cell-associated pro-MMP-2 activation (26Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, MT1-MMP lacking the transmembrane domain (Δ535) or the transmembrane and fibronectin-like domains (Δ335) caused only faint pro-MMP-2 activation (Fig.3). Co-expression of claudin-5 with each of the MT1-MMP mutants also induced pro-MMP-2 activation. These results suggest that only the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP is enough for the processing of pro-MMP-2 in the presence of claudin-5.Figure 3Claudin-5 promotes pro-MMP-2 processing by MT1-MMP mutants. A, control (pSG5) plasmid or claudin-5 plasmid (40 ng) was co-transfected into 293T cells cultured in 24-well culture plates with MMP-2 plasmid (80 ng) and either wild-type or mutant MT1-MMP plasmid (220 ng) as indicated. Total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 500 ng/well with pSG5 plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed by gelatin zymography. B, cell lysates used for gelatin zymography inA above were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and tested for the expression of MT1-MMP mutants Δ535 or Δ335 by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody against MT1-MMP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A model suggested for pro-MMP-2 processing involves the formation of a tri-molecular complex comprising MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and pro-MMP-2, and thus proΔMMP-2, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal domain to interact with TIMP-2 and can not form a tri-molecular complex, has been thought to be insensitive to processing by MT1-MMP (24Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H. Tamura T. van Westrum S.S. Crabbe T. Clements J. d'Ortho M.P. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Effects of claudin-5 expression on proΔMMP-2 processing were examined in 293T and COS-1 cells. ProΔMMP-2 expressed in 293T cells was detected as a 48-kDa band by gelatin zymography (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, co-expression of MT1-MMP in 293T cells resulted in processing of proΔMMP-2 to the 44-kDa intermediate form, and further transfection of claudin-5 cDNA stimulated MT1-MMP-mediated processing of proΔMMP-2 and generated the 42-kDa-activated form. Co-transfection of claudin-5 cDNA alone with proΔMMP-2 gene did not result in processing (data not shown). To analyze the association of TIMP-2 with proΔMMP-2 processing by MT1-MMP, effects of TIMP-2 expression on processing by MT1-MMP were compared between pro-MMP-2 and proΔMMP-2 (Fig. 5, A andB). In 293T cells pro-MMP-2 was processed to an intermediate form by MT1-MMP, and expression of TIMP-2 promoted pro-MMP-2 activation to produce the fully active form in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, processing of proΔMMP-2 by MT1-MMP was inhibited by TIMP-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. In COS-1 cells pro-MMP-2 was converted to the fully active form by MT1-MMP without exogenous TIMP-2 expression and was not further stimulated but inhibited by transfection of the TIMP-2 cDNA at the highest dose. ProΔMMP-2 was only faintly processed to the 44- and 42-kDa forms without exogenous TIMP-2 expression and this was also only inhibited by the expression of TIMP-2.Figure 5Effects of TIMP-2 on processing of pro-MMP-2 and proΔMMP-2. A andB, pro-MMP-2 (80 ng) or proΔMMP-2 (40 ng) plasmid and MT1-MMP (220 ng) were co-transfected into 293T (A) or COS-1 (B) cells cultured in 24-well microplates with indicated amounts of TIMP-2 plasmid. C, control plasmid or claudin-5 plasmid (50 ng), pro-MMP-2 (80 ng), and MT1-MMP mutants Δ535 (220 ng) were co-transfected into 293T cells cultured in 24-well microplates with indicated amounts of TIMP-2 plasmid. Total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 500 ng/well with pSG5 plasmid. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and analyzed by gelatin zymography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TIMP-2 levels secreted by 293T and COS-1 cells with or without exogenous TIMP-2 expression were compared (TableI). 293T cells do not secret a detectable level of endogenous TIMP-2 (<1 ng/ml), whereas the level of endogenous TIMP-2 in COS-1 cells (49 ng/ml) was close to the level that induced maximum pro-MMP-2 activation in 293T cells (101 ng/ml). Pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP was almost constant under conditions of TIMP-2 expression within a range of 49–1630 ng/ml in COS-1 cells and within a quite similar range in 293T cells (101–995 ng/ml). Complete inhibition of pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP was observed when the TIMP-2 level reached 7280 ng/ml in the culture medium.Table ITIMP-2 productionPlasmid293TCOS-1ng/wellng/ml0<149 ± 82<163 ± 111019 ± 4272 ± 4550101 ± 151630 ± 186250995 ± 1227280 ± 880293T or COS-1 cells cultured in 24-well microplates were transfected with expression plasmid for TIMP-2.

This complex of over 20 polypeptides associates with pol II and is recruited to transcription complexes at promoters. Previous isolations of yeast Mediator-containing complexes in different laboratories have identified several distinct complexes. To identify the major forms of Mediator in yeast, Mediator was isolated from nuclear extracts using a two-step chromatographic procedure, avoiding ion exchange chromatography and high salt conditions to prevent dissociation of subunits during purification. Components of the Mediator complexes were identified by mass spectrometry and Western analysis. The major form of Mediator, termed pol II·Med, contained pol II and Mediator, including the Srb8–11 module. A second lower molecular size complex was also identified, termed Mediator core (Medc), which lacked pol II, Srb8–11, Rox3, Nut1, and the Rgr1 module. Both of these complexes were active in transcription in vitro, although the Medc complex had significantly lower activity and could compete with the activity of the pol II·Med complexin vitro.

Together these factors comprise the minimal pol II transcription machinery and can promote accurate transcription initiation from a core promoter (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev.

However, additional factors termed coactivators are required for response to transcriptional regulatory signals. These factors include the chromatin remodeling machinery, histone acetylases, the TBP-associated factors, and the Mediator complex (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev.

The Mediator complex was first discovered in yeast and consists of more than 20 polypeptides. TheSrb2, -4, -5, and -6Mediator subunit genes were identified as dominant suppressors of deletions in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest pol II subunit (8Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. 1995; 20: 113-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Likewise, the Srb7–11 subunits were identified as recessive suppressors of CTD deletions. The remaining subunits were identified by biochemical fractionation and include proteins previously identified as having positive and/or negative roles in gene regulation (Hrs1/Pgd1, Gal11, Sin4, Nut1, Nut2, Rox3, and Rgr1) and other subunits not previously known to be involved in transcription (Med1, -2, -4, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -11) (9Myers L.C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vivo, and in crude nuclear transcription extracts, the yeast Mediator behaves functionally as a general transcription factor. Heat shock of a strain containing a temperature-sensitive Srb4 allele results in a global decrease in pol II transcription equivalent to a mutation in pol II (12Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Likewise, transcription in vitro is highly dependent on Srb2, -4, and -6 in nuclear extracts (14Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1367-1375Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this nuclear extract system, mutation of Srb2, -4, or -6 blocks recruitment of factors except TFIIA and TFIID to the preinitiation complex (PIC) (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After transcription initiation, Mediator along with TFIIA, TFIID, TFIIH, and TFIIE remain at the promoter forming a scaffold for recruitment of pol II and other missing factors required for transcription reinitiation (16Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Specific activators can stabilize this scaffold complex (16Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In highly purifiedin vitro systems, Mediator stimulates both basal and activated transcription as well as phosphorylation of the pol II CTD (17Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 18Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 19Myers L.C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In these highly purified systems, Mediator isolated from strains carrying deletions of nonessential subunits is defective in response to specific transcriptional activators. In the past several years, human homologs of the yeast Mediator complex have been identified by affinity purification, interaction with specific activators, and on the basis of coactivator activity. At least eight different human and mouse Mediator complexes have been identified (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 3Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 21Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These complexes differ in their exact polypeptide composition but contain a common set of polypeptides, including homologs to yeast Rgr1 and Med7. Interestingly, even though Srb2, -4, -5, and -6 are crucial to yeast Mediator function, no homologs to these factors have yet been identified in any organism other than yeasts. Because both yeast and human Mediator subunits interact with specific transcription activators, a current model for activator function is that interaction between specific activators and specific Mediator subunits aids in recruitment of the transcription machinery to promoters (1Lee T.I. Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 77-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 3Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcription reinitiation may be facilitated by interactions between activators and Mediator subunits that may stabilize the scaffold complex (16Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported biochemical fractionation of yeast Mediator-containing complexes from whole cell extracts. Young and coworkers followed purification of Mediator subunits by Western blot assay and isolated a complex termed RNA pol II holoenzyme. This complex contains pol II, Mediator (including the Srb8–11 subunits), TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIH, and SWI/SNF (18Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 22Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. van Vuuren H.J.J. Young R.A.

In contrast, fractionation by Kornberg, Kim, and coworkers found Mediator (lacking the Srb8–11 subunits) associated with pol II and sometimes TFIIF in a complex termed holopolymerase or holoenzyme (10Gustafsson C.M. Myers L.C. Beve J. Spahr H. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30851-30854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Han S.J.

Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The reason for these differences in Mediator complexes is not clear, because similar methods involving ion exchange chromatography were used by all three groups (24Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 176-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Li Y. Bjorklund S. Kim Y.J. Kornberg R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 172-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, using a different purification method, Jaehning and coworkers (26Chang M. French-Cornay D. Fan H.Y. Klein H. Denis C.L. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1056-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have isolated a complex termed Paf1 or alternative holoenzyme, which contains pol II, TFIIB, TFIIF, Cdc73, Paf1, Ccr4, Hpr1, and the Mediator subunits Gal11 and Sin4. Both biochemical and genetic studies have suggested that the Mediator is composed of stable subcomplexes or modules. One module contains the dominant CTD suppressors Srb2, -4, -5, and -6 as well as Med6 and Rox3 (27Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This subcomplex is stable in 1 m urea. A second module consists of Rgr1, Gal11, Sin4, Hrs1/Pgd1, and Med2. Evidence for this subcomplex is that pol II·Med with a C-terminal deletion of Rgr1 lacks Gal11, Sin4, and Hrs1 (20Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell.

In light of the different Mediator-containing complexes isolated by biochemical fractionation and the distinct modules of Mediator subunits identified by biochemical and genetic studies, we have investigated the different forms of Mediator complexes in yeast. To avoid high salt conditions and multiple ion-exchange chromatographic steps used previously that could have caused dissociation of subunits during isolation, affinity chromatography and gel filtration were used to isolate yeast Mediator complexes under mild conditions. Using these methods, two major yeast Mediator-containing complexes were identified and found to be distinct from those complexes previously identified. One complex is similar to the holoenzyme isolated by Kornberg, Kim, and colleagues, but in addition contains the Srb8–11 module. The other complex consists of a subset of Mediator components, and based on other work, appears to be the core Mediator complex. A PCR-mediated epitope-tagging method (31Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) was used to C-terminally tag the yeast Srb5, Srb4, and Rgr1 open reading frames. In brief, plasmid p3FLAG-KanMX (32Gelbart, M., and Tsukiyama, T. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol, in press.Google Scholar), which contains a tagging cassette (three copies of the FLAG epitope upstream from the KanMX6 marker) was used as the PCR template. Each pair of PCR primers contained 45 bases homologous to the target gene and 18 bases complementary to the tagging cassette. PCR products were transformed to yeast, and the tagging cassette was introduced into the target gene by homologous recombination. Correct colonies were selected on G418 plates and identified by colony PCR. FLAG-tagged proteins were confirmed by Western blotting. The C-terminal FLAG-tagged strains were grown in YPD media, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (33Ranish J.A. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19320-19327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 mg of nuclear extract (20–40 mg/ml of protein) was diluted to 30 ml with buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, and proteinase inhibitors) containing 0.25 m KOAc and incubated with 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h. After ten 30-ml washes with buffer A containing 0.3 m KOAc, proteins were eluted twice from the beads by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with buffer A containing 0.3 m KOAc and 0.5 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) (synthesized by Research Genetics). The eluted proteins were concentrated by Centricon YM-30 (Millipore) and applied to a TSK-G4000SWXL (TosoHaas) gel filtration column at 0.37 ml/min equilibrated in buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.3m KOAc, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and proteinase inhibitors). 135-μl fractions were collected, and 5 μl was used in Western blot analysis. Fractions containing protein complex were combined and concentrated by Microcon YM-10 (Millipore) for use in the transcription assay and immobilized template assay. For the estimation of molecular size of protein complexes, blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and bovine albumin (66 kDa) (Sigma) were loaded onto the same column as molecular size markers. All Western blots were performed as described (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected with the following antibodies: anti-Srb2, Rpb3, TFIIB, TBP (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), anti-Srb4, Srb10, Med6, Tfg2 (J. Movius and K. Coachman, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), anti-Sin4 (D. Stillman, University of Utah), anti-Gal11 (H. Sakurai, Kanazawa University, Japan), anti-Kin28, Rpb1 (Berkeley Antibody Co.), and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Quantitative Western blots were performed as described (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of recombinant proteins overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli (rSrb2, rSrb4, rSrb10, rRpb3, rTFIIB, and Tfg2) were used as standards. Band intensities were determined by densitometry using IQMAC v1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Peak fractions corresponding to pol II·Med or Medc from the gel filtration column were pooled and concentrated using Microcon YM-10 (Millipore). During concentration, the buffer was exchanged by repeated dilution with 100 mmNH4HCO3 with 8 m urea. Potential disulfide bonds were reduced and alkylated by incubation with 1 mm DTT at 37 °C for 20 min followed by 10 mmiodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature. Protein mixtures were digested with 100 ng of endoprotease Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 3 h at 37 °C, the urea concentration was adjusted to 2 m by dilution with 100 mmNH4HCO3, and CaCl2 was added to 5 mm. Digestion was continued by addition of modified trypsin (Promega) to a final substrate-to-enzyme ratio of 25:1 (w/w) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. After concentrating the samples to 50 μl and adjusting the pH to 3 with trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were desalted using C18 Ziptips (Millipore). Samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 5 μl of buffer C (5% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid). Identification of proteins was accomplished by microcolumn high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and data base searching (34Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar). A 100- by 365-μm fused silica capillary (Polymetrics Inc.) with a tapered tip was packed to a length of 10 cm with a 5-μm C18 reverse phase resin (Monitor). The sample was directly loaded onto the microcolumn by helium pressurization of the sample in a stainless-steel bomb. The mobile phase for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) consisted of buffer C and buffer D (99.5% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid). A precolumn split was used to deliver a flow rate of 300 nl/min through the column. The HPLC pump was programmed to ramp solvent B from 10 to 38% in ∼70 min. Electrospray ionization was done at a voltage of 1.8 kV. A Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer was used to automatically acquire tandem mass spectra during the entire gradient run. Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data base obtained from Stanford University with the SEQUEST program. Each high scoring peptide sequence and the corresponding tandem mass spectrum was manually inspected to ensure the match was correct. In vitrotranscription assay and primer extension were performed as described (33Ranish J.A. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19320-19327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2Available from the S. Hahn laboratory on the web. The plasmid pSH515 was used as the template, which contains the HIS4 core promoter and a Gal4-binding site (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Gal4-VP16 was prepared as described (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Immobilized template derived from plasmid pSH515 was prepared as described previously (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complex (PIC) formation experiments were performed essentially as described (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).2 Briefly, 2.5-μl immobilized templates were preincubated with 48 ng of Gal4-VP16 for 10 min at room temperature. At the same time, nuclear extract mix was prepared by adding 180 μg of nuclear extract and purified proteins to a transcription mix containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Then, the immobilized template and 0.5 μg of HaeIII-digestedE. coli competitor DNA were added to the nuclear extract mix to a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 40 min to form PICs. After washing three times with transcription buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 2.5 mm DTT, the immobilized template was digested with 60 units of PstI at 37 °C for 30 min. The liberated mixture was fractionated on a 4–12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), and the composition of PICs was analyzed by quantitative Western blotting. Previous biochemical fractionation of Mediator-containing complexes from yeast whole cell extracts have resulted in isolation of several complexes: the holoenzyme containing pol II, Srb8–11, and the general transcription factors TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIH (18Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), the holoenzyme lacking Srb8–11 and all general transcription factors (11Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the holoenzyme including a single general transcription factor TFIIF (17Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), and free Mediator (lacking both Srb8–11 and pol II) (36Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These fractionation methods have all used multiple ion exchange chromatography steps and high ionic strength buffers. It is possible that some of the differences in Mediator-containing complexes isolated by different laboratories arise from dissociation of subunits under these conditions. For example, it has been shown that a fraction of Mediator can be separated from pol II by ion exchange chromatography (36Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To isolate Mediator complexes under gentler conditions, we first epitope-tagged the genomic copy of the subunits Srb5, Srb6, or Rgr1 with three copies of the FLAG epitope at the C terminus of these genes. As judged by cellular growth rates compared with wild-type strains, and by in vitrotranscription using extracts made from these strains, the FLAG epitopes did not affect the function of any of these Mediator subunits. As a source for Mediator purification, we used yeast nuclear extracts, because these extracts have a much higher specific transcription activity compared with whole cell extracts used previously in holoenzyme and Mediator purification (data not shown). In addition, the nuclear extract system is clearly Mediator-dependent and has been used extensively for biochemical study of transcription initiation, reinitiation, and activation (15Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S.

Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The first step in Mediator isolation was affinity purification on anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads followed by peptide elution. Fig.1 shows the small-scale affinity purification results from three yeast strains containing C-terminal FLAG-tagged Srb5, Srb6, and Rgr1, respectively. Recovery was measured by probing Western blots for Mediator subunits, pol II subunit (Rpb1), and several general transcription factors. Similar recoveries were obtained for all the strains: ∼70% of Mediator subunits, 5–10% of pol II and <1% of both TFIIB and TFIIF were recovered. TFIIH and TBP were undetectable in the affinity-purified fractions (TableI). These results indicate that our FLAG-tag-based affinity purification is specific and efficient. A large-scale affinity-purified fraction from the FLAG-tagged Srb5 strain was then fractionated using gel filtration chromatography. In this step, we monitored each fraction by Western blotting using antibodies against Mediator subunits and general transcription factors (Fig.2). The results revealed that the Mediator subunits existed in two major forms: one large complex (fractions 39–47) corresponding to an apparent size of ∼1.9 MDa, and one smaller complex (fractions 63–69) corresponding to an apparent size of ∼0.55 MDa. As shown below, the large complex is a form of pol II·Mediator complex (termed pol II·Med), and the small complex consists of a core subset of Mediator subunits termed Mediator core (Medc).Table IRecovery of Mediator, pol II, and GTFs during affinity purificationProteinsRecoveryMolecules/cell%MediatorSrb5, Srb6, Rgr1-FLAG702–4,000Srb470Gal1170Pol IIRpb15–1010–20,000GTFTFIIB<130–50,000TFIIF<130–50,000TFIIH- aNot detectable.N.D. bN.D., not determined.TBP- aNot detectable.30–50,000Quantitative Western blotting was performed with a series of dilutions of nuclear extracts and the affinity purification fractions to calculate recovery.

The molar amounts of factors in the gel filtration fractions were determined by comparison with recombinant protein standards for Srb2, Srb4, Srb10, Rpb3 (pol II subunit), TFIIB, and Tfg1 (TFIIF subunit) (Fig. 2; data not shown; TableII). The pol II·Med complex principally contains pol II, and Mediator, including the Srb8–11 complex. As quantitated by Western blot of the pol II subunit Rpb3, pol II is estimated to be present at about one-half the molar ratio as compared with Srb2, -4, and -10. As shown below from comparison of the ratio of Mediator subunits to Rpb3 in preinitiation complexes (PICs), we believe that pol II is substoichiometric in the pol II·Med fractions compared with PICs. In contrast, a significantly lower amount of the general factors TFIIB and TFIIF was present in these fractions compared with Mediator subunits and pol II. We estimate that these factors are present a"

Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration changes the kinase activity, thus regulating smooth muscle contraction. On the other hand, the other component of myosin phosphorylation regulation, myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), was originally assumed to be itself unregulated. Recent studies have revealed that this is not the case and that MLCP is regulated by various signaling pathways. MLCP consists of three subunits, a myosin-binding large subunit (MBS), a 20-kDa small subunit, and a catalytic subunit of the type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase family (5Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MBS can be phosphorylated by Rho-dependent kinase, which results in a decrease in MLCP activity (6Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar); therefore, it has been postulated that an activation of the Rho signaling pathway would down-regulate MLCP and thus increase contraction. It was also shown that the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibits MLCP, thus inducing contraction (7Masuo M. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Kitazawa T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This suggests that MLCP is regulated by a membrane-associated large G-protein signaling pathway acting via activation of phospholipase C to produce diacylglycerol, an activator of PKC. Subsequently, it was suggested that the PKC-induced increase in contraction is due to an activation of MLCP-specific inhibitor protein, CPI17, by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (8Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It was also found that arachidonic acid could directly interact with MLCP to induce the dissociation of the MBS from the MLCP holoenzyme. The dissociation of the MBS results in a decrease in the phosphatase activity (9Gong M.C. Fuglsang A. Alessi D. Kobayashi S. Cohen P. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Pharmacol. 1988; 151: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is called agonist-induced “Ca2+sensitization.” Since guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiothiphosphate) mimics this effect (14Nishimura J. Kolber M. van Breemen C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,15Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is thought that G-proteins are involved in this mechanism. Since both PKC and Rho are downstream of G-protein pathways, it is thought that MLCP down-regulation is at least part of the “Ca2+ sensitization” mechanism. It is known that smooth muscle initiates contraction in the absence of Ca2+ when MLCP activity is completely inhibited by the potent phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin (16Gong M.C. Cohen P.

During this process, myosin regulatory light chain is phosphorylated, suggesting that Ca2+-free contraction with MLCP inhibition is due to an increase in myosin phosphorylation by protein kinases. The question is the identity of such protein kinases. The first candidate is MLCK, since MLCK can phosphorylate myosin in the absence of Ca2+(20Tokui T. Ando S. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the activity of MLCK in the absence of Ca2+is 1/1,000 to 1/10,000 of that in the presence of Ca2+(20Tokui T. Ando S. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and this value is too low to account for the phosphorylation rate observed during Ca2+ free contraction. This view was supported by the recent finding that a MLCK-specific peptide inhibitor failed to inhibit the Ca2+-free contraction induced by microcystin (19Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the stimulation of smooth muscle by certain agonists induces myosin light chain phosphorylation at both serine and threonine residues, presumably at Ser19 and Thr18 (21Colburn J.C. Michnoff C.H. Hsu L.C. Slaughter C.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Seto M. Sasaki Y.

While the serine phosphorylation is higher than the threonine phosphorylation, the extent of threonine phosphorylation is sufficiently high that it cannot be readily explained by MLCK, since it phosphorylates Ser19 100 times faster than Thr18 (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings lead to a hypothesis that protein kinases other than MLCK may contribute to myosin light chain phosphorylation in smooth muscles during agonist-induced contraction. The question to be answered is which protein kinases are responsible for myosin light chain phosphorylation. In this study, we found that ZIP kinase is expressed in smooth muscle tissues and that it can phosphorylate myosin in a Ca2+-independent manner and thereby induce Ca2+-free contraction of permeabilized smooth muscle. Smooth muscle myosin (25Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9569-9573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and myosin light chain kinase (26Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared from turkey gizzards as described previously. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (27Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Xenopus oocyte calmodulin (28Chien Y.H. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle MLC20 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (29Ikebe M. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P.

Mutant MLC20 in which Thr18 and/or Ser19 were mutated to Ala was made by site-directed mutagenesis (31Yano K. Araki Y. Hales S.J. Tanaka M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the MLC20expression vector as a template. A cDNA fragment corresponding to the nucleotide residues 347–678 of the coding region of human ZIP kinase (32Murata-Hori M. Suizu F. Iwasaki T. Kikuchi A. Hosoya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from HeLa cell total RNA and used as probe. The probe DNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Screening of the rat aortic smooth muscle cell cDNA library in λ ZAP II (Stratagene) was performed with the plaque hybridization technique using charged nylon membrane Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 °C. Positive plaque was detected by autoradiography and subsequently cloned by the repeating the positive plaque and plaque hybridization. The cDNA inserts were subcloned into pBluescript SK− from the ZAP II vector by in vivo excision using ExAssist helper phage and SOLR E. coli strain. Nucleotide sequences were determined on an automated sequence analyzer ABI 377S (Applied Biosystem) and analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). A DNA fragment corresponding to the nucleotide residues from 49 to the T7 promoter on the pBluescript SK− was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using sense primer, which was designed to contain an EcoRI site, and M13 reverse primer as an antisense primer. The EcoRI- and XhoI-digested polymerase chain reaction product was ligated to the EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pGEX4T-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using T4 ligase. Arg305 was substituted by stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression vector was transformed into BL21 codon plus E. coli (Stratagene) and cultured at 30 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8–1.0. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 50 µmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were allowed to grow for 2 h and were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Brij-35, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10% glycerol. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed for 3–4 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. The resin was extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol. The bound protein was eluted by 10 mm glutathione, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Full-length ZIP kinase cDNA was subcloned into pFASTBAC (Life Technologies, Inc.) with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) cDNA fused at its NH2terminus. Full-length rat MBS cDNA and Rho-kinase cDNA were kind gifts from Dr. P. Cohen (University of Dundee) and Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University), respectively, and were cloned into pFASTBAC HT plasmid. The plasmids were transformed into DH10BAC E. coli. Recombinant bacmids (recombinant virus DNA) were isolated and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells. Proteins were expressed by infection of fresh Sf9 cells with viral stock for 72 h. GST-fused full-length ZIP kinase was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Hexahistidine-tagged MBS and Rho-kinase were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Mutant MBS (T641A), in which Thr641 was mutated to Ala, was made by site-directed mutagenesis using MBS expression vector as a template. Peptides CRRREDGARKPERR (corresponding to the sequence of amino acids 294–306 of smooth muscle ZIP kinase) and CQSRRSpTQGVTL (where pT represents phosphothreonine) (corresponding to the sequence of amino acids 636–646 of rat MBS) were chemically synthesized as antigen and bound to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, at the NH2-terminal cysteine residue by Genmed Synthesis Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Antibody was prepared by injecting two rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide. Antibody against ZIP kinase was affinity-purified from the obtained serum by affinity chromatography with the peptide-conjugated resin. Phosphorylation-specific antibody against MBS phosphorylated at Thr641 was purified by two-step chromatography, affinity chromatography on phosphopeptide-coupled resin, and then absorption in unphosphorylated peptide-coupled resin. Phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin or isolated MLC20 was carried out using 1 µg/ml GST-ZIPK in the presence of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 µmmicrocystin LR, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the indicated period, and then the reaction was terminated by 10% trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography or quantified as described previously (33Walsh M.P. Hinkins S. Dabrowska R. Hartshorne D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK was carried out using 0.46 µg/ml MLCK in the presence of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 µm microcystin LR, 2 µg/ml calmodulin, and 0.1 mm ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis was done as described previously (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin was determined by measuring the liberated 32P as described previously (26Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out as described previously (31Yano K. Araki Y. Hales S.J. Tanaka M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Highashihara M. Frado L.L. Craig R. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). New Zealand White rabbits (2.5–3.0 kg) were sacrificed by the injection of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg). Smooth muscle strips were dissected from the first branch of mesenteric arteries. Fat and adventitia were removed mechanically under a binocular microscope, and endothelium was removed by gentle rubbing with a cotton swab. Then mesenteric arteries were cut into strips (50 µm thick, 500 µm wide, and 3 mm long). Smooth muscle strips were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, and 0.5 mm DTT for 60 min at 25 °C. The strips were tied with silk filaments and suspended between the fine tips of two tungsten needles, one of which was connected to a force transducer (FORT-10, WPI, Sarasoto, FL). The standard relaxing solution used for resting states of the permeabilized strips contains the following: 100 mmpotassium methansulfonate, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 5.9 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, and 20 mm Tris-maleate, pH 6.8. In the activating solution, a calculated amount of calcium methanesulfonate was added to give the final desired concentration of free Ca2+ ions. All solutions were adjusted to pH 6.8 at 25 °C. The developed tension was expressed as a percentage, assigning the values in relaxing solution and steady state of 10 µmCa2+-induced contraction recorded at the end of the experiment as 0 and 100%, respectively. MLC20 phosphorylation of smooth muscle strips was determined according to the method described by Persechini et al. (37Persechini A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6293-6299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contractile responses were terminated by the immersion of dry ice-cold acetone containing 10% trichloroacetic acid and 10 mm DTT. Proteins were extracted in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 23 mm glycine, 10 mm DTT, 9 m urea, and 0.002% bromphenol blue and then subjected to urea/glycerol PAGE, followed by immunoblot using 20-kDa myosin light chain antibody or a phosphorylation site-specific antibody for phosphorylated 20-kDa myosin light chain at Ser19 (38Komatsu S. Yano T. Shibata M. Tuft R.A. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34512-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). ZIP kinase was cloned from rat aorta. The deduced amino acid sequence was highly homologous to the ZIP kinase previously cloned from other mammalian species (Fig.1). However, the ZIP kinase obtained from rat aorta contained a unique 16 residues at the NH2-terminal end of the molecule, with a unique initiation codon. In the nucleotide sequence of ZIP kinase previously reported (39Kogel D. Plottner O. Landsberg G. Christian S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), there is a stop codon at the −15-position. In the rat aorta ZIP kinase, this stop codon was not present; instead, a novel 5′ sequence was found. Based upon this unique extension of the 5′ sequence, it is concluded that the aorta clone encodes a ZIP kinase with a unique 16-residue extension at the NH2-terminal end. Aorta ZIP kinase showed highest homology to the kinase domains of death-associated protein kinase and MLCK (48.6% identical to rabbit smooth muscle MLCK) as previously reported for other ZIP kinases (32Murata-Hori M. Suizu F. Iwasaki T. Kikuchi A. Hosoya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Kogel D. Plottner O. Landsberg G. Christian S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2645-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but there is no autoinhibitory region and calmodulin binding region as is present in MLCK, suggesting that this kinase is not a calmodulin-dependent kinase. The expression of ZIP kinase in smooth muscle was examined by Western blot analysis of various smooth muscle tissues (Fig.2). ZIP kinase was found in various types of phasic or tonic smooth muscle tissues. To find whether ZIP kinase can phosphorylate smooth muscle myosin, we expressed and purified the ZIP kinase. ZIP kinase cDNA was inserted into a pGEX-4T-2 expression vector containing the GST gene, and the GST fusion protein was expressed. Fig. 3shows the expression and purification of GST-ZIP kinase. GST-ZIP kinase was purified to homogeneity with an expected molecular mass of 60 kDa. The authenticity of the 60-kDa band protein as ZIP kinase was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-GST antibodies and anti-ZIP kinase antibodies as shown in Fig. 3 B. The purified GST-ZIP kinase was examined for phosphorylation of myosin and myosin-regulatory light chain (MLC20). ZIP kinase phosphorylated MLC20in a Ca2+-independent manner. The time course of phosphorylation fits a single saturation curve, suggesting that ZIP kinase phosphorelates MLC20 with a single rate constant. Consistently, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that ZIP kinase phosphorylates both serine and threonine residues to a similar extent (Fig. 4 B). Autoradiography confirmed that the incorporation of 32P is indeed into MLC20 (Fig. 4 C). Since many protein kinases can phosphorylate MLC20 when isolated but not while it resides in intact myosin, whole smooth muscle myosin was used as a substrate for ZIP kinase. While the rate of phosphorylation was slightly slower for whole myosin, ZIP kinase phosphorylated intact smooth muscle myosin well at its regulatory light chain (MLC20).Figure 4Phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin and myosin light chain by GST-ZIP kinase. A, rate of phosphate incorporation into MLC20 in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (open circles) or CaCl2 (0.2 mm) plus calmodulin (10 µg/ml) (closed circles). The extent of phosphorylation was expressed by percentage, assigning the maximum phosphorylation in the presence of EGTA (2 mol of phosphates/1 mol of MLC20) as 100%.

MLC20 (0.2 mg/ml) or myosin (2 mg/ml) was phosphorylated by GST-ZIP kinase (1 µg/ml) in the reaction mixture 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 µm microcystin LR, and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP at 25 °C for the indicated period and subjected to SDS-PAGE (upper panel) and then to autoradiography (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Table I shows the effect of ZIP kinase-induced phosphorylation on the actin-activated ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin. The activity was significantly enhanced by ZIP kinase-induced phosphorylation, and the value was comparable with that phosphorylated by MLCK. These results suggest that ZIP kinase phosphorylates the MLCK sites, i.e. Ser19 and Thr18 of MLC20. To determine the ZIP kinase phosphorylation sites, we produced MLC20 mutants in which Ser19 and/or Thr18 is mutated to Ala (Fig.5). The extent of phosphorylation by ZIP kinase of S19A and T18A mutants was approximately half of the wild type (Fig. 5). For T18A,S19A MLC20, the phosphorylation was completely abolished (Fig. 5). These results clearly indicate that ZIP kinase phosphorylates both Ser19 and Thr18. In contrast to MLCK, which phosphorylates Ser19 much faster than Thr18 (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of phosphorylation of the S19A and T18A mutants by ZIP kinase was nearly identical, indicating that ZIP kinase does not have a preference between Ser19 and Thr18. Fig. 6 shows the time course of myosin phosphorylation by ZIP kinase and MLCK. The phosphorylated myosin was examined at various times for the fraction of monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms. While MLCK produces the monophosphorylated form exclusively, ZIP kinase produced the diphosphorylated form before saturating the monophosphorylated form. The ratio of the monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated form was plotted against the extent of total phosphorylation. The obtained curve fits random phosphorylation of the two sites with an identical rate constant rather than a sequential phosphorylation.Table IActin-activated ATPase of smooth muscle myosin phosphorylated or unphosphorylated by GST-ZIP kinase+Actin−ActinActin-activatednmol/mg/minPhosphorylated80.08.271.8Dephosphorylated5.22.62.6The ATPase activity was measured in the buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mg/ml myosin in the presence and absence of 2 mg/ml actin at 25 °C. Smooth muscle myosin was phosphorylated by GST-ZIP kinase (1 µg/ml) in the same condition as in Fig. 4 for 60 min at 25 °C.

We examined the role of integrin-linked tyrosine kinases and focal adhesion proteins in regulation of L-type calcium current in single vascular myocytes. Soluble tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocked the increase in current produced by α5 integrin antibody or fibronectin, whereas tyrosine phosphatase inhibition enhanced the effect. Cell dialysis with an antibody to focal adhesion kinase or with FRNK, the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of focal adhesion kinase, produced moderate (24 or 18%, respectively) inhibition of basal current but much greater inhibition (63 or 68%, respectively) of integrin-enhanced current. A c-Src antibody and peptide inhibitors of the Src homology-2 domain or a putative Src tyrosine phosphorylation site on the channel produced similar inhibition. Antibodies to the cytoskeletal proteins paxillin and vinculin, but not α-actinin, inhibited integrin-dependent current by 65–80%. Therefore, α5β1integrin appears to regulate a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade involving Src and various focal adhesion proteins that control the function of the L-type calcium channel.

Several types of ion channels exhibit mechanosensitivity, but the mechanisms underlying their gating remain unclear. Membrane tension changes induced by physiologically relevant forces may not be sufficiently large to gate channels directly in eukaryotic cells (1Sachs F. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that mechanically advantageous associations with cytoskeletal or other membrane-bound proteins play a key role in control of gating. However, some mechanism must exist to integrate mechanosensitive gating behavior with the primary regulatory mechanism for channel gating, which is phosphorylation of channel proteins by intracellular kinases (2Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Integrins are potential force transduction proteins because they span the plasma membrane and link the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 to the underlying actin cytoskeleton (CSK) in specialized focal contact regions. Stress applied through integrin-specific adhesion sites increases cytoskeletal stiffening (3Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar), activates second messenger formation (4McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and initiates ribosomal and mRNA recruitment to focal adhesions (5Chicurel M.E. Singer R.H. Meyer C.J. Ingber D.E. Nature. 1998; 392: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Integrin clustering by multivalent ligands, including ECM proteins, induces recruitment of CSK proteins including vinculin, talin, paxillin and tensin to the focal contact (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 7Miyamoto S. Teramoti H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, PLC-γ, and Rho GTPase, as well as adaptor proteins such as Grb2, Sos, and Shc, are also recruited to the ECM-integrin binding site (8Vuori K. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Boudreau J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Subsequently, phosphorylation cascades are initiated involving one or more tyrosine kinases.We recently described functional coupling between integrins and the L-type calcium channel in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) (10Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This channel is the primary calcium entry pathway in VSM and can exhibit mechanosensitive gating under certain conditions (11Xu W.X. Kim S.J. So I. Kang T.M. Rhee J.C. Kim K.W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Doughty J.M. Miller A.L. Langton P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 433-439Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is regulated by at least two integrins. Soluble or bound ligands of the αvβ3 (vitronectin) receptor inhibit whole-cell, L-type current through RGD-dependent interactions. In contrast, only insoluble ligands of the α5β1 (fibronectin) integrin enhance L-type current. Soluble α5β1 ligands such as monoclonal antibodies activate current only if they are clustered using a secondary antibody (10Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that an integrin-linked signaling pathway may be involved (13Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar).The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanism by which the L-type channel in VSM is regulated by α5β1-ECM interactions. Our results indicate that a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade is required for the regulation of the L-type calcium channel by α5β1ligands. Furthermore, the pathway appears to be constitutively active, with FAK and c-Src as components. The involvement of these kinases suggests there may be overlap or convergence of the signaling pathway with those described for growth factor receptors (14Hu X.-Q. Singh N. Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5337-5342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This integrin-linked pathway represents a potential mechanism whereby calcium entry, and therefore vascular tone, can be regulated by mechanical forces and integrin-matrix interactions.DISCUSSIONOur results support the conclusion that regulation of the L-type calcium channel by the α5β1 integrin involves tyrosine phosphorylation and complex formation of multiple focal adhesion proteins. In vascular smooth muscle, engagement of this integrin by insoluble α5 integrin antibody or FN led to enhancement of L-type calcium current under conditions where the ligand was clustered. Regulation of calcium current by α5β1 integrin was blocked by broad spectrum inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or by targeting FAK or Src tyrosine kinases with specific antibodies. Tyrosine kinase inhibition had significant but less profound effects on basal L-type calcium current, whereas PKC inhibition produced selective inhibition of basal calcium current. Monoclonal antibodies to two integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein targets, paxillin and vinculin, also blocked regulation of current by α5β1 ligands. All of these proteins were localized to VSM focal adhesions. Finally, a peptide directed at a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site on the C-terminal loop of the α1c channel protein blocked regulation of current by α5β1 ligands. Our data support a role for direct regulation of calcium entry by α5β1integrin, with the potential for this effect to be greater than that described for serine-threonine kinases. It is likely that Src tyrosine kinase directly or indirectly mediates this effect. We propose that extracellular matrix exerts constitutive control over the major calcium-permeable ion channel in VSM and that acute regulation of calcium signaling by integrins may occur under physiological and pathological conditions in blood vessels.This conclusion is consistent with recent evidence that integrin ligands and ECM proteins can acutely regulate vascular tone. For example, RGD peptides cause a transient constriction and then dilation of isolated, pressurized skeletal muscle arterioles when applied extraluminally (36Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The dilatory phase is associated with a fall in VSM intracellular calcium (37D'Angelo G. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H175-H182PubMed Google Scholar) and is blocked by a β3 integrin antibody (36Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, α5β1 integrin ligands produce sustained constrictions of the same arterioles that are mediated by endothelin-1 release from the endothelium (38Mogford J.E. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, the initial, transient constriction is endothelium-independent. The responses of arterioles to αvβ3 and α5β1 integrin ligands (inhibition and enhancement, respectively) are consistent with the effects produced by these ligands on L-type calcium current in single arteriolar smooth muscle cells (10Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This evidence indicates that extracellular matrix proteins have the potential to influence vascular tone through an interaction with integrins, pointing to a possible role for these mechanisms in tissue injury responses (39Davis G.E. Bayless K.J. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1489-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).A growing body of evidence now suggests that phosphorylation of voltage-gated ion channels by protein tyrosine kinases is a general mechanism of acute channel regulation (40Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, the majority of those studies have focused on K+ channels. For example, deficiency in p56lck tyrosine kinase abolishes Fas-mediated inhibition of Kv1.3 current, whereas reconstitution of p56lckrestores the effect (41Szabo I. Gulbins E. Apfel H. Zhang X. Barth P. Busch A.E. Schlottmann K. Pongs O. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20465-20469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor inhibits Kv1.5 (42Bowlby M.R. Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Levitan I.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), probably through Src kinase, because co-expression of Src and hKv1.5 in HEK cells results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel and suppression of current (43Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R.B. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Studies of cloned Kv, Kir, and KCa channels have revealed specific tyrosine residues on the N- and C-terminal loops of the α subunits that are involved in channel regulation (42Bowlby M.R. Fadool D.A. Holmes T.C. Levitan I.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation leads, in almost all cases, to inhibition of current. However, the functional effects of K+ channel tyrosine phosphorylation in native cells are not very well known.In excitable cells, the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel constitutes the primary calcium influx pathway used by depolarizing stimuli and many G-protein-coupled agonists (20Hughes A.D. J. Vasc. Res. 1995; 32: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Regulation of this channel by serine-threonine kinases is well established (46Xiong Z. Sperelakis N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 75-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but regulation by tyrosine kinases has only recently been described (15Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,47Blair L.A. Marshall J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases have also been implicated in the regulation of the pore-forming subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, including α1e (48Arnoult C. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), α1d (49Strauss O. Buss F. Rosenthal R. Fischer D. Mergler S. Stumpff F. Thieme H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and α1c (50Evans G.J.O. Pocock J.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 51Ekinci F.J. Malik K.U. Shea T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30322-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In visceral smooth muscle, the α1c channel subunit (Cav1.2b) co-immunoprecipitates with both c-Src and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (14Hu X.-Q. Singh N. Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5337-5342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In cerebellar neurons, the neuronal isoform of α1c (Cav1.2c) is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IGF-1, resulting in potentiation of L-type current (47Blair L.A. Marshall J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,52Selinfreund R.H. Blair L.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1215-1220PubMed Google Scholar). This effect can be duplicated in recombinant Cav1.2c channels expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. Potentiation requires c-Src because expression of kinase-dead Src blocks potentiation of current (15Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Kinase assays using lysates from neuroblastoma cells expressing Cav1.2c show that purified Src kinase phosphorylates Tyr2122 of the C terminus. Furthermore, point mutation of Y2122F (but not of a nearby tyrosine residue) prevents tyrosine phosphorylation and prevents IGF-1 potentiation of current (15Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because Cav1.2b and Cav1.2c share identical sequences in this region, it is likely that Tyr2122 (rather than other postulated sites (14Hu X.-Q. Singh N. Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5337-5342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 53Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17786-17791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) also mediates the platelet-derived growth factor potentiation of current in smooth muscle. Our results with a peptide inhibitor directed against this region (Fig. 8) indicate that integrin-mediated enhancement of Cav1.2b current requires phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue. Although direct phosphorylation of VSM α1c (Cav1.2b) by Src or another Src family kinase has not yet been demonstrated, this site may be a common regulatory site for integrin and growth factor signaling pathways (14Hu X.-Q. Singh N. Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5337-5342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Wijetunge S. Hughes A.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 54Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the cardiac isoform of α1c (Cav1.2a) does not contain this tyrosine and that cardiac L-type channels are resistant to potentiation by IGF-1 (15Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Regulation of the L-type calcium channel by a tyrosine kinase in the focal adhesion complex is consistent with an emerging view that CSK proteins are key components for ion channel regulation. Evidence from a number of studies suggests that various structural proteins, including actin (55Maguire G. Connaughton V. Prat A.G. Jackson Jr., G.R. Cantiello H.F. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), synaptin (56Wiser O. Trus M. Hernández A. Renström E. Barg S. Rorsman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), tenascin (57Srinivasan J. Schachner M. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15753-15757Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and ankyrin (58Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), are required for normal regulation of voltage-gated ion channels. Their role may be analogous to that of protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring proteins in the regulation of Ca2+ and K+channels by PKA, where PKA-anchoring proteins 15/18 and 79 are needed for PKA targeting to Ca2+ and K+ channels, respectively (59Fraser I.D. Scott J.D. Neuron. 1999; 23: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, L-type calcium channels associate with at least three different synaptic vesicle proteins in secretory cells, and grouping of the channel in this multi-protein complex is required for normal function (56Wiser O. Trus M. Hernández A. Renström E. Barg S. Rorsman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the ability of vinculin and paxillin antibodies to inhibit the enhancement of L-type current by α5β1 ligands is probably because of interference by the antibodies with the assembly of Src or another tyrosine kinase on an intracellular scaffolding of focal adhesion proteins rather than a direct interaction with the channel. These CSK proteins have no intrinsic kinase activity, but some, like paxillin, can be phosphorylated to alter their ability to associate with other proteins (8Vuori K. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although there are at least 15 other known proteins in the focal adhesion complex (7Miyamoto S. Teramoti H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) that we have not tested, it is interesting that the only antibodies effective in blocking α5β1 enhancement of L-type current were those directed against focal adhesion proteins containing SH2 or SH3 domains. These are regions that would potentially enable these proteins to associate with tyrosine kinases, and α-actinin contains neither of them (8Vuori K. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Importantly, the α1c channel subunit contains an SH3 region in its C-terminal, intracellular loop (60Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Bunemann M. Puri T.S. Adair A. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that may allow it to interact with Src or other focal adhesion proteins, as is the case for an SH3 domain in the hKv1.5 channel (43Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Ren R.B. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The exact sequence of events from integrin ligation to calcium channel regulation will be difficult to unravel, but elucidation of this pathway may produce a new view of how voltage-gated calcium channels are regulated by ECM. Mechanical forces are known to stimulate a number of cell signaling pathways, including those initiated by or resulting in ion channel activation. Several types of ion channels exhibit mechanosensitivity, but the mechanisms underlying their gating remain unclear. Membrane tension changes induced by physiologically relevant forces may not be sufficiently large to gate channels directly in eukaryotic cells (1Sachs F. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that mechanically advantageous associations with cytoskeletal or other membrane-bound proteins play a key role in control of gating. However, some mechanism must exist to integrate mechanosensitive gating behavior with the primary regulatory mechanism for channel gating, which is phosphorylation of channel proteins by intracellular kinases (2Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are potential force transduction proteins because they span the plasma membrane and link the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 to the underlying actin cytoskeleton (CSK) in specialized focal contact regions. Stress applied through integrin-specific adhesion sites increases cytoskeletal stiffening (3Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E. Science. 1993; 260: 1124-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar), activates second messenger formation (4McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and initiates ribosomal and mRNA recruitment to focal adhesions (5Chicurel M.E. Singer R.H. Meyer C.J. Ingber D.E. Nature. 1998; 392: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Integrin clustering by multivalent ligands, including ECM proteins, induces recruitment of CSK proteins including vinculin, talin, paxillin and tensin to the focal contact (6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 7Miyamoto S. Teramoti H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, PLC-γ, and Rho GTPase, as well as adaptor proteins such as Grb2, Sos, and Shc, are also recruited to the ECM-integrin binding site (8Vuori K. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Boudreau J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Subsequently, phosphorylation cascades are initiated involving one or more tyrosine kinases. We recently described functional coupling between integrins and the L-type calcium channel in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) (10Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This channel is the primary calcium entry pathway in VSM and can exhibit mechanosensitive gating under certain conditions (11Xu W.X. Kim S.J. So I. Kang T.M. Rhee J.C. Kim K.W. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Doughty J.M. Miller A.L. Langton P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 433-439Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is regulated by at least two integrins. Soluble or bound ligands of the αvβ3 (vitronectin) receptor inhibit whole-cell, L-type current through RGD-dependent interactions. In contrast, only insoluble ligands of the α5β1 (fibronectin) integrin enhance L-type current. Soluble α5β1 ligands such as monoclonal antibodies activate current only if they are clustered using a secondary antibody (10Wu X. Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that an integrin-linked signaling pathway may be involved (13Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to determine the mechanism by which the L-type channel in VSM is regulated by α5β1-ECM interactions. Our results indicate that a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade is required for the regulation of the L-type calcium channel by α5β1ligands. Furthermore, the pathway appears to be constitutively active, with FAK and c-Src as components. The involvement of these kinases suggests there may be overlap or convergence of the signaling pathway with those described for growth factor receptors (14Hu X.-Q. Singh N. Mukhopadhyay D. Akbarali H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5337-5342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Bence-Hanulec K.K. Marshall J. Blair L.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This integrin-linked pathway represents a potential mechanism whereby calcium entry, and therefore vascular tone, can be regulated by mechanical forces and integrin-matrix interactions. DISCUSSIONOur results support the conclusion that regulation of the L-type calcium channel by the α5β1 integrin involves tyrosine phosphorylation and complex formation of multiple focal adhesion proteins. In vascular smooth muscle, engagement of this integrin by insoluble α5 integrin antibody or FN led to enhancement of L-type calcium current under conditions where the ligand was clustered. Regulation of calcium current by α5β1 integrin was blocked by broad spectrum inhibitors of tyrosine kinases or by targeting FAK or Src tyrosine kinases with specific antibodies. Tyrosine kinase inhibition had significant but less profound effects on basal L-type calcium current, whereas PKC inhibition produced selective inhibition of basal calcium current. Monoclonal antibodies to two integrin-associated cytoskeletal protein targets, paxillin and vinculin, also blocked regulation of current by α5β1 ligands. All of these proteins were localized to VSM focal adhesions. Finally, a peptide directed at a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site on the C-terminal loop of the α1c channel protein blocked regulation of current by α5β1 ligands. Our data support a role for direct regulation of calcium entry by α5β1integrin, with the potential for this effect to be greater than that described for serine-threonine kinases. It is likely that Src tyrosine kinase directly or indirectly mediates this effect. We propose that extracellular matrix exerts constitutive control over the major calcium-permeable ion channel in VSM and that acute regulation of calcium signaling by integrins may occur under physiological and pathological conditions in blood vessels.This conclusion is consistent with recent evidence that integrin ligands and ECM proteins can acutely regulate vascular tone. For example, RGD peptides cause a transient constriction and then dilation of isolated, pressurized skeletal muscle arterioles when applied extraluminally (36Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The dilatory phase is associated with a fall in VSM intracellular calcium (37D'Angelo G. Davis M.J. Meininger G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H175-H182PubMed Google Scholar) and is blocked by a β3 integrin antibody (36Mogford J.E. Platts S.H. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, α5β1 integrin ligands produce sustained constrictions of the same arterioles that are mediated by endothelin-1 release from the endothelium (38Mogford J.E. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, the initial, transient constriction is endothelium-independent. The responses of arterioles to αvβ3 and α5β1 integrin ligands (inhibition and enhancement, respectively) are consistent with the effects produced by these ligands on L-type calcium current in single arteriolar smooth muscle cells (10Wu X.

The degradation profile of the cell is comprised of the selective degradation of proteins that occurs predominantly in the cytosol through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, and the degradation of bulk cytoplasm that takes place in the lysosome in mammals and plants and in the vacuole in fungi (1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Autophagy is the major degradation route by which bulk cytoplasm is delivered to the lysosome/vacuole. This pathway is conserved from yeast to human. Although the autophagic machinery only functions at a basal level in nutrient-rich conditions, it plays an essential physiological role in starvation conditions, which are more likely to mimic the natural environment of organisms such as yeast. In yeast, when cells sense nitrogen starvation, cytosol and organelles are nonspecifically sequestered and delivered to the vacuole by the up-regulated autophagic machinery, where they can be recycled and used for critical processes, thus ensuring cell survival (3Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10807-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Klionsky D.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in yeast, autophagy overlaps with the biosynthetic delivery of the vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I (Ape1)1 by the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Under vegetative growth conditions, precursor Ape1 (prApe1) is synthesized in the cytosol where it quickly forms a homo-dodecamer (5Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These dodecamers subsequently assemble into a higher order complex termed the Cvt complex. The Cvt complex becomes enwrapped by a membrane resulting in a double-membrane Cvt vesicle (150 nm diameter). The contents of the Cvt vesicles appear to exclude cytosol and are observed as an electron-dense structure by electron microscopy (6Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Autophagy is morphologically similar to the Cvt pathway, however, the cytosolic double membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) are much larger (300–900 nm diameter) than Cvt vesicles and they include bulk cytoplasm (7Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In either case, the completed cytosolic vesicles then dock and fuse with the vacuole membrane releasing single membrane Cvt or autophagic bodies into the vacuole lumen. During starvation conditions, prApe1 is specifically sequestered, along with bulk cytoplasm, inside the double membrane autophagosome for its delivery to the vacuole. Precursor Ape1 is proteolytically processed to mature Ape1 once it reaches the vacuole by either the Cvt pathway or autophagy. Therefore, prApe1 processing serves as a useful diagnostic marker for studying both the Cvt pathway in nutrient-rich conditions and the autophagy pathway during starvation (8Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses support the morphological data that indicate an overlap between the Cvt pathway and autophagy. A genetic screen that was based on the accumulation of precursor Ape1 under nutrient-rich conditions was used to isolate mutants in the Cvt pathway (9Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J.

These cvt mutants exhibited an extensive genetic overlap with apg and aut mutants that were isolated as being defective in autophagy, indicating that the two pathways also share protein components (8Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the selective degradation of excess peroxisomes (pexophagy) occurs by a similar process using the same molecular machinery shared between the Cvt and autophagy pathways (11Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of the molecular components required for these pathways has provided significant insights into the process by which proteins are delivered post-translationally to the vacuole/lysosome. While many of the details of cytoplasm to vacuole transport remain to be elucidated, some of the key questions have begun to be answered. For example, the Cvt pathway operates under nutrient-rich conditions while autophagy is induced by starvation. Degradation of peroxisomes occurs during adaptation to preferred carbon sources following growth in peroxisome proliferating conditions such as methanol or oleate. The identified mechanism of signal transduction includes a signaling pathway regulated by Tor, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase homologue. Tor represses autophagy under nutrient-rich conditions. During starvation or following treatment with rapamycin, Tor kinase activity is inhibited and autophagy is induced (12Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). The Tor signaling cascade also affects the phosphorylation state of Apg13 and its affinity for the Apg1 kinase (13Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Recently, Cvt9 and Apg17 were characterized as additional proteins that associate with the Apg1 kinase (13Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 14Kim J. Kamada Y. Stromhaug P.E. Guan J. Hefner-Gravink A. Baba M. Scott S.V. Ohsumi Y. Dunn Jr W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cvt9 is specific for the Cvt pathway and is also needed for pexophagy while Apg17 is specific for autophagy. These findings suggest that a potential protein complex including the Apg1 kinase and various regulatory proteins may determine which of these pathways operates within the cell. One of the most distinctive features of the Apg/Cvt pathways is the formation of sequestering vesicles that engulf cytoplasm. A major difference between autophagy and the Cvt pathway is that autophagosomes are substantially larger than the Cvt vesicles that form under nutrient-rich conditions. Aut7 is the first identified component that localizes to both Cvt vesicles and autophagosomes. The level of Aut7 is up-regulated under starvation conditions, suggesting that it is a limiting component that is required for Cvt vesicle formation as well as autophagosome expansion (15Huang W.P.

Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The formation and completion of the Cvt vesicle/autophagosome also requires a novel protein conjugation system consisting of Apg5, Apg7, Apg10, Apg12, and Apg16 (17Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T.

Cell. 2000; 11: 969-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that Aut7 membrane association is dependent on the autophagy (Apg) conjugation system as well as a novel membrane lipidation process involving the Aut1 protein (21Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Finally, Apg9 is the only characterized integral membrane protein required for the vesicle formation/completion step for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways. It is localized at a perivacuolar punctate structure that appears to be distinct from typical plasma membrane and endomembrane marker proteins. Interestingly, the Apg9 protein does not appear to be localized to the Cvt vesicle/autophagosome suggesting that it might mark the site of the donor membrane for vesicle formation (23Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Baba M. Tokunaga C. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although some components have been cloned, many questions remain to be answered concerning the Cvt pathway, autophagy, and pexophagy. The identification of additional components that function in these pathways will help us to understand the molecular details of the import process including the origin of the sequestering membrane, the signal transduction cascade that senses the nutritional conditions, the mechanism of vesicle formation, and the subsequent delivery and breakdown of the subvacuolar vesicles. In the present study we have begun a characterization of the Apg2 protein that is required for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways and also for the related process of peroxisome degradation. The apg2Δ strain accumulated the precursor form of Ape1 in a protease-accessible, membrane-associated form, suggesting that Apg2 is required for the completion stage of Cvt vesicle and autophagosome formation. Subcellular fractionation and biochemical studies demonstrate that Apg2 is a peripheral membrane protein that localizes to the previously identified Apg9 compartment. Finally, microscopy experiments indicate that GFPApg2 localization is dependent on the Apg9 protein. This finding is supported by an in vitro pull-down assay that demonstrates a physical interaction between Apg2 and Apg9. The strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or synthetic minimal medium (SMD; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 2% glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids and vitamins as needed). Peroxisomes were induced by incubation in synthetic glycerol (0.67% YNB without amino acids, pH 5.5, 3% glycerol, 0.1% glucose) and oleic acid (YTO; 0.67% YNB, 0.1% Tween 40, 0.1% oleic acid) media.

To fuse GFP to the NH2 terminus of Apg2, theAPG2 ORF was amplified by PCR using pYCG_YNL242w as the template. The 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides used for the PCR amplification were 5′-TTGATTTCGACCCGGGGGCATTTTGGTTACCTCAAAATATACAAAAGCG-3′ and 5′- ATATCAAAAATGTCGGTACCAATTTTTACGAATCAGTCCGATTGGACTT-3′, respectively. The 5′ oligonucleotide contains an XmaI site that is in the same reading frame as the end of the GFP ORF of pCuGFP (414), a plasmid in which GFP expression is under the control of the CUP1copper-inducible promoter (22Kim J. Huang W.-P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The 3′ oligonucleotide contains aKpnI site. The APG2 PCR product was subcloned into pCuGFP(414) by an XmaI-KpnI digest, resulting in the pCuGFPAPG2(414) plasmid. To examine the survival of various yeast strains under nitrogen starvation conditions, cells were grown to an A 600 = 1.0 in SMD medium, washed once in SD-N, and then resuspended in SD-N to anA 600 = 1.0. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, serially diluted and plated onto YPD plates in triplicate. After 2–3 days incubation, colonies were counted on plates. To examine the protease sensitivity of prApe1 in the apg2Δ, apg7Δ, and ypt7Δ strains, cells were grown to mid-log phase (1.0A 600/ml) and converted into spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were then subjected to osmotic lysis in PS200 lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol) containing 5 mm MgCl2 at a spheroplast density of 20 A 600/ml. The lysed spheroplasts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min resulting in supernatant (S13) and pellet (P13) fractions. The P13 pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer in the presence or absence of proteinase K (50 µg/ml) and 0.2% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, acetone wash, and immunoblot with anti-Ape1 and anti-Pgk1 antisera. The procedure for the membrane flotation experiments is a modification of a previously described protocol (26Kim J. Dalton V.M. Eggerton K.P. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1337-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts from the apg2Δ strain were osmotically lysed in PS200 containing 5 mmMgCl2 at a spheroplast density of 20A 600/ml. The lysate was subjected to a 13,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min, resulting in supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions. The pellet fractions, which contained all of the prApe1, were resuspended in 200 µl of 15% Ficoll 400 (w/v) in lysis buffer with or without the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100. The resuspended pellet fractions were overlaid with 1 ml of 13% Ficoll 400 in lysis buffer and then 200 µl of 2% Ficoll 400 in lysis buffer. The resulting step gradients were subjected to a 13,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min at room temperature. Fractions were collected from the top. The first 400 µl was the float fraction (F), the remaining 1 ml was the non-float fraction (NF), and the gradient pellet was considered the pellet fraction (P2). The resulting fractions were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and washed twice with acetone followed by immunoblot with anti-Ape1 antiserum. To examine Apg2 stability and post-translational modification, cells were grown toA 600 = 1.0 in SMD. Cells (20 ml) were collected and labeled in 300 µl of SMD with 20 µCi of Tran35S-label for 30 min. The cells were then subjected to a non-radioactive chase in SMD supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract, 4 mm methionine, and 2 mm cysteine at a final density of 2.0 A 600/ml. Samples were removed at the indicated time points and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Crude extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (9Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells (SEY6210) were spheroplasted at an A 600 = 1.0 before osmotic lysis in PS200 buffer containing 0 or 5 mmMgCl2. The total cell lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resulting in soluble (S13) and pelletable (P13) fractions. The S13 fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman Coulter, Inc. (Fullerton, CA) OptimaTM MAX-E ultracentrifuge using a TLA 100.4 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C to generate the corresponding S100 and P100 fractions. The resulting fractions were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and washed twice with acetone followed by immunoblot with anti-Apg2 antiserum. To further examine the biochemical nature of the Apg2 pelletable fractions, spheroplasts of wild type cells were osmotically lysed in PS200 lysis buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2. The cell lysate was aliquoted and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The total pellet fraction was collected and resuspended in one of the following buffers: 1 m KCl, 0.1 mNa2CO3 (pH 10.5), 3 m urea, 1% Triton X-100. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, all samples were separated into supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blot as described previously (9Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Wild type cells were grown to mid-log phase and converted into spheroplasts before being subjected to osmotic lysis in PS200 buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin A). After a pre-clear centrifugation step at 800 × g for 5 min to remove the cell debris, the crude lysate (20 A 600 units of cells) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting total membrane fraction was resuspended in lysis buffer and layered on top of a density gradient consisting of 0–66% OptiPrep in PS200 containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The gradients were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 16 h at 4 °C in a TLS 55 rotor. Samples were collected from the top of the gradients into 14 fractions. The fractions were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and examined by immunoblot using antiserum or antibodies against Apg2, Dpm1, Mnn1, Pep12, Pho8, and Apg9. The multicopy APG2 plasmid, pAPG2(426), was co-transformed into SEY6210 wild type cells with pRS425-ProtA or pRS425-ProtA-APG9. Spheroplasts prepared from transformants were grown to mid-log phase and lysed by Dounce homogenization at a cell density of 30 A 600/ml in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer with or without 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 200 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, ± 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates (1 ml) were incubated with 20 µl of Dynabeads M-500 Subcellular cross-linked to human IgG for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer 4 times and eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Apg2 was detected by immunoblot. The assay was carried out essentially as described previously (11Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown in YPD to the exponential stage and then shifted to synthetic glycerol for 12 h at 30 °C. A 10× solution of YP was added to a final concentration of 1X and the culture incubated 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were then shifted to YTO for 19 h to induce peroxisomes. Cells were harvested and washed once in 1 × YNB (0.67% YNB) and SD-N, respectively. After washing, cells were resuspended in SD-N to anA 600 = 1.0. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, trichloroacetic acid precipitated, and then subjected to immunoblot with anti-Fox3 antiserum. Induction of peroxisomes in cells expressing GFP-SKL was done as described for the pexophagy thiolase assay. Following induction, cells were shifted to SD-N. At 0, 12, and 26 h following incubation in SD-N medium, aliquots were removed and examined by fluorescence microscopy. To examine GFPApg2 localization, cells were grown to midlog phase and viewed directly or shifted to SD-N medium for 4 h prior to examination. Microscopy was performed on a Nikon E-800 fluorescent microscope (Mager Scientific Inc., Dexter, MI). Images were captured by an ORCA II CCD camera (Hamamatsu Corp., Bridgewater, NJ) using Openlab software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). To examine induction and stability of Apg2 and GFPApg2, theapg2Δ (CWY1) and apg9Δ (JKY007) strains transformed with a plasmid expressing GFPApg2, and non-transformedapg9Δ and wild type (SEY6210) strains were grown in SMD or shifted to SD-N for 4 h. Protein extracts were prepared and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GFPApg2 and Apg2 were detected by Western blot using antiserum against Apg2. In the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, growth on methanol results in the proliferation of peroxisomes. Ethanol adaptation results in the degradation of excess peroxisomes through macropexophagy, where the organelles are sequestered within cytosolic vesicles and subsequently delivered to the vacuole (1Klionsky D.J.

Here we report that hGCN5, a well known histone acetyltransferase, specifically interacts with and acetylates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator protein, Tat. The interaction between Tat and hGCN5 is direct and involves the acetyltransferase and the bromodomain regions of hGCN5, as well as a limited region of Tat encompassing the cysteine-rich domain of the protein. Tat lysines 50 and 51, target of acetylation by p300/CBP, were also found to be acetylated by hGCN5. The acetylation of these two lysines by p300/CBP has been recently shown to stimulate Tat transcriptional activity and accordingly, we have found that hGCN5 can considerably enhance Tat-dependent transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat. These data highlight the importance of the acetylation of lysines 50 and 51 in the function of Tat, since different histone acetyltransferases involved in distinct signaling pathways, GCN5 and p300/CBP, converge to acetylate Tat on the same site.

Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that histone acetyltransferases p300, CBP, and P/CAF also possess a factor acetyltransferase (FAT) activity, in that they acetylate non-histone substrates, such as specific and general transcription factors or chromatin-related proteins (reviewed in Ref. 5Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Factor acetylation can modify protein-DNA or protein-protein interaction depending on the nature of the substrate. For instance, acetylation of the transcriptional activators GATA-1 by p300 (6Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6792-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by P/CAF increases their DNA-binding capacities, whereas acetylation of E1A 12S and TAL1 by P/CAF inhibits their interaction with a co-repressor (12Huang S.

Finally, the acetylation of the chromatin-associated protein HMG-17 by P/CAF reduces its affinity for nucleosomes (14Herrera J.E. Sakaguchi K. Bergel M. Trieschmann L. Nakatani Y. Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3466-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein acetylation may also regulate other cellular functions such as the stability or nuclear import of proteins (10Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T.

Tat, a viral protein encoded by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), activates viral gene transcription from the proviral long terminal repeat (LTR) by interacting with several cellular factors. One such factor is the Tat-associated kinase CDK9/P-TEFb, which is recruited by Tat on the transcription response RNA (TAR) element, located at the 5′ termini of all viral transcripts. This complex stimulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (Refs. 16Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Two nuclear HATs, p300 and P/CAF, were found to interact with and acetylate Tat on distinct lysine residues (25Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A.

The acetylation of the activator domain of Tat by P/CAF enhances the binding of Tat to the cellular factor CDK9/P-TEFb, whereas the acetylation of the TAR binding domain of Tat by p300 promotes its dissociation from TAR element during early transcriptional elongation, and both events increase the activation of transcription from the LTR. Thus, HIV-1 appears to develop the capacity to use the cellular acetylation signaling system to enhance its transcription (25Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C.

GCN5 is one of a number of well characterized nuclear HATs that acetylate histones H3 and H4 at specific residues (27Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D.

Human GCN5 (hGCN5) exists in two forms resulting from alternative splicing (30Smith E.R. Belote J.M. Schiltz R.L. Yang X.J. Moore P.A. Berger S.L. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2948-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,31Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The longer form (813 amino acids) shares strong homologies with P/CAF. The shorter form (476 amino acids) exhibits a size similar to yeast GCN5 and corresponds to the C-terminal part of the long hGCN5. In contrast to its homologue P/CAF, GCN5 has been described as a poor transcriptional coactivator in mammals. Additionally, it is not known whether hGCN5, like p300, CBP, and P/CAF, uses its acetyltransferase activity to modulate transcription factors by acetylation. In this report we investigated the ability of hGCN5 to acetylate and modulate the activity of the HIV transactivator, Tat. Data presented here show that hGCN5 interacts directly with Tat. The domains involved in this interaction were mapped on both proteins and the site of acetylation on Tat characterized. hGCN5 was found to acetylate Tatin vitro on lysine 50 and 51. In agreement with these findings, hGCN5 was shown to stimulate Tat-dependent transcriptionnal activation of the HIV-1 LTR. These results point to hGCN5 as a novel “FAT” that can take part in the activation of HIV gene expression by acetylating the viral transactivator Tat. Expression vectors for short hGCN5, wild type (wt), and mutants were constructed as follows. Coding sequences for hGCN5 and different mutants were produced by PCR with appropriate primers. Forward primers are: 5′-GCTCTAGACATGCTGGAGGAGGAGATC for wt and mutants 1–388 and 1–110, 5′-GCTCTAGACATGCTGGGGCCTGAGAC for mutants 111–476 and 111–251, 5′-CCTCTAGACTACGCCGACGAGTACGCC for mutants 252–476 and 252–388, and 5′-CCTCTAGATGCCTGGCCCTTCATGGAG for mutant 389–476. Reverse primers are 5′- GGCGGATCCCTACTTGTCAATGAGGCCTCC for wt and mutants 111–476, 252–476, and 389–476; 5′- CGGGATCCTAGGCAGCAGGGTCAGTGA for mutant 1–110; 5′-TCGGATCCTAGGTGAGGAAGTAGAGAA for mutant 111–251; 5′- CGGGATCCTAACTGGGGTGAGACTTGATTT for mutants 1–388 and 252–388. Forward and reverse primers contained XbaI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. PCR products were cloned in pSG5 (Stratagene). The expression vector for GST-Tat M5 mutant was generated as follows. The amino acids 21–48 region of Tat was amplified by PCR using the following sequences as primers: 5′-GGGGATCCCAACTGCTTGTACCAATTGCT-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTAGCCATAGGAGATGCCTAAG-3′. The amplified fragment was then cloned in BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-5X.3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells and HL3T1 cells (National Institutes of Health AIDS research), grown in monolayers to 50% confluence, were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with variable amounts of different plasmids (as described in the legends of the figures). Total amounts of SV40 and cytomegalovirus promoter-containing plasmids were adjusted with pSG5 and a pCMV vector DNA. Cells were collected 36 h after transfection and used for gene reporter assay. In each experiment, the expression of the transfected proteins (wild type and mutants Tat as well as hGCN5) was controlled by a Western blot using anti-Tat or anti-flag antibodies. The luciferase activities was measured on HeLa cytoplasmic extracts using a luciferase-based assay system (Promega), and the level of CAT protein was measured on HL3T1 extracts using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activity was normalized with respect to the plasmid uptake. Briefly, nuclei and cell debris obtained after the luciferase assay were pelleted and resuspended in 100 µl of 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mm EDTA containing 0.5% SDS, and digested with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. Ten µl of each sample were used to perform a Southern blot analysis. The blot was probed with a32P-labeled HIV-1 LTR fragment. Signals were quantified using a PhosphorImager, and the obtained values were used to normalize the luciferase activity. A recombinant His-tagged hGCN5 was produced in BL21-Lys bacteria transformed with the appropriate expression vector (pET28a-hGCN5). Briefly: recombinant protein expression was induced in exponentially growing bacteria by 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, overnight at room temperature. Bacteria were then pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 mm imidazole (per 500 ml of cell culture), and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-agarose column. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and His-tagged hGCN5 was eluted by lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, following by dialysis on 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. Total amounts of protein were estimated on a Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel. GST and GST-Tat fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 strain as described previously (32Veschambre P. Simard P. Jalinot P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and retained on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were incubated (1 h, 4 °C) either with 300 µg of HeLa nuclear extract (prepared according to the Dignam method) prepared from cells transfected with 1 µg of flag-tagged hGCN5 expression vector, or with 100 µl of a buffer (20% glycerol, 3 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 250 mmKCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µmacetyl-coA) containing 5 µg of purified, recombinant GCN5 or 10 µl of [35S]methionine-labeled hGCN5, wild type, or mutant proteins (produced using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system;Promega). After three washes in the same buffer, complexes were recovered in gel loading buffer and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then revealed either by Western blot using an anti-flag M2 (Sigma) or anti-His antibody (Qiagen), or by autoradiography. Purified recombinant His-GCN5 (2 µg) was incubated (30 min, 30 °C) with purified GST-Tat in a 30-µl reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 µCi of [14C]acetyl-coA). For assays with Tat mutants, acetylation was performed in same conditions, except that GST-Tat wild type or mutant proteins were immobilized on 25 µl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, stained in Coomassie Brillant Blue, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. GST-Tat pull-down assays were set up to investigate the ability of Tat to interact with hGCN5: GST-Tat (Tat86, HXB2 strain) fusion protein and GST (as a control) were produced in E. coli, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts expressing flag-tagged hGCN5 (f-hGCN5; Fig.1A). A Western blot using an anti-flag antibody revealed that flag-tagged hGCN5 is efficiently retained on GST-Tat beads, but not on GST. hGCN5 present in the HeLa nuclear extracts could therefore specifically interact with Tat. To show direct interaction between hGCN5 and Tat, GST-Tat pull-down assays were performed with purified recombinant His-tagged hGCN5 protein, followed by Western blotting using an anti-His antibody for detection of bound tagged hGCN5. Tat from two different viral strains, Tat 86 (HXB2 strain) and Tat 101 (SF2), were produced in fusion with GST. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows that recombinant hGCN5 is specifically retained on Tat 86 as well as on Tat 101. We can conclude from these experiments that hGCN5 is capable of interacting directly with both forms of Tat, without any cellular intermediates. To determine the domains of hGCN5 involved in interaction with Tat, we constructed several hGCN5 deletion mutants, corresponding to regions encompassing amino acids 1–110, 111–251 (contains the HAT domain), 252–388, and 389–476 (contains the bromodomain), or combinations of two or three adjacent domains (Fig.2A). 35S-Labeled mutants were generated in vitro and tested for their interaction with Tat in a GST-Tat pull-down assay. The N-terminal 1–110 part of hGCN5 as well as the 252–388 region were unable to interact with Tat (Fig. 2, B (lanes 2and 6) and D). Two regions of hGCN5, encompassing amino acids 111–151 and 389–476 (corresponding to HAT and bromodomain, respectively) efficiently interacted with Tat (Fig. 2,B (lanes 4 and 8) andD). All the hGCN5 fragments used in the experiment presented on Fig. 2 (C and E) contained either the HAT or the bromodomain and consequently interacted with Tat. We conclude from these results that the HAT domain and the bromodomain of hGCN5 are two Tat-interacting modules and that the interaction of Tat with one domain may occur independently of the interaction with the other domain. We then mapped Tat domains necessary for hGCN5 interaction. GST-Tat pull-down assays were carried out with different C-terminal truncated forms of Tat 101 (Fig. 3A) fused to GST, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with purified recombinant hGCN5 as described. Results show that the hGCN5-Tat interaction is maintained for a Tat fragment containing the 48 first residues (Fig. 3 B, M3 mutant,lane 5). However, the interaction is completely abolished for the M4 mutant (amino acids 1–22) (Fig. 3 B,lane 6). These results suggested that the Tat domain responsible for interacting with hGCN5 was localized between amino acids 22 and 48. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we generated a new Tat mutant containing only the amino acids 21–48 region of the protein fused to GST (M5 mutant). Interestingly, hGCN5 interacted with this Tat mutant as efficiently as with the wild type protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8 and9). This experiment suggests that the amino acids 21–48 region of Tat is necessary and sufficient for the interaction of Tat-hGCN5. This region contains the cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat and is located in the minimal activation domain of the protein. Recently, it has been discovered that p300 and P/CAF acetyltransferases modulate Tat transcriptional activity by directly acetylating the protein on specific and distinct lysines (25Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 26Ott M.

We examined if hGCN5 was also capable of acetylating Tat. Purified GST-Tat or GST (as a negative control) was incubated with increasing amounts of purified recombinant hGCN5, in the presence of 14C-labeled acetyl-CoA. Proteins were then electrophoresed on a denaturing gel, and the acetylation of Tat revealed by autoradiography. We observed that the incubation of Tat with increasing amounts of hGCN5 led to the appearance of two major radiolabeled bands corresponding to GST-Tat and hGCN5, respectively (Fig. 4A, right panel). This experiment also showed that, in addition to acetylating Tat, hGCN5 is also capable of undergoing auto-acetylation. In the control experiment, using GST as a substrate, only auto-acetylation of hGCN5 was observed (Fig. 4 A,left panel). We concluded from these experiments that hGCN5 specifically acetylates Tat in vitro. To define which lysines of Tat are the site of acetylation by hGCN5, similar experiments as above were performed using the wild type Tat 101 or Tat deletion mutants as substrate (Fig. 4 B). hGCN5 could efficiently acetylate wild type Tat, and M1 and M2 mutants, but could not acetylate Tat M3 and M4 mutants (Fig. 4 C,lanes 5 and 6). The region of Tat acetylated by hGCN5 is therefore located between amino acids 48 and 60 and corresponds to the basic domain of Tat. This region contains only two lysines at positions 50 and 51 (Fig. 4 B). Point mutations of either Lys-50 or Lys-51 were then generated to determine which lysine was the target of hGCN5. In both cases, mutation of a single lysine reduced the acetylation of Tat (Fig. 4 D, compare lanes 3 and 4 tolane 2). This result suggested that both lysines were acetylated by hGCN5. In order to confirm this hypothesis, Tat containing Lys-50 and Lys-51 mutated to arginines was generated. As controls, we also mutated lysines at position 28 and 29 to arginines. These mutants were tested as substrates for acetylation by hGCN5 (Fig.4 D, lanes 7 and 8). As expected, the replacement by arginines of both Lys-50 and Lys-51, but not that of Lys-28 and Lys-29, reduced the acetylation of Tat by hGCN5 to the background level (Tat acetylation in the absence of hGCN5,lane 5). Thus, both lysines 50 and 51 of the HIV-1 transactivator Tat are targets for hGCN5-mediated acetylation. The acetylation of lysines 50 and 51 of Tat has been shown to correlate with an efficient transactivation of the HIV LTR (25Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 26Ott M. Schnolzer M. Garnica J. Fischle W. Emiliani S. Rackwitz H.R. Verdin E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1489-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of hGCN5 on Tat-dependent LTR activation. HeLa cells were co-transfected with an LTR-luciferase reporter plasmid, and expression vectors for Tat, either wt or Tat mutated on lysines 50 and 51 (lysine to arginine mutation), in the presence or absence of hGCN5 (Fig. 5A). As expected, wild type Tat strongly activated the HIV LTR (about 40-fold in our assay). In contrast, hGCN5 alone only poorly activated the LTR. Interestingly, we found that the co-expression of Tat and hGCN5 considerably enhanced the transactivator potential of Tat. Under the same conditions, Tat Lys-50/Lys-51 mutant, although capable of efficiently stimulating the HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity, was unable to cooperate with hGCN5 to further activate transcription. In order to know if the stimulating effect of hGCN5 on the HIV promoter could be observed on an integrated, chromatin-associated LTR, similar experiments were performed in HL3T1 cells, a HeLa cell-derived line containing an integrated LTR-CAT construct (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of Tat, the integrated LTR exhibited no detectable transcriptional activity (data not shown). In contrast, in cells transfected with 10 ng of the wild type Tat expression vector, the LTR was strongly activated. This Tat-dependent transcriptional activity was further enhanced, although to a lesser extent than that of the non-integrated LTR, by its coexpression with hGCN5 (Fig.5 B), Here again, although Tat Lys-50/Lys-51 mutant efficiently stimulated the HIV-1 LTR transcription, it was not as efficient as the wild type protein in cooperating with hGCN5. These results strongly suggest that acetylation of Tat on Lys-50 and Lys-51 by hGCN5 plays an important role in the control of the activity of the protein. The HIV transactivator Tat interacts with several histone acetyltransferases, such as Tip60 (24Creaven M. Hans F. Mutskov V. Col E. Caron C. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S.

This interaction occurs directly, via residues 21–48 of Tat, a region contained in the minimal transactivating domain of Tat. This finding is in agreement with the fact that the amino acid 30–45 region of Tat was required for recruitment of HAT activity from nuclear cell extracts (21Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H.

Interestingly, the Tat hGCN5-interacting domain appears to differ from domains involved in interaction with other HATs. For instance, the basic domain of Tat has been shown to be required for Tip60 and p300 interaction, whereas the Tat C-terminal domain is necessary for hTAFII250 interaction (20Weissman J.D. Brown J.A. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P.A. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Otherwise, similar to p300/CBP and P/CAF, hGCN5 is capable of stimulating Tat-dependent LTR transcriptional activation and of acetylating Tat on specific lysines. Tat-Tip60 and Tat-TAFII250 interactions do not, however, affect transcription from the LTR but repress transcription of cellular genes such as the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (24Creaven M. Hans F. Mutskov V. Col E. Caron C. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8826-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the major histocompatibility class I genes (20Weissman J.D. Brown J.A. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P.A. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, although the targeting of HATs would be a general mechanism of Tat activity, the HAT-interacting domain of Tat and possibly the functional consequences of these interactions could be different for each HAT. In contrast to P/CAF or p300, only a few reports show a direct recruitment of GCN5 by transcriptional factors in mammals. Long hGCN5 is known to be recruited by c-Myc to activate transcription, but this recruitment was shown to be indirect, and to require the cofactor TRRAP (34McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). A direct interaction has, however, been described between short hGCN5 and the ubiquitous transcription factor, NF-Y. The interaction was mapped to the N-terminal domain of hGCN5 and to the histone-like DNA binding domain of NF-Y (35Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, the recruitment of hGCN5 by Tat, reported here, constitutes a new example of recruitment of hGCN5 by a transcription factor. Acetylation of non-histone substrates by GCN5 has also been, to our knowledge, poorly described. Acetylation of E1A by yGCN5 and c-Myb by hGCN5 has been recently reported, but the effect of GCN5 on these transcription factors was not further characterized (13Zhang Q. Yao H. Vo N. Goodman R.H. Savard J. Rothblum L.I. Cote J. Moss T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14323-14328Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Tomita A. Towatari M. Tsuzuki S. Hayakawa F. Kosugi H. Tamai K. Miyazaki T. Kinoshita T. Saito H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified Tat as a new substrate of GCN5 FAT activity. It is therefore very probable that GCN5 (like p300 and P/CAF), acetylates different transcription factors, and more generally other cellular and viral proteins (not necessarily involved in transcription) to modulate their activity. Since c-Myb and Tat are acetylated in vitro by GCN5 and P/CAF, and since both HATs are closely related, it can be speculated that hGCN5 and P/CAF have redundant FAT functions. However, our data show divergences between P/CAF and hGCN5 activity on Tat. First, unlike hGCN5, P/CAF does not stimulate Tat transcriptional activity by itself; instead, it enhances the stimulating effect of p300. Indeed, it has been suggested that Tat, p300/CBP, and P/CAF associate in a ternary complex, and that in this complex, p300-P/CAF interaction is required for a stimulating effect of p300 on Tat activity (21Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24898-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In our experiments we used the short form of hGCN5, which is unable to interact with p300/CBP (37Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Therefore, the short hGCN5 would then act on Tat by a different and more direct mechanism, which does not require the simultaneous recruitment of p300. Finally, functional differences between hGCN5 and P/CAF are confirmed by the fact that they target different lysines within Tat; P/CAF acetylates Tat on lysine 28 (25), whereas hGCN5 targets lysine 50 and 51. This observation suggests that, despite strong homology and preferential acetylation of the same lysine (Lys-14) within the same histone (H3) (28Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), these HATs could in certain cases recognize different lysines in the same substrate. Our data show that, although divergent in sequence and belonging to different families, hGCN5 and p300/CBP acetylate Tat on the same lysines. The use of different cellular HATs by Tat to acetylate the same site highlights the importance of this post-translational modification for the activity of Tat. In support of this hypothesis, the acetylation of lysine 50 has been correlated to a lower affinity of Tat for the TAR sequence (25Kiernan R.E. Vanhulle C. Schiltz L. Adam E. Xiao H. Maudoux F. Calomme C. Burny A. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. Benkirane M. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6106-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, the acetylation of Tat would increase the rate of its dissociation from TAR element. The consequence of this acetylation would be a faster recycling of each molecule of Tat, and an increased transcription of the HIV LTR. Data presented here show that hGCN5 is also involved in the acetylation-dependent control of Tat activity. However, the role of hGCN5 and other HATs capable of acetylating Tat in activating the LTR transcription in the context of HIV-infected cells remains to be determined. Interestingly, the hGCN5-interacting domain of Tat (amino acids 21–48) is different from the acetylated region. Moreover, the recruitment of hGCN5 can occur independently of Tat acetylation, as showed by the M3 Tat mutant, which, although not acetylated by hGCN5 (Fig.4 C), interacted with this HAT (Fig. 3 B). Thus, besides the control of Tat acetylation state, the hGCN5-Tat interaction may also target hGCN5 to the HIV-1 LTR to acetylate histones and then displace nucleosomes at the initiation or during the elongation steps of the transcription. Therefore, one may separate the role of Tat-hGCN5 interaction on HIV-1 LTR chromatin remodeling from its role on Tat acetylation. Our data show also that the bromodomain of hGCN5 is capable of efficiently interacting with Tat. Bromodomains are conserved sequence motifs probably involved in protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Refs. 39Jeanmougin F. Wurtz J.M. Le Douarin B. Chambon P. Losson R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar and 40Winston F. Allis C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This domain is found in transcription-related proteins and especially in the Tat-interacting HATs p300/CBP, P/CAF, and TAFII250 (besides hGCN5). Recently, it has been shown that bromodomains of P/CAF, TAFII250, and GCN5 directly and specifically interact with acetylated histones (41Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 42Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6141-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the case of hGCN5, the bromodomain is necessary for nucleosome remodeling by the Swi/Snf complex (44Syntichaki P. Topalidou I. Thireos G. Nature. 2000; 404: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By contacting the bromodomain of hGCN5, Tat could modify the action of hGCN5 on chromatin. It would therefore be interesting to know if such an interaction could perturb either recruitment of hGCN5 on acetylated histones or the activity of the Swi/Snf complex. Tat-hGCN5 interaction would then have consequences on the transcription of cellular genes. Furthermore, although the involvement of p300, P/CAF, and hTAFII250 bromodomains in the direct interaction with Tat has not been demonstrated, the Tat-bromodomain interaction could be a general mechanism of modulation of chromatin targeting by bromodomain-containing proteins.

Several observations suggest that p120 can both positively and negatively regulate cadherin adhesiveness depending on signals that so far remain unidentified. Although p120 tyrosine phosphorylation is a leading candidate, the role of this modification in normal and Src-transformed cells remains unknown. Here, as a first step toward pinpointing this role, we have employed two-dimensional tryptic mapping to directly identify the major sites of Src-induced p120 phosphorylation. Eight sites were identified by direct mutation of candidate tyrosines to phenylalanine and elimination of the accompanying spots on the two-dimensional maps. Identical sites were observed in vitro and in vivo, strongly suggesting that the physiologically important sites have been correctly identified. Changing all of these sites to phenylalanine resulted in a p120 mutant, p120–8F, that could not be efficiently phosphorylated by Src and failed to interact with SHP-1, a tyrosine phosphatase shown previously to interact selectively with tyrosine-phosphorylated p120 in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor.

Armadillo glutathione-S-transferase monoclonal antibody Cadherins constitute a major superfamily of transmembrane cell-cell adhesion receptors present in most adherent cell types. The extracellular domains mediate adhesion between adjacent cells through calcium-dependent homophilic interactions. The cytoplasmic domains interact with a group of proteins called catenins (e.g. p120ctn, α-catenin, and β-catenin), which regulate cadherin interactions with the actin cytoskeleton. β-Catenin (or γ-catenin/plakoglobin) (1McCrea P.

In general, cadherin-mediated adhesion is compromised in cells expressing activated tyrosine kinases, but the extent to which direct phosphorylation of the catenins contributes to defects in cadherin function is unclear. Studies of endogenous Src family proteins suggest both positive and negative roles in adhesion. In one study, cell adhesion defects were observed in keratinocytes and epidermal cells from Fyn-deficient mice or from mice with double knockouts of Src and Fyn, suggesting that the activities of Src kinases are necessary for normal cell-cell adhesion (28Calautti E. Cabodi S. Stein P.L. Hatzfeld M. Kedersha N. Paolo Dotto G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1449-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, another study showed that inhibition of the catalytic activity of the Src kinases promotes the stability of cadherin-dependent cell-cell contacts (29Owens D.W. McLean G.W. Wyke A.W. Paraskeva C. Parkinson E.K. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that Src kinase activity is normally required for junction disassembly. The latter result is consistent with data from oncogene-transformed or mitogen-stimulated cells, where increased tyrosine kinase activity is associated with weak junctions (for review see Ref. 30Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation for these apparently contradictory findings is that controlled tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for both assembly and disassembly of adherens junctions, depending on regulatory influences that are poorly understood. It has been suggested that constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 and β-catenin contributes to defects in cadherin-mediated adhesion in Src-transformed cells (for review see Ref. 30Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although evidence suggests that these defects are independent of β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation (31Takeda H. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), a role for p120 tyrosine phosphorylation has not been excluded. Indeed, mutation of p120 tyrosine residue 217 can partially reverse the Src-induced defects in cadherin function (32Ozawa M. Ohkubo T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 503-512PubMed Google Scholar) in L-cells. An unresolved problem, especially in Src-transformed cells, is how to separate the effects of p120 tyrosine phosphorylation from the simultaneous effects induced by tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates. For example, most prominent Src substrates (e.g.tensin, focal adhesion kinase, Crk-associated substrate, actin filament-associated protein, cortactin, ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins, p120, β-catenin, etc.) are proteins that affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (33Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that constitutive phosphorylation of these proteins affects cadherin function indirectly by negatively affecting the underlying actin framework that anchors the cadherin complex. Therefore, although a vast literature correlates cadherin malfunction to unscheduled tyrosine phosphorylation of the catenins, direct mechanistic evidence of a role for p120 phosphorylation is lacking. To directly address the role of p120 tyrosine phosphorylation in cadherin function, we aim to generate dominant negative p120 Tyr → Phe mutant proteins that are selectively unable to be phosphorylated at key tyrosine residues. Here, as a first step toward this goal, we have employed two-dimensional tryptic mapping methods to identify all major sites of Src-induced p120 tyrosine phosphorylation. A method was developed to tyrosine phosphorylate p120 to high stoichiometry using a modification of the in vitro Src kinase assay. Deletion mapping revealed that virtually all p120 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in a region amino-terminal to the first Arm repeat. Thus, we have named this region the p120 phosphorylation domain and suggest that it is involved in the regulation of p120 function. To confirm the identity of each site, individual candidate tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine and assayed for elimination of the accompanying spot on the two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide map. Importantly, p120 tryptic maps from in vitro labeling experiments were nearly identical to p120 maps generated by [32P]orthophosphate labeling in vivo, indicating that we have indeed mapped the sites that are likely to be relevant in vivo. Eight sites were identified, and changing these sites to phenylalanine resulted in a p120 mutant (p120–8F) that could not be phosphorylated efficiently by Src and failed to interact with SHP-1, a phosphatase known to bind p120 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Using mutants with individually altered tyrosine phosphorylation sites, it may now be possible to distinguish the specific effects of p120 phosphorylation from effects driven by phosphorylation of other substrates induced by Src and receptor tyrosine kinases. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containingl-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cos-7 (African green monkey kidney) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and from Dr. Steven Hanks (Vanderbilt University); HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Transient transfections were performed with SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's directions, except that DNA-SuperFect complexes were allowed to form for 15 min prior to the addition to cells. In co-transfection experiments, equal microgram amounts of each plasmid were transfected (5 µg of total plasmid/60-mm dish). Transfections were carried out with 5 µl of SuperFect/1 µg of DNA for Cos-7 cells and 6 µl of SuperFect/1 µg of DNA for 293 cells. Experiments on transfected cells were performed 1 day post-transfection. Transfected constructs include RcRSV/mp120–1A (wild type and Tyr → Phe point mutants), RcRSV/mp120–1N Δ1–157, RcCMV/mp120–1N Δ29–233, RcCMV/mp120–1N Δ233–387, RcRSV/Src527F, and pcDNA3.1/c-Src (K430R). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting procedures have been described in detail previously (13Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed one time in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA) for 5 min at 0 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:1 slurry of beads and phosphate-buffered saline) coupled to a rabbit anti-mouse bridge antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, Inc.) were then added to lysates and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. Denatured proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7% gels. The proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for phosphopeptide mapping procedures or to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Western blotting was performed with p120 mAb pp120 (Transduction Laboratories), diluted to 0.1 µg/ml in 3% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and with phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (Transduction Laboratories) diluted to 1 µg/ml in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline. The blots were developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the exception of the use of alkaline phosphatase color reaction for Fig. 1C (lower panel). The cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline before being starved for 15 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 4% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (4 ml/100-mm dish, 1.5 ml/60-mm dish). 32P-Labeled H3PO4 (0.5 mCi/µl in H2O, carrier-free; ICN Biomedicals Inc.) was then added directly to cells (1 mCi/100-mm dish, 350 µCi/60-mm dish). The cells were then incubated for 4 h before treatment with pervanadate (described below), followed by lysis. The cells were lysed with RIPA containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (pervanadate (0.3 mmNa3VO4, 0.6 mmH2O2) and 50 mm NaF). The immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. Transfected murine p120 was specifically immunoprecipitated with 3 µg of mAb 8D11, which does not react with human or monkey p120 epitopes. The cells were incubated with pervanadate (0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm H2O2) for 6 min before being washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing pervanadate (0.3 mm Na3VO4, 0.6 mmH2O2). Pervanadate was prepared fresh before each experiment by incubating appropriate concentrations of Na3VO4 and H2O2 for 20 min at room temperature before storing on ice until ready to use. Cos-7 cells were co-transfected in 60-mm dishes with an equal number of µg of RcRSV/Src527F (chicken) and RcRSV/p120–1A (murine) plasmid DNA. Kinase-dead c-Src(K430R) in pcDNA3.1 vector was obtained from Dr. Sarah Parsons (University of Virginia). Lysis and immunoprecipitation procedures were performed as described above, except that 3 µg each of p120 mAb 8D11 and Src mAb 327 were added to each lysate to precipitate immune complexes of Src and p120, and only 10 µl of protein A-Sepharose slurry coupled to rabbit anti-mouse bridge antibody was added to each immunoprecipitation reaction to allow saturation of the beads with immune complexes. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in ice cold RIPA, followed by two times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmNa3VO4. Src-p120 immune complexes were then incubated in 20 µl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2) containing either 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals Inc.) or 20 µm unlabeled ATP (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature with constant agitation. Reactions were terminated by washing twice with RIPA containing 5 mm EDTA followed by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min. Phosphoproteins labeled in vivo or in vitro were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were rinsed well with deionized H2O twice before visualization of phosphoproteins by autoradiography. The phosphoproteins were then excised, and the membrane pieces were re-wet with methanol followed by water. The membranes were blocked with 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times with 50 mm NH4HCO3 before enzymatic cleavage of phosphoproteins from the polyvinylidene difluoride withl-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine pancreas trypsin (Worthington). The peptides were then subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping according to the procedures described in detail by Boyle et al. (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) and VanDerGeeret al. (35VanDerGeer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Performic acid oxidation was not routinely performed. Partial hydrolysis fingerprints were generated by incubation of phosphopeptides for 30 min in 6 n HCl. p120 deletion mutants have been described previously (13Daniel J.M. Reynolds A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated by QuickChange Mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions except that Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all amplification reactions, for high fidelity. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. GST-SHP-1 constructs and methods for generating the GST fusion proteins were described previously (36Keilhack H. Tenev T. Nyakatura E.

Briefly, overnight cultures of BL21(DE3) Escherichia colitransformed with pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pGEX 5X-SH2 SHP-1 plasmids were diluted 10–20-fold into a fresh 200-ml culture of Luria broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C until A 600 = ∼0.7. Protein expression was then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at ambient temperature (25–29 °C) for 14 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in detergent buffer (10 mmNaH2PO4 pH 7.4/150 mm NaCl/0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. Bacterial suspensions were sonicated on ice, and lysate was clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. GST proteins were immobilized by incubating the clarified lysate with 250 µl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The beads were washed twice with detergent buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended to a final volume of 500 µl to generate a 50:50 bead slurry for pull-down experiments. GST proteins were gel-quantified relative to known protein loading standards. Cos-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with Src527F and murine p120, andin vitro kinase assays were performed with the immunoprecipitated protein, as described above. Kinase assays were done in the presence of 20 µm ATP (Sigma) rather than with [γ-32P]ATP. Following kinase assays, beads were washed twice with RIPA and then boiled for 5 min in denaturation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). After samples cooled to ambient temperature, an aliquot of sample was reserved for Tyr(P) and p120 Western blotting to determine the relative amount of p120 present in each pull-down reaction. Then 600 µl of 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4 was added to each sample to dilute the SDS to less than 0.05%. The beads were discarded from samples, and the proteins were allowed to partially renature in this solution for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with GST or SHP-1 SH2 domain GST fusion protein were added, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1.5 h with end-over-end rotation. Then beads were washed three times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100 and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min. To determine the extent of total p120 phosphorylation under steady state conditions in vivo, murine p120 was transiently overexpressed and orthophosphate-labeled in rapidly growing 293 cells. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of p120 resolved two peptides that were robustly phosphorylated, as well as a complex array of minor phosphopeptides (Fig.1 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the total protein revealed that a majority of the phosphorylation was on serine, with a relatively small amount of phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the two major peptides (Fig. 1 A, peptides Cand H) indicated that the phosphate was on serine (data not shown). Because p120 was initially discovered as a major in vivo substrate for Src tyrosine kinase, we overexpressed p120 together with Src527F, a constitutively active Src mutant. Overexpression of Src527F lead to a sharp increase in the phosphotyrosine content of p120, as determined by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 1 B, compare − and +Src panels), producing a unique array of p120 phosphopeptides (Fig.1 A, panel ii). Because of the high stoichiometry of tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphoserine-containing peptides were no longer detectable at optimal exposure times for phosphotyrosine detection. Five-minute pervanadate treatment prior to cell lysis was required for optimal detection of these phosphorylation events, suggesting that the sites are rapidly dephosphorylated under normal circumstances. To determine whether Src could phosphorylate p120 directly, we devised a modified in vitro kinase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) based on coimmunoprecipitation of p120 and Src527F, followed by incubation of the purified complexes with [γ-32P]ATP and manganese, the relevant co-factor. Phospholabeling p120 by this method induced significantly higher stoichiometry of phosphorylation than could be obtained by in vivo labeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate while reducing working levels of radioactivity. p120 was heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of Src527F (Fig. 1 C,lane 3), but not in its absence (Fig. 1 C,lane 2), or in the presence of kinase-dead c-Src (K430R) (Fig. 1 C, lane 4), indicating that the coprecipitated Src was directly responsible for the phosphorylation of p120. In addition, phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that thein vitro phosphorylation event occurred on tyrosine only (data not shown). In vitro phosphorylation of p120 produced a peptide pattern that was nearly identical to that produced upon Src overexpression in vivo (Fig. 1 A, comparepanels ii and iii), generating phosphopeptides with similar electrophoretic and chromatographic mobility as well as similar stoichiometry of phosphorylation among peptides. The tryptic maps of in vitro phosphorylated p120 were highly reproducible, although occasional differences in the relative intensity between peptides 4 and 5 and among peptides 1–3 were detected. Mixing experiments confirmed that the in vitro and in vivo labeled peptide co-migrated on the tryptic peptide maps (Fig.1 A, panel iv). Together, these data suggest that Src phosphorylates p120 directly and that the in vivo andin vitro phosphorylation sites are similar, if not identical. Initially, a panel of p120 deletion mutants was assayed to identify regions of p120 that could be phosphorylated by Src. Only deletions in the amino terminus of p120 affected the phosphorylation pattern on tryptic maps (Fig.2), in agreement with previous data indicating that most of the major phosphorylation sites were contained in an 18-kDa amino-terminal fragment generated by cleavage with the protease Endolysine C. 2A. B. Reynolds, unpublished observations.Deletion of the first 157 amino acids eliminated the major phosphopeptides 6, 9, and 10 (Fig. 2). Deletion of amino acids 29–233 eliminated one additional peptide, peptide 7, suggesting that three of the major phosphopeptides originated from amino acids 29–157, whereas another peptide lay between amino acids 158 and 233. Finally, deletion of amino acids 233–387 eliminated the remaining major phosphopeptides, 1–5 and 8, suggesting the location of the remaining sites. In addition, the latter deletion eliminated peptide 7, and a new peptide designated peptide A was observed. These experiments place all of the major sites within the amino-terminal 387 residues. Partial tryptic digestion frequently results in overlapping peptides containing the same phosphorylated residue. To determine which of the phosphopeptides shared amino acid sequence similarity, individual peptides were isolated and treated with hydrochloric acid to detect similarities in the pattern of partial hydrolysis products that are characteristic of each peptide (Fig. 3). These “peptide fingerprints” showed a relationship between peptides 1–3 (Fig. 3 A), peptides 4 and 5 (Fig. 3 B), peptides 9 and 10 (Fig. 3 C), and peptides 7 and A (not shown). Furthermore, each of these sets of peptides behaved similarly when oxidized with performic acid (not shown). Based on deletion mapping, peptide fingerprinting, and performic acid oxidation data (not shown), the search was narrowed to specific candidate residues. To definitively identify each site, suspected tyrosines were individually mutated to phenylalanine and re-evaluated by in vitro kinase assay and two-dimensional tryptic mapping (Fig. 4). Mutation of tyrosines 112, 228, and 280 to phenylalanine resulted in elimination of phosphopeptide spots 6, 7, and 8, respectively. Mutation of tyrosine 96 eliminated spots 9 and 10, whereas mutation of tyrosine 257 eliminated spots 4 and 5. The latter results confirm the partial hydrolysis fingerprinting data, which suggested that each of these pairs of spots arose from partial tryptic digestion of the same sequence. Identification of Tyr228 in peptide 7 is in accordance with the deletion analysis, which indicated that peptide 7 resided between amino acids 158 and 233. The unique peptide A present in p120Δ233–387 apparently results from the new fusion peptide formed by the deletion. In addition, each p120 point mutant was transiently co-transfected with Src527F into 293 cells and labeled in vivo by the addition of [32P]orthophosphate to the cell culture medium. Note that the transfected p120 mutants were generated from murine p120 and can therefore be selectively immunoprecipitated from human 293 cells using p120 mAb 8D11, which recognizes murine but not human p120. Two-dimensional tryptic maps generated by directly immunoprecipitating the transfected p120 from these cells demonstrated that the major peptides that were lost corresponded exactly to those identifiedin vitro (Fig. 4, compare in vitro and in vivo columns). These maps of in vivo labeled p120 also revealed occasional unique phosphopeptides that were not readily reproducible. T"

In addition, Etk contains Src homology-3 (SH3) and -2 (SH2) domains, and a catalytic kinase domain (4Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The PH domain protein module is commonly found in signal transduction proteins and is believed to help mediate lipid-protein or protein-protein interactions (5Haslam R.J. Kolde H.B. Nature. 1993; 363: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The PH domains of Etk and Btk (a related Tec family member) have been shown to interact with heterotrimeric G protein and protein kinase C (6Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Hamazaki Y. Kojima H. Mano H. Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Abe T. Nagasawa T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and these interactions are believed to regulate kinase activity. Recent studies suggest that activation of PI3-kinase stimulate Etk, probably because of the direct interaction between the lipid product resulting from PI3-kinase reaction and the PH domain of Etk (8Li Z.

Although most of the Tec family kinases such as Btk, Itk, and Tec are of hematopoietic origin, Etk is found to be expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, including lung and prostate tissues and salivary epithelial and endothelial cells (3Tamagnone L.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because Etk is a cytoplasmic kinase with several motifs characteristic of signaling molecules, it has been implicated in signal transduction networks. For example, Etk/Bmx was shown to mediate activation of Rho and serum response factor in response to the heterotrimeric G proteins Gα-12 and -13 that can be activated by hormones and neurotransmitters (6Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, Etk was shown to be a substrate of Src kinases and to be responsible for Src activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) and for cellular transformation (12Tsai Y.-T. Su Y.-H. Fang S.-S. Huang T.-N. Qiu Y. Jou Y.-S. Shih H.-M. Kung H.-J. Chen R.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Experiments using a kinase inactive mutant Etk-KQ showed that Etk kinase activity was required for interleukin 6-induced neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells (4Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of PI3-kinase blocked interleukin 6-induced stimulation of Etk in this system, suggesting that Etk is an effector of PI3-kinase (4Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition to Etk, the p21-activated kinases (Paks) represent another well characterized family of effectors of PI3-kinase. Pak1 is a direct target of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, and binding of GTPases to Pak1 stimulates its kinase activity via autophosphorylation (13Manser E. Leung T. Salhuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar).

Despite the recent reports of the involvement of Etk in signaling cascades in human cancer cells and the fact both Etk and Pak1 are downstream of PI3-kinase, the relationship between Etk and Pak1 kinase and the role of the Etk pathway in the biology of human mammary epithelial cancer cells remain unknown. We sought to determine the role of Etk pathway in breast cancer cells. We present new evidence that Etk is an upstream effector of Pak1 tyrosine phosphorylation and that it is directly associates with Pak1. Furthermore, we found that Etk activity is discovered to be required for the proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity of mammary epithelial cancer cells.

Clonal stable cell lines overexpressing Wt-Etk or Etk-KQ or control pcDNA were selected in the presence of G418 resistance (500 µg/ml). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmNaF, 1 mm NaVO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The T7-tagged Etk or Myc-tagged Pak1 were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with mAbs directly against T7 or Myc, respectively, as described (23Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L.

When indicated, the immuncomplex was washed with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reaction was carried out in buffer supplemented with 7.5 µg of enolase (Sigma) for the Etk kinase assay and with myelin basic protein (MBP) for the Pak kinase assay.

Elutes were resolved onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized using a phosphorimager. MCF-7 and MDA-MB435 cells (2 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well plate) and counted daily for six days. Anchorage-independent colony assays were performed as described previously (21Vadlamudi R.

Briefly 1 ml of solution of 0.6% DIFCO Agar in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum was layered onto 60 × 15 mm tissue culture plates. MCF-7 or MDA-MB 435 cells (10,000 cells) were mixed with 1 ml of 0.36% Bactoagar solution in DMEM prepared in a similar manner and layered on top of the 0.6% Bactoagar layer.

In dominant negative Pak1 experiment, MCF-7 cells or Wt-ETK cells were transfected with 10 µg of GFP or GFP-K299R Pak1 or GFP-Pak1 inhibitor and tested for anchorage-independent growth. Exponentially growing cells (3 × 106) were injected into mammary fat pad (two sites/animal) of female athymic mice (Nu/Nu, 4 weeks old). Every fourth day, tumor volumes were measured with calipers along two major axes. Tumor volume was calculated as follows V = (4/3)πR12 R2, where R1 is radius 1 and R2 is radius 2 and R1 < R2 (n = 10 per group) (24Mandal M. Vadlamudi R. Nguyen D. Wang RA Costa L. Bagheri-Yarmand R.

Tunnel method was used to detect DNA fragmentation as previously described by Gabriel et al.(25Gravrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J.

Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections pretreated with protease were nicked and labeled with biotinylated poly(dU), introduced by terminal deoxy-transferase, and then stained using avidin-conjugated peroxidase. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from different stages of mice tissue using the Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 500 ng of RNA analyzed by RT-PCR. The forward primer for mEtk was 5′-CACACCACCTCAAAGATTTCATGG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CATACTGCCCCTTCCACTTGC-3′. RT-PCR products were run onto 1% agarose gel, transferred to a blot, and probed with a 520-bp cDNA of mEtk. For in situ hybridization, mouse mammary glands or 12-day-old embryos were dissected out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissues were processed into 10 µm of frozen sections, and in situ hybridization was performed as described (24Mandal M. Vadlamudi R. Nguyen D. Wang RA Costa L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9699-9704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To make the probe, the Etk cDNA fragment was cloned to TOPO II vector, and RNA probe was labeled with digoxigenin and was synthesized by in vitro transcription. Sense-probe hybridization was used as background control. To explore the role of Etk during cell proliferation and differentiation, we first explored the expression profile of Etk during mouse embryonic development using in situhybridization. As shown in Fig. 1, Etk mRNA was expressed in most tissues, with highest levels in the nervous and epithelial tissues, i.e. encephalon, dorsal root ganglia, pancreas, lung, and the intestinal mucosa. Etk mRNA signals in the vertebral column and hearts were significantly lower.In situ hybridization analysis of mouse mammary gland demonstrated that Etk mRNA signal was much stronger in the lactating alveoli than in the pregnant mammary gland (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Etk expression during the mammary gland development. A, in situ hybridization, a strong Etk signal was observed in the epithelial cells during lactation (L, day 4) but not pregnancy (P, day 15) stage.L/S, sense probe hybridization in the lactation mammary gland. B, RNA (1 µg) at various stages of mammary gland development (V, virgin weeks; L, lactation days) was analyzed for the expression of Etk and GAPDH control by RT-PCR followed by Southern hybridization.

RNA (1 µg) from the indicated cell lines was analyzed for Etk expression by RT-PCR followed by Southern hybridization. The results are representative of two similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Etk/Bmx is usually the only Tec family kinase expressed in epithelial cells, but the expression level is generally low. Despite the low level, accumulating evidence suggests that it play an important role in the growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of epithelial cell (26Qiu Y. Kung H.-J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To understand the potential function of Etk in mammary gland, we investigated Etk expression during various stages of the mammary gland development by RT-PCR followed by Southern hybridization with a fragment of human Etk cDNA. Results indicated that Etk expression appears to undergo a cyclic change as the expression levels of Etk were down-regulated during pregnancy, early lactation, and again during the late stages of lactation (Fig. 2, B and C). Etk expression was lowest during pregnancy, a stage of high proliferation for mammary glands (Fig. 2, B and C), and highest in non-proliferative weaning and virgin mammary glands, suggesting that Etk may have an important role in the biology of mammary epithelial cells. Because the potential role of Etk in mammary epithelial cancer cells is not known, we next examined the expression of Etk in a panel of breast cancer cell lines by Southern hybridization. Among the breast cancer cell lines used, highly tumorigenic and metastatic MDA-MB435 cells exhibited the highest Etk content, whereas the Etk content of MCF-7 and SKBR-3 was lower (Fig. 2 D). Because MCF-7 and SKBR-3 cells do not form tumors and metastasis in vivo, it appears that Etk expression may correlate with the degree of transformation of breast cancer cell lines used here. To assess the physiological significance of Etk expression in breast cancer cells, we sought to determine whether Etk kinase activity can be stimulated by physiologically relevant molecules in mammary gland, as heregulin-β 1 (HRG), a polypeptide growth factor with a role in the development and tumorigenesis of mammary epithelial cells (18Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that HRG activated the autophosphorylation of Etk in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 3 A). Because of the low level of expression and relatively low avidity of the antibodies currently available, it has been difficult to visualize endogenous Etk in cell biology study. Therefore, we resorted to express T7-tagged Etk for this type of analysis. Because both Etk and Pak1 are downstream of PI3-kinase, we sought to determine whether Etk could activate Pak1. Co-transfection of MCF-7 cells with T7-tagged Etk and Myc-tagged Pak1 constructs significantly increased Pak1 kinase activity as determined by an immune-complex kinase assay using MBP as a substrate (Fig.3 B, upper panel). Because Etk is a tyrosine kinase, we hypothesized that Etk phosphorylates Pak1 on tyrosine residues. Indeed, we discovered that co-transfection of Etk and Pak1 was accompanied by a substantial stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak1 (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). To verify that Pak1 is downstream of Etk, we next demonstrated that coexpression of a kinase-defective K299R Pak1 mutant protein (designated dominant-negative (DN)-Pak1) suppressed the ability of Etk to activate Pak1 kinase activity (Fig. 3 C). In the targeted Pak1 K299R sequence, the lysine 299 ATP binding site was replaced by arginine, rendering Pak1 catalytically defective as shown by us and others in cell lines (16Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bakoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 18Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Mandal M. Chernoff J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To rule out that the observed inhibitory effect of Pak1 K299R mutant was not due to ineffective transduction of Cdc42/Rac signals, we next generated stable MCF-7 clones expressing the central inhibitory fragment of Pak1 aa 83–149 (Fig. 3 D,upper panel), which does not interfere with cdc42/Rac1 binding. These stable cell lines expressing control vector or the central Pak inhibitor were transfected with T7-tagged Etk, and the effect Etk on Pak1 kinase activity was measured by subjecting the immunoprecipitated T7-Etk to in vitro kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. The Etk was able to activate Pak1 activity in vector-transfected cells but not in the cells that express Pak inhibitor aa 83–149 (Fig. 3 D). Together, these results confirm that Etk regulates Pak kinase activity. While at present, we do not know whether tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak1 induced by Etk contributes to its elevated activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that Pak1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and serves as a downstream substrate of Tec family of kinase. While interesting and reproducible, at present we do not know the significance of the tyrosine phosphorylation, and experiments are planned to explore the significance of this finding. To determine whether the observed activation of Pak1 by Etk is due to interactions between the two proteins, we examined the association between T7-tagged Etk and Myc-tagged Pak1 in vivo by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays. Results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 3E. Transient expression of T7-tagged Etk, but not of control T7 vector, in MCF-7 cells was accompanied by the association of T7-tagged Etk with Myc-tagged Pak1 in both immunoprecipitation experiments. These results suggest that Etk associates with Pak1 and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Pak1 (Fig. 3 E). To determine whether the observed association between Etk and Pak1 was direct or mediated via other proteins, we examined the ability ofin vitro translated Wt-Etk or Etk-KQ protein to bind GST-Pak1 in GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 3 F, Etk and its N-terminal domain (aa 1–240) strongly interact with GST-Pak1; very little interaction was seen between Etk C-terminal domain (aa 243–674) and GST-Pak1, and GST alone provided a proper negative control. To further delineate the contribution of Etk in the biology of breast cancer cells, we established stable MCF-7 clones expressing T7-tagged Wt-Elk or kinase-inactive Etk-KQ or control vector. The results shown in Fig.4 A demonstrate the expression of tagged Etk in several representative clones. The functionality of Etk was assessed by performing in vitro kinase assays using enolase as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 4 B). To determine how Etk affects the Pak1 pathway, MCF-7/Etk cells were transfected with Myc-Pak1. Overexpression of Etk in MCF-7 cells was associated with significant increases in the phosphorylation of Pak1 on tyrosine (Fig.4 C). MCF-7 cells expressing Wt-Etk were transfected with or without Myc-tagged Pak1, and tagged Pak1 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-Myc mAb and subjected to in vitro kinase assay. Theupper and lower bands in Fig. 4 Drepresent the autophosphorylated T7-Etk (73 kDa) and Myc-Pak1 (64 kDa), respectively. These protein bands were identified due to their differential electrophoretic mobilities in the gel. To examine the influence of Etk expression on the growth characteristics of breast epithelial cancer cells, we measured the proliferation rate and the ability of cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Compared with vector-transfected control cells, cells in which Wt-Etk was overexpressed demonstrated greater ability to form larger colonies in soft agar, and expression of Etk-KQ mutant led to a reduction in the anchorage-independent growth (Fig.5,A and B). In addition, as shown in Fig. 5 C, the growth rate of cells expressing Wt-Etk and Etk-KQ was affected 35–40% more than that of the control vector-transfected clone. Because Pak1 has been shown to promote the anchorage-independent growth (21Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Wang R.A. Mandal M. Nuguyen D. Sahin A. Chernoff J. Hung M.-C. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36238-36244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 22Howe A.K. Juliano J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we next determined whether dominant-negative Pak1 could modulate the ability of Wt-Etk cells to form colonies in soft agar. Wt-Etk cells were transfected with GFP-dominant-negative Pak1 and GFP-Pak1 inhibitor and used for soft agar assay. As shown in Fig. 6,A and B, Wt-Etk cells transfected with dominant-negative Pak1 or Pak1 inhibitor form small colonies compared with Wt-Etk control cells. Together, these findings suggested that Pak1 is a downstream effector of Etk pathway and may contribute to the observed phenotypic changes by Etk.Figure 6Dominant-negative inhibition of Pak1 reduces soft agar cloning efficiency of Wt-Etk cells.

Representation results from two independent experiments are shown here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next sought to determine whether Etk activity is required for the maintenance of the transformed phenotypes in breast cancer cell lines. Highly tumorigenic and invasive MDA-MB435 cells were stably transfected with T7-tagged kinase-inactive Etk mutant (Etk-KQ) or with control pcDNA vector (Fig.7 A, upper panel). As expected from the results shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of Etk-KQ led to a significant reduction in Etk and Pak1 kinase activities (Fig.7 B). The expression of Etk-KQ was accompanied by a significant inhibition of the growth rate of MDA-MB435 cell (Fig.7 C). In addition, overexpression of kinase-inactive Etk-KQ reduced the ability of cells to grow in soft agar as compared with vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 7, D andE). To investigate the significance of Etk expression in vivo, we next examined the ability of MDA-MB435 clones expressing kinase-inactive Etk-KQ or vector control in a xenograft model. In these experiments, cells were implanted into the mammary fat pad of athymic mice. Inactivation of Etk in MDA-MB435 cells severely affected the ability of cells to form tumors (i.e. by 55–70% compared with vector-transfected cells) (Fig.8 A). Histological examinations of tumors with hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed the presence of necrotic areas in tumors from Etk-KQ clones (data not shown). Reevaluation of these tumors with TUNEL staining confirmed that apoptosis was widespread in Etk-KQ tumors (Fig. 8 B). Together, these findings suggest that Etk expression may be required for the maintenance of transformed phenotypes in breast cancer cells. Etk is a member of the Tec family of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that are characterized by N-terminal PH domains. The PH domain is important in protein-protein interactions and is involved often in cytoplasmic signaling cascades. Etk is one of the few Tec family members, which are expressed in epithelial cells (10Xue L.Y. Qiu Y. He J. Kung H.-J. Oleinick N.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3391-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we sought to determine the role of Etk in regulating breast cancer growth regulation. We report that: 1) Etk expression is developmentally regulated during mammary gland development; 2) Etk is expressed in the highly tumorigenic MDA-MB435 cell lines; 3) Etk is tyrosine-phosphorylated and is activated by physiologically relevant growth factor in breast cancer cells; 4) Etk phosphorylates Pak1 on tyrosine residues, and kinase-inactive Pak1 mutant blocked Etk activation of Pak1; 5) Etk directly interacts with Pak1 via the N-terminal PH domain-containing region; 6) overexpression of Wt-Etk in noninvasive breast cancer line enhanced the ability of the cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner; and 7) expression of kinase-inactive Etk inhibits tumorigenic phenotypes in a highly tumorigenic breast cancer cell line. Taken together, these observations suggest that Etk play an important role in the regulation of mammary epithelial cancer cells. The finding that Pak1 kinase activity is stimulated following Etk kinase activation is important, as it implies that Etk kinase constitutes an initial signal for Pak1 activation. This hypothesis is supported by several additional observations: 1) inhibition of Etk kinase by a kinase-defective mutant was accompanied by concurrent inhibition of Pak1 activity; 2) expression of dominant-negative Pak1 mutant blocked the ability of Etk to activate the Pak1 kinase and did not affect the Etk kinase; 3) Etk directly interacted with Pak1 via its N-terminal PH domain; and 4) Etk-mediated stimulation of anchorage-independent growth was blocked by dominant-negative Pak1. These results suggest that Pak1 may be downstream of Etk kinase in breast cancer cells. These findings are inconsistent with those in a recent report (6Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that showed activation of Rho rather than of Cdc42 or Rac1 (upstream regulators of Pak1) by Tec family members in mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells. To reconcile these findings, we suggest that the Tec family may utilize distinct members of the small GTPase family members in epithelial cancer and fibroblast cells in humans and/or mice. Another notable finding in this study was that Etk induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pak1 and that Etk activity is required for the proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. This finding strongly suggests that Etk utilize Pak1 tyrosine phosphorylation to influence transformed phenotypes that are generally believed to be driven by tyrosine phosphorylation. This hypothesis is further supported by recent findings by us and by others that overexpression of kinase-active Pak1 mutant (T423E, predominantly serine phosphorylation) in breast cancer cells selectively enhanced the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells (21Vadlamudi R.

Juliano J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not know the precise mechanism by which Etk exerts its profound stimulatory effects in the transformation functions of cancer cells. It is possible that in addition to Pak1, there are other unidentified downstream effectors for Etk pathway that contribute the observed phenotypic changes. Studies are in progress to investigate these and other possibilities. Our findings clearly established, for the first time, that Etk kinase directly associates with Pak1 and stimulates Pak1 tyrosine phosphorylation and that Etk controls the anchorage-independent growth rate and tumorigenic behavior of human mammary epithelial cancer cells. These observations open a new avenue of investigation closely linking the Tec and Pak families with breast cancer cell activity."

For example, mutations of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene, the prototypic family member, result in the genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). Much attention has focused on other members of this gene family (including LRP,1 megalin, apolipoprotein E receptor-2, very low density lipoprotein receptor) because of their recently recognized roles in development, cell signaling, and pathogenesis (2Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP1B (initially referred to as LRP-DIT (deleted in tumor)), a candidate tumor suppressor, is a new member of the giant receptor subgroup of this gene family. It is located at chromosome 2q21.2 and was isolated by positional cloning based on homozygous deletions detected in human cancer cell lines (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 5Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation analysis revealed that the gene is frequently (45%) inactivated in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines by intragenic homozygous deletions, point mutations, and aberrant transcripts missing internal portions. Loss of heterozygosity analysis also detected high allelic loss within the locus using two independent microsatellite polymorphism markers, suggesting that the gene is a candidate tumor suppressor (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar).The low density lipoprotein receptor gene family previously contained two very large members, LRP (LRP1), a dimer of 515 and 85 kDa, and its closely related homolog, megalin (LRP2), a single species of ∼600 kDa (2Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LRP1B is more closely related to LRP (with similarity of 59 and 52% identity at the cDNA and predicted amino acid levels, respectively) than to LRP2 (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA of LRP1B is 16.5 kilobases, with an open reading frame of 13,797 base pairs, which encodes a protein of 4599 amino acids. Characterization of exon-intron boundaries determined that the genomic DNA of LRP1B contains 91 exons, 89 of which are nearly identical in size and location to those of the 89 exons in the LRP gene (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 5Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A. Genomics. 2000; 69: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The two extra exons in LRP1B, exon 68 and exon 90, have no counterparts in LRP. However, the average size of the introns in LRP1B is at least 10 times larger than that of LRP (5Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A. Genomics. 2000; 69: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein domain structure comparison of the two genes reveals that the overall domain structural organizations of the two proteins are almost identical to one another, except for the fragments encoded by the two extra exons in LRP1B (4; see Fig. 1). Similar to LRP, LRP1B protein has four putative ligand-binding domains (I, II, III, and IV from the amino terminus) that consist of 2, 8, 10, and 12 cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats, respectively. As in LRP, these domain clusters are separated from one another by three clusters of epidermal growth factor precursor repeats and (F/Y)WXD spacer repeats. The number and arrangement of the two types of repeats are the same as those found in LRP, except for the one additional ligand-binding repeat in domain IV, which is encoded by exon 68. LRP1B also contains a putative furin endopeptidase processing site (REKR) at positions 3954–3957 (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A.

The transmembrane domain of LRP1B is similarly separated from domain IV and by a cassette of six epidermal growth factor-like precursor repeats. The cytoplasmic tail of LRP1B contains two NPXY motifs. Between these two is a unique insertion of 33 amino acid residues (contributed by exon 90) not present in LRP (4Liu C.-X. Musco S.

This diversity in biological processes is mediated by the interactions of LRP with multiple ligands, including proteinases, proteinase-inhibitor complexes, and lipoprotein particles (9Hussain M.M.

The close similarity in protein domain structure between LRP1B and LRP strongly suggests that the two receptors may share similarity in ligand interaction; i.e. many ligands for LRP may also be ligands for LRP1B. This notion is supported by the observation that LRP2 binds some ligands for LRP, such as receptor-associated protein (RAP) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) complexed with plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), although their homology is not as high as that between LRP and LRP1B. Furthermore, some of the ligands, such as apolipoprotein E and RAP, bind most of the receptors of the gene family (9Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). RAP is a 39-kDa protein that binds to LRP and inhibits the binding of all other ligands of LRP (22Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Physiologically, RAP serves as a folding chaperone for LRP during receptor biosynthesis (22Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed the biogenesis and endocytic functions of a minireceptor of LRP1B and demonstrated its ability to bind and endocytose several LRP ligands including RAP, uPA, PAI-1, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA).DISCUSSIONBased on its predicted amino acid sequence, LRP1B is a new member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family with a size (∼600 kDa) similar to that of LRP and megalin. LRP1B is more closely related to LRP than to megalin/LRP2 both at the amino acid sequence level and in its domain structural organization (4, 5; Fig. 1). These structural similarities suggest that the ligands of the receptors as well as the function of the receptors may well overlap. Our studies have utilized minireceptors of LRP1B and LRP. We have shown that mLRP1B4 is abundantly expressed at the cell surface and is probably processed by the endoprotease furin within the trans-Golgi compartments. At the cell surface, mLRP1B4 binds and internalizes each of the four LRP ligands examined (scuPA, tPA, PAI-1, and RAP). Furthermore, RAP inhibits the binding of each of these ligands to mLRP1B4, as it does to mLRP4.Despite these similarities, LRP1B and LRP differ in two important aspects. First, the kinetics of ligand endocytosis (as determined with RAP) are distinctly different between these two receptors. Although mLRP1B4 and mLRP4 display similar affinity for ligand (i.e. K d) and rates of ligand degradation, the internalization rate and efficiency is substantially less for mLRP1B4. The rate of internalization is more than 15-fold slower for mLRP1B4, which results in increased time spent by the ligand/receptor at the cell surface. The physiological significance of this difference is not yet clear but may limit the effectiveness of LRP1B as a protein clearance system. Alternatively, slower receptor internalization may provide for enhanced cell surface signaling capacity, should LRP1B be found to play a role in intracellular signaling. This appears likely, because several other members of this receptor family have been found to play a role in signaling (2Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the major difference within the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and LRP1B is the 33-amino acid insert in the tail of LRP1B. This insert may promote interaction with adapter proteins and thus provide a mechanistic explanation for the slower internalization rate of LRP1B. Future studies similar to those that have dissected the signals within the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (35Stockinger W. Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M.

LRP is highly expressed in liver, brain, and lung. In liver LRP is a major receptor for clearance of chylomicron particles and proteases (37Willnow T.E. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas in brain LRP plays an important role in neurite growth (38Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 39Narita M. Bu G. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and is involved in the pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (3Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and long term potentiation (14Zhuo M. Holtzman D.M. Li Y. Osaka H. DeMaro J. Jacquin M. Bu G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Megalin is mainly expressed in kidney, with limited expression in lung and brain. In kidney it serves as an endocytic receptor regulating homeostasis of vitamin D and other nutrients (40Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). LRP1B is most abundantly expressed in brain, thyroid, and salivary gland, clearly a distinct pattern from those of the other receptors of the gene family. A more precise definition of LRP1B expression requires further examination via eitherin situ hybridization with an antisense riboprobe or immunohistochemical staining with the antibody when it becomes available.The identification of uPA and PAI-1 as ligands for LRP1B deserves comment because they are key components of the uPA system, one of the major extracellular matrix-degrading proteinase systems (41Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 42Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 103-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uPA system plays a central role in cancer invasion and metastasis as well as other physiological and pathological processes involved in tissue remodeling. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that a major role of the uPA system in promoting cell invasion and metastasis independent from its proteinase activities is dependent upon the interactions between uPA, uPAR, PAI-1, and other cell surface and extracellular components (41Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 42Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 103-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LRP is well recognized as one important regulator of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 function (15Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M.

Pro-uPA first binds to cell surface uPAR with high affinity and is converted into active uPA. Receptor-bound uPA catalyzes the conversion of the inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, which in turn mediates the degradation of extracellular components including collagens. Active uPA can be inhibited by PAI-1 with the formation of a uPAR·uPA complex. The trimolecular complex (uPAR·uPA·PAI-1) binds to LRP with high affinity and is internalized with the ligand complex subsequently directed to lysosomes for degradation. uPAR and LRP recycle back to the cell surface (17Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Nykjaer A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A similar sequence of events may involve LRP1B and may link its cellular physiology to altered cellular invasion/metastasis. LRP1B was identified via its homozygous deletions in human cancer cell lines and thus represents a candidate tumor suppressor. Preliminary mutation analysis showed that it was frequently (∼50%) inactivated in cell lines of human lung cancer (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our present results, which show that LRP1B interacts with uPA and PAI-1, warrant further studies on the potential function of LRP1B in mediating the function of the uPA/uPAR system and in tumor metastasis.In summary, using LRP1B minireceptor (LRP1B4)-expressing cells, we identified that RAP, uPA, tPA, and PAI-1 are ligands for LRP1B. However, LRP1B differs from LRP in both endocytic kinetics and in its tissue expression pattern. Future studies will focus on its physiological and pathophysiological roles as well as the molecular bases thereof. Members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family play a wide variety of roles in normal cell function and development. For example, mutations of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene, the prototypic family member, result in the genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). Much attention has focused on other members of this gene family (including LRP,1 megalin, apolipoprotein E receptor-2, very low density lipoprotein receptor) because of their recently recognized roles in development, cell signaling, and pathogenesis (2Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP1B (initially referred to as LRP-DIT (deleted in tumor)), a candidate tumor suppressor, is a new member of the giant receptor subgroup of this gene family. It is located at chromosome 2q21.2 and was isolated by positional cloning based on homozygous deletions detected in human cancer cell lines (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 5Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A. Genomics. 2000; 69: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Lisitsyn N.A. Lisitsina N.M. Dalbagni G. Barker P. Sanchez C.A. Gnarra J. Linehan W.M. Reid B.J. Wigler M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation analysis revealed that the gene is frequently (45%) inactivated in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines by intragenic homozygous deletions, point mutations, and aberrant transcripts missing internal portions. Loss of heterozygosity analysis also detected high allelic loss within the locus using two independent microsatellite polymorphism markers, suggesting that the gene is a candidate tumor suppressor (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). The low density lipoprotein receptor gene family previously contained two very large members, LRP (LRP1), a dimer of 515 and 85 kDa, and its closely related homolog, megalin (LRP2), a single species of ∼600 kDa (2Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Ulery P.G. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LRP1B is more closely related to LRP (with similarity of 59 and 52% identity at the cDNA and predicted amino acid levels, respectively) than to LRP2 (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA of LRP1B is 16.5 kilobases, with an open reading frame of 13,797 base pairs, which encodes a protein of 4599 amino acids. Characterization of exon-intron boundaries determined that the genomic DNA of LRP1B contains 91 exons, 89 of which are nearly identical in size and location to those of the 89 exons in the LRP gene (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 5Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A. Genomics. 2000; 69: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The two extra exons in LRP1B, exon 68 and exon 90, have no counterparts in LRP. However, the average size of the introns in LRP1B is at least 10 times larger than that of LRP (5Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Yaklichkin S.Y. Lisitsyn N.A. Genomics. 2000; 69: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein domain structure comparison of the two genes reveals that the overall domain structural organizations of the two proteins are almost identical to one another, except for the fragments encoded by the two extra exons in LRP1B (4; see Fig. 1). Similar to LRP, LRP1B protein has four putative ligand-binding domains (I, II, III, and IV from the amino terminus) that consist of 2, 8, 10, and 12 cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats, respectively. As in LRP, these domain clusters are separated from one another by three clusters of epidermal growth factor precursor repeats and (F/Y)WXD spacer repeats. The number and arrangement of the two types of repeats are the same as those found in LRP, except for the one additional ligand-binding repeat in domain IV, which is encoded by exon 68. LRP1B also contains a putative furin endopeptidase processing site (REKR) at positions 3954–3957 (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar), similar to that in LRP (7Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

LRP is widely expressed and plays important roles in lipoprotein catabolism, blood coagulation, cell adhesion and migration, neuronal process outgrowth, and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (2Howell B.W.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Physiologically, RAP serves as a folding chaperone for LRP during receptor biosynthesis (22Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study we analyzed the biogenesis and endocytic functions of a minireceptor of LRP1B and demonstrated its ability to bind and endocytose several LRP ligands including RAP, uPA, PAI-1, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). DISCUSSIONBased on its predicted amino acid sequence, LRP1B is a new member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family with a size (∼600 kDa) similar to that of LRP and megalin. LRP1B is more closely related to LRP than to megalin/LRP2 both at the amino acid sequence level and in its domain structural organization (4, 5; Fig. 1). These structural similarities suggest that the ligands of the receptors as well as the function of the receptors may well overlap. Our studies have utilized minireceptors of LRP1B and LRP. We have shown that mLRP1B4 is abundantly expressed at the cell surface and is probably processed by the endoprotease furin within the trans-Golgi compartments. At the cell surface, mLRP1B4 binds and internalizes each of the four LRP ligands examined (scuPA, tPA, PAI-1, and RAP). Furthermore, RAP inhibits the binding of each of these ligands to mLRP1B4, as it does to mLRP4.Despite these similarities, LRP1B and LRP differ in two important aspects. First, the kinetics of ligand endocytosis (as determined with RAP) are distinctly different between these two receptors. Although mLRP1B4 and mLRP4 display similar affinity for ligand (i.e. K d) and rates of ligand degradation, the internalization rate and efficiency is substantially less for mLRP1B4. The rate of internalization is more than 15-fold slower for mLRP1B4, which results in increased time spent by the ligand/receptor at the cell surface. The physiological significance of this difference is not yet clear but may limit the effectiveness of LRP1B as a protein clearance system. Alternatively, slower receptor internalization may provide for enhanced cell surface signaling capacity, should LRP1B be found to play a role in intracellular signaling. This appears likely, because several other members of this receptor family have been found to play a role in signaling (2Howell B.W. Herz J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the major difference within the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and LRP1B is the 33-amino acid insert in the tail of LRP1B. This insert may promote interaction with adapter proteins and thus provide a mechanistic explanation for the slower internalization rate of LRP1B. Future studies similar to those that have dissected the signals within the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (35Stockinger W. Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M.

LRP is highly expressed in liver, brain, and lung. In liver LRP is a major receptor for clearance of chylomicron particles and proteases (37Willnow T.E. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas in brain LRP plays an important role in neurite growth (38Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 542-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Megalin is mainly expressed in kidney, with limited expression in lung and brain. In kidney it serves as an endocytic receptor regulating homeostasis of vitamin D and other nutrients (40Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). LRP1B is most abundantly expressed in brain, thyroid, and salivary gland, clearly a distinct pattern from those of the other receptors of the gene family. A more precise definition of LRP1B expression requires further examination via eitherin situ hybridization with an antisense riboprobe or immunohistochemical staining with the antibody when it becomes available.The identification of uPA and PAI-1 as ligands for LRP1B deserves comment because they are key components of the uPA system, one of the major extracellular matrix-degrading proteinase systems (41Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 42Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 103-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uPA system plays a central role in cancer invasion and metastasis as well as other physiological and pathological processes involved in tissue remodeling. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that a major role of the uPA system in promoting cell invasion and metastasis independent from its proteinase activities is dependent upon the interactions between uPA, uPAR, PAI-1, and other cell surface and extracellular components (41Andreasen P.A.

Pro-uPA first binds to cell surface uPAR with high affinity and is converted into active uPA. Receptor-bound uPA catalyzes the conversion of the inactive plasminogen to active plasmin, which in turn mediates the degradation of extracellular components including collagens. Active uPA can be inhibited by PAI-1 with the formation of a uPAR·uPA complex. The trimolecular complex (uPAR·uPA·PAI-1) binds to LRP with high affinity and is internalized with the ligand complex subsequently directed to lysosomes for degradation. uPAR and LRP recycle back to the cell surface (17Conese M.

A similar sequence of events may involve LRP1B and may link its cellular physiology to altered cellular invasion/metastasis. LRP1B was identified via its homozygous deletions in human cancer cell lines and thus represents a candidate tumor suppressor. Preliminary mutation analysis showed that it was frequently (∼50%) inactivated in cell lines of human lung cancer (4Liu C.-X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Fogacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our present results, which show that LRP1B interacts with uPA and PAI-1, warrant further studies on the potential function of LRP1B in mediating the function of the uPA/uPAR system and in tumor metastasis.In summary, using LRP1B minireceptor (LRP1B4)-expressing cells, we identified that RAP, uPA, tPA, and PAI-1 are ligands for LRP1B.

We now show that Hsp27 is also phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK), a signaling system important for the inhibition of platelet aggregation. Stimulation of washed platelets with 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP, a cGK specific activator, resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of Hsp27. This is supported by the ability of cGK to phosphorylate Hsp27 in vitro to an extent comparable with the cGK-mediated phosphorylation of its established substrate vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Studies with Hsp27 mutants identified threonine 143 as a yet uncharacterized phosphorylation site in Hsp27 specifically targeted by cGK. To test the hypothesis that cGK could inhibit platelet aggregation by phosphorylating Hsp27 and interfering with the MAPKAP kinase phosphorylation of Hsp27, the known MAPKAP kinase 2-phosphorylation sites (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82) as well as Thr143 were replaced by negatively charged amino acids, which are considered to mimic phosphate groups, and tested in actin polymerization experiments. Mimicry at the MAPKAP kinase 2 phosphorylation sites led to mutants with a stimulating effect on actin polymerization. Mutation of the cGK-specific site Thr143alone had no effect on actin polymerization, but in the MAPKAP kinase 2 phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, this mutation reduced the stimulation of actin polymerization significantly.

Agonists such as thrombin, thromboxane, vasopressin, and ADP activate platelets and cause shape change, aggregation, and degranulation. Platelet activation is inhibited by a variety of agents, including aspirin and Ca2+ antagonists as well as cGMP- and cAMP-elevating agents such as NO and prostaglandin I2, respectively (for review, see Ref. 1von Bruchhausen F. Walter U. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1997; 126: 181-208Crossref Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of cGMP and cAMP are principally mediated by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (cGK and cAK, respectively), with some cross-talk existing between the two systems. For example, cGMP stimulates the hydrolysis of cAMP via cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (2Haslam R.J. Dickinson N.T. Jang E.K. Thromb.

To identify additional intracellular targets for cGK, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled human platelets in combination with nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-MS). By applying this method, we identified heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27)1 as a substrate of cGK I in intact platelets. Additionally, we suggest that phosphorylation of Hsp27 may contribute to the inhibitory actions of cGMP by regulating actin polymerization. Urea (ultra pure), IPG strips, [γ-32P]ATP, and ECL detection kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany), QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), trypsin was from Promega (Heidelberg, Germany), 8-pCPT-cGMP was from BioLog (Bremen, Germany), goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, and nonfat dry milk were from Bio-Rad (München, Germany), p38 antibody was from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany), Hsp27 human polyclonal antibody and recombinant human active MAPKAP kinase 2 were from Biozol (Eching, Germany),N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands), [32P]orthophosphate (HCl-free) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore (Eschborn, Germany), and nitrocellulose was obtained from Schleicher and Schuell (Kassel, Germany). All other chemicals, reagents and solvents of the highest purity available were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). cGK Iα and the catalytic subunit of cAK type II were purified from bovine lung and bovine heart, respectively (17Walter U. Miller P. Wilson F. Menkes D. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3757-3762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGK Iβ and cGK II were expressed in and purified from the baculovirus-Sf9 cell system (18Pöhler D. Butt E. Meißner J.

Freshly donated blood from healthy volunteers (50 ml) was collected in acid-citrate dextrose and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g to yield platelet-rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged for 20 min at 500 × g and the pellet was resuspended and washed once in an isotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.5 mmglucose, and 1 mm EDTA at a density of 1 × 109 cells/ml. After resuspension, platelets were allowed to rest at 37 °C for 15 min. Platelet preparation was carried out essentially as described above. After washing, 1 ml of platelets at a concentration of 1 × 109/ml was incubated with 500 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (HCl-free) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Platelets were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 7 min and resuspended in 1 ml of isotonic buffer. Aliquots of 100 μl (corresponding to 200 μg of protein) were used for activation with 500 μm8-pCPT-cGMP for 30 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, platelets were briefly centrifuged (500 × g) to yield a pellet. Isoelectric focussing for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using the Multiphor II system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The platelet pellet (about 200 μg of protein) was solubilized for 15 min by sonication in 220 μl of lysis buffer containing 7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 15 mmdithiothreitol (electrophoresis grade), 0.5% carrier ampholytes, pH 3–10. Pellet homogenate was loaded on a 13-cm immobilized IPG strip, pH 3–10, using a reswelling cassette (custom-built). Focussing was carried out for 1 h at 150 V, 1 h at 600 V, and 25 h at 3500 V. After equilibration in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 6 murea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, strips were immediately applied to a vertical 10% SDS gel without stacking gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 8 °C with a constant current of 30 mA per gel. The gels of radioactively labeled platelet proteins were fixed in 30% ethanol, 10% acetic acid and exposed. Radioactive spots were cut out, collected, and concentrated in a Pasteur pipette according to Gaevertet al. (19Gevaert K. Verschelde J.-L. Puype M. Van Damme J. Goethals M. De Boeck S. Vandekerckhove J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 918-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The concentrated gel piece was washed sequentially for 10 min in tryptic digestion buffer (10 mmNH4HCO3) and digestion buffer:acetonitril, 1:1. These steps were repeated three times and led to a shrinking of the gel. It was reswollen with 2 μl of protease solution (trypsin at 0.05 μg/μl) in digestion buffer and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was collected and dried down to 1 μl. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was carried out using a TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nanospray source of 0.6 to 1.1 kV constructed in-house. Mass spectra were acquired with a scan speed of 1000 Da/s. Argon at a pressure of 3 mTorr was used as collision gas. For the fully automated interpretation of fragment ion spectra, the SEQUESTTM algorithm (version B22) was employed. Washed, intact human platelets (100 μl) at a concentration of 1 × 109cells/ml were incubated at 37 °C by adding 2 units/ml thrombin for 2 min or by adding 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP for the times indicated in the figures. After treatment, platelets were briefly centrifuged (500 × g) to yield a pellet, which was immediately boiled in Laemmli SDS stop solution and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. After blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocking with 3% nonfat dry milk in 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was first incubated with a polyclonal antibody against dual phosphorylated p38 (1:500) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) and detection by ECL. For Hsp27 detection, a two-dimensional SDS gel was blotted on nitrocellulose, blocked with 1% hemoglobin in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated first with an anti-Hsp27 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) and detection by ECL.

All mutants were verified by sequencing. Hsp27 and its mutants S15D, S78D,S82D, S15D,S78D,S82D, S15D,S78D,S82D,T143E, and T143E (each 0.5 μm) were incubated at 30 °C in a total volume of 20 μl with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, and the C subunit of cAK or cGK Iα, Iβ, or II (each 0.05 μm) and 5 μm cGMP. Alternatively, Hsp27 and its mutants were incubated with 5 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 6.25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1.25 mmEGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 unit of MAPKAP kinase 2. Reactions were started by the addition of 50 μm ATP containing 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and terminated after 30 min or at the times indicated in the figures by the addition of 10 μl of Laemmli SDS stop solution. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography. G-actin was prepared from pig skeletal muscle according to the procedure of Pardee and Spudich (22Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). For labeling with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide, G-actin was dialyzed 3 times for 12 h against G-buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2). To polymerize G-actin to F-actin, 100 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 was added for 1 h at room temperature. N-(1-Pyrenyl)iodoacetamide (at a 2-fold molar excess) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added slowly with gentle stirring to the F-actin solution. The solution was kept at room temperature in the dark for 20 h. After labeling, F-actin was dialyzed 5 times against G-buffer with 0.5 mmdithioerythritol at 4 °C to form G-actin. To remove any residual F-actin, the solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g in a swing-bucket rotor and the supernatant was used in the polymerization experiments. The degree of labeling was determined by UV spectroscopy at 344 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 2.2 × 104m−1cm−1, and was found to be 70–80%. For standard assays, pyrene-labeled G-actin in G-buffer at a final concentration of 2 μm and various amounts of Hsp27 were mixed in a total volume of 500 μl in a solution of 20 mmTris (pH 7.6), 0.05 mm NaN3, 0.002 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithioerythritol, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NH4Cl. The solutions were mixed with 1 μl of 1 m MgCl2 and 12.5 μl of 2 mKCl to start actin polymerization. Polymerization was measured by the enhancement of pyrene-actin fluorescence using the luminescence spectrophotometer LS50 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Excitation was measured at 365 nm with a 2.5-mm slit width, and emission was detected at 407 nm with 2.5-mm slit width. To identify substrates of cGK in intact human platelets, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, stimulated with 500 μmof the specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase activator 8-pCPT-cGMP, and proteins of the resulting platelet lysate were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fig.1 shows low basal phosphorylation of three proteins with an approximate molecular mass of 27 kDa in resting platelets (control). Phosphorylation of the two more acidic protein spots was significantly increased after stimulation with 8-pCPT-cGMP. To identify these proteins, the three spots were excised from several two-dimensional gels, concentrated, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. All spots contained Hsp27, suggesting that the three spots either represent the mono-, bis-, and tris-phosphorylated isoforms of the protein with a 8-pCPT-cGMP-induced increase in the amount of the bis- and tris-phosphorylated forms or indicate some different post-translational modifications (23Scheler C. Li X.-P. Salnikow J. Dunn M.J. Jungblut P.R. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3623-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To confirm the identification of Hsp27, human platelets were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, stimulated with 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP for 10 min, and proteins of the homogenate were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and positions of the phosphoproteins were determined by autoradiography (Fig. 2, lower panel). The membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Hsp27. Two radioactive protein spots that demonstrated increases in phosphorylation after cGK activation were immunoreactive with anti-Hsp27 antibody (Fig. 2, upper panel). Three more basic proteins, most likely representing additional nonphosphorylated or weakly phosphorylated isoforms of Hsp27, were also immunoreactive and decreased in amount during stimulation.Figure 2The 27-kDa protein is immunoreactive with anti-Hsp27 antibody. Intact human platelets were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with 500 μm8-pCPT-cGMP for 10 min. Platelet homogenate proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The autoradiogram (lower panel) reveals phosphorylation of two proteins. The corresponding anti-Hsp27 immunoblots (upper panel) demonstrate immunoreactive protein corresponding to the phosphoprotein. In addition, three unphosphorylated immunoreactive proteins were identified. The location of the unphosphorylated isoforms and the phosphorylated spots are indicated at the top of the figure. The blots are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether cGK phosphorylates Hsp27 in vitro, purified, recombinant Hsp27 was incubated with the three cGK isoforms Iα, Iβ, and II or the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. An autoradiogram of a representative SDS-PAGE gel is shown in Fig.3. Incorporation of phosphate was observed after 30 min with all of the four kinases, albeit at different levels, with cGK causing less phosphate incorporation than the C subunit. In a control experiment, VASP, a well known substrate for cAK and cGK (15Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was equally phosphorylated by all four kinases. It is known that Hsp27 is phosphorylated in human platelets directly by MAPKAP kinase 2 after stimulation of the platelets with thrombin and subsequent activation of the p38 MAPK cascade (24Mendelsohn M.E.

To exclude any direct stimulation of p38 MAPK or MAPKAP kinase 2 by 8-pCPT-cGMP and any indirect effect of cGK on Hsp27 phosphorylation via p38 MAPK, human platelets were stimulated with 500 μm 8-pCPT-cGMP or, as a positive control, with 2 units/ml thrombin, and p38 MAPK activation was monitored by a specific antibody that recognizes the active, bis-phosphorylated form of p38 MAPK. In contrast to the control experiment with thrombin treatment, where p38 MAPK was rapidly phosphorylated and activated in platelets after 2 min, the stimulation with 8-pCPT-cGMP did not lead to increased p38 phosphorylation at any of the times analyzed (Fig. 4). Similar negative results were obtained when we investigated the ability of cGK to directly phosphorylate and activate MAPKAP kinase 2 (data not shown). It has been shown that Hsp27 is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivoby MAPKAP kinase 2 at Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82, with this latter residue being the most prominentin vitro phosphorylation site (29Landry J.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Experiments with cAMP-dependent protein kinase revealed phosphorylation of Ser15 and Ser86 of mouse Hsp25 in vitro, albeit with low efficiency (31Gaestel M. Schröder W. Benndorf R. Lippmann C. Buchner K. Hucho F. Erdmann V.A. Bielka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14721-14724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, our sequence analysis of Hsp27 identified an additional putative phosphorylation site of Hsp27 for cAK and cGK at threonine 143 (Arg-Lys-Tyr-Thr 143-Leu). To study this potential phosphorylation site, we constructed two mutants in which threonine 143 was replaced by a phosphate-mimicking glutamic acid: Hsp27-T143E and Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D,T143E. In addition, we investigated three Hsp27 mutants reported previously: Hsp27-S15D, Hsp27-S78D,S82D, and Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D (21Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C.

Analysis of these earlier mutants by in vitro phosphorylation experiments confirmed the results obtained previously with MAPKAP kinase 2 showing complete absence of phosphate incorporation after substitution of all three known serine phosphorylation sites in mutant Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D (Fig. 5). In contrast, this mutant was still phosphorylated by both cGK and cAK (8 ± 0.8 and 20 ± 0.5% of wild-type phosphorylation, respectively). Only after mutation of threonine 143 to glutamic acid (Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D,T143E), phosphate incorporation was abolished (Fig. 5, TableI). To confirm this result, the threonine phosphorylation by cGK and cAK was further analyzed by phosphorylating wild type Hsp27 and Hsp27-T143E with the two kinases. A 50% reduction in phosphate incorporation was observed for the threonine mutant providing further evidence that threonine 143 represents an important phosphorylation site for cGK and cAK in Hsp27 (Fig.6 A). For quantification, the areas of the gel corresponding to the autoradiogram in Fig. 5 were collected for liquid scintillation counting. These data are summarized in Table I. Ser15 is probably not phosphorylated by cGK since the mutants Hsp27-S78D,S82D and Hsp27-S15D,S78D,S82D showed similar phosphate incorporation. Interestingly, cAK also appears not to phosphorylate Ser15, although mimicking Ser15phosphorylation (Hsp27-S15D) increased incorporation of phosphate by cAK about 2-fold compared with wild-type Hsp27. This enhanced phosphate incorporation after Ser15 mutation was also observed with MAPKAP kinase 2, albeit to a lesser extent: S15D phosphorylation increased to 118 ± 9% of wild-type phosphorylation (Fig. 5, Table I). In the presence of cGK, wild-type Hsp27 is phosphorylated 24.8 ± 3% with respect to wild-type phosphorylation by MAPKAP kinase 2 (Table I).Table IPhosphate incorporation of wild-type and mutant Hsp27KinasePhosphate incorporation (%)Wild-typeS15DS78D,S82DS15D,S78D,S82DS15D,S78D,S82D,T143EMAPKAPK-2100118 ± 950 ± 5.80.6 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.2cGK24.8 ± 318.6 ± 2.78.8 ± 0.88 ± 0.71.8 ± 0.3C-subunit40.8 ± 693 ± 7.915.1 ± 1.620.5 ± 0.50.3 ± 0.1Wild-type Hsp27 and the mutants S15D,S78D,S82D, S15D,S78D,S82D and S15D,S78D,S82D,T143E (each 0.5 μm) were incubated with 0.2 units of MAPKAP kinase 2 or 0.05 μm cGK and C-subunit in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 20 μl.

https://openalex.org/W2149098649,"Reverse transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome appears to be strictly regulated at the level of initiation. The primer binding site (PBS), at which the tRNA 3Lys molecule anneals and reverse transcription is initiated, is present in a highly structured region of the untranslated leader RNA. Detailed mutational analysis of the U5 leader stem identified a sequence motif in the U5 region that is critical for activation of the PBS-bound tRNA 3Lys primer. This U5 motif, termed the primer activation signal ( PAS ), may interact with the TΨC arm of the tRNA 3Lys primer, similar to the additional interaction proposed for the genome of Rous sarcoma virus and its tRNATrp primer. This suggests that reverse transcription is regulated by a common mechanism in all retroviruses. In HIV-1 , the PAS is masked through base pairing in the U5 leader stem. This provides a mechanism for positive and negative regulation of reverse transcription. Based on structure probing of the mutant and wild-type RNAs, an RNA secondary structure model is proposed that juxtaposes the critical PAS and PBS motifs.

Reverse transcription is mediated by the virion-associated enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT),1and a cellular tRNA molecule is used as a primer (2Marquet R. Isel C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B.

The tRNA primer binds with its 3′-terminal 18 nts to a complementary sequence, the primer binding site (PBS), that is located in the 5′-untranslated leader region of the viral RNA genome. Retroviral particles are competent to initiate reverse transcription shortly after budding from the producer cell, but there is also evidence that reverse transcription in virions is limited (3Trono D.

Alternatively, reverse transcription may be restricted in extracellular virions by the low concentration of dNTP molecules in virus particles. In the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), the PBS is predicted to be part of an extended RNA structure. Several RNA secondary structure models have been proposed for this region of the 5′-untranslated leader (14Berkhout B. Progr. Nucleic Acid. Res. Mol.

The model depicted in Fig. 1 A shows the U5-PBS hairpin that occludes part of the PBS and the extended U5 leader stem, which is formed by base pairing of sequences in the upstream U5 and the downstream leader region. Similar RNA secondary structures have been predicted for other retroviruses (16Rizvi T.A. Panganiban A.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2681-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Berkhout B. Schoneveld I.

For the avian Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), these structures have been reported to regulate initiation of reverse transcription (8Cobrinik D. Soskey L. Leis J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3622-3630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cobrinik D. Aiyar A. Ge Z. Katzman M. Huang H. Leis J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3864-3872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cordell B.

Virol. 1997; 71: 7648-7656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In RSV, reverse transcription is stimulated by an additional vRNA-tRNA interaction between a sequence motif in the U5 region and the TΨC arm of the tRNATrp primer (22Aiyar A. Cobrinik D. Ge Z. Kung H.J. Leis J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2464-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For HIV-1 reverse transcription, initiation is thought to be stimulated by other template-primer contacts, including a base-pairing interaction between the A-rich loop of the U5-PBS hairpin and the anti-codon loop of the tRNA 3Lys primer (12Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Liang C. Li X. Rong L. Inouye P. Quan Y. Kleiman L. Wainberg M.A. J.

We measured the replication capacity of the mutant viruses and performed in vitro reverse transcription assays with the mutant RNA templates. Analysis of HIV-1 mutants with large deletions suggested that the U5 region contains a motif that is critical for tRNA 3Lys-mediated initiation of reverse transcription but not for reactions that are initiated by a DNA primer. A second set of mutants was designed to map this HIV-1 RNA motif in more detail. We identified an eight-nucleotide sequence in the U5 region that is not involved in tRNA annealing but that is important for initiation of reverse transcription. We propose that this motif interacts with the TΨC arm of tRNA 3Lys, thereby triggering initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription. This U5 motif, termed primer activation signal (PAS), is masked in the wild-type RNA through base pairing in the U5 leader stem. Interestingly, reverse transcription can be activated by exposure of the PAS through mutation of the “opposing” leader sequence. The presence of the PAS enhancer element and a repressive RNA structure provides a mechanism for positive and negative regulation of reverse transcription. In addition, we performed structure probing of the mutant and wild-type RNAs to resolve the secondary structure of the PBS domain. An RNA secondary structure model is proposed in which the PAS and PBS motifs are juxtaposed. Overall, regulation of reverse transcription in HIV-1 appears to be very similar to that in RSV, suggesting that reverse transcription is regulated by a common mechanism in all retroviruses. A derivate of the full-length proviral HIV-1 clone pLAI was used to produce wild-type and U5 leader stem-mutated viruses. This construct pLAI-R37 has been described previously and contains a unique U5 region in the 5′-LTR (31Das A.T. Klaver B. Klasens B.I.F. van Wamel J.L.B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide numbers refer to positions on HIV-1 genomic RNA, with +1 being the capped G residue. For mutation of the U5 leader stem, we used the construct Blue-5′-LTR (32Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3830-3840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains aXbaI-ClaI fragment of HIV-1, encompassing the 5′-LTR, PBS, leader, and the 5′ end of the gag gene (positions −454 to +376) cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). The U5 leader stem was mutated by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis with a Muta-Gene Phagemid in Vitromutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). For sequence analysis, the 5′-LTR leader region was PCR-amplified with the sense R region primer T7-1 (positions −54 to −34) with the 5′-flanking T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and the antisense primer AUG (positions +348 to +368, with 6 additional nucleotides at its 5′-end). These PCR products were sequenced with the DYEnamicTM Direct cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. Subsequently, the mutated XbaI-ClaI fragments were introduced into the proviral clone pLAI-R37, which was checked by sequence analysis of the mutated domain. SupT1 T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. SupT1 cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 1 µg of the HIV-1 proviral constructs by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarads). Fresh SupT1 cells (0.5 × 106) were added after transfection to support virus replication. Cells were split 1 to 10 twice a week. CA-p24 levels in the culture medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (33Back N.K.T. Nijhuis M. Keulen W. Boucher C.A.B. Oude Essink B.B. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. Van Gennip A.H. Berkhout B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant pBlue-5′-LTR plasmids were used as the template for PCR amplification and subsequent in vitro transcription. The 5′-LTR-leader region was PCR-amplified with the sense primer T7–2 (positions +1 to +20) with 5′-flanking T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and the antisense primer AUG (positions +348 to +368). The PCR fragments were phenol-extracted, precipitated and dissolved in water. In vitro transcription was performed with the T7-MegaShortscript kit (Ambion). Upon DNase treatment and phenol extraction, the unincorporated free nucleotides were removed by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column. Subsequently, the RNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in renaturation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). The RNA was renatured by incubation at 85 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature, and the RNA was stored at −20 °C. The RNA concentration was measured by UV spectroscopy. The in vitrosynthesized RNA template (10 ng) was incubated either with 1.5 µg of calf liver tRNA (6 pmol total tRNA, of which ∼1.2 pmol tRNA 3Lys, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or with 20 ng of DNA primer in 12 µl of annealing buffer (83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl) at 85 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling to room temperature over a 1-h period. We previously demonstrated that there is selective priming by tRNA 3Lys in this system (6Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Even the related tRNALys1,2 molecules do not act as a primer. The primer was extended with 1 nt by the addition of 6 µl of RT(−) buffer (9 mm MgCl2, 30 mmdithiothreitol, 150 µg/ml actinomycin D), 1 µl of [α-32P]dCTP, and 0.5 units of HIV-1 RT (Medical Research Council AIDS Reagent Project). Reverse transcription was performed for 30 min at 37 °C. Complete cDNA synthesis was accomplished in RT(+) buffer (RT(−) buffer with 30 µmdATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 1.5 µm dCTP), 0.3 µl of [α-32P]dCTP, and 0.5 units of HIV-1 RT. In the PBS occupancy assay, the RNA template was incubated simultaneously with 1.5 µg of calf liver tRNA and 20 ng of AUG primer, and reverse transcription was performed in RT(+) buffer with avian myeloblastosis virus RT enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNA products were precipitated in 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 70% ethanol at −20 °C, dissolved in formamide-loading buffer, heated, and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea-sequencing gel. The antisense primers used are poly(A) (positions +77 to +104), Lys-21 (positions +182 to +202), and AUG (positions +348 to +368, with 6 additional nucleotides at its 5′ end). Sequence reactions with the BB-3 (positions +215 to +245) and AUG primer were performed with the Sequenase kit 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and included on the sequencing gels to determine the exact length of the cDNA products. In vitrosynthesized HIV-1 leader RNA (positions +1 to +368) (50 ng) was treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC, 0.5%/2.5%), dimethyl sulfate (DMS, 0.1/0.5%), RNase T1 (0.004 units/0.02 units), RNase S1 (2 units/10 units), or RNase One (10−5 units/5 × 10−5 units) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples treated were phenol-extracted and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The antisense primers AD-SD (positions + 270 to +290) and Lys-21 (positions +182 to +202) were used to map the sites of modification or cleavage. Primers were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled oligonucleotide (2 ng) was mixed with the RNA sample in a total volume of 10 µl of annealing buffer, incubated for 2 min at 85 °C and for 10 min at 65 °C, and slowly cooled to 25 °C. The primer was extended by the addition of 5 µl of RT(+) buffer and 12.5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus RT enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 15-min incubation at 42 °C. The samples were mixed with formamide-loading buffer and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea-sequencing gel. Sequence reactions initiated by the primers AD-SD or Lys-21 were included on the sequencing gels to determine the exact positions of modification or cleavage. To study the role of the U5 leader stem in reverse transcription, we constructed two deletion mutants (Fig. 1 B). Mutant d1 contains a large deletion on left side of the U5 leader stem (positions +112 to +148), and mutant d2 contains a deletion on the right side of the stem (positions +216 to +242). The double mutant d1/2 combines both deletions. A second set of more subtle mutants was designed to change the individual stem segments of the U5 leader structure as illustrated in Fig. 1 C. The upper stem segment 1 was mutated by a 7-nt substitution either on the left side in mutant 1L or on the right side in mutant 1R. Mutations 1L and 1R are complementary, and base pairing will be restored in the double mutant 1LR, at least according to the RNA secondary structure model in Fig. 1. Similar type of mutations were introduced in stem segment 2 (2L, 2R, and 2LR) and segment 3 (3L, 3R, and 3LR). In addition, the left arm (positions +134 to +148) and the right arm (positions +224 to +233) of the U5 leader structure were deleted in mutants dL and dR, respectively. Both deletions were combined in the double mutant dLR. To study the replication potential of viruses with U5 leader stem mutations, we transfected wild-type and mutant proviral genomes into the SupT1 T cell line. These cells express the CD4-CXCR4 receptors and are fully susceptible for replication of the HIV-1 LAI strain. Virus replication was followed by measuring the accumulation of CA-p24 in the culture medium at several days post-transfection. Transfection with 1 µg of the proviral constructs d1, d2, and d1/2 demonstrated that these deletions completely impair virus replication (Fig.2 A), indicating that the U5 leader stem or sequence elements encoded by this region are important for viral replication. To study the contribution of distinct sequence or structure elements in more detail, we tested the second set of more subtle mutants. Mutation of stem 1 had a minor effect on virus replication (Fig. 2 B). However, both mutations 2L and 2R in the middle segment severely impaired virus replication, and the double mutant did not restore replication (Fig. 2 C). Mutation 3L in the lower stem segment also reduced viral replication significantly, whereas mutation 3R showed only a minor effect on viral replication (Fig. 2 D). The combination of both mutations in mutant 3LR further reduced the replication capacity. Deletion dL did not significantly affect virus replication, deletion dR showed a modest defect, and combination of the mutations in mutant dLR further reduced replication (Fig. 2 E). These combined results indicate that sequences within stem 2 of the U5 leader structure are most important for virus replication. We next performed in vitro reverse transcription reactions with the wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RNA templates. RNA templates encompassing the complete untranslated leader region (positions +1 to +368) were used with the natural tRNA 3Lys primer or DNA primers to initiate reverse transcription. The position of the different primers is shown in Fig. 1 A. The primers were heat-annealed onto the different RNA templates, and reverse transcription was initiated by the addition of dNTPs and HIV-1 RT enzyme. Full-length reverse transcription products were quantitated and corrected for the amount of input RNA template, as determined with the DNA primer poly(A) (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1–4). Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 3. The results of three independent assays were quantitated and are summarized in Fig. 4.Figure 4Relative reverse transcription activities of wild-type and d1, d2, and d1/2 mutant templates. The results of three independent experiments were quantitated, and the activity of the wild-type template was arbitrarily set at 1. Shown is DNA-primed reverse transcription with the Lys-21 primer (A), tRNA-primed reverse transcription (B), and tRNA-primed 1-nt incorporation (C). The tRNA occupancy of the PBS is shown inD and was also set at 1 (100% occupancy) for the wild-type template.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Extension of the DNA primer Lys-21 that is complementary to the PBS resulted in a 202-nt full-length cDNA product on the wild-type template, with a predicted change in cDNA length for the d1 and d1/2 templates due to the deletion in the U5 region (Fig.3 A, lanes 5–8). The efficiency of DNA-primed reverse transcription is equal on all templates (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, extension of the natural tRNA primer, which results in a 257-nt cDNA product on the wild-type template, was abolished on the d1 and d1/2 templates (Fig. 3 A, lanes 9–12 and Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, reverse transcription on the d2 template was stimulated 6-fold over the wild-type level. These differences in tRNA-primed reverse transcription efficiency on the mutant templates could result from differences in tRNA annealing, initiation, or elongation. To study initiation of tRNA-primed reverse transcription, the reaction was performed in the presence of [32P]dCTP but without the other dNTPs. This will result in the extension of the 76-nt tRNA 3Lysprimer with 1 nt on all templates (Fig. 3 A, lanes 13–16). The results of this initiation assay are similar to the results of tRNA-primed full-length cDNA synthesis. No initiation was observed on the d1 and d1/2 templates, whereas a 6-fold stimulation was measured on the d2 template (Fig. 4 C). This indicates that the inhibitory effect of deletion d1 and the stimulatory effect of deletion d2 are apparent at the level of initiation. The observed differences in initiation efficiency may be caused by different amounts of tRNA primer annealed onto the PBS. This seems unlikely because the PBS motif itself is not altered in the mutant HIV-1 templates, and the primer was heat-annealed in these studies. To nevertheless rule out this possibility, we determined the tRNA occupancy of the PBS on the wild-type and mutant templates. The tRNA primer was annealed onto the template, and this complex was subsequently used for extension of the DNA primer AUG that is positioned downstream of the PBS (Fig. 1 A). We used the avian myeloblastosis virus RT enzyme to selectively extend the DNA primer because this enzyme is unable to extend the tRNA primer (6Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4130-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When the PBS was occupied by the tRNA primer, AUG-mediated reverse transcription was blocked by the tRNA, yielding a cDNA product of ∼175 nts. Free RNA templates will produce a full-length cDNA product of 374 nts on the wild-type template. All templates exclusively yield the stop product, indicating that the templates are fully occupied by the tRNA 3Lys primer (Fig.3 B, lanes 9–12). Control reactions were performed with the upstream poly(A) primer and the AUG primer in the absence of tRNA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–4 and5–8, respectively). The results of the PBS occupancy test are summarized in Fig. 4 D. These combined results indicate a complex interplay of positive and negative regulation of HIV-1 reverse transcription. The left side of the U5 leader stem seems to encode a sequence motif that is involved in initiation of reverse transcription. Deletion of the right side of the stem may expose this sequence motif, thereby activating reverse transcription. These effects are observed exclusively with the natural tRNA 3Lys primer and not with a PBS-bound DNA primer, suggesting that additional tRNA-vRNA contacts may be involved. The second set of stem mutants was designed to accurately map the sequence motifs that regulate HIV-1 reverse transcription. Reverse transcription assays were performed with these mutant templates and the tRNA 3Lys or Lys-21 DNA primer. All reverse transcription products were quantitated and corrected for the amount of input RNA template as determined by poly(A) primer extension (Fig. 5 A, polyA panel). The results of three independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 6. We measured no difference among the templates in reverse transcription reactions initiated by the DNA primer Lys-21, whereas profound differences in cDNA synthesis were observed in tRNA-primed reactions. Most severe effects were observed with mutations in stem segment 2. Mutants 2L and 2LR showed 10-fold reduced tRNA-primed reverse transcription compared with the wild-type template (Fig. 5 A, tRNA panel,lanes 4 and 6), whereas mutation 2R enhanced reverse transcription 2.5-fold (lane 5). Mutation 3R also stimulated reverse transcription (lane 8), and there is a modest 3-fold inhibitory effect on reverse transcription with the deletion mutants dL, dR, and dLR (lanes 10–12). Furthermore, the observed reverse transcription effects are specific for tRNA-primed reactions.Figure 6Relative reverse transcription activities of wild-type and mutant templates. The average of three independent experiments was calculated, and the activity of the wild-type template was set at 1. Shown is DNA-primed reverse transcription (A), tRNA-primed reverse transcription (B), tRNA-primed 1-nt incorporation (C), tRNA occupancy of the PBS (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These effects are apparent at the level of initiation as determined in the single nucleotide incorporation assay (Fig.5 A, tRNA 1nt panel). The PBS occupancy test demonstrated that the tRNA primer is annealed onto each template with equal efficiency (Fig. 5 B, tRNA/AUG panel). Thus, mutations in stem segment 2 affect reverse transcription in a similar way as the deletion mutants d1 and d2. Mutation of the left side of the stem inhibits reverse transcription, whereas mutation of the right side stimulates reverse transcription. These combined results suggest that the 2L sequence activates the PBS-bound tRNA molecule to initiate reverse transcription. We will therefore refer to this motif as the PAS. Mutation of the PAS in mutant 2L inhibits reverse transcription, whereas mutation 2R may stimulate initiation by making the PAS more accessible. Mutation 3R also stimulates reverse transcription, which may indicate that the opening of stem segment 3 weakens the stability of the adjacent stem segment 2. The results presented above suggest an important biological role for the U5 leader stem, in particular for stem segment 2. We therefore determined the secondary structure of the U5 leader stem by treating wild-type and mutant HIV-1 templates with structure-specific probes (Fig.7). Nucleotides sensitive to the chemicals DEPC or DMS and the RNases S1, T1, or One are assumed not to be involved in base pairing or base-stacking interactions. The sites of modification or cleavage were determined by primer extension analysis. Control experiments were performed in parallel to detect pauses of reverse transcription due to, for instance, stable RNA structure. The results of the probing experiments on the wild-type template are summarized in Fig. 8.Figure 8Modified RNA secondary structure model for the U5-PBS-leader region of HIV-1. Based on structure probing results, this region is folded into the U5 leader stem, the U5-top hairpin, and the single-stranded PBS region. The reactive sites for the individual structure-specific probes are indicated. The proposed base pairing interaction between the HIV-1 PAS element and anti-PAS in the TΨC arm of the tRNA 3Lys primer is marked in orange. The PBS-anti-PBS interaction is marked ingreen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Probing of the wild-type template with RNase T1 resulted in cleavage of G residues at positions 202, 206, and 208 (Fig. 7 A,lanes 1 and 2) that are single-stranded in the structure model of Fig. 1. However, the G residues that are proposed to be base-paired in stem 1 (G212–G214) are also sensitive to RNase T1, indicating that this part of the structure model is not correct. Probing of the wild-type template with the chemicals DEPC (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4 and 5) and DMS (Fig. 7 A, lanes 6 and 7) demonstrated that several A residues in the single-stranded PBS region are exposed. In addition, the A residues that are base-paired in stem 1 in Fig. 1(A209-A211) were highly sensitive to both chemicals. Treatment with RNase S1 and RNase One (Fig. 7 B) resulted in several cleavages in the single-stranded PBS region and the right arm of the U5 leader stem. RNase S1 also cleaves the U residues at position 153–156 that are proposed to be base-paired in stem 1 (Fig. 7 B,lanes 1 an"

These enzymes are transported to the vacuole via the secretory or the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt)1 pathway. On the other hand, their substrates to be degraded are delivered from outside of the cells and the plasma membrane through the endocytic pathway or from the cytoplasm by autophagy. Macroautophagy is a cellular mechanism for bulk degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic components, which may be important for cellular remodeling during development and differentiation (3Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Genetic and morphological studies revealed an interesting fact that the biosynthetic Cvt pathway shares the overlapping mechanistic features with autophagy despite the differences in their cellular functions (4Harding T.M.

Macroautophagy is a dynamic process involving changes in membrane topology. During the autophagic process, cytoplasmic components including macromolecules and organelles are enwrapped by an isolation membrane to form a double membrane-bound structure, termed the autophagosome. Subsequently, its outer membrane fuses to the membrane of the lysosome/vacuole to release a single membrane vesicle into the lumen. Finally, this single membrane structure, termed the autophagic body, is degraded in a protease-dependent manner (8Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 9Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J.

The process of autophagosome formation should require several events such as the supply of lipids or membranes to the site of formation and expansion of the isolation membrane. Many efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanism of autophagy. In those processes, a lot of proteins essential for autophagy, such as Apg, Aut, and Cvt proteins, have been identified and characterized (11Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We have isolated the APG genes and characterized their gene products, and most of the Apg proteins are now classified into several groups by their functions. The Apg1p kinase complex is comprised of Apg1p, Apg13p, and Apg17p, and the enhancement of its kinase activity is necessary for the induction of autophagy, which is controlled by Apg13p and Apg17p (12Kamada Y.

Apg6p/Vps30p and Apg14p are constituents of the autophagy-specific PI 3-kinase complex together with Vps34p and Vps15p (14Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The autophagy/Cvt pathway requires two ubiquitination-like systems. The first ubiquitin-like protein, Apg12p, is conjugated to Apg5p via Apg7p (E1) and Apg10p (E2), and the conjugation facilitates the binding of Apg5p to Apg16p (15Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Apg8p/Aut7p is the second ubiquitin-like protein of which the exposed C-terminal glycine is covalently attached to the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine. This process is catalyzed by the Apg4p/Aut2p protease, Apg7p (E1), and Apg3p/Aut1p (E2) (19Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). All these Apg proteins are suggested to function in autophagosome formation, and most of them are associated with certain membranes (13Scott S.V. Nice 3rd, D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It was also reported that Apg8p is a potential tracer of the autophagic process. Immuno-EM study revealed that Apg8p localizes to the autophagosomes, the autophagic bodies, and the isolation membranes near the vacuole (23Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that GFP-fused Apg8p/Aut7p localizes to the punctate structures proximal to the vacuole in addition to autophagic bodies (24Kim J. Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This punctate localization of GFP-Apg8p/Aut7p needs the Apg12p-Apg5p conjugation and Apg8p lipidation system, suggesting that the structure is physiologically important. As described above, in the past few years the molecular characterizations of Apg proteins have proceeded and allowed their classification into several functional groups. For the further understanding of the molecular mechanism of autophagy, it becomes important to elucidate how these proteins participate in autophagosome formation. However, the APG2 gene has not yet been identified and its identification is essential for an overall understanding of autophagy. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of Apg2p. By fluorescence microscopic analysis, Apg2p co-localizes with Apg8p to the dot structure close to the vacuole. Its localization is perturbed in some apg mutants and by its own point mutation. These suggest that the structure is crucial for autophagy. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cells are grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), synthetic complete (SC) medium containing nutritional supplements, or SCD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% casamino acid, and 2% glucose) supplemented with 0.002% adenine sulfate, 0.002% uracil, and 0.002% tryptophan if necessary. For nitrogen starvation, SD(-N) medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids and 2% glucose) was used. Standard genetic manipulations were performed as described by Adams et al. (25Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T.

(25Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). YTS19 cells were transformed with a YEp24-based yeast genomic library, spread and grown on SC-Ura plates at 30 °C for 3 days. About 60,000 transformants on 3 plates were collected and pooled as a frozen stock (∼1 ml). Ten microliters of the cell stock was spread on a YPD plate and incubated at 30 °C for 12 h. Then cells were collected from the plate, washed with sterile water three times, and resuspended in 2.5 ml of sporulation medium (1% potassium acetate, 0.025% glucose). After an 8-day incubation at 23 °C, sporulated culture was treated with 1 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku kogyo) at 30 °C for 1 h and sonicated moderately to kill non-spore cells and disrupt asci to scatter the spores. One-hundred microliters of the spore suspension was then spread onto SC-Ura plates and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. The red colonies derived from the ade2 ascospores were picked to exclude the surviving ADE2/ade2 diploid cells (white), and then checked their accumulation of autophagic bodies in SD(-N) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Plasmids were recovered from the positive clones and sequenced with the pBR322 oligonucleotides. Partial sequences were analyzed withSaccharomyces Genome Data base (genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/) and the plasmids were found to contain one ORF, YNL242w. The 5.8-kb SphI-KpnI fragment containing the entire YNL242w ORF was subcloned into pUC18 to generate pTS101. The 2.0-kb XbaI-PstILEU2 fragment from pJJ282 (27Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was ligated toXbaI-PstI digested pTS101 to generate pTS104. The 1.75-kb SmaI-HincII HIS3 fragment from pJJ215 (27Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was ligated to the NcoI-BamHI digested and blunted pTS101 to generate pTS105. The 4.4-kbSphI-KpnI fragment from pTS105 was used for transformation of KA311A and the 4.05-kbSphI-KpnI fragment from pTS104 was for transformation of YW5-1B and TN125. The disruption of theAPG2 gene was verified by PCR. The 5.8-kbSphI-KpnI fragment containing APG2gene was subcloned into YCplac33 and YEp352 to generate pTS102 and pTS103, respectively. The DNA fragments encoding GFP-tagged Apg2 proteins were constructed as follows. The 1.4-kbSphI-EcoRV fragment from pTS101 was subcloned into pUC18 to generate pTS108. The BamHI site was introduced just after the initiation codon of the APG2 gene on pTS108 using a QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-TTGATTTCGATACAATGGGATCCGCATTTTGGTTACCTCA-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTAACCAAAATGCGGATCCCATTGTATCGAAATCAA-3′, to generate pTS109. The DNA fragment encoding GFP (S65T) with BamHI site on both sites was then ligated to the BamHI site of pTS109 to generate pTS110. The 5.05-kb BglII-KpnI fragment from pTS101 was then ligated into the BglII-KpnI site of pTS110 to generate pTS111. Finally, pTS112 (GFP-APG2on YCplac33) was constructed by subcloning the 6.5-kbSphI-KpnI fragment of GFP-APG2 into YCplac33. pTS114 (YFP-APG2 on YCplac33) was constructed by the same procedure with GFP-APG2 using YFP fragments. For the construction of pTS119 (apg2-2 on YCplac33) and pTS120 (apg2-2 on YEp352), the 5.8-kbSphI-KpnI fragment containing theapg2-2 allele was amplified from MT82 genomic DNA by PCR and then cloned to YCplac33 and YEp352. The mutation site was verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis with primers 5′-CGGTGTGGAAATCGATGAGTCTGGTTTAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTAAACCAGACTCATCGATTTCCACACCG-3′ was used to change the glycine at position 83 in APG2 to a glutamate (QuikChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene) to generate pTS121 (GFP-apg2–2 CEN). Antibody to Apg2p was prepared against the recombinant protein corresponding to the 824–1952 amino acid residues of Apg2p (Apg2p-C). To construct the plasmid for bacterial expression of Apg2p-C, a DNA fragment encoding Apg2p-C was amplified by PCR using following primers: 5′-AGGCAGATCTTCTTTCAAAGGCGAATACAC-3′and 5′-GTCTGCAAAAATTTTTAAGATCTCGAATCAGTCCGATTGG-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with BglII and then ligated into theBamHI site of pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate pTS130. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pTS130 were grown up to A 600 = 0.5 and then incubated in Luria- Bertani medium containing 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for expression of Apg2p-C. Because the recombinant Apg2p-C was obtained as an inclusion body, it was purified by washing with 1% Triton X-100 and subsequent SDS-PAGE. The gel containing Apg2p-C was stained by 0.0025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and the protein band was excised, and eluted by soaking in Elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05% SDS) at 37 °C for 12 h. The concentration of the purified protein was estimated by a gel assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Standard procedure was used to generate antisera in female Japanese White rabbits. Antisera against aminopeptidase I (API) and Pep12p were provided by Dr. Klionsky (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Antibodies of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), carboxypeptidase Y, proteinase A, Kex2p, and Sec12p were prepared by our laboratory (28Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 29Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.P. Baba M. Tokunaga C. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in YPD and then incubated in SD(-N) for starvation conditions, and converted to spheroplasts as described previously (29Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.P. Baba M. Tokunaga C. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The spheroplasts were suspended in PSM200 buffer (20 mmPIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.2 m sorbitol, 5 mmMgCl2 and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) with or without 0.5% Triton X-100 at a density of 40 A 600/ml and lysed by extrusion through a polycarbonate filter with 3-µm diameter pores. The filter effluent was centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min to remove cell debris. For fractionation, small amounts of the supernatant were withdrawn as a total cell lysate (Total), and the remaining sample was then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to generate the supernatant (S5) and the pellet (P5) fractions. For the protection assay, the P5 fraction equivalent to 32A 600 cells was suspended in 400 µl of PSM200 buffer, and divided into four aliquots (100 µl). Each aliquot was diluted 2-fold in 100 µg/ml proteinase K, 100 µg/ml proteinase K plus 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Triton X-100, or distilled water. The samples were incubated for 30 min on ice, and then 200 µl of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate reactions. After centrifugation and two washes with cold acetone, the samples were dissolved in 200 µl of SDS loading buffer, and were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-API antibody. Yeast cells were grown in YPD or incubated in SD(-N), and then converted to spheroplasts. The spheroplasts were lysed in Lysis buffer (20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmPMSF, and 4 × protease inhibitor mixture) by extrusion through a polycarbonate filter with 3-µm diameter pores. After removing cell debris during a low-speed spin (500 × g) for 5 min, the supernatant (Total) was centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 15 min to separate into low-speed supernatant (LSS) and pellet (LSP) fractions. The LSS fraction was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain high-speed supernatant (HSS) and pellet (HSP) fractions. The total membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation of cell lysate at 100,000 × g for 30 min. This fraction (1 ml) was layered onto an Optiprep (NYCOMED PHARMA AS, Oslo, Norway) step gradient in Lysis buffer (0.5 ml of 50%, 1 ml of 40%, 1 ml of 30%, 1.5 ml of 25%, 2 ml of 20%, 2 ml of 15%, and 1.5 ml of 10% w/v Optiprep) and centrifuged at 174,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a PS40T rotor (Hitachi). Fourteen fractions were collected from the top of gradient and examined by immunoblot analysis. The total membrane fraction was suspended in lysis buffer and treated with 2% Triton X-100 (in Lysis buffer), 1 m NaCl (in Lysis buffer), 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5 in distilled water), 6 m urea (in Lysis buffer), or control Lysis buffer for 20 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to separate into the supernatant and pellet fractions. The fractions were probed by immunoblot analysis with anti-Apg2p, anti-ALP, and anti-Kex2p antibodies. Fluorescence microscopic analysis was performed with a DeltaVision microscope system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). The cells expressing the fluorescent protein-fused Apg2p or Apg8p were grown to midlog phase in SCD medium, and then observed as growing cells. For induction of autophagy, cells were further treated with 0.2 µg/ml rapamycin in SCD medium at 30 °C. For FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) staining, cells were labeled in SCD medium containing 0.5 µg/ml FM4-64 at 30 °C for 15 min. After washing with medium, cells were incubated in the medium at 30 °C for 30 min and subjected to microscopic analysis. For measurement of autophagic activity, the ALP assay was performed as described previously (30Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (17Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We isolated and characterized anapg2-1 mutant (31Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells accumulated autophagic bodies in their vacuoles in a nitrogen-starvation medium containing 1 mm PMSF, while not in the apg2-1 mutant cells (Fig. 1 A). The mutation severely caused loss of viability under starvation conditions (Fig.1 C). Precursor aminopeptidase I (proAPI) is transported to the vacuole by the Cvt pathway and processed to a mature form in aPEP4-dependent manner (7Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The apg2-1mutant strain also showed the defect in API maturation in both rich and starvation media, whereas the maturation of other vacuolar enzymes, carboxypeptidase Y and proteinase A, was normal (Fig. 1 B), indicating that Apg2p functions in the Cvt pathway but not in the Vps pathway. All of apg mutants show a defect in sporulation (31Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). We used this phenotype for cloning of the APG2 gene. YEp24-based yeast genomic library was introduced into theapg2-1/apg2-1 diploid strain (ADE2/ade2) and the transformants were subjected to sporulation conditions. After a procedure that kills non-spore cells, the spores were grown on SC-Ura plates. The ade2 ascospores show red pigment, so that they can be distinguished from the white colonies including theADE2/ade2 or ADE2 cells. Therefore, the red colonies were picked to exclude the surviving diploid cells from the screening. More than 500 red colonies were obtained and 16 clones of them were checked for restoration of autophagy. Twelve clones accumulated autophagic bodies in their vacuoles in SD(-N) containing 1 mm PMSF. Finally, two kinds of plasmids were yielded from those clones, containing 8.6- and 8.5-kb genomic fragments, respectively. Sequencing and data base analyses revealed that both DNA fragments contained only one entire ORF, YNL242w. It was reported that a Δynl242w/Δynl242w homozygous diploid cell was unable to sporulate (32Saiz J.E. Santos M.A. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Revuelta J.L. Yeast. 1999; 15: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), corresponding with our observation for the apg2-1 mutant. The 5.8-kbSphI-KpnI fragment containing the entire ORF was subcloned to YCplac33 and introduced into the apg2-1 cell. A single copy of YNL242w was sufficient to complement the mutation (Fig.1). Next, to determine whether YNL242w was the authentic APG2gene, this ORF was disrupted by replacing with a LEU2 orHIS3 gene. The disruptants exhibited the same phenotypes as the apg2-1 mutant for autophagy, activation of proAPI, and viability under starvation conditions (Fig. 1). A diploid cell obtained by crossing apg2-1 and Δynl242wcells was also defective in autophagy (data not shown). We, therefore, concluded that YNL242w is the authentic APG2 gene. APG2 is a novel gene and encodes a hydrophilic protein of 1,592 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 178 kDa. The amino acid sequence of Apg2p provided no insight into its function. A BLAST search identified proteins closely related to Apg2p in human (KIAA0404), Drosophila melanogaster (CG1241),Caenorhabditis elegans (M03A8.2), andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (SPBC31E1.01c). Their functions are not characterized yet, but are expected to be involved in autophagy, as is the case with Apg8p and Apg12p (33Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5395) Google Scholar, 34Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). We generated polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal half of Apg2 protein produced bacterially. As shown in Fig.2 A, the affinity-purified anti-Apg2p antibody specifically recognized a 180-kDa protein in crude yeast extracts, which corresponds well to the predicted molecular mass of Apg2p. This band was not detected in the strain deleted forAPG2, and therefore represents Apg2p. The expression level of Apg2p was unaffected by starvation or treatment with the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of Tor, which mimics starvation and induces autophagy (data not shown), indicating that Apg2p was constitutively expressed in both growing and starvation conditions. Using this antibody for immunoblot analysis, we surveyed the expression of Apg2 protein in the original 13 apg2 mutants. Among them, only one strain, apg2-2 mutant, expressed Apg2p with full size. Sequence analysis revealed that apg2-2 contains a single amino acid change from glycine to glutamate at the 83rd amino acid of Apg2p. We cloned the mutant APG2 gene,apg2-2, and introduced it into theΔapg2 strain. The Δapg2strain showed a complete defect in API transport under both growing and starvation conditions. Single copy apg2-2 did not complement the defect under growing conditions, however, under starvation conditions proAPI was partially matured (Fig. 2 C, column 3). This partial maturation was much enhanced when apg2-2 was expressed via a multicopy plasmid (Fig. 2, column 5). Thus, the mutation does not cause complete loss of Apg2p function. Autophagic activities can be measured by monitoring autophagy-dependent processing of the cytosolic form o"

The α subunit of HIF-1 was found to be frequently overexpressed in advanced tumors, which was proposed to help the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxia. Here we show that an important tumor suppressor protein, p14ARF(alternative reading frame product of the INK4A locus) can directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 by sequestering its α subunit into the nucleolus. The interaction requires neither p53 nor HDM2. This is one of the first reports that describe the interaction of p14ARF with a protein besides HDM2, which may define a p53-independent tumor suppressor activity for p14ARF.

Elevated expression of the hypoxia-responsive proangiogenic factors and glycolytic enzymes contributes to the manifestation of the “lethal cancer phenotype” (1Semenza G.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 71-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric HIF-11transcription factor is the major regulator of many genes that are activated under low oxygen concentration. It has been reported that HIF-1α is the hypoxia-responsive component of the dimer, while HIF-1β is expressed constitutively (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is accumulated in hypoxic cells, which is mainly due to its increased resistance to proteasomal degradation (3Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 4Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Additionally, an increase of the transactivation potential of HIF-1α, which may be related to its phosphorylation status, has been reported (5Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can also result in changes in the expression and/or activity of HIF-1α (6Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Yeh P. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3436-3440PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar, 8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S.

Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most frequently mutated tumor suppressor protein, p53, can also negatively affect the activity of HIF-1. According to an earlier report, the ability of p53 to inhibit HIF-1 is based on a competition between the two transcription factors for the p300/CBP transcriptional co-activator (11Blagosklonny M.V. An W.G. Romanova L.Y. Trepel J. Fojo T. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11995-11998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that p53 can also affect the stability of HIF-1α through the regulation of the HDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2 in mouse) (10Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of HDM2 is activated by p53, which in turn inhibits p53, creating a negative feedback loop that is mainly responsible for the low p53 activity in normal nonstressed cells (12Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). HDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that inactivates p53 primarily by accelerating its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (13Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). HDM2 can also form a ternary complex with HIF-1α and p53 (10Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that in this complex HDM2 preferentially promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of HIF-1α. This model may explain the observed shorter half-life of HIF-1α in cells expressing wild-type p53 compared with those in which p53 activity is compromised. The p14ARF tumor suppressor protein (p19ARF in mouse) has recently been recognized as an important negative regulator of HDM2 (14Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). p14ARF can strongly bind HDM2 and facilitates its translocation from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus (15Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 16Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The nucleolar sequestration is suggested to prevent HDM2 from promoting the degradation of p53, resulting in elevated p53 activity. In this study, we examined whether the inhibition of HDM2 by p14ARF can also have a positive effect on HIF-1 activity. Surprisingly, we found that HIF-1, unlike p53, was strongly inhibited by p14ARF. The inhibition is at least partially p53-independent and strongly correlates with the ability of p14ARF to bind HIF-1α. The interaction does not require HDM2 or p53 and induces nucleolar relocalization of HIF-1α. Although several reports have suggested that the p14ARF/p19ARF tumor suppressor may have p53-independent functions (17Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), only a very recent study identified several members of the E2F family of transcription factors as binding partners for p19ARF (19Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A. Livingston D.M. Grossman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our data extend these findings by showing that the human p14ARF protein is capable of interacting with the α subunit of the HIF-1 transcription factor, which may also contribute to some of the p53-independent tumor suppressor activities of the protein. U-2OS cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. The Hep3B and HT1080 cell lines were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 or 15% fetal bovine serum, respectively. The p53−/−, MDM2−/−mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the media and the fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with Cytofectene (Bio-Rad), while the rest of the cell lines were transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. For transient transfection assays, cells were seeded in 24-well microtiter plates 1 day before the transfection. Generally, 500 ng of DNA/well was used including 25 ng of reporter plasmid and 125 ng of expression construct. The total amount of DNA was brought up to 500 ng using the “empty” expression vector. Endogenous HIF-1α protein was induced in cells by the addition of 125 µm of desferrioxamine for 16–20 h. Hypoxia treatments were performed in a hypoxic chamber (<0.2% O2; Sheldon Corp.). β-galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities were measured using chemiluminescent β-galactosidase and luciferase assay kits from Roche Biochemicals. All of the transfections were performed in triplicate. For Western blot analysis, cells were plated in 100-mm dishes, and the transfections were carried out with 5, 10, or 15 µg of DNA. For cell cycle analysis, cells growing in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2.5 µg of ARF expression construct and 2.5 µg of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression vector. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 5 min followed by a 5-min postfixation in 70% ethanol. Before analysis, the cells were treated with RNaseA (100 µg/ml) and stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml). The cell cycle profiles were analyzed on a FACScaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The p14ARF cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA prepared from Hep3B cells. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using a kit from Roche Biochemicals. After the cDNA synthesis, the p14ARF cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-AGGCGGCGGACTCATGGTGCGCAGGTT-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCTCAGCCAGGCCACG-3′. The p14ARF cDNA was cloned into pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen), and its sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The FLAG-tagged full-length and deleted versions of p14ARF were constructed in the same expression vector by PCR using appropriate primers. A pIND vector (Invitrogen) containing the full-length HIF-1α cDNA was obtained from N. Denko (Stanford University). The cDNA was cut out from the plasmid withKpnI and NotI restriction enzymes and cloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen). An HA tag was fused to the C-terminal end of the cDNA by PCR. The hypoxia-responsive reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting four tandem copies of a 54-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the human vascular endothelial growth factor HRE into the NheI site of pGL2 promoter (Promega). In the resulting plasmid, the luciferase gene was replaced with a 3.7-kilobase pair HindIII-BamHI fragment of pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene. Finally, to reduce the background activity of the reporter, the 0.4-kilobase pairBglII-HindIII fragment containing the minimal SV40 promoter was removed from the plasmid. To construct a p53-responsive reporter plasmid, 10 copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus p53 binding site (5′-GGCCAGGCAAGTCCAGGCA-3′) were inserted into theSmaI site of the pGL2 promoter vector in a tandem manner. To obtain the HIF-1α-EGFP fusion constructs, different segments of the HIF-1α coding region were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCruzHA expression vectors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The EGFP open reading frame was amplified by PCR using pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) as a template and cloned into the above mentioned plasmids in frame with the HIF-1α fragments. The HIF-1α-DsRed-1 fusion gene was constructed by inserting the HIF-1α open reading frame as a 2.6-kilobase pairKpnI-HpaI fragment into the pDsRed1-N1 expression vector (CLONTECH). To obtain in frame fusion, pDsRed1-N1 was digested with BamHI and KpnI restriction enzymes, and prior to the ligation the BamHI end was repaired with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase I. The plasmid sequences were verified by sequencing. Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Na3VO4. The lysis buffer was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) before use. The cell suspension was sonicated with a cell disruptor (Heat Systems Ultrasonics Inc.) on ice (three cycles, 10 s each, setting 3). After sonication, the extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants were transferred into clean tubes, and the protein concentration was determined with the Dc Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). The proteins were resolved on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The transfer and the subsequent processing of the membrane were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detection, the ECL system was used from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Immunoprecipitation was carried out from 300–500 µg of cell extract. The volume of the cell extract was brought up to 250 µl with lysis buffer. Next, 250 µl of dilution buffer (same as the lysis buffer with the exception that it contained no NaCl and the glycerol concentration was increased to 20%) and 1 µg of the appropriate antibody was added to the extracts and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a shaking platform. The following morning, 20 µl of protein A-Sepharose slurry was added to the tubes, and the incubation was continued for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed in three consecutive steps with the following buffers: 1) NET-gel buffer (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 500 mmof NaCl; 2) NET-gel buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS; and 3) 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The washed Sepharose beads were resuspended in 20 µl of 2× sample buffer (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. In this study, the following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), polyclonal anti-HA.11 antibody (Babco), monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody clone H1α67 (Novus Biologicals), polyclonal anti-p14ARF antibody FL-132 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-p14ARF antibody (Abcam), polyclonal anti-GFP antibody FL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-p21Cip1/WAF1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), monoclonal anti-p53 antibody PAb1801 (NeoMarkers), and monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibody MS-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells growing on coverslips were transfected with the appropriate expression vectors. Twenty-four to thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. For the anti-nucleolin staining, the cells were fixed with cold methanol for 5 min. To block the nonspecific antibody binding, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.5% bovine serum albumin dissolved in T-TBS (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) (0.1% Tween 20). The coverslips were successively incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h each. The antibodies were diluted in T-TBS. The coverslips were extensively washed with T-TBS and mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The Cy3- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The slides were examined by an Axioplan Fluorescent Microscope (Zeiss). To monitor HIF-1 activity in cells, a reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting four tandem copies of the 54-base pair hypoxia response element from the human vascular endothelial growth factor gene promoter upstream of the bacterial β-galactosidase gene. The reporter construct was highly responsive to hypoxia and HIF-1α overexpression. In addition, the plasmid could also be induced by CoCl2 and desferrioxamine treatments, which were both shown to be able to cause the stabilization of the HIF-1α protein similarly to hypoxia (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). Forced expression of the p14ARF tumor suppressor protein drastically inhibited the HIF-1-dependent activity of the reporter in the human osteosarcoma cell line U-2OS, without affecting the desferrioxamine-induced expression of HIF-1α. (Figs.1b and 3b). A similar inhibition was exhibited by p14ARF in experiments where the HIF-1-responsive reporter plasmid was activated by either hypoxia (Fig. 1 a) or forced expression of HIF-1α (Fig.2b). As expected, p14ARF expression elevated both the protein level of p53 (Fig. 2 a) and its transcriptional activity as judged by the increased expression of the p53 target gene, p21Cip1/WAF1(Fig. 2 a) and the elevated activity of a reporter plasmid containing concatamerized p53 binding sites in front of the firefly luciferase gene (Fig. 2 b). This observation raised the possibility that the decreased HIF-1 activity was due to the activation of p53. To prevent p53 activation, p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 or HDM2, were co-expressed with p14ARF in U-2OS cells. Although both proteins could efficiently prevent the activation of p53, they were unable to restore HIF-1 activity. Importantly, forced expression of neither HPV E6 nor HDM2 alone had any significant effect on HIF-1 activity (Fig.2 b). These data combined with the observation that p14ARF could also strongly inhibit the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 in the p53 null Hep3B cell line suggest that the inhibition is at least partially p53-independent (Fig. 1 b). HIF-1 activity in the presence of p14ARF was 3–10% of control in Hep3B cells, while it was less than 1% in U-2OS cells, indicating that, in agreement with previous reports, p53 could also contribute to the inhibition of HIF-1 (11Blagosklonny M.V.

Immunoprecipitations (IP) were carried out from 300 µg of total cell extracts, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting (WB).

U-2OS cells were transfected with the indicated ARF expression constructs (a). The expression of the ARF polypeptides was demonstrated by Western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody (top panel). The induction of the endogenous p53 and p21Cip1/WAF1 proteins was also followed by Western blotting (middle and bottom panels).

Transient transfection assays were carried out in U-2OS cells (b). The expression vectors were transfected into the cells in the combinations indicated. Both a β-galactosidase gene containing HIF-1-responsive reporter vector and a luciferase gene containing p53-responsive reporter plasmid were introduced into the cells. HIF-1 and p53 activities were simultaneously monitored by measuring β-galactosidase and luciferase activities in the same cell extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the inhibitory domain within p14ARF, deletion mutants of the ARF cDNA were constructed, and their ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 was tested in transient transfection assays. The N-terminal 64-aa fragment of p14ARF inhibited HIF-1 to a similar extent as the full-length protein, while the C-terminal 68-aa region did not exhibit significant inhibitory activity (Fig. 1 b). Western blot analysis indicated that the different polypeptides were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 2 a). It has been reported before that forced expression of p14ARF can arrest U-2OS cells at both G1 and G2 phases (20Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the inhibition of HIF-1 activity was due to a nonspecific effect of the cell cycle arrest, cell cycle profiles of U-2OS cells transfected either with the full-length or the deleted p14ARFexpression constructs were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. As expected, full-length p14ARF induced G1 and G2 arrest; however, the cell cycle distribution of cells expressing either the N-terminal or the C-terminal fragment of p14ARF did not change significantly compared with control cells that were transfected with the “empty” expression vector (Fig. 1 c). Since the N-terminal fragment of p14ARF inhibited HIF-1 almost as efficiently as the full-length protein, it is unlikely that the inhibition is a result of cell cycle arrest. Additionally, since the forced expression of p14ARF did not considerably affect the activities of reporter constructs driven by either the SV40 early promoter or the cytomegalovirus early promoter, we can rule out the possibility that the p14ARF-induced reduction of HIF-1 activity is a result of a nonspecific inhibition of the general transcription apparatus (Fig. 1 d). FLAG-tagged full-length or terminally deleted derivatives of p14ARF were separately co-expressed with HA-tagged HIF-1α in U-2OS cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed with anti-HIF-1α or anti-FLAG antibodies. p14ARF and HIF-1α were efficiently co-precipitated, indicating that the two proteins are capable of forming a strong complex in vivo (Fig.3 a). The results also clearly show that the N-terminal 64-aa fragment of p14ARF encoded by the first exon was necessary and sufficient for the interaction with HIF-1α. These data are also consistent with the results of the transient transfection assays, where the N-terminal fragment of p14ARF strongly inhibited HIF-1, while the C-terminal fragment, which was unable to bind to HIF-1α, had no significant effect on HIF-1-mediated transcription. The same interaction pattern was also seen between the desferrioxamine-induced endogenous HIF-1α protein and the overexpressed p14ARF polypeptides (Fig.3 b). Importantly, in the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, which expresses easily detectable amounts of endogenous p14ARF and HIF-1α, the interaction could also be confirmed (Fig. 3 c). Previously, it has been reported that the MDM2 oncoprotein can physically interact with both p14ARF and HIF-1α. To examine the possibility that the HIF-1α-p14ARFinteraction is mediated by MDM2, immunoprecipitations were carried out from cell extracts prepared from MDM2−/−, p53−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts that were transiently transfected with p14ARF and HIF-1α expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 3 d, HIF-1α was efficiently co-precipitated with p14ARF, indicating that the interaction between the two proteins did not require the presence of either MDM2 or p53. Since it was described before that the nucleolar p14ARF/p19ARF protein was capable of sequestering HDM2/MDM2 into the nucleolus, we examined whether p14ARF could change the subcellular localization of HIF-1α in a similar manner. The localization of HIF-1α was followed by fusing the DsRed1 fluorescent protein in frame to the HIF-1α cDNA. When the HIF-1α-DsRed1 fusion protein was expressed alone in U-2OS cells, it was localized to the nucleus but was mostly excluded from the nucleoli. Co-expression of p14ARF induced nucleolar accumulation of the fusion protein (Fig.4a). This result was also confirmed in experiments where the localization of overexpressed HIF-1α was followed by indirect immunofluorescence. The identity of the nuclear structures occupied by the p14ARF-HIF-1α complexes was verified by staining with anti-nucleolin antibodies (Fig.4 b). To determine which region of HIF-1α is responsible for the p14ARF-induced nucleolar relocalization, different fragments of HIF-1α were fused to EGFP. The fusion proteins were expressed in U-2OS cells either alone or in combination with p14ARF. As seen in Fig. 5, co-expression of p14ARF could only change the subcellular localization of the fusion protein that contained the N-terminal 199-aa segment of HIF-1α (1–199HIF-1α-EGFP). In the absence of p14ARF, this protein exhibited a slight nuclear accumulation; however, co-expression of p14ARF induced its almost complete relocalization to the nucleoli. We could also show that the N-terminal 64-aa fragment of p14ARF was necessary and sufficient to induce the nucleolar accumulation of 1–199HIF-1α-EGFP. On the contrary, the C-terminal 68-aa fragment of p14ARFwas unable to do so despite the fact that this polypeptide could also localize to the nucleoli (although less efficiently than the full-length protein) (Fig. 6).Figure 6The N-terminal 64-aa fragment of p14ARF is necessary and sufficient to induce the nucleolar accumulation of 1–199HIF-1α-EGFP. The subcellular localization of the EGFP fusion protein containing the N-terminal 199-aa segment of HIF-1α (1–199HIF-1α-EGFP) was analyzed in U-2OS cells expressing the full-length or the deleted p14ARF polypeptides. The 1–199HIF-1α-EGFP fusion protein was localized based on the EGFP fluorescence (green). The FLAG-tagged ARF constructs were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence (primary antibody: monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma); secondary antibody: Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories)) (red). The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The p14ARF binding sites of HIF-1α were mapped by using immunoprecipitation. Fragments of HIF-1α covering the entire protein were fused in frame to EGFP, and the resulting fusion proteins were separately co-expressed with FLAG-tagged p14ARF in Hep3B cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-GFP antibodies, and the presence of p14ARF in the precipitated material was analyzed with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig.7). p14ARF bound strongly to the 463–652 segment of HIF-1α. This fragment covers almost the entire proline-serine-threonine-rich protein stability domain (PSTD), which was previously suggested to play an important role in the regulation of HIF-1α (4Huang L.E.

A. 2000; 97: 4748-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Weaker binding of p14ARF to the 1–199 and 200–462 segments of HIF-1α could also be seen. These data combined with the results of the cellular localization studies suggest that the N-terminal 199-aa fragment of HIF-1α may contain a cryptic nucleolar localization signal, which is activated by p14ARF, resulting in nucleolar sequestration of the polypeptide. Although the PSTD exhibits higher affinity toward p14ARF, it does not translocate efficiently to the nucleoli, probably as a result of the absence of a nucleolar localization signal of its own. A similar mechanism for the p14ARF/p19ARF-induced nucleolar sequestration of HDM2/MDM2 has been proposed recently (16Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). During the growth of solid tumors, a strong selective pressure is imposed on the tumor cells to undergo both metabolic and genetic alterations, which help their survival under the adverse environmental conditions accompanying the unregulated expansion of the tumor mass. Increasing numbers of observations suggest that mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, besides altering the cell cycle and/or apoptotic properties of tumor cells, may also have an impact on their general metabolism (24Dang C.V. Semenza G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 68-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric HIF-1 transcription factor appears to play a central role in this adaptation process. HIF-1 was identified as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of many genes involved in the organism's responses to reduced availability of oxygen under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Activated oncogenes (e.g. v-src, Ha-ras, and K-ras) have been reported to be capable of inducing HIF-1 by increasing the stability and/or activity of HIF-1α. On the contrary, overexpression of tumor suppressors (e.g. PTEN (phosphatase andtensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein, and p53) has been shown to attenuate the hypoxia-mediated stabilization of this protein. Here we demonstrate that the p14ARF tumor suppressor protein can also affect HIF-1-mediated transcription. p14ARF/p19ARF is an alternative product of the INK4A locus and is a component of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway (25Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Since its expression is induced by several oncogenes (c-myc, E1A, ras, v-abl,E2F-1), it has been suggested that its function is to protect the cells from excessive mitogenic signaling (26Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). p14ARF/p19ARF can directly bind to HDM2/MDM2, which induces the nucleolar sequestration of the complex. In vitro, p19ARF was also capable of directly inhibiting HDM2's ability to ubiquitinate p53 (27Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). According to a recent report, HDM2 can also accelerate the degradation of HIF-1α supposedly by promoting its ubiquitination (10Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, one would assume that the inhibition of HDM2 by p14ARF may result in increased activity of the HIF-1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, we found that p14ARF strongly inhibited HIF-1-mediated transcription, which most likely ensued from its ability to bind HIF-1α. Interaction could be detected between the endogenous proteins, and it did not require the presence of either HDM2 or p53. Importantly, in our experimental system, p14ARF could not decrease the stability of the endogenous HIF-1α protein. These observations suggest that the inhibition of HIF-1 by p14ARFis mechanistically different from the HDM2-mediated inhibition reported previously. In cellular localization studies, we demonstrated that p14ARF induced the nucleolar sequestration of HIF-1α. Of note, it was reported that in the human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, the endogenous HIF-1α protein was accumulated in the nucleoli (28Zhong H. Agani F. Baccala A.A. Laughner E. Rioseco-Camacho N. Isaacs W.B. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5280-5284PubMed Google Scholar). Based on immunocytochemical staining, p14ARF is expressed at high levels in PC-3 cells and predominantly localized to the nucleoli, 2K. Fatyol and A. A. Szalay, unpublished data. lending further support to the suggestion that the p14ARF-HIF-1α interaction can take place under physiological conditions. p14ARF represses HIF-1 transcriptional activity, most likely by inducing the translocation of HIF-1α into the nucleolus. The nucleolar sequestration may prevent HIF-1α from reaching its targets and/or interacting partners needed for the hypoxia-responsive transcription. Recently, it has been proposed that nucleolar sequestration represents a novel regulatory mechanism, by which the activities of several cell cycle-regulatory proteins are inhibited (29Visintin R. Amon A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our data, combined with a recent observation that the E2F family of transcription factors can also be sequestered into the nucleoli through binding to p19ARF (19Martelli F. Hamilton T. Silver D.P. Sharpless N.E. Bardeesy N. Rokas M. DePinho R.A. Livingston D.M. Grossman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), extend this hypothesis and suggest that not only cell cycle regulatory proteins but transcription factors may also be controlled by nucleolar sequestration. It is conceivable that the p14ARF/p19ARF protein plays a important role in this process, probably by acting as an adapter molecule for a nucleolar transport mechanism. Since the half-life of HIF-1α in normoxia is very short (t 12 ∼5 min), one may hypothesize that the regulation of HIF-1 activity by p14ARF would become important under conditions where HIF-1 is constitutively active. This is the situation in high grade tumors, where the expression of HIF-1α can be detected even in normoxia, partly as a result of the stabilizing effects of the oncogenic mutations discussed above (28Zhong H. Agani F. Baccala A.A. Laughner E. Rioseco-Camacho N. Isaacs W.B. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5280-5284PubMed Google Scholar, 30Zhong H. De Marzo A.M. Laughner E. Lim M. Hilton D.A. Zagzag D. Buechler P. Isaacs W.B. Semenza G.L. Simons J.W. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5830-5835PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these mutations can cooperatively result in the constitutive activation of the ras signaling pathway, which has been reported to increase the activity of not only HIF-1 but the expression of p14ARF as well (31Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Since the increased expression of HIF-1-activated proangiogenic factors (especially vascular endothelial growth factor), glycolytic enzymes, etc. confers significant selective advantage to tumor cells, it is conceivable that in this setting the inhibition of HIF-1 by p14ARF may act as a potent tumor suppressor mechanism. Interestingly, in the highly vascularized aggressive glioblastoma multiforme, p14ARF was found to be one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes (32Ishii N. Maier D. Merlo A. Tada M. Sawamura Y. Diserens A.C. Van Meir E.G. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for this is that the mutation of p14ARF at least partially inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. However, since the inactivation of p53 itself would be even more advantageous, we can hypothesize that p14ARF may indeed have p53-independent effects in these cells, one of which may be the direct inhibition of HIF-1 by p14ARF described here. Inhibition of the HIF-1-regulated transcriptional program has been identified as a promising therapeutic strategy in tumor cells (33Brown J.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 157-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). One possible way to achieve this goal is to prevent the interaction between HIF-1α and the p300 transcriptional co-activator. Based on this premise, polypeptides derived from the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α were used successfully to inhibit HIF-1-mediated transcription (34Kung A.L. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This strategy, however, may have inherent limitations. Since the p300 co-activator is required for the activity of a large number of transcription factors, the interference with p300 function may result in unintended side effects. For example, the CH1 domain of p300, which is required for HIF-1α binding, can also interact with p53. Therefore, the blocking of the CH1 domain with the use of competitive polypeptides may also inhibit p53 activity, which is obviously undesirable in tumor cells. Our results presented here suggest an alternative way to selectively inhibit HIF-1 activity. By understanding the details of the HIF-1α-p14ARFinteraction, one may be able to design polypeptides or small molecules, which can inhibit HIF-1 activity with high specificity.

To understand the growth-inhibitory mechanisms of FGF, we analyzed the effects of FGF2 on cell cycle-regulating molecules in chondrocytes. FGF2 dramatically inhibited proliferation of rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells and arrested their cell cycle at the G1 phase. FGF2 increased p21 expression in RCS cells, which assembled with the cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, although the expression of neither cyclin E nor Cdk2 increased. In addition, the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated cyclin E or Cdk2, assessed with retinoblastoma protein (pRb) as substrate, was dramatically reduced by FGF-2. Moreover, FGF2 shifted pRb to its underphosphorylated, active form in RCS cells. FGF2 not only induced p21 protein expression in proliferating chondrocytes in mouse fetal limbs cultured in vitro but also decreased their proliferation as assessed by the expression of histone H4 mRNA, a marker for cells in S phase. Furthermore, inhibitory effects of FGF2 on chondrocytic proliferation were partially reduced in p21-null limbs, compared with those in wild-type limbs in vitro. Taken together, FGF's growth inhibitory effects of chondrocytes appear to be mediated at least partially through p21 induction and the subsequent inactivation of cyclin E-Cdk2 and activation of pRb.

They play important roles in regulating proliferation and differentiation of various types of cells, including those involved in limb development and long bone formation (1Szebenyi G. Fallon J.F.

Long bones form by endochondral ossification, which is characterized by mesenchymal condensation, chondrogenic differentiation, chondrocytic proliferation, synthesis of cartilage matrix, hypertrophic differentiation, and replacement by bone. These sequential growth and differentiation processes are regulated by numerous growth factors and their receptors, such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, Indian hedgehog, and insulin-like growth factor-I (3Karp S.J.

Moreover, targeted overexpression of FGF9 in cartilage results in dwarfism in mice similar to the dwarfism in achondroplasia (14Garofalo S. Kliger-Spatz M. Cooke J.L. Wolstin O. Lunstrum G.P.

Although these findings support the hypothesis that FGF and its receptors are negative regulators of endochondral bone development, little is known about the mechanisms by which FGF inhibits chondrocytic growth. Sahni et al. recently reported that FGF inhibited chondrocytic growth through activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway and suggested that p21 might be a factor responsible for inhibiting chondrocytic proliferation (15Sahni M. Ambrosetti D.C. Mansukhani A. Gertner R. Levy D. Basilico C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression is known to be governed by the assembly of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors (CKIs) and subsequent regulation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) activity. In the early G1 phase of the cell cycle, for example, cyclin D-Cdk4 phosphorylates pRb, and in the late G1 phase cyclin E-Cdk2/cyclin D-Cdk4 phosphorylates pRb. Hyperphosphorylated pRb then releases E2F family transcription factors, which activate genes that are necessary for S phase entry (16Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). The CKI p21cip1, waf-1 belongs to a Cip/Kip family with p27kip1 and p57kip2 and broadly inhibits the activity of cyclin D-, E-, and A-dependent kinases (17Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5071) Google Scholar, 18Vidal A. Koff A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, the second class of CKIs (i.e. Ink4 (inhibitors for Cdk4) proteins (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d), bind to and inactivate only Cdk4 and Cdk6 but not other CDKs or D-type cyclins (17Sherr C.J.

Science. 1995; 267: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), and activation of STAT1 and increased expression of p21 in cartilage have been demonstrated in thanatophoric dysplasia human embryos (20Su W.C.

Based on these data, p21 has been suggested to be involved in FGF's growth inhibition of cartilage. Interestingly, in some breast cancer cells, FGF has been shown to inhibit their proliferation through activation of STAT1 and induction of p21 expression (21Wang H. Rubin M. Fenig E. DeBlasio A.

In this study, we first examine the effects of FGF2 on cell cycle progression and p21 expression in rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cells, whose proliferation is potently inhibited by FGF2. Second, we analyze how p21 induction by FGF2 leads to cell cycle arrest in RCS cells by examining the binding of FGF2-induced p21 to cyclins and CDKs as well as by assessing the changes in CDK- and cyclin-dependent kinase activities after FGF2 treatment. Finally, we examine the functional involvement of p21 in FGF's growth inhibition by comparing the effects of FGF2 on cartilaginous growth in vitro in limbs isolated from p21-deficient and wild-type mice. RCS cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (23Mukhopadhyay K.

Cells were passaged using trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) and were split at a 1:15 ratio on a 100-mm dish (Falcon; Becton and Dickinson). Cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay as well as by measuring DNA contents. RCS cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/24-well plate (Falcon), and growing cells (70% confluent) were treated with vehicle (0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline) or the indicated dose of FGF2 (R&D Systems) for 24 h. Cells were labeled with 0.5 µCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 2 h of culture and dissolved with 0.1 n NaOH, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Samples were mixed with the same volume of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. After washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid, pellets were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, 1% Triton X-100, and their radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter (Beckman). DNA content was measured by a fluorometric method. Briefly, RCS cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/24-well plate and treated with vehicle or indicated doses of FGF2. Cells were digested with 20 µg/ml of papain (Sigma) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 50 mm EDTA, 10 mm cysteine-HCl (pH 5.53) at 55 °C for 16 h. The DNA content in digested lysates were measured using PicoGreen DNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). RCS cells were plated at a density of 8 × 105 cells/60-mm culture dishes, and subconfluent cells were treated with 3 nm of FGF2 for 6, 12, and 24 h. Cells were then trypsinized, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml; Sigma), RNase A (200 µg/ml; Sigma), 0.1% glucose in phosphate-buffered saline for 4 h at room temperature. Samples were analyzed on an Epics Alta flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). For Western blotting, cells were lysed in 2× SDS buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS containing phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma), 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 132 µg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). Protein concentration of the lysates was determined using protein assay kit DC (Bio-Rad). Samples were then diluted by adding the same volume of 2× dye containing 20% glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and equal amounts of protein were resolved on 6.5% SDS gel for pRb or 12.5% gel for all other proteins. Proteins were then transferred onto ImmobilonTM-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). After being washed twice with 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) (T-TBS), blots were incubated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used for Western blotting were diluted as follows: anti-p21 (F-5, 1:750), anti-p27 (F-8, 1:200), anti-cyclin D2 (M-20, 1:2000), anti-cyclin A (C-19, 1:2000), anti-cyclin E (M-20, 1:2000), anti-Cdk2 (M2, 1:2000), anti-Cdk4 (C-22, 1:2000) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-pRb (clone G3–245, 1:750, Pharmingen). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in blocking buffer at 1:10,000. Western blots were developed with chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, blots were incubated with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with other primary antibodies. RCS cells growing on 100-mm dishes were treated with vehicle or 3 nm FGF2 for 12 h. Cells were then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 10 µm β-glycerophosphate, phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 66 µg/ml of aprotinin for 30 min on ice. Lysates were precleared with 0.5 µg/ml nonimmune rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C and then with 40 µl/ml of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation, and 500 µg of protein of the supernatant was incubated with 2.0 µg of rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p21 (C-19), cyclin D2 (M-20), Cdk2 (M2), cyclin E (M-20 and Upstate Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal antibody to Cdk4 (clone DCS-35; Pharmingen) for 1 h at 4 °C and then with 40 µl of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for Cdk4 or protein A-agarose (Life Technologies) for all other antibodies overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Samples were then washed four times with lysis buffer, dissolved in sample buffer, and resolved on 12.5% SDS gel, followed by Western blotting. For CDK kinase assay, immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer (50 mmHepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was carried out in 30 µl of kinase buffer containing 2 µg of GST-fusioned carboxyl-terminal pRb (New England Biolabs), 30 µm ATP, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by boiling after the addition of the same volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS gel and analyzed using a CycloneTMphosphor imager (Packard). Animals were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mutant mice deficient for p21 (B6;129-Cdkn1atm1tyj) (24Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) and wild-type (WT) mice (B6129SF2/J) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Methods for mouse fetal limb culture were described previously (25Vortkamp A. Lee K. Lanske B. Segre G.V. Kronenberg H.M. Tabin C.J. Science. 1996; 273: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). In brief, limbs of embryonic day 16.5 fetuses were stripped of skin and soft tissue and placed on a filter paper (type AA, 0.8-µm pore size; Millipore) supported by stainless steel grids (Wire Mesh Corp.). Limbs were cultured with daily replacement of BGJb medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. After the termination of cultures, samples were fixed in 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline. 35S-Labeled riboprobes for histone H4 were made using genomic DNA (1.2-kilobaseEcoRI/XbaI fragment of the plasmid pF0108A) (26Sierra F. Stein G. Stein J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7069-7086Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) obtained from Dr. Gary Stein (University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, Worcester, MA). Antisense [35S]cRNAs were synthesized from linearized plasmids using the Gemini Transcription Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]UTP (1289 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (27Lee K. Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Deeds J.D. Kohno H. Nissenson R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Slides were dipped into NTB-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) and stored at 4 °C for 7 days. After development, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin and mounted. After sections (6 µm) were deparaffinized and hydrated, antigen was unmasked by boiling twice in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min in a microwave oven. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-p21 mouse IgG (F-5, 1:50) and mouse ABC staining kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. RCS cells display numerous chondrocytic characteristics, including expression of type II and type IX collagens and production of cartilaginous matrix (23Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we confirmed that RCS cells expressed FGFR2 and R3, which were phosphorylated at tyrosine residues upon treatment with FGF2 (data not shown). First, we assessed the effects of FGF2 on cellular proliferation by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as DNA content. As shown in Fig.1 A, FGF2 suppressed thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 1000 pm. Growth inhibition by FGF2 was confirmed by dose-dependent decreases of DNA content in RCS cells continuously treated with 3–100 pm FGF2 (Fig.1 B). Then we analyzed the effects of FGF2 on cell cycle distribution of RCS cells. As shown in Fig. 2, vehicle-treated cells showed an almost identical distribution of cells across the cycle throughout the time course studied (G1, 56.9–63.4%; S, 16.3–17.8%; G2/M, 16.9–19.7%) except for a slight increase in the G1 population at 24 h. FGF2-treated cells first accumulated in G2/M phase (43.17%), along with a reduction in cells in S phase (5.79%) at 6 h. Then FGF2-treated cells accumulated in G1 phase at 12 and 24 h (73.90 and 77.94%, respectively), which was associated with a further reduction of cells in S phase (1.17% at 24 h). The G2/M population of FGF2-treated cells decreased dramatically between 6 and 12 h and remained at this level at 24 h. The distribution pattern of FGF2-treated cells at 24 h remained unchanged at least up to 36 h (data not shown). To understand the mechanisms of FGF-induced G1 arrest of RCS cells, we examined the effects of FGF2 on expression of G1/S cell cycle proteins. As shown in Fig.3, FGF2 induced p21 protein expression by 6 h, and its expression peaked at 12 h. In contrast, p57 was undetectable either in the presence or absence of FGF2 (data not shown). Also, whereas p27 expression was detectable at 12 and 24 h, FGF2 did not affect the level of its expression. We then examined the phosphorylation state of pRb by Western blotting, using an antibody to pRb that recognizes both hyperphosphorylated (ppRb in Fig. 3) and underphosphorylated pRb (pRb in Fig. 3). FGF2 shifted pRb from hyperphosphorylated, inactive forms to underphosphorylated, active forms by 6 h. By 12 h and thereafter, the majority of pRb was in the underphosphorylated, active form in FGF2-treated cells. This paralleled the increased p21 protein expression as well as the increase of cells in G1. A partial shift of pRb to underphosphorylated forms was observed in vehicle-treated cells also at 12 and 24 h, which might be related to the slight increase in G1 cells in vehicle-treated RCS at 24 h. Parallel to the shift of pRb to its active form, expression of cyclin A, whose expression is regulated by E2F, was dramatically reduced at 12 and 24 h. In contrast, whereas cyclin D2 expression was dramatically increased by FGF2, cyclin E expression was unaffected during the time studied. Furthermore, FGF2 did not change the expression levels of Cdk2 or Cdk4. Next, we examined which cyclin-CDK complexes were associated with FGF-induced p21. We treated RCS cells with vehicle or FGF2 for 12 h and then immunoprecipitated with antibodies to p21, cyclin D2, cyclin E, Cdk2, and Cdk4, followed by Western blotting with antibodies to p21, p27, cyclin D2, Cdk2, and Cdk4. As shown in Fig.4 A, FGF2-induced p21 coimmunoprecipitated with cyclin D2, cyclin E, Cdk2, and Cdk4, whereas p21 expressed in vehicle-treated cells was associated with them at much lower levels. Although cyclin D2 was associated with Cdk4 in vehicle-treated cells, it became associated with both Cdk4 and Cdk2 after FGF2 treatment. Also, whereas the association between cyclin E and Cdk2 was unaffected by FGF2 treatment, the cyclin E-Cdk2-p21 complex assembled only after FGF2 treatment. In summary, these data suggest that FGF2 treatment generates a cyclin E-Cdk2-p21 complex and quantitatively increases cyclin D2-Cdk4-p21 and cyclin D2-Cdk2-p21 complexes. FGF2 did not change the expression of p27 or its association with cyclin D2, cyclin E, or Cdk2. We then examined which cyclin-dependent kinase activity is regulated by FGF2. To assess the kinase activity of CDKs, cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with antibodies to cyclin D2, cyclin E, Cdk2, or Cdk4, and precipitated proteins were then incubated with [32P]ATP and GST-Rb protein. As shown in Fig.4 B, 12 h of FGF treatment did not change the activity of Cdk4 or cyclin D2-dependent kinase but dramatically reduced the activity of Cdk2 and cyclin E-dependent kinases, as assessed by the phosphorylation of exogenous pRb protein. Reduction in the activity of Cdk2 and cyclin E-dependent kinases was also observed using histone H1 as substrate (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that FGF2 inhibited G1/S transition of cell cycle through the induction of p21 and subsequent inactivation of cyclin E-Cdk2 in RCS cells. We then examined whether FGF2 induces p21 in chondrocytes in the growth plate in limbs isolated from mouse fetuses. As shown in Fig.5, p21 protein expression was limited to hypertrophic chondrocytes and some proliferating chondrocytes residing in the peripheral region of the lower half of the proliferating zone in vehicle-treated limbs (Fig. 5 a). In contrast, after 8-h treatment with FGF2, p21 immunoreactivity was seen in almost all of the chondrocytes (Fig. 5, b andc). This widespread pattern of p21 immunoreactivity in growth plate chondrocytes was observed also at 16 and 24 h after FGF2 treatment (data not shown) Next, we examined whether inhibitory effects of FGF2 on chondrocytic proliferation differ in the growth plate of p21 −/− mice, compared with WT mice, by comparing mRNA expression for H4 histone (H4), a marker for cells in S phase (27Lee K. Lanske B. Karaplis A.C. Deeds J.D. Kohno H. Nissenson R.A. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To avoid the interference caused by developmental variability among littermates, we treated one hind limb with vehicle alone and the contralateral hind limb with the indicated amounts of FGF2. As shown in Fig.6, H4 expression was detected in cells in the proliferating zone but not in the hypertrophic zone in vehicle-treated tibias from WT and p21 −/− mice. In both WT and p21 −/− tibias, FGF2 dose-dependently decreased the number of H4-positive cells in the proliferating zone. However, whereas 1.5 nm FGF2 dramatically decreased the number of H4-positive chondrocytes in the proliferating zone in WT limbs, the number of H4-positive chondrocytes in the proliferating zone in p21 −/− limbs was unaffected. Moreover, whereas 6 and 24 nm FGF2 completely suppressed the chondrocytic proliferation in WT tibias, as evidenced by the absence of H4 mRNA expression, chondrocytic proliferation was only partially inhibited in p21 −/− tibias at these doses of FGF2. As shown in Fig. 7, when tibias were treated with 1.5 nm FGF2 or vehicle alone for 2 days, FGF2 dramatically reduced both the overall size of the growth plate and the thickness of the hypertrophic zone in WT tibia, compared with the vehicle-treated control. In contrast, neither the growth plate size nor the thickness of the hypertrophic zone in p21 −/− tibia was affected as dramatically as WT tibia. 2 days of 24 nm FGF2 treatment decreased both of these in p21 −/− tibias as it did in WT (data not shown), consistent with the effects on H4 expression. Although FGF and its receptor are known to negatively regulate cartilage proliferation, little is known about the mechanisms involved. In this study, we examined the effects of FGF2 on the cell cycle inhibitor, p21, in both cell and fetal limb cultures to understand the growth-inhibitory pathway of FGF signaling in chondrocytes. Unlike the effects of FGF2 on primary chondrocytes and ATDC5 cells, FGF2 inhibits growth of RCS cells, thus mimicking its effects in vivo. In this study, we took advantage of the antiproliferative response of RCS cells to analyze the growth-inhibitory mechanisms of FGF in chondrocytes. FGF2 arrests the cell cycle of RCS cells mainly at G1, a stage known to be controlled by pRb activity (28Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar). pRb is underphosphorylated and exerts its antiproliferative function in G1, and hyperphosphorylation of pRb by cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes inactivates it at the G1/S transition, allowing the cell to proceed into S phase (29Hinds P.W.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the cell cycle arrest at G1is linked to the decreased kinase activity of cyclin D-Cdk4 or cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes as well as to the underphosphorylation of pRb (32Hatakeyama M. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 33Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Consistent with these, the time course of G1accumulation and exclusion from S phase in RCS cells after FGF2 treatment was synchronized to the underphosphorylation of pRb and decrease in cyclin A, whose expression is regulated by E2F family members through inactivation (hyperphosphorylation) of pRb (16Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Moreover, all of these events (i.e. G1accumulation, underphosphorylation of pRb, and decrease in cyclin A) were associated with p21 expression but not with p27, cyclin D2, cyclin E, Cdk2, and Cdk4 (Figs. 2 and 3). On the other hand, a slight increase in G1 population and partial underphosphorylation of pRb also was observed in vehicle-treated RCS cells. These events were associated with the expression of p21 and p27 at 12 and 24 h (Fig. 3). Since RCS cells grow very rapidly, with the doubling time shorter than 16 h, and their growth is contact-inhibited, and because we started the experiment when cells were 70% confluent, it is highly likely that the apparent G1 arrest and the associated increase in p21 and p27 expression at later time points were caused by contact inhibition. The involvement of p21 in G1 cell cycle arrest of RCS cells was further examined by coimmunoprecipitation and cyclin-dependent kinase assay. We found that FGF2 induced the assembly of cyclin E-Cdk2-p21, cyclin D2-Cdk4-p21, and cyclin D2-Cdk2-p21 complexes. Also, we demonstrated that FGF2 dramatically reduced the activity of Cdk2 and cyclin E-dependent kinases. Although FGF2 increased the expression of cyclin D2 in RCS cells, cyclin D2-dependent kinase activity was not affected by FGF2. Our findings with limb explants show that the increase in p21 expression induced by FGF2 in vitro also is evident in whole growth plates. Moreover, higher doses of FGF2 are required to inhibit cartilaginous growth in limbs from p21 −/− mice compared with those from WT mice. This further highlights the importance of p21 in the mechanisms by which FGF2 mediates inhibition of cartilage growth. In contrast to our data, Li et al. (9Li C. Chen L. Iwata T. Kitagawa M. Fu X.Y. Deng C.X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have reported that Ink4 family proteins but not p21 were activated in postnatal growth plates of mice carrying the mutant FGFR3 gene (K644E). We did not examine Ink4 protein expression in this study, because FGF2 did not change the activity of Cdk4 or cyclin D2-dependent kinase in RCS cells. The apparent discrepancy between our in vitrodata and their in vivo data may be explained by a possible qualitative difference in signaling pathways in ligand-induced activation of WT FGFR and ligand-independent activation of mutant FGFR3 (K644E), or FGF's cell cycle regulation may involve different cell cycle inhibitors in fetal and postnatal growth plates. In summary, our data indicate that FGF's inhibitory effects on chondrocytic proliferation appear to be mediated at least partially through p21 induction and the subsequent inactivation of cyclin E-Cdk2 and activation of pRb.

To characterize the role of BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, we analyzed gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 using microarray technology. We found that loss of BRCA1 correlated with decreased expression of several groups of genes including stress response genes, cytoskeleton genes, and genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation. Previous study showed that BRCA1 is a transcriptional co-activator of p53 protein; however the majority of p53 target genes remained at the same expression levels in BRCA1 knockout cells as in the wild type cells. The only p53 target gene down-regulated with the loss of BRCA1 was 14-3-3ς, a major G2/M checkpoint control gene. Similar to cells with decreased 14-3-3ς activity, BRCA1-deficient cells were unable to sustain G2/M growth arrest after exposure to ionizing radiation. We find that BRCA1 induction of 14-3-3ς requires the presence of wild type p53 and can be regulated by a minimal p53 response element.

Another putative function of BRCA1 is in the regulation of transcription. BRCA1 interacts with a number of transcription factors or modifiers of transcription like p53, c-Myc, CtIP·CtBP, STAT1, and p300 (14Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc.

For example, BRCA1 induces the transcription of cell cycle regulators cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and GADD45 by virtue of p53 transcriptional co-activation or represses the expression of the same genes when silencing ZBRK1 transcription factor through the CtIP·CtBP complex (20Zheng L.

Mutations identified in the C terminus of BRCA1 from breast cancer patients were unable to activate transcription, inferring the importance of transcriptional activating function for BRCA1 tumor suppression activity. To characterize the role of BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, we analyzed gene expression profiles of ES cells with targeted deletion of full-length BRCA1 gene. We found that loss of BRCA1 results in decreased expression of stress response genes, cytoskeletal genes, and 14-3-3ς, a major G2/M checkpoint control gene. Irradiation of BRCA1-deficient cells showed the preliminary exit from G2/M growth arrest similar to cells with targeted deletion of 14-3-3ς (21Chan T. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). BRCA1 protein overexpression activated the 14-3-3ς promoter or induced transcription of the endogenous 14-3-3ς in a p53-dependent manner.

Mcf7 breast carcinoma, HCT116, RKO, SW480, and HT29 colon cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in recommended growth media. HCC1937 cells were a gift from Dr. Mel Campbell and Dr. Roy Jensen (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Cells were irradiated using a 137Cs γ-irradiator at total dosage of 10 Gy. Messenger RNA was isolated from ES cells using a FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 2 µg of mRNA was reverse transcribed using T7(dT)24 primer and then labeled with biotinylated ribonucleotides incorporated by T7 RNA polymerase. Resultant RNA was fragmented and hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray Mu6500 chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. BRCA1−/− mRNA hybridization was repeated twice, and data from each hybridization were used as a baseline for comparison with BRCA1+/+ and BRCA1-tg cells. Comparison of gene expression was performed with GeneChip analysis software. Signal intensities for different chips were scaled to the target value of 150 for GAPDH gene (3′ and M probes). The genes were excluded from the list of outliers if the decision algorithm used negative values of average differences. Only genes reproduced in 3 of 4 cross-comparisons resulting in more than 2-fold difference were considered as true outliers. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 20 µg was used for analysis. A probe containing the 3′-untranslated region of the mouse 14-3-3ς gene was generated by polymerase chain reaction using expressed sequence tag AA873962 (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) and M13 forward and reverse primers. A 14-3-3ς human probe was also generated by polymerase chain reaction from the 3′-untranslated region as described in Ref. 26Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.-C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S.

To generate mouse BRCA1 probe, an internal 4.5 kilobase pair EcoRI fragment was isolated. Hybridizations were performed in QuickHyb solution using the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). ES cells were γ-irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy and collected at the indicated time points. 106 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide, and amounts of DNA per cell were determined using FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The amount of virus for infection was variable (50 multiplicity of infection/cell for HCT116 or 500 multiplicity of infection/cell for Mcf7 and RKO) to provide about two times overexpression of BRCA1. 16 h after infection total RNA was analyzed for 14-3-3ς or BRCA1 expression by Northern blotting. Cells were split 24 h prior to the experiment into 60-mm plates and transfected at about 60% density with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, each transfection reaction contained 0.5 µg of luciferase reporter and 0.2 µg of lacZ plasmid as an internal standard. Where indicated cells were transfected with 1 µg of p53 expression vector (or mutant p53–273H) and 12 µg of pcDNA3-BRCA1 (or pcDNA3-BRCA1ΔC). The total amount of DNA was balanced with equimolar amount of empty vector. In 24 h cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 400 ml of 0.25m Tris, pH 8.0, and snap frozen in dry ice. After two rounds of freeze-thaw cellular lysates were cleared by centrifugation, 10 µl of lysate was tested for β-gal activity using a β-gal assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 5–10 µl of lysate was used to measure luciferase activity (luciferase assay system, Promega, Madison, WI). To identify the impact of loss of BRCA1 function, we compared the gene expression in the following three cell lines: wild type ES cells, ES cells deficient in BRCA1 expression as a result of targeted mutation of exon 11 (these cells will be termed BRCA1−/−), and BRCA1−/− ES cells reconstituted by transfection with a mouse BRCA1 cDNA expression vector, transgene. Amplified mRNA from these cells was hybridized to an oligonucleotide microarray (Mu6500; Affymetrix). We considered as outliers the genes whose altered expression in BRCA1−/−cells compared with BRCA1+/+ cells was at least partially restored after ectopic expression of a BRCA1 transgene in the BRCA1−/− cells. Some BRCA1 regulated genes may not have achieved outlier status in our list, because the level of BRCA1 transgene expression was lower than that in the wild type cells, and therefore the reconstitution of BRCA1 expression was not complete (see Fig. 1 A and Ref. 7Snouwaert J.N. Gowen L.C. Latour A.M. Mohn A.R. Xiao A. DiBiase L. Koller B.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7900-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this approach allowed us to increase the reliability of the results increasing the probability that the expression of these genes is directly or indirectly regulated by BRCA1. Of the 6,500 gene elements represented in the array, 51 genes were expressed at more than two times higher levels in the presence of either the wild type or the reconstituted BRCA1, whereas no genes were down-regulated by BRCA1 within the stringent definition of outliers (see Table I in Supplemental Material). Expression of several genes involved in regulation of transcription was reduced with BRCA1 deletion. Included in this group is Id3, a dominant negative inhibitor of transcription. Id3 gene is induced during early G1phase, following by a second peak of induction in the late G1 or early S phase coincident with the expression of BRCA1. Partial inactivation of Id3 protein by antisense oligonucleotide or antibody microinjection results in a delayed entry of cells into the S phase of cell cycle. Similar to BRCA1, overexpression of Id3 induces apoptosis (22Norton J.D. Atherton G.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2371-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Using Northern blot analysis we have confirmed that both the wild type and BRCA1-tg ES cells express higher levels of Id3 gene than BRCA1−/− cells (data not shown). Loss of the BRCA1 resulted in reduced expression of a diverse group of genes involved in cytoskeleton reorganization including multiple forms of α-actin, ROCK kinase, stabilizing stress fibers, cytokeratin, vimentin, and tropomyosin. Cell cycle progression is associated with dramatic changes in the organization of cytoskeletal filaments. Expression of these genes is induced during S-G2/M phase of cell cycle (23Cho R.J. Huang M. Campbell M.J. Dong H. Steinmetz L. Sapinoso L. Hampton G. Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Lochart D.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and repressed during oncogenic transformation. Similar to the study reported here, microarray analysis of genes induced by p53 revealed up-regulation of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins (24Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We also found decreased expression of the Pw1 gene in BRCA1−/− cells. This gene is activated during p53/c-Myc-mediated apoptosis but not during p53-dependent G1 arrest, suggesting that Pw1 cooperates with p53 in determining the choice between cell death and survival (25Relaix F. Wei X.-J. Li W. Pan J. Lin Y. Bowtell D. Sassoon D.A. Wu X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2105-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A number of the genes with altered expression are involved in protein synthesis and degradation, as well as heat shock genes, whose products are known to modify protein folding in response to cellular stress. We consistently found decreased expression of 14-3-3ς in the BRCA1-deficient cells. Northern blot hybridization of RNA prepared from the three cell lines confirmed the differences obtained on analysis of our microarray data (Fig. 1 A). In addition, this induction is specific for 14-3-3ς in that other 14–3-3 family members did not change with the BRCA1 status. Previous studies have shown that 14-3-3ς gene is induced after genotoxic stress (26Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.-C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined whether expression of BRCA1 could modify the cellular response to γ-irradiation using 14-3-3ς expression as the read out. Our results show that induction of 14-3-3ς transcripts is significantly depressed in BRCA1−/− ES cells after exposure to 10 Gy of γ-irradiation (Fig. 1 B). The 14-3-3ς gene product is an important mediator of G2/M checkpoint control, blocking progression of cells with DNA damage through mitosis by retention of the CDC2·cyclin B complex in the cytoplasm (21Chan T. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Therefore, 14-3-3ς−/−cells arrest in G2/M phase of the cell cycle after exposure to DNA-damaging agents but exit this arrest prematurely. We determined whether the loss of BRCA1 and consequent decreased expression of 14-3-3ς leads to similar alteration of cell cycle regulation in ES cells and whether these changes could be restored by expression of the BRCA1 transgene. Wild type, BRCA1−/−, and BRCA1-tg cells were irradiated, and cell cycle progression was measured over the next 24 h. ES cells do not display an arrest in G1. Thus, after exposure to irradiation, the G1 population decreased whereas the number of cells in G2 increased dramatically. After 4 h, all three ES cell lines had a similar arrest in G2/M (Fig. 1 C). However, even at 8 h post-irradiation, the number of BRCA1−/− cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle was significantly lower than that in parental BRCA1+/+ or BRCA1-tg cells. Moreover, the premature reentry of the BRCA1−/− cells into the cell cycle was observed by the increase in the number of cells in G1 at the later time points. This pattern of behavior strikingly resembles that of 14-3-3ς−/− cells and suggests a functional consequence of the attenuated 14-3-3ς expression in the BRCA1-disrupted ES cells after DNA damage. In the previous study, p53 was identified as a transcriptional factor responsible for 14-3-3ς induction after DNA damage (26Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.-C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the status of p53 expression in BRCA1−/−cells. Neither microarray nor Northern blot analysis revealed any difference in levels of p53 transcript between these cell lines. Analysis of p53 protein by Western blot showed no differences in protein level or in phosphorylation of serine in position 15 of p53 in untreated wild type or BRCA1−/− cells (data not shown). 8 h after irradiation, phosphorylation of p53, as well as p21 protein, rose to similar levels in the parental and BRCA1-deficient lines. These results show that the decreased expression of 14-3-3ς in BRCA1−/− cells is not associated with changes in the p53 protein. To obviate the possibility that decreased expression of 14-3-3ς gene may be unique to mouse ES cells used in our microarray experiments, we infected several human cancer cell lines with adenovirus encoding the BRCA1 gene. The 14-3-3ς transcript was induced in all three cancer cell lines, harboring wild type p53 genes (Fig. 2 A). Isogenic virus encoding truncated BRCA1 protein was significantly less potent in inducing 14-3-3ς expression (Fig. 2 B). When we used the colon cancer cell line SW480, which is deficient in p53 protein, or the breast carcinoma cell line HCC1937, which is deficient in both p53 and BRCA1, no increase in 14-3-3ς transcription was observed (Fig.2 C). Somasundaram et al. (27Somasundaram K. MacLachlan T.K. Burns T.F. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6605-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reported that BRCA1 overexpression results in an increase in p53 protein levels 24 h after infection with adenovirus, and this increase is dependent on p14ARF. To verify that 14-3-3ς induction after adenovirus-mediated BRCA1 overexpression was not a secondary reaction because of p53 protein stabilization we monitored the amount of 14-3-3ς transcript and levels of p53 and BRCA1 proteins at various time points after infection. (Fig. 3 A). The BRCA1 protein was easily detectable 8 h after infection, and induction of 14-3-3ς transcripts expression was observed within the first 12 h of the experiment. In contrast, p53 induction could not be measured until at least 20 h post-infection. Together with previous data this observation suggests that whereas p53 is required for induction of 14-3-3ς, BRCA1 can modulate expression of this gene.Figure 3BRCA1 cooperates with p53 in stimulation of 14–3-3ς expression.

B, Western blot analysis of p53 and BRCA1 protein at different time points after BRCA1 overexpression in HCT116 cell line. C, BRCA1 stimulates p53-dependent transcription from the 14-3-3ς promoter. HT29 colon cancer cell line was co-transfected with the 14-3-3ς reporter plasmid and pcDNA3-lacZ, as an internal standard, and combinations of p53, mutant p53–273H and BRCA1, or transactivation-deficient BRCA1 mutant. Cells were harvested 24 later, and luciferase and β-gal activity were measured. D, as a control, p53 artificial promoter pG13 (15Zhang H. Somasundaram K. Peng Y. Zhang H. Bi D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) was used instead of the 14-3-3ς promoter. Experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. Representative experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of BRCA1 to modify 14-3-3ς expression was further tested by examining transcription of a luciferase gene driven by the 14-3-3ς promoter. This reporter plasmid was co-transfected with BRCA1 and/or p53 expression vectors into two p53-negative colon cancer cell lines, HT29 and SW480 (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). As expected, p53 gene alone induces luciferase gene expression. In contrast, BRCA1 alone had a very minor effect on the activity of the 14-3-3ς promoter. However, when both p53 and BRCA1 were co-expressed, transcription was induced to significantly higher levels than that observed in cells transfected with p53 alone. The magnitude of induction was comparable with that of an artificial promoter comprised of 13 tandem p53 response elements (Fig. 3 C). To further verify the role of BRCA1 in increased activity of the 14-3-3ς promoter, we compared the effectiveness of wild type and a mutant BRCA1 in this assay. We found that a C-terminal truncation mutant of the BRCA1 was defective in its ability to co-activate transcription from the 14-3-3ς promoter. Our findings indicate that BRCA1 alone is a very poor transcriptional activator of the 14-3-3ς but that BRCA1 can act synergistically to augment the ability of p53 to induce the transcription of the 14-3-3ς gene. The focus of this work is to characterize the changes in the gene expression in cells with targeted deletion of BRCA1 exon 11. Of the list of 51 genes induced by BRCA1, we focused on 14-3-3ς gene because of its role in cell growth control. The importance of 14-3-3ς protein in mammary cell transformation is suggested by the fact that 14-3-3ς expression is silenced in the majority of breast cancers (28Ferguson A.T. Evron E. Umbricht C.B. Pandita T.K. Hermeking H. Marks J.R. Lambers A.R. Futreal P.A. Stampfer M.R. Sukumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that BRCA1 is a transcriptional co-activator of p53. However, we find that BRCA1 is not a broad co-activator but rather a selective modulator of p53 transcription activity. The majority of p53 target genes presented in the chip did not alter their transcript levels with the loss of BRCA1. Obviously the most interesting question to address in the future will be to learn what other factors influence the BRCA1 choice of transcriptional activation. Previous microarray analysis of gene expression in the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line after induction of the BRCA1 protein did not show 14-3-3ς gene to be BRCA1 responsive (29Harkin D.P. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.-H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 568-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This may be explained by cellular specificity of the 14-3-3ς, which is expressed mainly in epithelial cells. In agreement with this, we did not see induction of 14-3-3ς in U2OS cells treated with adriamycin, unlike several breast or colon cancer cell lines (data not shown). Another study of downstream BRCA1 target genes focused mainly on p53-negative cells, and the inability of BRCA1 to induce 14-3-3ς gene expression confirms that BRCA1 acts through p53 (30MacLachlan T. Somasundaram K. Sgagias M. Shifman Y. Muschel R.J. Cowan K.H. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2777-2785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Of note, both publications were utilizing the overexpression of BRCA1 above the endogenous levels, which may explain the differences in the set of genes activated by BRCA1. Our results show that the expression of the 14-3-3ς checkpoint control gene is modulated by the BRCA1 status of a cell. Moreover, optimal expression of 14-3-3ς after DNA damage can be induced by a synergistic effect between BRCA1 and p53. These data imply that depending on the cellular context, BRCA1 can be a limiting factor in maximal p53-dependent transactivation. Our findings might also explain several clinical observations. First, there is increasing information linking the loss of 14-3-3ς expression to epithelial transformation. Given the synergistic interaction between BRCA1 and p53 in regulating 14-3-3ς expression described here, haploinsufficiency in either BRCA1 or p53 genes might contribute to an inadequate 14-3-3ς response to DNA damage and ultimately to transformation of breast epithelium. Second, our observation suggests that mutation in BRCA1 gene would compromise the 14-3-3ς function, which is operative mainly in epithelial cells. Thus, despite the ubiquitous expression of BRCA1, its regulation of 14-3-3ς expression might explain the epithelial specificity of cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers.

Boder E. Vinken P.J. Bruyn G.W. Klawans H.L. Handbook of Neurology. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1991: 347-422Google Scholar). The principal manifestation of A-T presents as a progressive truncal and limb ataxia as a consequence of degeneration of the cerebellum. This ultimately results in the patients being wheelchair-bound from the early teenage years. Other clinical signs of A-T are the presence of oculocutaneous telangiectasia, selective immunodeficiency, an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other radiomimetic chemicals, and a marked prevalence of tumors of the lymphoid system (reviewed in Ref.2Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These features define classical A-T, which results from total absence of functional ATM protein. At the gene level, the vast majority of classical A-T patients in the UK are compound heterozygotes for null mutations, most of which are truncating ATM mutations (3Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A. McGuire G.M. Robinson P. Weber P. Bedenham T. Bradwell A.R. Easton D.F. Lennox G.G. Haites N. Byrd P.J. Taylor A.M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 334-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The clinical diagnosis is unambiguous in these A-T patients. Whether or not clinical and cellular heterogeneity exists within the group of classical A-T patients with two null mutations is unknown, as no careful correlation studies have been undertaken. Across all A-T patients there is a degree of variation between them in both the severity and expression of the clinical features. In particular, the degree of telangiectasia, the extent of immunodeficiency, the susceptibility to recurrent sinopulmonary infections, longevity, the rate of neuronal degeneration, and the development of tumors show the greatest degree of heterogeneity among patients. In some cases this variation presents as a clearly milder form of A-T. These individuals have a combination of the following: a slightly later age of onset of the clinical symptoms, a slower rate of disease progression, an extended life span, when compared with most classical A-T patients, and a reduced or absent hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (3Stankovic T.

Given the predominance of null mutations underlying the classical form of ataxia telangiectasia (6Gilad S. Khosravi R. Shkedy D. Uziel T. Ziv Y. Savitsky K. Rotman G. Smith S. Chessa L.

Genet. 1996; 5: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that milder, “variant” forms arise from less severe mutations that retain some normal protein function. In support of this, we have previously reported two different ATM gene mutations that are specifically associated with a milder clinical syndrome (3Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A. McGuire G.M. Robinson P. Weber P. Bedenham T. Bradwell A.R. Easton D.F. Lennox G.G. Haites N. Byrd P.J. Taylor A.M.R. Am. J. Hum.

The first mutation, present in the heterozygous state in 15% of A-T families in the United Kingdom, is an intronic missense mutation that activates a cryptic splice donor/acceptor site resulting in the insertion of 137 nucleotides of intronic sequence at position 5762. It appears, however, that this mutation is “leaky” and also allows normal splicing to occur, albeit at a reduced level. It was proposed that the presence of some normal ATM protein was sufficient to reduce the severity of the disease (4McConville C.M. Stankovic T. Byrd P.J. McGuire G.M. Yao Q.-Y. Lennox G.G.

In a similar context, a leaky splice mutation (3576G→A) was identified in four Italian A-T patients with a milder phenotype (5Gilad S. Chessa L. Khosravi R. Russell P. Galanty Y. Piane M. Gatti R.A.

In contrast, the second ATM mutation we reported, associated with a mild variant A-T phenotype (3Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A. McGuire G.M. Robinson P. Weber P. Bedenham T. Bradwell A.R.

In this case the genotype-phenotype relationship is thought to result from some normal activity retained by the mutant ATM protein, which appears to be expressed at levels comparable to that in a normal individual, at least in affected individuals that are homozygous for this mutation (3Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A. McGuire G.M. Robinson P. Weber P. Bedenham T. Bradwell A.R. Easton D.F. Lennox G.G. Haites N. Byrd P.J. Taylor A.M.R. Am. J. Hum.

The mechanism for the milder clinical course in both the 5762ins137 and the 7271T→G patients is currently unknown. Our current study, therefore, was devised to try and identify cellular pathways dependent on ATM that may be important for moderating the symptoms arising from loss of ATM function. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and skin fibroblast strains were derived in our laboratory from normal individuals and patients with ataxia telangiectasia. LCLs were routinely maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Whole cell extracts (from ∼4 × 107 cells) were prepared as described (3Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A. McGuire G.M. Robinson P. Weber P. Bedenham T. Bradwell A.R. Easton D.F. Lennox G.G.

It is becoming increasingly evident that the ATM protein plays a crucial role in transducing signals that are activated in response to DNA damage. Like the majority of members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like family of proteins, the ATM protein principally functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase, phosphorylating a number of downstream target proteins that include p53, MDM2, BRCA1, hChk2, Nbs1, c-Abl, and RPA (9Baskaran R.

In an attempt to understand the underlying reason for the milder clinical phenotypes exhibited by patients with the 5762ins137 and 7271T→G mutations, we initially carried out Western blotting to evaluate the level of ATM protein expression in these patients and then, subsequently, assayed the residual protein for kinase activity. The level of residual ATM protein expression in patients with the 5762ins137 ATM gene mutation ranged from 3 to 60% of the normal level of expression (Fig. 1,A and B). Patients 1-3, 40-4, 52-4, 59-4, and 79-3 all had a second truncating mutation (TableI), consistent with the suggestion that the residual protein was solely wild type protein derived from the leaky 5762ins137 mutation (4McConville C.M. Stankovic T. Byrd P.J. McGuire G.M. Yao Q.-Y. Lennox G.G. Taylor A.M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 320-330PubMed Google Scholar). The second mutation in patient 62-4 was a deletion of three amino acids at position 2546, which has been found to be associated with a classical A-T phenotype (4McConville C.M. Stankovic T. Byrd P.J. McGuire G.M. Yao Q.-Y. Lennox G.G. Taylor A.M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 320-330PubMed Google Scholar). The secondATM gene mutation for the remaining patients has not been determined. However, the high level of ATM expression in patient 45-3 suggested that the second mutation was an expressed missense point mutation.Table IMutations in A-T cell lines used in assaysPatientMutation 1Mutation 2Cell lines with 5762ins137 mutations1–35762ins137Stop19303801delGStop126814-45762ins137Stop1930ND38-35762ins137Stop1930ND40-45762ins137Stop19308787ins14Stop293344-45762ins137Stop1930ND45-35762ins137Stop1930ND52-45762ins137Stop19309139C→TStop304759-45762ins137Stop19306412delAGStop214462-45762ins137Stop19307636del9delSRI79-35762ins137Stop19302282delCTStop763135-35762ins137Stop1930NDCell lines with 7271T→G mutation109 II-17271T→GV2424G7271T→GV2424G109 II-57271T→GV2424G7271T→GV2424G109 II-67271T→GV2424G7271T→GV2424G46, II-17271T→GV2424G3910del7Stop130446, II-27271T→GV2424G3910del7Stop1304136, II-17271T→GV2424GNDCell lines with 7636del926-47636del9DelSRIND39-47636del9DelSRI136del4Stop 46Cell lines from classical A-T with two truncating ATM mutations92-32249ins9ter7522249ins9ter752113-32639del200ter8802639del200ter880118-3794ins4Stop 2662839del83Stop 947 Open table in a new tab In contrast, the 7271T→G mutation was expressed at levels comparable to normal in cells from patients 109 II-1, 109II-5, and 109 II-6, homozygous for the mutation and approximately half that of normal in patient 46 II-2 who was heterozygous for the 7271 mutation and had a second null mutation, 3910del7 (3Stankovic T.

The normal level of ATM protein in the 7271 heterozygous patient 136 II-1 suggested that the second unknown mutation was also an expressed missense point mutation that did not affect the stability of the protein (Fig. 1 C). To evaluate the kinase activity of the residual ATM protein expressed in the 5762ins137 patients, an immunoprecipitation in vitrokinase assay was carried out in which the amount of protein was increased to compensate for the reduced level of expression. A ratio of the level of immunoprecipitated ATM to phosphorylated PHAS-I substrate was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the activity found in normal cells. Three of four 5762ins137 patients tested, 40-4, 45-3, and 135-3, exhibited the same specific activity of ATM kinase as normals. The fourth patient, 59-4, expressed ATM protein at levels that were too low to obtain any ATM kinase activity above background (data not shown). Patient 39-4, who was compound heterozygous for a truncating null ATM allele 136del4 and the 2546delSRI (7636del9) mutation exhibited no detectable ATM kinase activity, in keeping with the classical A-T phenotype exhibited by this patient (Fig.2 A). A similar assay was carried out using cells from patients with the 7271T→G mutation, except that similar amounts of protein were used in each immunoprecipitate given that the level of mutant protein in these patients was comparable to that found in normal cells (3Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A. McGuire G.M. Robinson P. Weber P. Bedenham T. Bradwell A.R. Easton D.F. Lennox G.G. Haites N. Byrd P.J. Taylor A.M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 334-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The mutant protein expressed in cells from the homozygous 7271 patients 109II-1, 109 II-5, and 109 II-6 showed only ∼4–6% of normal ATM kinase activity when using PHAS-I as a substrate (Fig. 2 B). In addition, this mutant ATM protein was also able to undergo weak autophosphorylation (data not shown). The kinase activity of the mutant ATM protein in the 7271T→G heterozygous patient 46 II-2 was too low to detect over and above nonspecific background phosphorylation of PHAS-I observed in the negative control (data not shown). In contrast, the kinase activity in the heterozygous patient 136 II-1 was ∼10–15% of normal ATM activity suggesting that the second expressed mutant allele, in addition to the 7271T→G mutation, significantly contributed to the residual ATM function in these cells (data not shown). Therefore, the residual ATM protein expressed in cells derived from both the 5762ins137 and the 7271T→G patients retained detectable in vitro protein kinase activity. In addition, the secondATM mutation present in the cells may also affect the level of remaining activity. To assess the activity of the residual ATM protein in these variant A-T patients in vivo, we examined the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the double strand break repair proteins, Nbs1 and hMre11, after DNA damage. The phosphorylation of Nbs1 (17Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lin J. Petrini J.H. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2000; 404: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 20Gatei M. Young D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19513-19516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) can be detected by a change in protein mobility on an SDS-PAGE gel. The bandshift of Nbs1 and hMre11 proteins is clearly evident in normal cells but not in cells from a classical A-T after exposure to 50 Gy of γ-radiation (Fig.3, A and B). To confirm that the mobility shift of both hMre11 and Nbs1 was specifically due to phosphorylation, immunoprecipitates of hMre11 and Nbs1 following exposure of normal and classical A-T cells to ionizing radiation were treated with λ protein phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment resulted in normal mobility of hMre11 and Nbs1 (Fig.3 C), therefore confirming that retardation of the hMre11 and Nbs1 protein after DNA damage was specifically due to phosphorylation. The three 5762ins137 cell lines analyzed showed a small detectable level of Nbs1 but not hMre11 phosphorylation following DNA damage (Fig.3 A). Immunoprecipitation and phosphatase treatment of Nbs1 in one of the 5762ins137 cell lines (40-4) following DNA damage demonstrated a small amount of damage-induced Nbs1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). However, immunoprecipitation of hMre11 in this cell line following exposure to ionizing radiation failed to show any damage-induced mobility shift (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, phosphorylation of Nbs1 and hMre11 was observed at a higher level in irradiated cells derived from patients that were either homozygous or heterozygous for the 7271T→G mutation, albeit at reduced levels when compared with normal (Fig. 3 B). Thus in both the 5762ins137 and the 7271 cells, the ATM protein did retain some normal activityin vivo as well as in vitro, although it was more evident in patients with the 7271T→G mutant protein. ATM activation results in the induction of p53 and certain downstream responsive genes. A-T cells exhibit a defective induction of p53 and GADD45 after exposure to ionizing radiation (24Kastan M.B.

However, in keeping with the heterogeneity that is characteristic of A-T, the kinetics of the damage-induced p53 accumulation in these cells does show some variability. It would appear that the defect in cells from classical A-T patients is either a delay in the accumulation of stable p53 or in both the timing of peak p53 accumulation and also a reduction in the maximal level of detectable p53 protein (24Kastan M.B.

Cell lines derived from 10 normal individuals were analyzed for the induction of p53, p21, and MDM2 following exposure to γ-radiation. The peak of maximum p53 induction occurred at 4 h post-irradiation with the fold p53 induction over basal levels varying between 6- and 15-fold. The induction of the p53-responsive gene products p21 and MDM2 reached a peak at 2–4 h post-irradiation (data not shown). When compared with normal the p53 induction kinetics in cells from 6 classical A-T patients showed significantly delayed and reduced accumulation when compared with normal (data not shown). The up-regulation of p21 and MDM2 in these cells was also defective. Seven LCLs with the 5762ins137 ATM mutation and two LCLs with the 7636del9 ATM mutation were analyzed for their ability to accumulate p53, p21, and MDM2 after exposure to ionizing radiation. Although some variation of p53 responses was observed within the 5762ins137 LCLs tested, cells from all seven patients exhibited a p53 induction profile that was intermediate between normal and classical A-T LCLs, characteristically showing a rapid accumulation of p53 within the first 2 h post-irradiation. The p21 and MDM2 accumulation in the 5762ins137 LCLs showed normal induction kinetics (Fig. 4). In contrast the two 7636del9 LCLs exhibited a p53, p21, and MDM2"

Extensive genetic studies using yeast have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) genes involved in vesicle transport to vacuoles. However, their mammalian counterparts are not fully elucidated. In this study, we identified two human homologues of yeast Class C VPS genes, human VPS11 (hVPS11) and human VPS18 (hVPS18). We also characterized the subcellular localization and interactions of the protein products not only from these genes but also from the other mammalian Class CVPS homologue genes, hVPS16 and rVPS33a. The protein products of hVPS11 (hVps11) and hVPS18 (hVps18) were ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues, suggesting that they have a fundamental role in cellular function. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins are predominantly associated with late endosomes/lysosomes. Immunoprecipitation and gel filtration studies showed that the mammalian Class C Vps proteins constitute a large hetero-oligomeric complex that interacts with syntaxin-7. These results indicate that like their yeast counterparts, mammalian Class C Vps proteins mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway.

These results indicate that like their yeast counterparts, mammalian Class C Vps proteins mediate vesicle trafficking steps in the endosome/lysosome pathway. vacuolar protein sorting cytomegalovirus early endosome antigen 1 green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor Eukaryotic cells contain highly specialized intracellular membrane-bound compartments.

Although numerous proteins and protein complexes have been characterized as having a role in intracellular vesicle transport and protein sorting, their precise mechanisms of involvement have not yet been elucidated. Genetic studies using yeast mutants have identified more than 40 vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)1 genes coding for proteins required for vacuolar proteins transports (3Bankaitis V.A. Johnson L.M.

The protein products of VPS11 andVPS18 contain a characteristic cysteine-rich RING-H2 finger domain in their C-terminal regions (10Woolford C.A. Dixon C.K. Manolson M.F. Wright R. Jones E.W.

Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 5813-5824Crossref Google Scholar). The RING-H2 finger domain is a subfamily of the RING finger motif utilized by numerous proteins for diverse cellular functions, including oncogenesis, cell differentiation, signal transduction, and membrane vesicle trafficking (14Freemont P.S.

The Class C Vps proteins, Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, and Vps33p, exist as a large detergent-insoluble HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) complex that also contains Vps39p and Vps41p. This Class C Vps/HOPS complex associates with Vam3p involved in regulating both vesicle docking/fusion and vacuole-to-vacuole fusion (12Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Previous studies have reported that Vps18p and Vps33p share significant homology with the Drosophila gene products, deep orange (dor) and carnation (car), respectively. These proteins are associated into a large complex that localizes to the endosomal compartment and is required for membrane trafficking to lysosomes and pigment granules in Drosophilaeyes (20Shestopal S.A.

Cell. 1999; 4: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared likely that mammalian homologues of the yeast Class C Vps proteins are also involved in protein sorting steps. Additionally, syntaxin-7, a Vam3p-related protein, was recently identified in mammals (22Wang H. Frelin L. Pevsner J. Gene. 1997; 199: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Wong S.H.

Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although there is some discrepancy regarding the precise intracellular localization of syntaxin-7, it is clear that syntaxin-7 is an essential factor for the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, lysosome homotypic fusion, and endocytic trafficking to late endosomes (24Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M.

In contrast, relatively little is known about their mammalian counterparts. Therefore, we sought to identify and characterize Vps proteins that may control intracellular vesicle trafficking events in mammalian cells. In the present study, we identify two human VPS gene homologues, hVPS11 and hVPS18, and characterize biochemical features and intracellular localizations of Class C Vps proteins. We show that mammalian Class C Vps proteins exist as a hetero-oligomeric complex primarily associated with late endosomes/lysosomes and that the complex interacts with syntaxin-7, suggesting that it has a role in SNARE complex assembly. The GenBankTM data base of human expressed sequence tags was searched using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae VPS11/PEP5/END1 sequences (8Dulic V. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Woolford C.A. Dixon C.K. Manolson M.F. Wright R. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1990; 125: 739-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the human expressed sequence tag clones (accession number AA385518) had a distant homology to the RING-H2 finger domain region of S. cerevisiae VPS11/PEP5/END1. Two oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (5′-AGCAGATTGCACAGGATGAG-3′ and 5′-CAGAGTCAATTTGTTGAAAA-3′) were designed and used to amplify a 395-base pair fragment using a HeLa cell cDNA template for PCR under standard conditions. Amplified fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently sequenced. The EcoRI-digested insert fragment from pGEM-T Easy vector was used as a probe for screening the human brain cDNA library constructed in λZAPII (gift from Dr. S. Nakanishi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Ten positive clones were obtained from 1 × 106 plaques screened. The clone carrying the longest insert was sequenced from both strands. hVPS18 was identified by searching the GenBankTM data base using S. cerevisiae VPS18/PEP3 sequences (11Preston R.A.

Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 5813-5824Crossref Google Scholar) andDrosophila deep orange sequences (20Shestopal S.A. Makunin I.V. Belyaeva E.S. Ashburner M. Zhimulev I.F. Mol. Gen.

Cell. 1999; 4: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A novel cDNA, designated KIAA1475 (GenBankTM accession numberAB040908) containing an open reading frame of 976 amino acids was found to be 34% identical to deep orange and 26% identical toS. cerevisiae VPS18/PEP3. The KIAA1475 clone was obtained from the KAZUSA DNA institute (Chiba, Japan). A hVPS11 cDNA fragment was excised using the BamHI restriction enzyme (1808 base pairs), and a hVPS18 cDNA fragment was excised using theSacI restriction enzyme (972 base pair). Fragments were random-primed radiolabeled (Life Technologies, Inc.) and hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight using human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (27Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged, full-length hVPS11, hVPS18, and rVPS33a were prepared using PCR with custom-designed oligonucleotide primers containing the appropriate restriction enzyme sites. To insert full-length hVPS11 downstream of the Myc- and HA-tagged sequence at the N-terminal end, a forward primer containing the EcoRI site upstream of the initiation codon (5′-CGGAATTCAAATGGCGGCCTACCTGCA-3′) and a reverse primer including theXhoI site downstream of stop codon (5′-CCTCGAGTTAAGTGCCCCTCCTGGA-3′) were used to amplify PCR products from a pBluescript SK(+)-hVPS11 template. PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and subsequently sequenced. TheEcoRI/XhoI-digested full-length hVPS11 was inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI site of the pMyc-CMV and pHA-CMV mammalian expression vectors (CLONTECH) to generate pMyc- and pHA-hVPS11, respectively. The N-terminally Myc- and HA-tagged hVPS18 constructs were also generated by PCR using oligonucleotide 5′-CGGAATTCCCATGGCGTCCATCCAT and 3′-CCGCTCGAGCTACAGCCAACTGAGC using the pBluescript II SK(+)-KIAA1475 clone as a template.EcoRI- and XhoI-digested full-length hVPS18 was inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI site of the pMyc-CMV and pHA-CMV mammalian expression vectors to generate pMyc- and pHA-hVPS18, respectively. A full-length rat VPS33a (GenBankTM accession number U35244) was amplified by PCR from rat total brain cDNAs. A forward primer containing theXhoI site upstream of the initiation codon (5′-CAGATCTCGAGCGATGGCGGCTCACCT) and a reverse primer containing theEcoRI site downstream of the stop codon (5′-CAGAATTCCTAGAAAGGCTTTTCCATGA) were used to amplify PCR products. The XhoI- and EcoRI-digested full-length rVPS33a was inserted into the XhoI and EcoRI site of the pEGFP-C1 mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH) to generate GFP-rVPS33a. The N-terminally Myc-tagged full-length human syntaxin-7 (GenBankTM accession number U77942) construct was generated by PCR using custom-designed oligonucleotide primers. The 5′ primer (CGGAATTCCCATGTCTTACACTCCA) and the 3′ primer (AATGCGGCCGCTCAGTGGTTCAATC) were used to amplify PCR products from a human cDNA brain library. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-7, HeLa, HEK 293, NRK, and BHK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Nippon Bio-Supply Center, Tokyo, Japan), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGENE 6 transfection regents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Peptides corresponding to the internal 20 amino acids of hVps11 (222IVSRDRKVSPKSEFTSRDSQ241) and 14 amino acids of hVps18 (426RPDSLLSEERVWEY439) were synthesized. The peptides were coupled to m-maleimidobenzoylN-hydroxysuccinimide ester-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as immunogens in rabbits. The polyclonal antiserum was affinity purified. Briefly, the immunogen peptides were linked to activated CH Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and polyclonal antiserum was affinity-purified by binding and elution from the Sepharose column. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 599–839 of hVPS16 was expressed in bacteria, purified, and used to raise antisera in rabbits. The polyclonal antiserum was affinity purified using the glutathioneS-transferase-hVps16 (599) fusion protein. The monoclonal antibodies for human early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing the transferrin receptor (CD71) and GFP (B-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing GFP were purchased from CLONTECH. A mouse monoclonal anti-Myc epitope (9E10) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). A rat monoclonal anti-HA (3F10) antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The mouse monoclonal antibody for lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp-1) was a gift from Dr. M. Fukuda (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The polyclonal antibodies for syntaxin-7 were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Wada (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity isolated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was purchased fromBIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Texas Red-conjugated affinity isolated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For immunofluorescence microscopy, COS-7 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.2% saponin (WAKO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 20 min, and nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% saponin, and 1% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 2 µg/ml affinity purified anti-hVps11, anti-hVps16, or anti-hVps18 antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% saponin and 1% normal goat serum for 2 h. After rinsing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h and then rinsed five times with PBS. Cells were mounted in Perma Fluor (Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA) and viewed under a CLSM2010 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped into ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min to lyse the cells. The cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were collected, and protein was quantitated. Supernatants were diluted into equal volumes of 2× SDS gel sample buffer (300 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 4/20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were incubated with anti-hVps11, anti-hVps16, and anti-hVps18 antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody binding was detected using the ECL protein detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications. HEK 293 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into 200 µl of PBS, and lysed by sonication. Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by spinning the lysate at 6,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane fractions (pellet). The pellets were resuspended in 200 µl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. Equal portions of the cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Membrane preparations were performed as described previously (28Hay J.C. Hirling H. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5671-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, three 10-cm culture dishes of confluent HEK 293 cells were scraped into ice-cold PBS and washed once, and the cells were spun down by brief centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture) and homogenized by brief sonication. Unlysed cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min. Postnuclear supernatants were divided into four aliquots (200 µl each) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl; 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 11.4; 5m urea; or 1% Triton X-100. These suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 min. After centrifugation, equal portions of each supernatant and pellet were diluted into equal volumes of 2× SDS gel sample buffer, and SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described above. For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture). Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined. Identical amounts of protein from each sample were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. After the removal of protein A/G-Sepharose by brief centrifugation, the solution was incubated with 2 µg each of anti-hVps11, anti-hVps16, anti-hVps18, polyclonal anti-GFP, monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies, or control IgGs for overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the antigen-antibody complex was accomplished by adding 40 µl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Sepharose-bound proteins were solubilized in 40 µl of 1× SDS gel sample buffer. Samples were separated and analyzed by 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. Western blots were detected with ECL detection kits. COS-7 cells transiently cotransfected with expression constructs encoding Myc-hVps11, HA-hVps18, and GFP-rVps33a. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture). Cells lysed by 15 passages through a 25 gauge needle. Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by spinning the lysate at 6000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The 0.5 ml of resulting supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column (HR 10/30) equilibrated in homogenization buffer prior to load. The column was run at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min usingÄKTA Explorer 10S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 1.0 ml of each fraction was collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analyses. The blots were incubated with anti-Myc, anti-HA, and anti-GFP antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Molecular weight was estimated by HMW marker kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify mammalian homologues of the yeast Class C VPSgenes, we searched the expressed sequence tag data base using the BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) with theS. cerevisiae Vps11p as a query. A human expressed sequence tag clone (GenBankTM accession number AA385518) fragment encoding a RING-H2 finger domain was identified. This cDNA fragment was used to probe a human brain cDNA library. Among the 10 positive clones, the longest open reading frame was 2823 base pairs, encoding a 941-amino acid polypeptide (Fig.1 A). A BLAST search for the non-redundunt protein data base using this open reading frame amino acid sequence as the query retrieved not only S. cerevisiae Vps11p but also homologues of other species at the high score range. In this report, we refer to this protein as human Vps11 (hVps11). The hVps11 shares 25% overall identity of amino acid sequence with S. cerevisiae Vps11p. Additionally, hVps11 shows a distant homology to proteins of unknown function fromArabidopsis thaliana (GenBankTM accession number AC007018), Neurospora crassa (accession numberAL355933), and Caenorhabditis elegans(accession number Z46794) with 39, 34, and 26% identity, respectively. The human protein homologue of yeast Vps18p, hVps18, was identified by searching the sequence data base using S. cerevisiae Vps18p and the Drosophila dor protein as a query. The KIAA1475 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AB040908) was found to contain an open reading frame of 976 amino acids (Fig. 1 B) that displays 34% overall identity Drosophila dor protein and 26% identity with S. cerevisiae Vps18p. Furthermore, hVps18 is homologous to the A. thaliana T12C242 protein (GenBankTM accession number AC025417), the C. elegans Pep3-related protein (accession number U23522), and theCandida albicans Vps18-related protein (accession number AJ289080) with 30, 25, and 20% identity, respectively. Northern blot analyses were performed to determine tissue distribution of hVPS11 and hVPS18 mRNAs. The hVPS11 mRNA (an ∼3.2-kilobase pair transcript) was ubiquitously expressed, with the lowest levels in the lung and liver (Fig.2 A). The mRNA expression pattern of hVPS18 (an ∼4.0-kilobase transcript) was similar to that of hVPS11 (Fig. 2 B). To determine cellular expression patterns for hVps11, hVps16, and hVps18, Western blot analyses were performed on lysates from the following cell lines: HeLa, HEK 293, COS-7, NRK, and BHK. Anti-hVps11 and anti-hVps18 antibodies recognized major bands of ∼112 and 116 kDa, respectively, in lysates from all the cell lines tested (Fig. 3, A and B). The anti-hVps18 antibody recognized an additional higher molecular mass band in COS-7 and BHK cells and an ∼88-kDa protein band in the HeLa, HEK 293, COS-7, and NRK cell lines. This 88-kDa band may represent a hVps18 degradation product because it was not detected in membrane fractionation experiments (see Fig.4 A).

Here we present the first site-directed mutagenesis study on the dissociation of the high affinity complex between CaM and full-length CaM kinase II. We measured dissociation kinetics of CaM and CaM kinase II proteins by using a fluorescently modified CaM that is sensitive to binding to target proteins. In low [Ca2+], the phosphorylated mutant kinase F293A and the CaM mutant E120A/M124A exhibited deficient trapping compared with wild-type. In high [Ca2+], the CaM mutations E120A, M124A, and E120A/M124A and the CaM kinase II mutations F293A, F293E, N294A, N294P, and R297E increased dissociation rate constants by factors ranging from 2.3 to 116. We have also identified residues in CaM and CaM kinase II that interact in the trapped state by mutant cycle-based analysis, which suggests that interactions between Phe293 in the kinase and Glu120 and Met124 in CaM specifically stabilize the trapped CaM-CaM kinase II complex. Our studies further show that Phe293 and Asn294 in CaM kinase II play dual roles, because they likely destabilize the low affinity state of CaM complexed to unphosphorylated kinase but stabilize the trapped state of CaM bound to phosphorylated kinase."

Understanding its regulation provides a basis for determination of the mechanisms controlling chamber-specific gene expression in heart development. The observed chamber distribution results from repression of slow MyHC3 gene expression in the ventricles. A binding site, the vitamin D response element (VDRE), for a heterodimer of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoic X receptor α (RXRα) within the slow MyHC3 promoter mediates chamber-specific expression of the gene. Irx4, anIroquois family homeobox gene whose expression is restricted to the ventricular chambers at all stages of development, inhibits AMHC1, the chick homolog of quail slow MyHC3, gene expression within developing ventricles. Repression of the slow MyHC3 gene in ventricular cardiomyocytes by Irx4 requires the VDRE. Unlike VDR and RXRα, Irx4 does not bind directly to the VDRE. Instead two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays show that Irx4 interacts with the RXRα component of the VDR/RXRα heterodimer and that the amino terminus of the Irx4 protein is required for its inhibitory action. These observations indicate that the mechanism of atrial chamber-specific expression requires the formation of an inhibitory protein complex composed of VDR, RXRα, and Irx4 that binds at the VDRE inhibitingslow MyHC3 expression in the ventricles."

Upon its assembly into dodecamers, pAPI is wrapped by double-membrane saccular structures for its further transport within vesicles that fuse with the vacuolar membrane and release their content in the vacuolar lumen. Targeting of API to the vacuole occurs by two alternative transport routes, the cvt and the autophagy pathways, which although mechanistically similar specifically operate under vegetative growth or nitrogen starvation conditions, respectively. We have studied the role of Yol082p, a protein identified by its ability to interact with API, in the transport of its precursor to the vacuole. We show that Yol082p interacts with mature API, an interaction that is strengthened by the amino extension of the API protein. Yol082p is required for targeting of pAPI to the vacuole, both under growing and short term nitrogen starvation conditions. Absence of Yol082p does not impede the assembly of pAPI into dodecamers, but precludes the enclosure of pAPI within transport vesicles. Microscopy studies show that during vegetative growth Yol082p is distributed between a cytoplasmic pool and a variable number of 0.13–0.27-µm round, mobile structures, which are no longer observed under conditions of nitrogen starvation, and become larger in cells expressing the inactive Yol082ΔC32p, or lacking Apg12p. In contrast to the autophagy mutants involved in API transport, a Δyol082 strain does not lose viability under nitrogen starvation conditions, indicating normal function of the autophagy pathway. The data are consistent with a role of Yol082p in an early step of the API transport, after its assembly into dodecamers.

Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and delivered to the vacuole by one of two alternative routes that operate under distinct physiological conditions: the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt), in nutrient-rich conditions, and the autophagy (Apg) pathway, under starvation conditions (2Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The Cvt pathway is constitutive and biosynthetic, while autophagy is nonselective and degradative and is induced to survive periods of nutrient limitation (3Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, the two pathways share many molecular components and both involve sequestration by double-membrane saccular structures of unknown origin that capture the load, close into vesicles, and then fuse with the vacuole (4Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A major difference between these pathways appears to be the size and content of the transport vesicles. The Cvt vesicles exclude cytoplasm and are smaller than autophagosomes that engulf bulk cytoplasm and even organelles (2Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Strikingly, despite all these differences, targeting of API to the vacuole is specific and saturable, both in vegetative growth conditions and under nitrogen deprivation (3Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), although the molecular details of its selective recognition and capture remain essentially unknown. Previous studies have shown that pAPI recognition by the transport machinery involves its prepro-amino extension (5Seguı́-Real B. Martı́nez M. Sandoval I.V.

Seguı́-Real B. Silles E. Mazón M.J. Sandoval I.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this study we report that Yol082p, a protein shown to interact physically with pAPI in a two-hybrid screening performed with the whole yeast genome (10Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar), mediates API loading into transport vesicles and targeting to the vacuole. We also show that Yol082p interacts with API by a process that does not only involve the prepro-amino extension but also the mature part of the API protein. Yol082p is distributed between the cytoplasm and distinct round mobile structures.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that Yol082p, identified in a whole-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions as an API-interacting protein (10Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar), is required for vacuolar targeting and conversion of pAPI into mAPI, both in vegetative growth and under short term nitrogen starvation conditions.The interaction of Yol082p with pAPI and mAPI, but not with the prepro-amino extension of the precursor, is particularly interesting given the role of the latter in the transport of pAPI to the vacuole and the observation that it is necessary and sufficient for the transport of the reporter protein GFP from the cytoplasm to the vacuole (9Martı́nez E. Seguı́-Real B. Silles E. Mazón M.J. Sandoval I.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that transport of API to the vacuole requires additional transport determinants localized in the mature part, outside its amino extension. In addition, the stronger two-hybrid interaction of Yol082p with pAPI, as compared with mAPI, suggests that either Yol082p interacts physically with the amino extension in the context of the native protein or, alternatively, that the extension is required for proper folding and exposure of the transport determinants contained in the mature part of API to Yol082p. Clearly, further research is required to determine whether the determinants involved in its interaction with Yol082p are specific of API.Our studies on the processing of pAPI in wild-type and Δyol082 cells show that Yol082p is required for targeting and conversion of pAPI into mAPI in the vacuole, both under vegetative growth and short periods of nitrogen starvation. The rescue of the API processing defect in Δyol082 cells transformed with Yol082p expressed from an inducible promoter unambiguously shows the involvement of Yol082p in the vacuolar import of pAPI.The block in API vacuolar processing shown byΔyol082 cells incubated for short periods in SD(−N) medium is in contrast to the ability of mutants with impeded API transport, such as apg13, vac8,cvt3, aut2, and aut7, to overcome the pAPI accumulation soon after their shift to medium without nitrogen (2Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,24Scott S.V. Nice D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I.

Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is interesting that the inhibition of the pAPI processing in Δyol082 cells is partially reversed by the extension of the nitrogen starvation period. Under these conditions, mAPI is detected after 12 h in SD(−N) medium, and maturation proceeds slowly to reach a plateau at ∼30% in 16 h. These observations strongly suggest that Yol082p is involved in the rapid and specific capture of pAPI by the autophagosomes developed after a short starvation period, but not in the slow and unspecific capture that occurs with the engulfment of large portions of the cytoplasm after prolonged starvation.Apg mutants (26Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) often show a correlation between the effect of the mutation in autophagosome biogenesis and the loss in viability under nitrogen starvation, so that mutants with defective autophagosome nucleation die earlier upon nitrogen deprivation (25Abeliovich H. Dunn W.A.J. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this context it is, therefore, interesting that although Yol082p appears to function in an early step in the pathway of API transport, theΔyol082 mutant is completely starvation-resistant. This resistance to starvation suggests again that Yol082p is not essential for autophagosome biogenesis.Regarding the API transport step in which Yol082p is involved, we have shown that pAPI assembly into dodecamers takes place normally in the mutant cells. We also show that in the absence of Yol082p, the interaction of the oligomerized pAPI with the sequestering double-membrane sacs appears to be affected. The proteinase K protection assay performed with metabolically labeled protein reveals that, in the mutant strain, the newly synthesized pAPI remains unprotected in the cytoplasm after 2 h of its synthesis, which is in contrast to the wild-type. This difference suggests that Yol082p may work in the recognition of pAPI by the wrapping membranes or, alternatively, by closing these into vesicles. The recovery of the protease-sensitive pAPI extracted from apg5,apg7, apg9, aut7/apg8, andcvt3 cells defective in biogenesis of the API transport vesicles (19Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.P. Baba M.

Furthermore, the equilibrium is dramatically shifted by changes in the cell growing conditions, the ability of the cells to use the autophagy pathway, and the functional activity of GFP-Yol082p. Although we lack direct evidence on the meaning of the above changes in distribution, some of these observations suggest that the pool organized into YR structures could be actively engaged in the transport of pAPI to the vacuole by the Cvt pathway. With regard to this, the disappearance of the YR structures from cells incubated for 2 h in SD(−N) medium strongly suggests that they are not needed under conditions in which the autophagy pathway is activated. The difference between the rapid processing of pAPI in mutants with a defective Cvt pathway and the inability ofΔyol082 cells to process pAPI, when they were incubated in SD(−N) medium, strongly suggests that transport of pAPI by the autophagy pathway requires the disassembly of the YR structures. This may be related to the decrease in the cytoplasmic pool of GFP-Yol082p and the enhanced visibility of YR structures observed inΔapg12 cells incubated with SD or SD(−N) medium, changes that could reflect a blockage of the Cvt/Apg pathways after the transport step mediated by Yol082p. Also interesting is the disappearance of the cytoplasmic protein and the increase in size of YR structures observed in wild-type cells expressing the functionally inactive Yol082ΔC32p-GFP. This shift in equilibrium could again be consistent with our view that YR structures are involved in protein transport through the Cvt pathway, since the functionally inactive protein may cause the jam of the transport machinery and/or the accumulation of the transported material. A second alternative is the possibility that the deletion of the last 32 residues may shift the protein equilibrium toward the YR structures, which could also explain the insensitivity of these to the incubation of cells in SD(−N) medium. Obviously, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.Because of its behavior as a Cvt protein we propose to rename Yol082p as Cvt19p.Further research is required to characterize the transport step mediated by Yol082p, a step that appears to lay after the assembly of pAPI into dodecamers and before the wrapping of Cvt complexes by the saccular structures. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the vacuolar hydrolase leucine aminopeptidase I (API)1 is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor (pAPI) (1Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J.

Under these conditions, mAPI is detected after 12 h in SD(−N) medium, and maturation proceeds slowly to reach a plateau at ∼30% in 16 h. These observations strongly suggest that Yol082p is involved in the rapid and specific capture of pAPI by the autophagosomes developed after a short starvation period, but not in the slow and unspecific capture that occurs with the engulfment of large portions of the cytoplasm after prolonged starvation.Apg mutants (26Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar) often show a correlation between the effect of the mutation in autophagosome biogenesis and the loss in viability under nitrogen starvation, so that mutants with defective autophagosome nucleation die earlier upon nitrogen deprivation (25Abeliovich H. Dunn W.A.J. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this context it is, therefore, interesting that although Yol082p appears to function in an early step in the pathway of API transport, theΔyol082 mutant is completely starvation-resistant. This resistance to starvation suggests again that Yol082p is not essential for autophagosome biogenesis.Regarding the API transport step in which Yol082p is involved, we have shown that pAPI assembly into dodecamers takes place normally in the mutant cells. We also show that in the absence of Yol082p, the interaction of the oligomerized pAPI with the sequestering double-membrane sacs appears to be affected. The proteinase K protection assay performed with metabolically labeled protein reveals that, in the mutant strain, the newly synthesized pAPI remains unprotected in the cytoplasm after 2 h of its synthesis, which is in contrast to the wild-type. This difference suggests that Yol082p may work in the recognition of pAPI by the wrapping membranes or, alternatively, by closing these into vesicles.

Furthermore, the equilibrium is dramatically shifted by changes in the cell growing conditions, the ability of the cells to use the autophagy pathway, and the functional activity of GFP-Yol082p. Although we lack direct evidence on the meaning of the above changes in distribution, some of these observations suggest that the pool organized into YR structures could be actively engaged in the transport of pAPI to the vacuole by the Cvt pathway. With regard to this, the disappearance of the YR structures from cells incubated for 2 h in SD(−N) medium strongly suggests that they are not needed under conditions in which the autophagy pathway is activated. The difference between the rapid processing of pAPI in mutants with a defective Cvt pathway and the inability ofΔyol082 cells to process pAPI, when they were incubated in SD(−N) medium, strongly suggests that transport of pAPI by the autophagy pathway requires the disassembly of the YR structures. This may be related to the decrease in the cytoplasmic pool of GFP-Yol082p and the enhanced visibility of YR structures observed inΔapg12 cells incubated with SD or SD(−N) medium, changes that could reflect a blockage of the Cvt/Apg pathways after the transport step mediated by Yol082p. Also interesting is the disappearance of the cytoplasmic protein and the increase in size of YR structures observed in wild-type cells expressing the functionally inactive Yol082ΔC32p-GFP. This shift in equilibrium could again be consistent with our view that YR structures are involved in protein transport through the Cvt pathway, since the functionally inactive protein may cause the jam of the transport machinery and/or the accumulation of the transported material. A second alternative is the possibility that the deletion of the last 32 residues may shift the protein equilibrium toward the YR structures, which could also explain the insensitivity of these to the incubation of cells in SD(−N) medium. Obviously, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.Because of its behavior as a Cvt protein we propose to rename Yol082p as Cvt19p.Further research is required to characterize the transport step mediated by Yol082p, a step that appears to lay after the assembly of pAPI into dodecamers and before the wrapping of Cvt complexes by the saccular structures. In this study we have shown that Yol082p, identified in a whole-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions as an API-interacting protein (10Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3896) Google Scholar), is required for vacuolar targeting and conversion of pAPI into mAPI, both in vegetative growth and under short term nitrogen starvation conditions. The interaction of Yol082p with pAPI and mAPI, but not with the prepro-amino extension of the precursor, is particularly interesting given the role of the latter in the transport of pAPI to the vacuole and the observation that it is necessary and sufficient for the transport of the reporter protein GFP from the cytoplasm to the vacuole (9Martı́nez E. Seguı́-Real B. Silles E. Mazón M.J. Sandoval I.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that transport of API to the vacuole requires additional transport determinants localized in the mature part, outside its amino extension. In addition, the stronger two-hybrid interaction of Yol082p with pAPI, as compared with mAPI, suggests that either Yol082p interacts physically with the amino extension in the context of the native protein or, alternatively, that the extension is required for proper folding and exposure of the transport determinants contained in the mature part of API to Yol082p. Clearly, further research is required to determine whether the determinants involved in its interaction with Yol082p are specific of API. Our studies on the processing of pAPI in wild-type and Δyol082 cells show that Yol082p is required for targeting and conversion of pAPI into mAPI in the vacuole, both under vegetative growth and short periods of nitrogen starvation. The rescue of the API processing defect in Δyol082 cells transformed with Yol082p expressed from an inducible promoter unambiguously shows the involvement of Yol082p in the vacuolar import of pAPI. The block in API vacuolar processing shown byΔyol082 cells incubated for short periods in SD(−N) medium is in contrast to the ability of mutants with impeded API transport, such as apg13, vac8,cvt3, aut2, and aut7, to overcome the pAPI accumulation soon after their shift to medium without nitrogen (2Baba M.

https://openalex.org/W2140969130,"Friend of GATA (FOG)-2 is a multi-zinc finger transcriptional corepressor protein that binds specifically to GATA4. Gene targeting studies have demonstrated that FOG-2 is required for normal cardiac morphogenesis, including the development of the coronary vasculature, left ventricular compact zone, and heart valves. To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which FOG-2 regulates these cardiac developmental programs, we screened a mouse day 11 embryo library using a yeast two-hybrid interaction trap with the fifth and sixth zinc fingers of FOG-2 as bait. Using this approach, we isolated clones encoding the orphan nuclear receptors chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) 2 and COUP-TF3. COUP-TF2-null embryos die during embryonic development with defective angiogenesis and cardiac defects, a pattern that partly resembles the FOG-2-null phenotype. The interaction between COUP-TF2 and FOG-2 in mammalian cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins from transfected COS-7 cells. The sites of binding interaction between COUP-TF2 and FOG-2 were mapped to zinc fingers 5 and 6 and fingers 7 and 8 of FOG-2 and to the carboxyl terminus of the COUP-TF proteins. Binding to COUP-TF2 was specific because FOG-2 did not interact with the ligand-binding domains of retinoid X receptor α, glucocorticoid receptor, and peroxisome proliferating antigen receptor γ, which are related to the COUP-TF proteins. Full-length FOG-2 markedly enhanced transcriptional repression by GAL4-COUP-TF2(117–414), but not by a COUP-TF2 repression domain mutant. Moreover, FOG-2 repressed COUP-TF2dependent synergistic activation of the atrial natriuretic factor promoter by both GATA4 and the FOG-2-independent mutant GATA4-E215K. Taken together, these findings suggest that FOG-2 functions as a corepressor for both GATA and COUP-TF proteins."

The initial event of FasL-induced apoptosis is the multimerization of Fas by the membrane-bound form of its ligand. This receptor oligomerization leads to the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex comprising the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT, which binds with its C-terminal death domain to the death domain of Fas, and the FADD-interacting initiator caspase-8, which interacts with the N-terminal death effector domain (DED) of FADD via its own DEDs (14Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The death-inducing signaling complex-induced proximity of procaspase-8 molecules leads to autoproteolytic activation and initiation of the apoptotic caspase cascade (15Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar). This process, however, can be inhibited by FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP) (16Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H.

FLIP exists in two splice forms: FLIP-long (FLIP-L) comprising two N-terminal DEDs and an enzymatically inactive pseudo caspase domain and FLIP-short (FLIP-S) containing only the two DEDs.

We show here that stimulation of Jurkat T-cells with FasL or the closely related TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) leads to up-regulation of the proto-oncogene c-fos, a target gene of mitogenic stimuli. The FasL/TRAIL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos is regulated by FLIP and requires FADD and caspase-8, but the protease activity of the latter is dispensable. Chemicals and secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma, and cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. The Jurkat T-cell lines that are deficient for FADD and caspase-8 and the respective parental control cell line as well as Jurkat clones overexpressing FLIP-L and FLIP-S, respectively, were described elsewhere (16Thome M.

An additional Jurkat clone (JB-6) deficient in caspase-8 expression was a kind gift from Shigekazu Nagata (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan). All Jurkat clones were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified 5.0% CO2 environment. The caspase-8-specific mAb was a gift from Klaus Schulze-Osthoff (Universität Münster, Münster, Germany). The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). The anti-FLIP rat mAb Dave-2 was from Apotech (Lausanne, Switzerland), and the anti-c-Fos polyclonal rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany). Jurkat cells (10 × 106) were treated with the indicated reagents for the given times, and total RNAs were isolated with the RNA INSTAPURE kit (Eurogentech, Seraing, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The presence of transcripts of the indicated apoptosis-related genes as well as the internal controls L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed using a custom Multi-Probe template set (PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany). Probe synthesis, hybridization, and RNase treatment were performed with the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay System (PharMingen). Protected transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (5%) and visualized on a PhosphorImager with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For Western blot analysis of caspase-8 and FLIP lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture stock solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the supplier. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. For detection of c-Fos protein nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere (26Wajant H. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Muhlenbeck F. Kreuz S. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24357-24366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis. Proteins (50 µg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) dry milk, washed, and incubated with anti-caspase-8 mouse mAb, anti-FLIP rat mAb Dave-2 (Apotech, Epalinges, Switzerland) or anti-c-Fos rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rat/rabbit IgG (Sigma) and nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. c-Jun N-terminal kinase assays were performed using an anti-JNK1 rabbit antiserum for immunoprecipitation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun as substrate. The in vitrokinase assay has been described elsewhere (34Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Clark E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activity was measured in caspase activity assay buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% sucrose) with 20 µm Ac-DEVD-AMC (Calbiochem) as substrate. Activity was measured with a luminescence spectrometer (Aminco-Bowman Series2) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 450 nm. Specificity of caspase-dependent Ac-DEVD-AMC cleavage was regularly controlled with the caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk and DEVD-fmk. For monitoring AP-1 activity in transiently transfected Jurkat cells, 5 × 106 cells were electroporated (250 V, 1800 microfarad) with 30 µg of a AP-1-driven luciferase reporter gene plasmid (pAP1-Luc, Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). After 1 day of recovery, the cells were stimulated for 8 h with cross-linked FasL in the presence of z-VAD-fmk or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and finally luciferase activity was determined using a Lucy2 96-well luminometer (Anthos, Krefeld, Germany). Recent studies of FADD-deficient mice (35Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) or transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant-negative deletion mutant of FADD lacking its N-terminal DED (36Zornig M.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) showed unexpectedly that mitogen or T-cell receptor-induced proliferation of T-cells in vitro was impaired. Because FADD is involved in death receptor signaling and T-cell receptor stimulation induces up-regulation of FasL (14Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) and TRAIL (39Mariani S.M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1492-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we have asked here whether Fas or TRAIL receptors might be engaged in the mitogenic signaling pathways of T-cells. A potential role of Fas in mitogenic signaling pathways was also suggested from reports demonstrating Fas-dependent proliferation of fibroblasts (28Aggarwal, B. B., Singh, S., LaPushin, R., and Totpal, K. (1995)FEBS Lett. 3645–3648.Google Scholar, 29Freiberg R.A. Spencer D.M. Choate K.A. Duh H.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Khavari P.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 215-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Jelaska A. Korn J.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the expression of the early mitogenic response marker c-Fos in Jurkat T-cells upon TRAIL and FasL stimulation using RNase protection analysis assays with a Multi-Probe template set containing apoptosis- and proliferation-related templates including c-Fos. FasL induced c-Fos mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells (Fig.1A). Induction of c-Fos was independent from the activation of caspase-8 and the subsequent triggering of the apoptotic machinery because the pan caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk had no inhibitory effect on FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos (Fig. 1 B) at concentrations at which processing of procaspase-8 and activation of caspase-3 were completely blocked (Fig.1 D). Up-regulation of c-Fos mRNA by the well known potent c-Fos inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was readily detectable already after 30 min, peaked after 1 h, and reached almost background levels after 3 h (data not shown). In contrast, FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos occurred with delayed kinetics, starting to become detectable after 1 h and reaching a plateau after 6 h (Fig. 1 C). Maximal phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced c-Fos mRNA levels were 5 times higher than maximal mRNA levels induced by FasL (Fig. 1 E). Similarly, maximal c-Fos protein induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was 5.5 times higher than maximal c-Fos protein induced by FasL (Fig. 1 E). However, one should take into account that prolonged FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos might have another quality compared with the rapid transient up-regulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Some recent reports have demonstrated the capability of Fas to induce NF-κB activation (25Ponton A. Clement M.V. Stamenkovic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8991-8995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Wajant H. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Muhlenbeck F. Kreuz S. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24357-24366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We here therefore tested whether this pathway is involved in c-Fos up-regulation. Overexpression of a nondegradable mutant of I-κB did not affect Fas-induced up-regulation of c-Fos in Jurkat T-cells (data not shown) suggesting that the NF-κB pathway is not involved in this process. The c-fos gene is a target of AP-1 that is transcriptionally up-regulated when AP-1 is activated by JNKs (40Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, JNK is not involved in FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos because the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely prevented FasL-mediated JNK activation (Fig.1 F) but not induction of c-Fos mRNA (Fig. 1,A and C). AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor composed of Jun and Fos (or activating transcription factor) subunits. We therefore looked at whether FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos is accompanied by activation of an AP-1 reporter gene plasmid. Although phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was able to up-regulate the AP-1 reporter gene more than 35-fold, we found no evidence for any activation after FasL stimulation (Fig. 1 G). However, this was not unexpected because AP-1 activity depends on phosphorylation of its transactivation domain by JNK, but FasL does not induce this pathway in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1 F). FADD and caspase-8 are essential components of the ligand-induced Fas receptor-signaling complex (14Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). We have further analyzed FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos in Jurkat clones deficient in these molecules (32Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 33Juo P. Woo M.S. Kuo C.J. Signorelli P. Biemann H.P. Hannun Y.A. Blenis J.

In two independent FADD-deficient Jurkat clones we found no significant c-Fos up-regulation upon treatment with FasL (Fig.2A and data not shown). Moreover, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat clones were also found to be deficient in FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos (Fig. 2 Band data not shown). In two clones, we observed that induction of c-Fos by phorbol ester was unaffected (data not shown). Because the pan caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk had no effect on FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos but in parallel the lack of caspase-8 completely prevented this event, our data point to a signaling function of caspase-8 that is independent from its proteolytic activity. A function of caspase-8 to act as a signal-transducing molecule independent of its role as an effector caspase of the apoptotic program was also observed in two recent studies that demonstrated activation of the NF-κB and JNK pathways in response to transient overexpression of caspase-8 (42Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 43Chaudhary P.M. Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Hood L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19211-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the caspase-8-dependent activation of the JNK pathway shown in the latter study was not activated by FasL in Jurkat cells. Indeed as already mentioned, FasL-induced JNK activation was completely blocked by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1 E) in Jurkat cells. Thus, because JNK and NF-κB activation are not critically involved in FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos (see above), these data suggest that caspase-8 links a novel non-caspase-activating signaling pathway to Fas. Data from the literature indicate that the death domain-containing TRAIL receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 engage similar or at least closely related intracellular signaling pathways as Fas leading to the induction of apoptosis (14Krammer P.H.

We have found that the same is true for up-regulation of c-Fos. Like FasL, TRAIL induced c-Fos in Jurkat cells via a FADD/caspase-8-dependent pathway independent of the protease activity of caspase-8 (Fig. 2 B). FLIP is a major regulator of apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways engaged by FasL and TRAIL. We have therefore analyzed the FasL/TRAIL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos in Jurkat clones (Fig.3A) stably expressing the long slice form FLIP-L or the short splice form FLIP-S. Up-regulation of c-Fos was found to be differentially regulated by FLIP-S and FLIP-L (Fig. 3, B and C). In Jurkat FLIP-L cells, FasL- and TRAIL-induced c-Fos up-regulation was totally blocked (Fig. 3,B and C). However, in Jurkat FLIP-S cells FasL- and TRAIL-induced c-Fos expression was not reduced but was even enhanced (Fig. 3, B and C). We regularly found a weak but significant induction of TNF mRNA by TRAIL and FasL (Fig.1), opening the possibility that TRAIL- and FasL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos is mediated by the induction of endogenous TNF. However, in contrast to TRAIL and FasL, the closely related TNF did not affect c-Fos expression in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Thus, although TRAIL, FasL, and TNF act via stimulation of members of the death domain-containing receptor subgroup of the TNF receptor superfamily, only TRAIL and FasL, but not TNF, induce a common pathway leading to up-regulation of c-Fos. Based on the data described in this study and data from the literature, a model of Fas/TRAIL signaling appears possible in which the expression level of FLIP and in particular the balance of FLIP-S and FLIP-L expression determines the outcome of Fas and TRAIL receptor triggering. It has been shown that in the absence of FLIP expression FasL/TRAIL induces formation of a FADD-containing complex that “catalyzes” repeated cycles of procaspase-8 (p55/53) recruitment, proximity-induced activation of p55/53 to the p18/p10 form of caspase-8 via a p43/41 intermediate, and release of the receptor-bound prodomain of caspase-8 (24Scaffidi C.

Recruitment of FLIP-L arrested this cycling death-inducing signaling complex in a state containing procaspase-8 or the p43/41 intermediate product of caspase-8 processing and FLIP-L (24Scaffidi C.

It is now tempting to speculate that in this FLIP-L/FLIP-S-arrested state the receptor-signaling complexes of Fas, TRAIL-R1, and TRAIL-R2 acquire new signaling capabilities that are not related to apoptosis induction. According to our data, a FLIP-S-arrested complex may acquire the capability to interact with a yet unknown protein X that couples this FLIP-S-arrested complex to the activation of the c-fosgene (Fig. 4 B). This protein X might be replaced by TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins and/or receptor interacting protein when FLIP-S is substituted by FLIP-L because FLIP-L, but not FLIP-S, activates NF-κB (42Hu W.H.

It has been shown that c-Fos is an important regulator of cell proliferation and has a specific function in thymocyte development (50Wang Z.Q. Ovitt C. Grigoriadis A.E. Mohle-Steinlein U. Ruther U. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1992; 360: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that FasL/TRAIL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos is part of the proliferative response of thymocytes and T-cells upon T-cell receptor triggering, which is impaired in FADD-deficient mice (35Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) or transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant-negative deletion mutant of FADD (36Zornig M.

However, inlpr mice harboring a defective Fas molecule orgld mice expressing dysfunctional FasL, no inhibition of T-cell proliferation was found. This is at the first glance contradicting to a role of Fas in T-cell proliferation. However, it cannot be ruled out that in these mice TRAIL or other death ligands substitute for Fas/FasL interaction with regard to c-Fos-induction but not with regard to apoptosis induction. Furthermore, a recent study showing that lpr mice in a nonselecting background exert reduced proliferation in thymic T-cell development suggests that Fas/FasL contributes to thymocyte proliferation under defined circumstances (51Kurasawa K. Hashimoto Y. Kasai M. Iwamoto I. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 106: S19-S31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have also shown that FasL augmented CD3-induced proliferation, whereas Fas-Fc blocked T-cell proliferation (49Kataoka T. Budd R.C. Holler N. Thome M. Martinon F. Irmler M.

In contrast to the c-Fos activation described here, T-cell proliferation was dependent on active caspases in these studies (53Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp.

Thus, up-regulation of c-Fos may reflect a death receptor-mediated proliferative response that is, in contrast to other components of the proliferative response, caspase-independent. However, it cannot be ruled out that the FasL/TRAIL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos shown in this study is not related to T-cell receptor-dependent proliferation of T-cells.

Purified syndecan-1 ectodomains were analyzed for disaccharide composition and the GAG-protein linkage region after digestion with bacterial lyases. The HS chains contained predominantly a nonsulfated unit with smaller proportions of two monosulfated, two disulfated, and a trisulfated unit, whereas CS chains were demonstrated for the first time to bear GlcUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) as a major component as well as GlcUA-GalNAc, GlcUA-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), and an E disaccharide unit GlcUA-GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) as minor yet appreciable components. Two kinds of linkage region tetrasaccharides, GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl and GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl(2-O-phosphate), were found for the HS chains in a molar ratio of 55:45. In marked contrast, an additional sulfated tetrasaccharide, GlcUA-Gal(4-O-sulfate)-Gal-Xyl, was demonstrated only for the CS chains, and the unmodified phosphorylated and sulfated components were present at a molar ratio of 55:26:19. The present study thus provided conclusive evidence for the hypothesis that 4-O-sulfation of Gal is peculiar to CS chains in contrast to the phosphorylation of Xyl, which is common to both HS and CS chains. These modifications may be required for biosynthetic maturation of the linkage region tetrasaccharide sequence, which is a prerequisite for creating the repeating disaccharide region of GAG chains and/or biosynthetic selective chain assembly of CS and HS chains."
https://openalex.org/W1967039991,"Upon physiological stress, families of stress response genes are activated as natural defense mechanisms. Here, we show that induction of specific inflammatory genes is significantly dysregulated and altered in the heart of aged (24–26-month-old)versus young (4-month-old) mice experimentally challenged with a bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1.5 mg/kg of body mass). Whereas the LPS-mediated induction of cardiac mRNA for tumor necrosis factor α or inducible nitric-oxide synthase showed no age-associated differences, the induction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 was modestly extended with aging, and the induction of IL-6 was significantly prolonged with aging. This age-associated phenomenon occurred gradually from 4 to 17 months of age and became more evident after 23 months of age. The age-associated augmentation of the cardiac IL-6 induction was also dramatic at the protein level. Immunohistochemically, the LPS-induced cardiac IL-6 was localized mainly in the microvascular walls. Aged but not young mice showed a high mortality rate during these experiments. These results demonstrate that endotoxin-mediated induction of specific inflammatory genes in cardiovascular tissues is altered with aging, which may be causally related to the increased susceptibility of aged animals to endotoxic stress.

Although these inflammatory mediators act primarily for the host defense, they also cause pathophysiological conditions characteristic of sepsis. Upon infection with Gram-negative bacteria, released endotoxin (e.g. lipopolysaccharide, LPS)1 stimulates monocytes/macrophages to produce such initial proinflammatory cytokines as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β). These two in turn elicit a subsequent release of secondary inflammatory mediators, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and IL-6 (1Lamy M. Deby-Dupont G. Intensive Care Med. 1995; 21 Suppl. 2: 250-257Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TNFα is known to function synergistically with IL-1β to cause myocardial depression during acute septic shock (2Kumar A. Thota V. Dee L. Olson J. Uretz E. Parrillo J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Induction of iNOS and subsequent production of nitric oxide are known to be important mediators for systemic vasodilatation and hypotension during septic shock (3Grocott-Mason R.M. Shah A.M. Intensive Care Med. 1998; 24: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 promotes neutrophil-myocardial or neutrophil-vascular endothelial cell adhesion, which causes cardiovascular tissue injury due to the cytotoxic activity of neutrophils (4Smith C.W. Entman M.L.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). IL-6, a multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cells, is known to play important roles in immunological/inflammatory responses, hematopoiesis (7Akira S. Kishimoto T. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 25-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and synthesis of liver acute phase proteins (8Castell J.V. Gomez-Lechon M.J. David M. Andus T. Geiger T. Trullenque R. Fabra R. Heinrich P.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). High levels of IL-6 appear to have deleterious effects during systemic inflammation, because a reduced endotoxic mortality rate was observed in mice after treatment with anti-IL6 antibodies (9Starnes Jr., H.F. Pearce M.K. Tewari A. Yim J.H. Zou J.C. Abrams J.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4185-4191PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 is also known to exert a negative inotropic effect on myocardial tissues (10Finkel M.S. Oddis C.V. Jacob T.D. Watkins S.C. Hattler B.G. Simmons R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar,11Finkel M.S. Hoffman R.A. Shen L. Oddis C.V. Simmons R.L. Hattler B.G. Am. J. Cardiol. 1993; 71: 1231-1232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of young mice with LPS results in a rapid induction of mRNA for IL-1β and TNFα, followed by a strong induction of IL-6 and ICAM-1 in the heart. The IL-6 induction in the heart was more intense than in any other tissue examined, including brain, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar). Aging is characterized by an altered immune function and stress response (13Papaconstantinou J.

Handbook of the Biology of Aging. 4th Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 355-392Google Scholar). Cardiovascular function during stress also declines with aging (15Lakatta E.G. Schneider E.L. Rowe J.W. Handbook of the Biology of Aging. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 181-218Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that induction of stress response genes in the heart may be altered with aging. In the present study, we show that LPS-induced expression of specific genes, including those for IL-1β, ICAM-1, and IL-6 in particular, is significantly prolonged and augmented in the hearts of aged mice compared with young mice. We also show that the endotoxin-induced cardiac IL-6 is mainly localized to microvascular walls in the heart. Male C57BL/6, BALB/c, and CB6F1 mice were obtained from colonies of the National Institute on Aging through Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The newly arrived animals were kept at least 10 days in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and fed a standard chow diet ad libitum before experiments. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sigma) at a dose of 1.5 µg/g of body mass. In some experiments, in which young and aged mice did not show a significant difference in their body masses, all mice were injected with the same amount of LPS (50 µg, equivalent to ∼1.5 µg/g of body mass). After injection, animals, together with control non-injected mice, were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the indicated time points, and tissues were quickly dissected. At the same time, other major organs including brain, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and intestines were harvested and examined. Mice that exhibited any signs of abnormality, such as injury and tumor, were eliminated from the experiments. These procedures were approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Total RNA was isolated using guanidine/phenol, and Northern blot hybridization was performed as described previously (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar). Slot blot hybridization analysis for the IL-6 mRNA was performed using a Manifold II slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) with the same hybridization condition as Northern blot analysis. Cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from mouse hearts as described previously (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar). The cytokine concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using a commercial kit specific for mouse IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 (Endogen, Inc., Woburn, MA). The detection limits of this kit were 3, 10, and 7 pg/ml, respectively. Cryo-sections of mouse hearts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-rat IL-6 antibody SC-1267 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After serial washings with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature. The sections were developed with ABC reagent (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 45 min. After incubation in Fast Red (Sigma, F-4648) containing 1 mm levamisole, the slides were mounted for light microscopy (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether cardiovascular gene expression during the inflammatory response is altered by aging, we compared the endotoxin-mediated induction of mRNAs for several inflammatory genes in the hearts of young (4-month-old) versus aged (24-month-old) C57BL/6 mice. Mice were injected with 50µg of LPS, and sacrificed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h thereafter together with control non-injected mice (four mice per time point). During these experiments, we confirmed the previously reported higher mortality rate in aged mice by endotoxic stress (16Tateda K. Matsumoto T. Miyazaki S. Yamaguchi K. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 769-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Tanabe O. Akira S. Kamiya T. Wong G.G. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3875-3881PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10% of aged mice died within 24 h after LPS injection, whereas no young mice died during the same time period. We analyzed the RNA from the hearts by Northern blot hybridization and examined the induction of inflammatory genes, including IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, ICAM-1, and iNOS. As shown in Fig.1, the IL-1β and TNFα mRNA levels peaked at 1 h, the ICAM-1 and IL-6 mRNA levels peaked at 3 h, and the iNOS mRNA levels peaked at 6 h post-injection in both young and aged mice. The kinetics confirmed that the two early inflammatory genes, IL-1β and TNFα, are induced before the secondary inflammatory mediator genes, ICAM-1, IL-6, and iNOS, in the heart. Whereas the TNFα and iNOS mRNA levels did not show significant age-associated differences, the induced IL-6 mRNA levels after the peak time point were significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice. There was also an age-associated elevation in IL-1β and ICAM-1 mRNA levels at certain time points, although not to the same extent as in IL-6. These results demonstrate that aging alters the induction patterns of specific inflammatory genes in the heart during endotoxic stress. The high levels of IL-6 mRNA observed in the aged mice may be caused by a prolonged induction of the gene in all aged mice or possibly by the inclusion of one aged mouse or a few aged mice that were induced to produce exceptionally high levels of IL-6 mRNA. To distinguish these possibilities, we measured the IL-6 mRNA level in each individual young or aged mouse throughout the time course. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, induction of IL-6 mRNA in young hearts consistently occurred at 3 h after LPS injection, and the mRNA levels came back to near the undetectable basal level by 6 h. The standard deviations for the young mice were small at all time points, suggesting that induction of the IL-6 gene in the heart is tightly regulated in young animals. On the other hand, the IL-6 mRNA induction varied substantially among individual aged mice, suggesting that induction of the IL-6 gene is dysregulated in aged hearts. At 3 h after LPS injection, the IL-6 mRNA was induced very strongly in one aged mouse and was not induced at all in two others, suggesting that the IL-6 induction in response to LPS can be augmented or delayed in some aged mice. From 6 to 12 h after LPS injection, all the aged mice showed high levels of induced IL-6 mRNA, equivalent to the average peak level in young mice. Even at 24 h post-injection, high levels of the IL-6 mRNA were still detected in some of the aged mice. Because persistently high levels of IL-6 mRNA were commonly seen in aged mice, we concluded that induction of the cardiac IL-6 mRNA in response to endotoxic shock is prolonged in aged animals. To determine whether the age-associated differential induction of IL-6 mRNA is specific to the C57BL/6 mouse or is common among other strains, we conducted similar experiments using three different mouse strains, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and their hybrid CB6. For this experiment, we compared the induced IL-6 mRNA levels in the hearts of young (4–7-month-old)versus aged (24–28-month-old) mice 6 h after LPS injection (n = 4). We chose this time point because it was a time where IL-6 mRNA levels differ significantly in young and aged C57BL/6 mice. As demonstrated in Fig.2, the LPS-induced IL-6 mRNA levels were significantly higher than those in young hearts, not only in C57BL/6 mice but also in BALB/c and CB6 mice. These results suggest that the age-associated extended induction of the IL-6 gene in response to LPS is not mouse strain-specific. We sought to determine at what age the endotoxin-mediated induction of the cardiac IL-6 changes, i.e. whether this is a gradual change or one that occurs at a specific age. We compared the cardiac IL-6 mRNA levels at 6 h post-LPS injection among four different age groups: 4-, 10-, 16–17-, and 23–27-month old (n = 6–8 per group). As shown in Fig.3, the age-associated overexpression of the IL-6 gene occurred in some mice by the age of 10 months, became significant at age 16–17 months, and was even more dramatic at 23 months and later. Statistically significant differences were found between the 4- and 23–27-month-old groups (p < 0.001) and also between the 4- and 16–17-month-old groups (p< 0.01) but not between the 4- and 10-month-old groups (p > 0.3). Thus, we conclude that the age-associated elevation of IL-6 gene induction is not evident until at least 10 months of age, but it occurs by 16 months of age and becomes greater with increasing age. In these experiments we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to compare the cytokine protein levels in the hearts of young versus aged mice that were injected with 50 µg of LPS and sacrificed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h thereafter, together with control non-injected mice (three to six mice per time point). The IL-6 levels at 0 and 1 h were ∼20 pg/mg of protein or less in both young and aged mice. In young mice, a rapid increase and subsequent decline in the cardiac IL-6 protein levels were seen at 3 and 6 h, respectively, demonstrating that the induction of IL-6 protein synthesis follows the pattern of induced mRNA levels (see Figs. 1 A and 4). The average IL-6 protein levels in the aged hearts were 7.5–35-fold higher than those in the young hearts from 3 to 24 h after LPS injection. All the aged mice showed higher cardiac IL-6 levels than the young mice from 3 to 12 h after LPS injection. Even 24 h after LPS injection, one of the aged mice still showed a higher IL-6 level than the average peak IL-6 level (at 3 h) in young mice. Using the same protein samples, we also measured IL-1β and TNFα levels in youngversus aged mice hearts. IL-1β induction was modestly elevated in aged mice compared with young mice (2.2-fold elevation at the peak level; Fig. 4 B), but TNFα induction did not show any difference in young versusaged mice (data not shown). The data for these two proteins also agree with the mRNA data (Fig.1) that IL-1β showed moderate age-associated elevation whereas TNFα induction was not affected by aging. These results demonstrate that, during endotoxic stress, the age-associated overexpression of specific inflammatory cytokines occurs not only at the mRNA level but also at the protein level. We performed immunohistochemical analyses to localize IL-6 in the young and aged mouse hearts during endotoxic stress. Young (4-month-old) and aged (26-month-old) C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (1.5 µg/g of body mass) and sacrificed 6 h later, and frozen heart sections were prepared. Immunohistochemical analyses using anti-IL-6 antibody detected IL-6 mostly in nonmyocardial cells, particularly in the microvascular walls of hearts from both young and aged mice, suggesting that IL-6 is expressed mostly in vascular endothelial cells (Fig.5, A and B). IL-6 was also detected in relatively large vessels in both young and aged mice (Fig. 5 C) and in a small number of myocardial cells only in aged mice (Fig. 5 B). In the present study, we clearly demonstrated a significantly elevated and prolonged induction of IL-6 in aged mouse hearts during endotoxic stress. Induction of the IL-1β and ICAM-1 genes was also elevated or extended in the aged mice, although the extent was not as dramatic as for IL-6. IL-1β is an important inducer of both IL-6 and ICAM-1 (4Smith C.W. Entman M.L. Lane C.L. Beaudet A.L. Ty T.I. Youker K. Hawkins H.K. Anderson D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar); so the elevated IL-1β expression may be responsible for the prolonged induction of the ICAM-1 gene in aged mice. However, the moderate elevation of IL-1β expression alone cannot explain the dramatic overexpression of IL-6 in the aged mice. Because the LPS-mediated induction of a subset of inflammatory genes was altered in aged mice, we propose that the augmented induction of these genes probably is not caused by a decreased rate of clearance of endotoxin from aged animals. The augmented induction of the IL-6 gene may be due to an increased transcriptional rate for the gene and/or a decreased rate of its mRNA degradation in aged tissues. The regulatory region of the IL-6 gene contains putative binding sites for such stress-activated transcription factors as nuclear factor κB and nuclear factor/IL-6 (NF/IL6) (17Tanabe O. Akira S. Kamiya T. Wong G.G. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3875-3881PubMed Google Scholar) whose DNA binding activities increase with aging in mouse heart and liver, respectively (18Helenius M. Hanninen M. Lehtinen S.K. Salminen A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 19Hsieh C.C. Xiong W. Xie Q. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. An M.R. Reisner P.D. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1479-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such an age-related increase in the activation of transcription factors may enhance the transcriptional rate of the IL-6 gene and increase pool levels for its mRNA. On the other hand, there have been studies suggesting that the expression of several inflammatory genes is regulated by mRNA stability and that the stabilization is altered by aging and inflammatory signals (20Kumar S. Millis A.J. Baglioni C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Akashi M. Loussararian A.H. Adelman D.C. Saito M. Koeffler H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is yet to be determined whether stability of the IL-6 mRNA in the cardiovascular tissues increases with age. Our results demonstrated that the age-associated overexpression of IL-6 in the heart occurs more dramatically at the protein level than at the mRNA level. The age-associated increases in average peak levels (3 h after LPS injection) were ∼1.5- and 10-fold at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively (Figs. 1 C and 4). The difference in the magnitude of increase between the mRNA and protein levels raises the possibility that either the translational rate or protein stability of IL-6 is increased in the aged mouse heart. Whereas the IL-6 mRNA is solely derived from cardiac expression, the IL-6 protein may be produced in other tissues and reach the heart via the circulation. Indeed, the activity of plasma IL-6 after injection with LPS was reportedly higher in aged rats than in young rats (22Foster K.D. Conn C.A. Kluger M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: R211-R215PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although we have recently shown that the heart induces the highest level of IL-6 mRNA among all major tissues in young mice during endotoxic stress (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar), extra-cardiac tissues may also show profound age-associated overexpression of IL-6 as well. Our previous study using in situ hybridization andin vitro cell cultures demonstrated that cardiac IL-6 is expressed mainly by nonmyocardial cells via IL-1β action during endotoxic stress. In that study, we could not identify which nonmyocardial cells (i.e. fibroblasts, macrophages, vascular endothelial cells, or smooth muscle cells) express IL-6 (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that cardiac IL-6 was mostly localized to microvascular walls, suggesting that microvascular endothelial cells are the major cell source of IL-6 produced during endotoxic stress. It has been demonstrated that cultured human endothelial cells express IL-6 strongly in response to IL-1β (23Sironi M. Breviario F. Proserpio P. Biondi A. Vecchi A. Van Damme J. Dejana E. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 549-553PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-6 was also identified in relatively large vascular tissues, vascular smooth muscle cells may also express IL-6. According to previous in vitrostudies, macrophage cultures from the elderly produced less IL-6 than those from young subjects in response to LPS treatment (24Delpedro A.D. Barjavel M.J. Mamdouh Z. Faure S. Bakouche O. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas whole aorta cultures from aged rats produced more IL-6 than those from young rats after LPS treatment (25Belmin J. Bernard C. Corman B. Merval R. Esposito B. Tedgui A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H2288-H2293PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells are probably the major cells that overproduce IL-6 in the aged heart during endotoxic stress. Interestingly, IL-6 expression was detected in a small population of myocardial cells from LPS-treated aged, but not young, mice. This myocardial cell-derived IL-6 in aged mouse hearts may be attributed at least partly to the age-associated overproduction of cardiac IL-6. Because myocardial cells reportedly express IL-6 in vitro under hypoxic conditions (26Yamauchi-Takihara K. Ihara Y. Ogata A. Yoshizaki K. Azuma J. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), the IL-6 detected in myocardium of aged mice may be an indication of tissue ischemia during endotoxic shock. The role of IL-6 during systemic inflammation is complex. An early study demonstrated a reduced LPS-induced mortality rate in mice treated with anti-IL-6 antibodies, clearly suggesting that a high level of IL-6 is harmful during endotoxic shock (9Starnes Jr., H.F. Pearce M.K. Tewari A. Yim J.H. Zou J.C. Abrams J.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4185-4191PubMed Google Scholar). However, a more recent study showed a somewhat elevated LPS-induced mortality rate in IL-6 (−/−) knockout mice, suggesting that IL-6 may also have a beneficial role during endotoxic shock (27Xing Z. Gauldie J. Cox G. Baumann H. Jordana M. Lei X.F. Achong M.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Indeed, as we have recently shown, IL-6 may have a self-regulatory function to suppress its own inducers (TNFα and IL-1β) in the heart during endotoxic stress (12Saito H. Patterson C. Hu Z. Runge M.S. Tipnis U. Sinha M. Papaconstantinou J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2241-H2248PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and is often considered “a double-edged sword.” Upon physiological stress such as infection, an appropriate (and probably beneficial) amount of IL-6 is rapidly produced and presumably functions to protect tissues. As seen in Fig. 1, such induction is tightly regulated and does not last long in healthy young animals. On the other hand, uncontrolled overexpression of IL-6 is obviously harmful, because various transgenic mouse models overexpressing IL-6 develop various pathologies, including plasmacytosis (28Suematsu S. Matsuda T. Aozasa K. Akira S. Nakano N. Ohno S. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7547-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), adrenal hyperplasia (29Raber J. O'Shea R.D. Bloom F.E. Campbell I.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9473-9480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cardiac hypertrophy (30Hirota H. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), muscle atrophy (31Fujita J. Tsujinaka T. Ebisui C. Yano M. Shiozaki H. Katsume A. Ohsugi Y. Monden M. Eur. Surg. Res. 1996; 28: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and growth retardation (32De Benedetti F. Alonzi T. Moretta A. Lazzaro D. Costa P. Poli V. Martini A. Ciliberto G. Fattori E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar); this variety possibly results from the different tissues and levels of overexpression and the tissue distribution pattern of the IL-6 receptor. ICAM-1 promotes neutrophil-myocyte adhesion (5Youker K. Smith C.W. Anderson D.C. Miller D. Michael L.H. Rossen R.D. Entman M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and IL-6 stimulates neutrophils to produce hydrogen peroxide (33Yuan L. Inoue S. Saito Y. Nakajima O. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, overproduction of ICAM-1 and IL-6 in aged tissues during inflammation may cause elevated activation of neutrophils and resulting oxidative stress, which may lead to cardiovascular cell injury. In our study, mice were treated with a single LPS injection. However, in clinical septic conditions during infection, LPS is released continuously; so the duration of overexpression of these genes and resulting effects in aged animals may be far greater than that observed in our experimental model. The elderly show a significantly elevated mortality rate during septic shock after bacterial infection. Although the precise mechanisms for this increase in susceptibility to sepsis are largely unknown, mortality in elderly septic patients often depends on the physiological reserve and stress tolerance of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems (34Stengle J. Dries D. Crit. Care Nurs. Clin. North Am. 1994; 6: 421-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Streat S.J. Plank L.D. Hill G.L. World J. Surg. 2000; 24: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). During sepsis, cascades of inflammatory response mediate various cardiovascular dysfunctions, including vascular endothelial cell damage, vascular permeabilization, vasodilatation, hypotension, and myocardial depression (36Baldwin K.M. Davey S.S. Morris S.E. Burger M. McCance K.L. Huether S.E. Pathophysiology: The Biologic Basis for Disease in Adults and Children. Mosby, Inc., St. Louis, MO1998: 1570-1601Google Scholar). Persistently high levels of serum IL-6 reportedly predict high mortality in septic patients (1Lamy M. Deby-Dupont G. Intensive Care Med. 1995; 21 Suppl. 2: 250-257Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar,37Thijs L.G. Hack C.E. Intensive Care Med. 1995; 21 Suppl. 2: 258-263Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 38Damas P. Ledoux D. Nys M. Vrindts Y. De Groote D. Franchimont P. Lamy M. Ann. Surg. 1992; 215: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 39Simpson A.J. Smith M.D. Weverling G.J. Suputtamongkol Y. Angus B.J. Chaowagul W. White N.J. van Deventer S.J. Prins J.M. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, augmented induction of IL-1β, IL-6, and ICAM-1 in aged mouse hearts may be causally associated with the high mortality rate of aged mice during endotoxic stress. Endotoxin-mediated induction of TNFα and nitric oxide in plasma was reportedly increased modestly by aging (2-fold and 26%, respectively), and pretreatment with anti-TNFα antibody reduced LPS mortality rate in both young and aged mice, suggesting that TNFα has an important role in LPS mortality (40Chorinchath B.B. Kong L.Y. Mao L. McCallum R.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1525-1530PubMed Google Scholar). However, because LPS-mediated induction of TNFα and iNOS in the heart was not affected by aging, they may not be the primary factors contributing to the age-associated cardiovascular dysfunction and high mortality during systemic inflammation. IL-6 forms a complex with its specific receptor and a membrane glycoprotein (gp130) to exert its activity through two known signal pathways; one activates the transcription factor STAT3 via the Janus tyrosine kinases, and the other activates NF/IL6 (or CAAT/enhancer-binding protein) transcription factors via Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Several stress response genes are induced by IL-6 via these gp130 pathways (41Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 42Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Therefore, overexpression of IL-6 in aged cardiovascular tissues may result in overexpression of various stress response genes. Identification of such stress response genes should provide important information on altered biochemical mechanisms in aged animals in response to endotoxic stress. In conclusion, IL-6 is strongly induced in the heart, mostly in the microvascular walls, during endotoxic stress, and this induction is significantly augmented and prolonged with aging. The cardiac gene expression of IL-1β and ICAM-1 is also elevated or extended with aging during endotoxic stress. We propose such increased intensity and/or duration of the expression of inflammatory genes as important characteristics of aging that may be causally associated with the elevated susceptibility in aged subjects to inflammatory stress.

Yamamoto for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1980243384,"We recently reported that the endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes ETA and ETB are targeted to distinct intracellular destinations upon agonist stimulation (Bremnes, T., Paasche, J. D., Mehlum, A., Sandberg, C., Bremnes, B., and Attramadal, H. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 17596–17604). The ETA receptor was shown to follow the recycling route of transferrin, whereas ETBis targeted to lysosomes for degradation. In the present study we have investigated the mechanisms of ET receptor subtype-specific targeting to distinct intracellular trafficking pathways. Truncation mutants of the ETA and ETB receptors with deletions of the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail distal to the palmitoylation site were found to mediate inositol phosphate accumulation and to internalize upon agonist stimulation, although internalization occurred at a slower rate as compared with the wild-type receptors. However, the truncated ETA receptor was no longer able to undergo recycling. Rather, both truncation mutants were recognized by β-arrestin for recruitment to endocytosis and were sorted to lysosomes by a dynamin-dependent internalization pathway. Furthermore, studies of chimeric ETA and ETBreceptors where the cytoplasmic tail of ETA was swapped with the corresponding domain of ETB, and vice versa, revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of ETB is required for efficient lysosomal sorting and that signals for targeting to recycling reside in the cytoplasmic tail of the ETAreceptor. We recently reported that the endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes ETA and ETB are targeted to distinct intracellular destinations upon agonist stimulation (Bremnes, T., Paasche, J.

Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10305) Google Scholar) are mediated by the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ETA and ETB (2Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In the vasculature, ETA receptors residing on the smooth muscle cells mediate prolonged vasoconstriction (3Marsault R. Feolde E. Frelin C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C687-C693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ETB receptors, which are on the plasma membrane of endothelial cells, are primarily considered to cause NO-mediated vasodilatation (4Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, considerable evidence now also supports a role for ETB receptors in the clearance of plasma ET-1 from the circulation (5Dupuis J. Goresky C.A. Fournier A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6Fukuroda T. Fujikawa T. Ozaki S. Ishikawa K. Yano M. Nishikibe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of these distinct physiological responses, we recently characterized the intracellular trafficking pathways of the ETA and ETB receptors (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Upon agonist stimulation both receptor subtypes are rapidly internalized by mechanisms that depend on G protein-coupled receptor kinase, arrestin, clathrin, and dynamin. Interestingly, the internalized ETAand ETB receptors initially appear to share a common path into Rab5-positive early endosomes. However, the two receptor subtypes are subsequently targeted to different intracellular fates. Whereas the ETA receptor follows the recycling pathway through the pericentriolar recycling compartment and reappears at the plasma membrane, the ETB receptor is directed to lysosomes for degradation. In terms of physiological effects, rapid recycling of the ETA receptor may provide the basis for reestablishment of the signaling response, and thus for the sustained vasoconstriction mediated through this receptor. Conversely, lysosomal targeting of the ETB receptor is consistent with a role for this receptor subtype in the clearance of ET-1 from the circulation. In this respect, it was recently also demonstrated that ET-1 is cotransported with ETB receptors to lysosomes (10Oksche A. Boese G. Horstmeyer A. Furkert J. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Rosenthal W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1104-1113PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms that allow for sorting of GPCRs to recycling versus degradation in lysosomes are unknown. However, recent evidence obtained with the substance P receptor and the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) indicates that the signals for sorting may reside in the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail (11Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the latter report analysis of chimeric substance P and PAR-1 receptors demonstrated that the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domains of these receptors contained information critical for receptor-specific targeting to recycling or lysosomal degradation, respectively. The aims of the present study were to investigate the mechanisms of ET receptor subtype-specific targeting to distinct intracellular trafficking pathways, i.e. recycling in the case of the ETA receptor and lysosomal sorting in the case of the ETB receptor. The kinetics of ET receptor internalization and recycling were investigated by monitoring 125I-ET-1 trafficking in the absence and presence of Rab protein mutants known to interfere with the recycling process. The data provided in the present study corroborate the evidence that ETA receptors follow the recycling pathway through the pericentriolar recycling compartment via a transport route controlled by Rab5 and Rab11. To elucidate the role of the carboxyl-terminal domains of the ET receptors in intracellular trafficking, truncation mutants of the ETAand ETB receptors with deletions of the cytoplasmic tail were constructed and analyzed in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Furthermore, chimeric ET receptors where the carboxyl-terminal domains of ETA and ETB were interchanged were subjected to studies of agonist- dependent internalization and intracellular trafficking. Strikingly, the carboxyl-terminally truncated ETA receptor lost the ability to undergo recycling. Moreover, the chimeric ETB receptor with the carboxyl-terminal tail of ETA was capable of recycling, whereas the chimeric ETA receptor with the carboxyl-terminal domain of ETB was rapidly targeted to lysosomes. Both ET receptor subtypes with deletions of the cytoplasmic tail were targeted to lysosomal compartments in an agonist-dependent manner, although internalization occurred at a slower rate as compared with the wild-type receptors. However, overexpression of β-arrestin was able to rescue the reduced rate of internalization. Thus, although the cytoplasmic tail of ETBaugments the rate of internalization, lysosomal trafficking appears to be a default pathway. Sorting to recycling, on the other hand, appears to depend on a signal residing in carboxyl-terminal domain of the ETA receptor. Subcloning of the cDNAs of the human endothelin receptors ETA and ETB into pcDNA1 has been described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged wild-type dynamin and the dynamin K44A mutant (12van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) in pRK5 were gifts from Dr. C. Van Koppen (University of Essen, Germany). Rat β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 were in the expression vector pCMV5 (13Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their respective mutants V53D and V54D in pcDNA1 were from Dr. M. G. Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC). The Rab11 S25N and Rab5 Q79L cDNA constructs in pcDNA1 were from Dr. H. Stenmark (The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway). Subcloning of the human transferrin receptor cDNA into pcDNA1 has been described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Truncation mutants of ETA (ETAT) and ETB (ETBT) with deletion of the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail were constructed in pcDNA1 by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis replacing Gln-390 and Gln-406, respectively, by stop codons and introduction of a downstreamXbaI restriction site. The primers for ETAT were 5′-ccctcttcatttaagccg-3′ and 5′-gctctagagcctagtaacagcagcagcagaggcatgactgg-3′ (XbaI site underlined), and the primers for ETBT were 5′-gatcccaatagatgtgaac-3′ and 5′-gctctagagcctagcaccagcagcataagcatgacttaaag-3′. TheEcoRI-XbaI fragments of the wild-type receptors in pcDNA1 were replaced by theEcoRI/XbaI-digested polymerase chain reaction products. The cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis using the dideoxy chain termination method. Construction of ETA-GFP and ETB-GFP in pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) has been described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ETAT-GFP and ETBT-GFP in pEGFP-N1 were made by introducing a BamHI site at the carboxyl-terminal truncation site for in frame cloning of the ETAT and ETBT sequences into pEGFP-N1. The primers for construction of ETAT-GFP were 5′-ccctcttcatttaagccg-3′ and 5′-cgcggatcccggtaacagcagcagcagaggcatgactgg-3′ (BamHI site underlined), and the primers for ETBT-GFP were 5′-gatcccaatagatgtgaac-3′ and 5′-cgcggatcccggcaccagcagcataagcatgacttaaag-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI for insertion intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested ETA-GFP and ETB-GFP. The chimeric receptors ETA/B and ETB/A were generated by interchanging the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the ETA and ETBreceptors at the conserved EcoRI site located in the 7th transmembrane domain of the receptor cDNAs. Briefly, theEcoRI-XbaI fragment of pcDNA1-ETB was exchanged with the corresponding fragment of pcDNA1-ETA and vice versa. The ETA/B-GFP and ETB/A-GFP constructs were made by similarly interchanging the cytoplasmic tails of ETA-GFP and ETB-GFP in pEGFP-N1. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC number CRL-61) were maintained in Ham's F-12 Kaighn's modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μg/ml garamycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were grown to 40–60% confluency before transient transfection using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For fluorescence microscopy experiments, cells were plated onto glass coverslips before LipofectAMINE transfection. Internalization of ETA and ETB receptors was determined using 125I-ET-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as we have described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transfection the cells were placed on ice, washed, and preincubated in binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% glucose) before binding of 50 pm125I-ET-1 in binding buffer for 3 h at 4 °C to obtain equilibrium binding. The cells were washed extensively in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound radioligand before incubation in prewarmed binding buffer at 37 °C for various time points. The cells were subsequently treated two times for 10 min at 4 °C with 0.5 m acetic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.5 (ETA) or 50 mm glycine-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, pH 2.2 (ETB), to strip off surface-bound radioligand. Acid-stripped cells were then lysed for 10 min in 1 m NaOH, before the fraction of surface-bound ET-1 in the acid wash and the fraction of internalized ET-1 in the lysate were determined by γ-spectrometry. Internalized receptor was calculated as the fraction of radioactivity that remained associated with the cells after acid wash. To verify the expression of wild-type and mutant arrestins, Western blot analysis of samples from transiently transfected CHO cells was performed. The immunoblots were processed as described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), using antisera against rat β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 (13Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Determination of ET-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation was performed after transfection of CHO cells as described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were metabolically labeled with myo-[3H]inositol for 24 h and subsequently treated with 20 mm LiCl in cell culture medium with or without 0.1 μm ET-1 with six parallels at each time point. Total inositol phosphates were separated by anion exchange chromatography on Dowex AG1–8x columns, and3H was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Radioligand binding analysis of membrane preparations of transiently transfected CHO cells was performed according to Elshourbagy et al. (14Elshourbagy N.A. Korman D.R. Wu H.L. Sylvester D.R.

Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, equilibrium binding conditions were obtained after 1 h at 37 °C, and saturation binding analysis was performed using 2–1000 pm125I-ET-1 in the absence or presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ET-1. The samples were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters presoaked with 0.05% bovine serum albumin to remove unbound ligand. After three washes in 0.5m NaCl, the filters were subjected to γ-spectrometric analysis. For analysis of ET receptor trafficking, transfected CHO cells on glass coverslips were placed on ice and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before binding of ET-1 (200 nm, 1 h at 4 °C) in binding buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution with 20 mm Hepes, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% glucose). The cells were subsequently incubated for various time points at 37 °C for internalization of the receptor-ET-1 complexes. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before mounting onto object slides using ProLong (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The specimens were investigated using a Zeiss Axiovert-100 fluorescence microscope with a 100 × 1.3 oil immersion objective. Images were processed and overlaid using Photoshop 5.5 and the Metamorph Imaging System. Loading of the pericentriolar recycling compartment with 25 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated transferrin (Tf) (Molecular Probes) was performed in CHO cells cotransfected with ET receptor-GFP cDNA and cDNA for the human transferrin receptor as described previously (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For labeling of lysosomes, LDL-DiI (Molecular Probes) was bound to the cells together with ET-1, and internalization was performed for 60 min allowing receptor-bound LDL to enter lysosomal compartments. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before mounting of the samples and investigation by fluorescence microscopy. In Fig. 1 A is shown the characteristic kinetics of ETA and ETB receptor internalization as determined by125I-ET-1 uptake at 37 °C in transiently transfected CHO cells. As shown, the time course of 125I-ET-1 internalization is principally different in ETAreceptor-expressing cells as compared with ETBreceptor-expressing cells. Whereas internalization of the ETB receptor is characterized by a monophasic time course that asymptotically increases toward a maximum level, the ETA receptor displays a biphasic internalization curve. Internalization of the ETA receptor peaks after 10 min of agonist stimulation and subsequently declines from 10 to 60 min. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, the sum of surface-bound and internalized 125I-ET-1 was constant during the time course of the assays for both the ETA and the ETB receptors. Thus, a decline in the fraction of internalized ETA receptors in the time span from 10 to 60 min reflects recycling of ligand-bound ETA back to the cell surface. To substantiate the kinetic evidence of ETAreceptor recycling and to provide further insights into the mechanisms of ETA receptor recycling, we employed Rab protein mutants known to interfere with the recycling process. Rab11 S25N, a dominant negative form of Rab11 retained in the GDP-bound state, has been shown to block transport from early endosomes to the recycling compartment (15Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), and Rab5 Q79L, a GTPase defective mutant of Rab5, has been shown to slow down the recycling process by increasing homotypic fusion of early endosomes (16Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 is shown how these Rab mutants affect the kinetics of ETA (Fig.2 A) and ETB receptor (Fig. 2 B) internalization in CHO cells. Strikingly, cotransfection of Rab11 S25N altered internalization of the ETA receptor from a biphasic event consistent with recycling to a monophasic process similar to that characteristic of the ETB receptor. A less dramatic, albeit similar alteration in the kinetics of ETA receptor internalization was observed with cotransfection of Rab5 Q79L. The alterations in the kinetics of ETA receptor recycling caused by Rab11 S25N and Rab5 Q79L can be visualized even more clearly by transforming the data obtained from the time course of ETA receptor internalization in Fig. 2 A. Thus, in Fig. 2 C changes in the rate of ETA receptor externalization during the time span from 10 to 30 min after initiation of agonist-induced internalization were calculated. As shown, in CHO cells transfected with ETA receptor alone, the level of surface receptors increased, consistent with net externalization during this time. In cells cotransfected with Rab5 Q79L or Rab11 S25N externalization of ETA receptor in the same time span was substantially blunted or even reversed. Conversely, neither Rab5 Q79L nor Rab11 S25N altered the rate of ETB receptor internalization during the same time span. However, the initial rate of ETB receptor internalization appeared to be lower in the presence of Rab11 S25N. Taken together, these data show that when the recycling pathway is inhibited by mutant Rab proteins, the typical biphasic internalization curve of recycling ETA receptors shifts to a monophasic process characteristic of terminally internalized ETB receptors. Hence, the distinct intracellular pathways of the ETA and the ETBreceptors appear to reflect on the internalization kinetics of these receptors.Figure 2Effects of Rab mutants on the kinetics of ETA and ETB receptor internalization.

Thus, both mutants retained the clusters of cysteines representing the putative sites of palmitoylation (17Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T. Muller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21589-21596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, the ligand binding characteristics of these truncated receptors did not differ significantly from those of wild-type ETA and ETB receptors. Furthermore, deletion of the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail did not appear to alter the capacity of the ET receptors to activate phospholipase C. As shown in Fig.3, C and D, ET-1-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates was nearly identical for the truncated receptors and their wild-type counterparts. However, agonist-stimulated internalization of ETAT and ETBT was substantially impaired as compared with wild-type ETA and ETB, respectively (Fig. 3, Aand B). The biphasic internalization curve characteristic for the recycling ETA wild-type receptor was abolished in agonist-stimulated internalization of ETAT. Thus, the monophasic internalization of ETAT provides evidence that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail of ETA prevents recycling of this receptor subtype. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of ETB reduced the rate and extent of agonist-stimulated internalization of this receptor subtype, indicating that the mechanism for fast sorting of ETB may reside in its carboxyl-terminal tail.Table ICarboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of the wild-type ET receptors, the carboxyl-terminally truncated receptors ETA T and ETB T, and the chimeras ETA/B and ETB/A ▾ETAwt-NSCINPIALYFVSKKFKNCFQSCLCCCCYQSKSLMTSVPMNGTSIQWKNHDQNNHNTDRSSHKDSMNETB/A-NSCINPIALYFVSKKFKNCFQSCLCCCCYQSKSLMTSVPMNGTSIQWKNHDQNNHNTDRSSHKDSMNETAT-NSCINPIALYFVSKKFKNCFQSCLCCCCYETBwt-NSCINPIALYLVSKRFKNCFKSCLCCWCQSFEEKQSLEEKKQSCLKFKANDHGYDNFRSSNKYSSSETA/B-NSCINPIALYLVSKRFKNCFKSCLCCWCQSFEEKQSLEEKKQSCLKFKANDHGYDNFRSSNKYSSSETBT-NSCINPIALYLVSKRFKNCFKSCLCCWCAmino acids of the 7th transmembrane region are indicated in bold, and the clusters of cysteines representing the putative sites of palmitoylation are underlined.

To investigate the intracellular trafficking pathways of the truncation mutants ETAT and ETBT, we constructed GFP fusion proteins of these receptor mutants for fluorescence microscopy studies. ETAT-GFP and ETBT-GFP were transiently transfected into CHO cells and subjected to analysis of agonist-stimulated internalization. The GFP-tagged wild-type receptors ETA-GFP and ETB-GFP were analyzed in parallel for comparison. ETA-GFP colocalized with red fluorescent transferrin in the pericentriolar recycling compartment after 15 min of ET-induced internalization (Fig. 4,A–C) consistent with our previous report (9Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ET-induced internalization of ETAT-GFP, however, was associated with spread endosome-like structures throughout the cytoplasm with only minor colocalization in the recycling compartment (Fig. 4, D–F). This finding indicates that the transport route of the carboxyl-terminally truncated ETA receptor differs from its wild-type counterpart. To investigate whether the spread vesicular distribution of internalized ETAT was consistent with transport to lysosomes, we labeled the lysosomal compartments of ETA-GFP- or ETAT-GFP-transfected cells with red fluorescent LDL (DiI-LDL). DiI-LDL was bound to the cells simultaneously with ET-1 at 4 °C, and internalization was performed at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.5, A–C, ETA-GFP was able to recycle efficiently, and no colocalization with LDL in lysosomes was seen after 60 min of internalization. However, the spread endosome-like structures of internalized ETAT-GFP demonstrated extensive colocalization with red fluorescent LDL (Fig. 5, D–F). ETB-GFP was not found to enter the recycling compartment (Fig. 4, G–I), and the same was the case for the truncated ETBT-GFP (Fig. 4,J–L). Rather, both ETB-GFP (Fig. 5,G–I) and ETBT-GFP (Fig. 5, J–L) were found to accumulate in LDL-positive lysosomes after 60 min of internalization. Thu"

They are involved in inhibiting excitability and contribute to regulating important physiological functions such as cardiac frequency and secretion of hormones. The functional cardiac (K(ACh)) channel activated by Gi/Go-coupled receptors such as muscarinic M2 or purinergic A1 receptors is supposed to be composed of the subunits GIRK1 and GIRK4 in a heterotetrameric (2:2) fashion. In the present study, we have manipulated the subunit composition of the K(ACh) channels in cultured atrial myocytes from hearts of adult rats by transient transfection of vectors encoding for GIRK1 or GIRK4 subunits or GIRK4 concatemeric constructs and investigated the effects on properties of macroscopic IK(ACh). Transfection with a GIRK1 vector did not cause any measurable effect on properties of IK(ACh), whereas transfection with a GIRK4 vector resulted in a complete loss in desensitization, a reduction of inward rectification, and a slowing of activation. Transfection of myocytes with a construct encoding for a concatemeric GIRK42 subunit had similar effects on desensitization and inward rectification. Following transfection of a tetrameric construct (GIRK44), these changes in properties of IK(ACh) were still observed but were less pronounced. Heterologous expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric GIRK4 resulted in robust currents activated by co-expressed A1and M2 receptors, respectively. These data provide strong evidence that homomeric GIRK4 complexes form functional Gβγ gated ion channels and that kinetic properties of GIRK channels, such as activation rate, desensitization, and inward rectification, depend on subunit composition.

The cardiac channel complex is supposed to be composed of GIRK1 (Kir3.1) and GIRK4 (Kir3.4) subunits in a heterotetrameric (2:2) fashion (5Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30524-30528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas neuronal channels contain, apart from GIRK1, the subunits GIRK2 or GIRK3. Recent evidence suggests, however, that GIRK4 is also expressed in the brain (6Wickman K. Karschin C. Karschin A. Picciotto M.R. Clapham D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 20: 5608-5615Google Scholar). According to the initial concept, GIRK1 subunits without co-expressed GIRK2, GIRK3, or GIRK4 subunits do not co-assemble and are not translocated to the membrane, whereas GIRK2, GIRK3, and GIRK4 are necessary for subunit assembly and translocation but do not form functional homomeric channel without GIRK1 (7Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Corey S. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2571-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, more recently, it has been shown that in atrial myocytes, a large fraction of GIRK4 subunits exist as homomultimers (8Corey S. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27499-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, in neurons, GIRK2 and GIRK3 subunits have been localized without GIRK1 protein (9Inanobe A. Yoshimoto Y. Horio Y. Morishige K.I. Hibino H. Matsumoto S. Tokunaga Y. Maeda T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jelacic T.M. Kennedy M.E. Wickman K. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36211-36216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that monomeric complexes devoid of GIRK1 may form functional channels. Cardiac GIRK channels are activated by various heptahelical receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins of the pertussis toxin-sensitive class (Gi/Go), of which M2AChR is the paradigmatic example. Receptor activation results in dissociation of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex into its α and βγ subunits. In turn, the βγ subunits interact with the GIRK subunits in a membrane-delimited fashion, causing an increase in open-state probability of the channel complex. Following activation by exposure to ACh, atrial IK(ACh)shows a peculiar type of desensitization, i.e. a partial decay in current with a half-time of a few seconds (11Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Pflügers Arch. 1987; 410: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), usually referred to as “acute” or “fast” desensitization. This component of desensitization is assumed to be localized downstream of the receptor. The mechanism(s) underlying this acute desensitization, however, so far has not been resolved. In the present study, GIRK4 subunits and GIRK4 concatemeric constructs were overexpressed in cultured adult rat atrial myocytes by transient transfection. Overexpression of GIRK4 resulted in ACh-activated currents that completely lacked fast desensitization. Strong inward rectification, a key property of GIRK currents, resulting from a block of outward current flow by intracellular cations, particularly polyamines, was reduced in GIRK4-transfected myocytes as compared with native cells. Qualitatively, this was confirmed by expressing GIRK4 subunits in CHO cells and HEK293 cells, which are assumed to be devoid of intrinsic GIRK1 subunits. These findings support the notion that important physiological properties, such as inward rectification and desensitization, depend on the subunit composition of the channel complex. Moreover, in atrial myocytes GIRK channel complexes with subunit compositions different from the GIRK42-GIRK12 stoichiometry might contribute to macroscopic IK(ACh). Experiments were performed with local ethics committee approval. Wistar Kyoto rats of either sex (around 200 g) were anesthetized by i.v injection of urethan (1 g/kg). The chest was opened, and the heart was removed and mounted on the cannula of a sterile Langendorff apparatus for coronary perfusion at constant flow. The method of enzymatic isolation of atrial myocytes has been described elsewhere (e.g. Ref. 12Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The culture medium was fetal calf serum-free bicarbonate-buffered M199 (Life Technologies, Inc., Karlsruhe, Germany) containing gentamycin (25 µg/ml, Sigma Deisenhofen, Germany) and kanamycin (25 µg/ml, Sigma). Cells were plated at a low density (several thousand cells per dish) on 36-mm culture dishes. Medium was changed 24 h after plating and then every second day. Myocytes were used experimentally from day 0 until day 5 after isolation. No effects of time in culture were found for the key experiments. For the patch clamp measurements, an extracellular solution of the following composition was used: 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10.0 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. The solution for filling the patch-clamp pipettes for whole cell voltage clamp experiments contained 110 mm potassium-aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 5.0 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm Na2ATP, 2.0 mm EGTA, 0.01 mm GTP, 10.0 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4. Standard chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). EGTA, Hepes, MgATP, Ado GTP, and ACh-chloride were from Sigma. Membrane currents were measured using whole-cell patch clamp. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and were filled with the solution listed above (direct current resistance, 4–6 MΩ). Currents were measured by means of a patch clamp amplifier (List LM/EPC 7, Darmstadt, Germany). Signals were analog filtered (corner frequency, 1–3 KHz), digitally sampled at 5 KHz and stored on a computer equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2, MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for voltage control and data acquisition. Experiments were performed at ambient temperature (22–24 °C). Cells were voltage-clamped at –90 mV, i.e.negative to EK, resulting in inward K+currents. Current-voltage relations were determined by means of voltage ramps between –120 and +60 mV. Rapid superfusion of the cells for application and withdrawal of different solutions was performed by means of a solenoid-operated flow system that permitted switching between up to six different solutions (t 12 ≤ 100 ms). Performance of this system was dependent on the positioning of the outlet tube in relation to the cell studied. This was routinely optimized by measuring the time course of the blocking action of Ba2+ on IK(ACh). To obtain the different GIRK4 constructs, we amplified the rat cDNA using different polymerase chain reaction primers to attach restriction sites for further coupling. The following constructs were amplified:A,KpnI-rGIRK4-(Met1-Met419)-(CAA)x5-EcoRV;B,EcoRV-(CAG)x5-rGIRK4-(Met1-Met419)-(CAA)x5-XhoI;C,XhoI-(CAG)x5-rGIRK4-(Met1-Met419)-(CAA)x5-XbaI;D,EcoRV-(CAG)x5-rGIRK4-(Met1-Met419)-(CAA)x5-XbaI; E,XbaI-(CAG)x5-RGIRK4-(Met1-Met419)-TGA-ApaI; and F,EcoRV-(CAG)x5-rGIRK4-(Met1-Met419)-TGA-ApaI. To construct the GIRK4 dimer, GIRK4- A was cut using the restriction enzymes KpnI and EcoRV to ligate in the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using the same sites and opened after ligation with EcoRV and ApaI.F was ligated into this vector using the corresponding restriction sites. The resulting tandem clone has the following amino acid sequence: kir3.41–419-QQQQQ-DI-QQQQQ-kir3.41–419, (pGIRK4)2. To obtain the GIRK4 tetramer, pcDNA3-GIRK4-A–E was digested using EcoRV and XhoI, and GIRK4-B was inserted. pcDNA3-GIRK4-A-B-E was further digested withXhoI and XbaI, and GIRK4-C was ligated using the corresponding restriction sites. The amino acid sequence of the tetramer pcDNA3-GIRK4-A-B-C-E was GIRK41–419-QQQQQ-DI-QQQQQ-GIRK41–419-QQQQQ-LE-QQQQQ-kir3.41–419-QQQQQ-SR-QQQQQ-GIRK41–419, (pcDNA-GIRK44). All constructs were sequenced to verify the nucleotide sequence. One day after the inoculation of HEK293 cells or CHO cells, 3 µg of each GIRK clone was transfected into the cells on a Petri dish (9-cm diameter) with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. CHO cells were co-transfected with a pSV-SPORT1-A1R vector encoding for a rat brain A1AdoR (kindly provided by Dr. A. Karschin, Göttingen, Germany). HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a pcDNA3-M2AChR vector, encoding a human M2AChR. For identification of transfected cells the reporter pIRES-EGFP vector (CLONTECH, 1.0 µg/plate) was co-transfected. Electrophysiological recordings were made on days 3 and 4 posttransfection. Time-matched EGFP-positive cells expressing the A1AdoR or M2AChR receptor without GIRK subunits or with GIRK1 only served as controls. After 2 days, the cells were rinsed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and collected with 1 ml of a preparation buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) cholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 µg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and chymostatin). The cell suspension was sonicated using a TOMY ultrasonic disruptor (UD-201, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (3 µl) was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide (11%) gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (9Inanobe A. Yoshimoto Y. Horio Y. Morishige K.I. Hibino H. Matsumoto S. Tokunaga Y. Maeda T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane was incubated with a primary antibody against GIRK4 (aG4N-10) raised in rabbit against a synthetic peptide, DSRNAMNQDMEIGV, corresponding to the amino acids 4–17 of GIRK4 (14Morishige K.-I.

After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive signals were developed with a SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL for 5 s (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following isolation, myocytes were cultured overnight to allow for attachment. For transfection of atrial myocytes the following vectors were used: the reporter pIRES-EGFP vector (CLONTECH, 1.0 µg/plate), pcDNA-GIRK1, pcDNA-GIRK4, pcDNA-GIRK42, pcDNA-GIRK44, and pSV-SPORT1-A1R (0.4 µg/plate). Transfection was performed by means of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophysiological recordings were made on days 3 and 4 after transfection. Transfected cells were identified using epifluorescence of EGFP (excitation wavelength, 470 nm). Time-matched EGFP-positive cells transfected with the reporter vector only served as controls. Student's t test was applied for the analysis of the results; differences atp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Lysates of transfected HEK293 cells were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted. Antibodies against amino acids 4–17 of rat GIRK4 recognized proteins of ∼45, ∼90, and ∼180 kDa in cells transfected with pcDNA-GIRK44, pcDNA-GIRK42, and pcDNA-GIRK4, respectively (Fig.1). Because transfection rates using LipofectAMINE methodology in atrial myocytes in terms of EGFP-positive cells were usually less than 5%, corresponding blots to verify expression of these proteins in myocyte cultures could not be produced. In native atrial myocytes, IK(ACh), upon activation by rapid exposure to ACh at concentrations ≥1 µm, shows various components of desensitization (12Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 351-362Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The acute component, not related to the activating receptor has a half-time on the order of magnitude of 5 s and is heterologous (15Meyer T. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Biewald A. Bender K. Eickel A. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Its magnitude varies in individual cells, and it is affected by the experimental conditions, such as rise time of the agonist concentration, which depends on the superfusion device, temperature, or density of functional receptors (12;13;16). In order to separate fast desensitization from receptor desensitization, exposures to ACh were usually limited to <60 s. For simplicity, in the following experiments, the current level reached after 30 s was considered as quasi-steady-state current (15Meyer T. Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Biewald A. Bender K. Eickel A. Pott L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5650-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in that study, complete recovery from fast desensitization following washout of ACh takes less than 30 s. Thus, apart from its fast onset, acute desensitization is defined by its rapid reversibility and by its heterologous nature (cf. Fig. 4) Fig. 2 compares representative sample traces of ACh-induced (10 µm) inward currents recorded from a control (EGFP-positive) myocyte (Fig. 2 A), a myocyte transfected with pcDNA-GIRK1 (Fig. 2 B), a myocyte co-transfected with pcDNA-GIRK1/pcDNA-GIRK4 (Fig.2 C), and a myocyte transfected with the pcDNA-GIRK4 vector (Fig. 2 D). Whereas GIRK1 and GIRK1/GIRK4 expression did not seem to affect the kinetic properties of IK(ACh), in the GIRK4-transfected cell, the current throughout exposure to ACh remained constant, with no sign of desensitization. To qualitatively assess the amount of fast desensitization, quasi-steady-state currents (at 30 s after changing to ACh-containing solution) normalized to peak inward current (for control myocytes) or current level att = 1 s (for GIRK4-transfected cells) have been compared. The summarized data in Fig. 2 E demonstrate that fast desensitization of IK(ACh) was completely abolished in myocytes transfected with the GIRK4 vector, whereas no significant difference was found between controls and myocytes overexpressing GIRK1 or GIRK1/GIRK4, respectively. Surprisingly, current densities of IK(ACh) were not significantly different in the groups of myocytes subject to the different transfection protocols. Fig. 3 illustrates that apart from the removal of acute desensitization, GIRK4 overexpression resulted in a slowing of activation upon fast agonist application. The mean time constant of activation in this series of experiments was increased from about 300 ms to 750 ms. Because a slowing of the rise time of IK(ACh) per se results in a decrease or blunting of the fast desensitizing component (13Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Bünemann M. Brandts B. Pott L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 549-554Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the absence of desensitization in GIRK4-overexpressing cells reflects a consequence of the slower rise time. Although the mechanism(s) underlying fast desensitization in the system under study is not understood, there is strong evidence that it reflects a phenomenon related to a signaling element downstream of the receptor, rather than the receptor itself. The major arguments against receptor desensitization come from the heterologous nature of fast desensitization. Two experimental protocols demonstrating the independence of desensitization and its removal by GIRK4 overexpression on the species of the activating receptor are illustrated in Figs.4 and5.Figure 5Removal of desensitization by GIRK4 overexpression is not limited to activation via M2AChR. Representative traces showing inward IK(ACh) activated by ACh (20 µm) and Ado (100 µm).

After a reference current had been elicited by ACh (10 µm, which yields the maximum IK(ACh) available in a given cell, thus reflecting the total population of available channels), a saturating concentration of Ado (100 µm) was applied. In line with previous reports, the maximum current that could be activated by Ado via A1AdoR amounted to about 30% of peak IK(ACh)elicited by a saturating concentration of ACh due to a lower membrane density of A1R as compared with M2AChR (13Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ado, superimposed pulses of ACh resulted in inward currents, the total amplitude of which was smaller than the amplitude of IK(ACh) in the absence of Ado. This occlusive, subadditive behavior, first described by Kurachi et al. (11Kurachi Y. Nakajima T. Sugimoto T. Pflügers Arch. 1987; 410: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and confirmed for other receptor combinations (17Bünemann M. Liliom K. Brandts B. Pott L. Tseng J.-L. Desiderio G.M. Sun G. Miller D. Tigyi G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5527-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Brandts B. Meyer T. Pott L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), results from fast desensitization. The Ado-induced current itself does not show desensitization in terms of a distinct relaxation subsequent to activation. However, the current desensitizes during its slow onset, reflecting the heterologous nature of fast desensitization. A representative result from a GIRK4-transfected myocyte is illustrated in Fig. 4 B. The current in the presence of ACh and Ado matches the current amplitude of the current evoked by the saturating [ACh], i.e. exposure to Ado did not cause heterologous desensitization. The difference between GIRK4-transfected myocytes and controls was highly significant, as confirmed by the summarized data (Fig. 4 C; p < 0.02;n = 6). Both fast desensitization and its removal by GIRK4 overexpression are not limited to currents activated by stimulation of the M2AChR. Fig. 5 illustrates the effect of overexpressing the A1AdoR. In Fig. 5 A (control), in line with Fig. 4, the maximum current induced by a saturating concentration of Ado (100 µm) was about 30% of peak IK(ACh) elicited by 20 µm ACh and never showed a fast desensitizing component. In Fig. 5 B, the same protocol was applied to a myocyte transfected with a vector encoding for the A1AdoR. As shown previously, in about 70% of these cells, Ado-induced IK(ACh) was larger than ACh-induced IK(ACh). Moreover, the Ado-induced current showed a prominent desensitizing component that was never seen in native myocytes (13Wellner-Kienitz M.-C. Bender K. Meyer T. Bünemann M. Pott L. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) If, as shown in Fig. 5 C, myocytes were co-transfected with the vectors encoding for A1AdoR and GIRK4, the majority of measurements yielded Ado-induced currents that were larger than ACh-induced currents. However, desensitization was absent, underscoring independence of desensitization and its removal by GIRK4 overexpression on receptor species. Previously, it has been shown that the speed and amount of acute desensitization are increased at positive membrane potentials (19Brandts B. Bünemann M. Hluchy J. Sabin G.V. Pott L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which can be considered as additional evidence in support of the notion that it represents a phenomenon related to the channel. As shown in Fig. 6 A, in a control myocyte, desensitization is more pronounced for outward as compared with inward IK(ACh) (see legend for experimental details), whereas in GIRK4-transfected myocytes, desensitization was lacking at both membrane potentials (Fig. 6 B). This observation, which is representative of five time-matched GIRK4-transfected and control myocytes, demonstrates that desensitization is genuinely removed rather than altered in its voltage dependence. GIRK channels are characterized by their strong inward-rectifying properties. Inward rectification of these channels reflects a block by endogenous intracellular cations, in particular by polyamines (spermine and spermidine) (20Yamada M. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9289-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Oliver D. Baukrowitz T. Fakler B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5824-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A comparison of current-voltage relations obtained by voltage ramps from –100 to +60 mV reveals a reduction in inward rectification in GIRK4-transfected as compared with control myocytes (Fig.7, A and B). To statistically compare inward rectification in the two groups of myocytes, ratios of current at 0 and –100 mV were calculated from I/V curves of individual cells and summarized in Fig. 7 C. This qualitative assessment yields a highly significant difference in inward-rectifying properties between the two groups. No difference was found if data from native (i.e. nontransfected) myocytes and myocytes transfected with the EGFP vector only were compared (not shown). The data presented so far demonstrate that transfection of atrial myocytes with a vector encoding for the GIRK4 subunit affects key properties of macroscopic IK(ACh), suggesting that functional channel complexes with a subunit composition different from the native GIRK channel population are formed. To obtain further information on this issue, myocytes were transfected with concatemeric GIRK4 constructs (GIRK42 and GIRK44). The results are summarized in Fig.8. Panels A and Bshow representative current recordings; summarized data on fast desensitization and inward rectification are shown in panels B and C, respectively. Currents recorded from myocytes transfected with pcDNA-GIRK42 were indistinguishable from currents recorded from myocytes overexpressing the GIRK4 monomer,i.e. they lacked fast desensitization and inward rectification was significantly reduced. In the group of myocytes transfected with the tetrameric construct (pcDNA-GIRK44), fast desensitization and inward rectification of IK(ACh) showed an intermediate behavior between control, GIRK4-transfected, and GIRK42-transfected groups. The data presented thus far suggest that GIRK4 homomeric complexes are functional channels with properties different from the native channel population that determines macroscopic IK(ACh), although other interpretations are possible. It is conceivable, for example, that the GIRK4 subunits overexpressed in atrial myocytes interfere in an unknown fashion with the signaling pathway, causing the changes in macroscopic IK(ACh) described above. We therefore studied whether heterologous expression of GIRK4 homo- and tetramers in combination with a Gi/o-coupled receptor in principle results in agonist-activation of GIRK currents in two different cell lines (CHO and HEK293) frequently used as mammalian expression systems. Both cell lines are assumed to be devoid of intrinsic GIRK subunits. To provide a receptor for activation of the signaling pathway, in CHO cells an A1AdoR was co-expressed. This was preferred over the M2AChR, because activation of the latter in CHO cells causes a novel long lasting heterologous desensitization not present in cardiac myocytes (22Bünemann M. Meyer T. Pott L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12537-12545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with pSV-SPORT1-A1R only served as controls. As positive controls, cells were transfected (apart from the A1receptor) with pcDNA-GIRK1 or pcDNA-GIRK4 (see under “Experimental Procedures”). In corresponding experiments on HEK293 cells, a rat M2AChR was used for activation of expressed GIRK currents. The principle question to be addressed by this series of experiments was whether expression of monomeric or tetrameric GIRK4 results in receptor-activated GIRK currents in a cell line devoid of intrinsic GIRK subunits. Current amplitudes in this expression system for a given set of transfection variables were more variable than in atrial myocytes, and fast desensitization was intrinsically weak. Therefore, reliable information on this issue was not available from this series of experiments. Fig. 9 compares representative responses of CHO cells to A1 receptor stimulation by 100 µm Ado. Whereas cells transfected with vectors encoding for GIRK1 and A1AdoR did not respond to Ado with a measurable change in whole cell current (Fig. 9 A), in cells co-expressing the A1-receptor and GIRK1/GIRK4, exposure to Ado, as expected, resulted in activation of sizable inward rectifying currents (B). Robust Ado-induced currents were also routinely recorded from cells expressing GIRK4 monomers (Fig.9 C) and tetramers (D). I"

Furthermore, a train of brief depolarizations produces more ultra-slow inactivation than a single maintained depolarization of the same duration.

These inactivated states can be separated by their contribution to the time course of recovery. Upon repolarization from brief (millisecond time scale) depolarizations recovery is characterized by a single kinetic phase with a time constant of a few milliseconds (“fast inactivation”). If adult rat skeletal muscle (µ1) Na+ channels, heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, are inactivated for ≥20 ms and then repolarized, the channels recover from inactivation with three distinct time constants, implying that there are at least three distinct inactivated states. These time constants are in the order of several ms (fast inactivation), several hundred ms (“intermediate inactivation”), and several thousand ms (“slow inactivation”) (1Nuss H.B. Balser J.R.

When the channels are inactivated for even longer periods, a component of recovery can be identified with a time constant in the range of 30–100 s (3Cummins T.R. Sigworth F.J. Biophys.

We refer to this inactivated state, from which channels recover with time constants in the order of ∼100 s, as “ultra-slow inactivation” (7Fox J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 426: 232-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Prolonged inactivation may be of substantial significance in a broad variety of physiological and pathological settings. In neurons, accumulation of Na+ channel prolonged inactivation may influence activity-dependent neuronal excitability, especially under pathological conditions of intense discharge such as epilepsy (8Fleidervish I.A. Friedman A. Gutnick M.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 83-97Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, differences in Na+channel prolonged inactivation may underlie differences in fast and slow twitch muscle excitability (9Ruff R.L. Simoncini L. Stühmer W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 383: 339-348Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several genetic skeletal muscle diseases are a result of defects in inactivation (10Cannon S.C. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 3-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the heart, myocardial infarction is associated with a delay in recovery from inactivation of Na+ currents (11Pu J. Balser J.R. Boyden P.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12Pu J. Boyden P.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This effect may produce inhomogeneities of cardiac impulse conduction, setting the stage for reentrant arrhythmias and predisposing to sudden cardiac death. Understanding the mechanisms of prolonged inactivation also could define new targets for drug development and therapeutic strategies against neurologic, neuromuscular, and cardiac disorders. The molecular basis of fast inactivation is thought to be a “ball and chain” mechanism involving a cytoplasmic loop between the third and fourth domain (the III-IV linker) (13Stuhmer W. Conti F.

We have shown previously that the mutations µ1-DIII-K1237E1 and µ1-DIV-A1529D favor entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state (6Todt H. Dudley S.C.J. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys.

Residues Lys1237 in DIII and Ala1529 in DIV are predicted to line the outer channel pore and, together with residues Asp400 in DI and Glu755 in DII, are presumed to form a part of the selectivity filter of the channel (17Lipkind G.M.

Recent work from other laboratories suggests that the voltage sensors in DIII and DIV play a unique role in coupling fast inactivation to voltage-dependent activation (23Cha A. Ruben P.C. George A.L.J. Fujimoto E. Bezanilla F. Neuron. 1999; 22: 73-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 24Horn R. Ding S. Gruber H.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 461-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Also, DIV voltage sensors have been shown to play a role in slow inactivation (25Mitrovic N. George A.L. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study we explore in detail the properties of ultra-slow inactivation in the mutant DIV-A1529D. We find that ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D has a U-shaped voltage dependence. It can be induced more efficiently by depolarizing voltage trains, suggesting that ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D occurs from intermediate closed states that are occupied on the way to the open state. This suggests that the P-loop in DIV may be involved in the activation mechanism of the channel. The oligonucleotide-directed point mutation A1529D was introduced using four primer polymerase chain reaction. An oligonucleotide containing the mutation was designed with a change in a silent restriction site to allow rapid identification of the mutant. A vector consisting of the µ1 coding sequence flanked byXenopus globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was provided as a gift by R. Moorman. This was used as the template for mutagenesis, and polymerase chain reaction fragments were isolated and subcloned into this template using directional ligations. Incorporation of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire polymerized regions. The vector was linearized by SalI digestion and transcribed with SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using reagents from the mCAP RNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The rat brain β1 subunit of the Na+channel was also subcloned into pAlterXG, and transcription was prepared from a BamHI-linearized template using SP6 RNA polymerase. Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were isolated from female frogs (NASCO, Ft. Atkinson, WI), were washed with Ca2+-free solution (90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaHPO4, and 5 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.6 with 1 nNaOH), were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) for 1.5 h, and had their follicular cell layers manually removed. Approximately 50–100 ng of cRNA was injected into each oocyte with a Drummond micro-injector (Broomall, PA). The oocytes were incubated at 17 °C for 12 h to 3 days before examination. Recordings were made in the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration using a Dagan CA-1 voltage clamp (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) or a TEC 10CD clamp (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany). Both clamp amplifiers had a series compensation circuit. All recordings were obtained at room temperature (20–22 °C). The oocytes were placed in recording chambers in which the bath flow rate was about 100 ml/h, and the bath level was adjusted so that the total bath volume was less than 500 µl. The electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of less than 1 MΩ. Using pCLAMP6 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software, data were acquired at 71.4 kHz after low pass filtration at 2 kHz (−3dB). Curve fitting was performed using ORIGIN 3.5 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Recordings were made in a bathing solution that consisted of 90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.2 with 1 n NaOH. BaCl2 was used as a replacement for CaCl2 to minimize Ca2+-activated Cl− currents, which arise as a consequence of Ca2+ entry via some of the mutant channels. To test for Ca2+ permeation in DIV-A1529D oocytes were bathed in the following solution: 85 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-Ca(OH)2, pH 7.2. The mutant µ-conotoxin GIIIA R13Q (µ-CTX R13Q) was synthesized by solid state synthesis on a polystyrene-based Rink amide resin on an Applied Biosystems 431A synthesizer, as described previously (26French R.J. Dudley S.C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 575-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The crude linear peptide was initially desalted on Sephadex G-10/20% acetic acid and then purified by preparative HPLC to ∼90% homogeneity as determined by analytical HPLC. Following folding of the peptide by air oxidation, µ-CTX R13Q was purified to near homogeneity by HPLC. The time courses of recovery from inactivation of normalized peak inward currents were fit with the following exponential functions. I2/I1=−A1exp(−t/τ1)−A2exp(−t/τ2)+C(Eq. 1) orI2/I1=−A1exp(−t/τ1)−A2exp(−t/τ2)−A3exp(−t/τ3)+C(Eq. 2) where I2 is the peak inward Na+ current of the test pulse during recovery, I1 is the peak inward Na+ current of a test pulse under fully available conditions, τ1, τ2, and τ3are the time constants of distinct components of recovery,A 1, A 2, andA 3 are the respective amplitudes of these time constants, and C is the final level of recovery. The time course of development of the ultra-slow inactivated state was best fit with a single exponential function.A2=S∞(1−exp(t/τd))(Eq. 3) where τd is the time constant of development of ultra-slow inactivation and S ∞ is the final level of ultra-slow inactivation expressed as a fraction of total inactivation. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using the two-tailed Student's ttest. A p < 0.05 was considered as being significant. Unless otherwise stated n = 6. DIV-A1529D shows a slowly recovering component of inactivation. Fig. 1A shows the growth of inward currents through DIV-A1529D channels with subsequent pulses at 20-s intervals. From a holding potential of −120 mV, the channels were first inactivated by a 300-s depolarizing prepulse to −50 mV. Recovery from inactivation after returning to −120 mV was monitored by repetitive test pulses to −10 mV. The test pulse duration was 30 ms. About 50% of the current recovered within 20 s, whereas the remaining fraction took several minutes to complete recovery. DIV-A1529D shows a larger component of a slowly recovering current in comparison with µ1. Fig. 1 B summarizes the time course of recovery from inactivation, produced by a 300-s depolarizing prepulse to −50 mV in native µ1 and in constructs with the mutation DIV-A1529D (n = 6 for each data point). To ensure complete recovery from fast inactivation between test pulses, the test pulse duration was decreased to 20 ms. The data were normalized to the final current level after full recovery. Clearly, wild type µ1 currents recovered completely within ∼50 s, whereas the time course of recovery of DIV-A1529D channels was substantially slower. The data points were well fitted with two exponentials (Equation 1) reflecting two channel populations recovering from distinct inactivated states, which we refer to as slow and ultra-slow inactivation (6Todt H.

Recovery from slow inactivation had a mean time constant of 7.9 ± 1.3 and 7.1 ± 1.4 s in µ1 and DIV-A1529D, respectively. The corresponding amplitudes were 0.58 ± 0.04 in µ1 and 0.35 ± 0.02 in DIV-A1529D (p < 0.01). Time constants of recovery from ultra-slow inactivation were 78.4 ± 19.8 s in µ1 and 110.9 ± 11.5 s in DIV-A1529D. The amplitudes were 0.22 ± 0.02 in µ1 and 0.62 ± 0.04 in DIV-A1529D (p < 0.01). Thus, significantly more channels recovered from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D than in µ1. To determine the time course of development of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D, prepulses to −50 mV of variable duration were applied from a holding potential of −120 mV, and the time course of recovery at −120 mV was monitored for each prepulse duration by subsequent 30-ms test pulses to −10 mV at 20-s intervals. The time course of recovery for each prepulse duration was then fitted with two exponentials that yielded time constants and amplitudes of slow and ultra-slow inactivation (Equation 1). In Fig. 1 C the amplitude of the ultra-slow exponential component of recovery, reflecting the fraction of channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation (A 2 in Equation 1 =F inactivating), is plotted as a function of the respective durations of the inactivating prepulse. Theconnecting line is the result of a single exponential fit (Equation 3) to the data points. The time constant of development of ultra-slow inactivation was 81 ± 17.9 s. Thus, both entry to and exit from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels had time constants similar to those previously found in DIII-K1237E channels (6Todt H. Dudley S.C.J. Kyle J.W.

Coexpression of the β1 subunit with the α subunit of the µ1 Na+ channel speeds current decay and accelerates recovery from fast and slow inactivation (6Todt H. Dudley S.C.J. Kyle J.W. French R.J.

We wanted to explore whether the β1 subunit affected recovery from ultra-slow inactivation in addition to well known modulating effects of β1 on fast andslow inactivation. We found that, compared with DIV-A1529D α alone, longer prepulse durations were required to drive DIV-A1529D+β1 channels into ultra-slow inactivation. Fig.1 (D and E) shows the time course of recovery of DIV-A1529D+β1 channels from ultra-slow inactivation produced by a 1200-s inactivating prepulse to −50 mV. Note that the prepulse duration was four times as long as in the experiment with DIV-A1529D α alone, shown in Fig. 1 A. Inward currents during recovery of DIV-A1529D+β1 were slowly increasing, suggesting that the channels recovered from ultra-slow inactivation. Comparison of the current traces in Fig. 1 (A andD) demonstrates that coexpression with β1substantially accelerated current decay. However, the time course of recovery from ultra-slow inactivation of DIV-A1529D+β1was similar to that of DIV-A1529 α alone (Fig. 1, B andE). Fig. 1 F shows that increasing the prepulse duration from 300 to 1200 s significantly increased the fraction of DIV-A1529D+β1 channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation. In contrast, entry into ultra-slow inactivation at −50 mV in DIV-A1529D α alone channels was completed after ∼300 s (Fig.1 C). Thus, coexpression of DIV-A1529D α with the β1 subunit did not abolish ultra-slow inactivation but delayed entry into the ultra-slow inactivated state. The fraction of channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation was strongly voltage-dependent. To examine the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D, the oocytes were depolarized for 300 s from −120 mV to prepulse voltages in the range of −90 mV to +30 mV. After each prepulse the potential was returned to −120 mV, and recovery was monitored by 20-ms test pulses to −10 mV at 20 s intervals (n = 4–12). The time course of recovery for each prepulse potential was then fit with a double exponential function (Equation 1) to estimate the fraction of channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation (A 2 =F inactivating). To facilitate comparison with standard availability curves, the fraction of channels not recovering from ultra-slow inactivation 1−A2=Fnoninactivating(Eq. 4) was plotted as a function of prepulse voltage in Fig.2. The voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation was U-shaped. At prepulse potentials of approximately −60 mV F noninactivating reached a minimum of ∼ 0.3, whereas this fraction was substantially increased as prepulse potentials were set at more positive and at more negative values. As shown in Fig. 1 F, coexpression of the β1 subunit with DIV-A1529D α slowed entry into the ultra-slow inactivated state. Hence, the fraction of DIV-A1529D+β1 channels that had entered the ultra-slow inactivated state after a prepulse duration of 300 s was smaller than if only the α subunit was expressed. However, the voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation of DIV-A1529D+β1channels was similar to DIV-A1529D α alone, exhibiting a U shape with minimum availability at ∼-60 mV (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig.1 D, coexpression with the β1 subunit strongly reduced slow current decay but still left a substantial amount of ultra-slow inactivation. Thus, ultra-slow inactivation was not confined to the abnormally slow gating fraction of µ1 channels expressed inXenopus oocytes. Because entry into ultra-slow inactivation was faster in DIV-A1529D α alone channels, further experiments were performed without coexpression of β1. U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation is well known in calcium channels, where it is frequently taken as evidence for Ca2+current-dependent inactivation (31Eckert R. Chad J.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 215-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To test for Ca2+ current-dependent inactivation, oocytes expressing DIV-A1529D channels were bathed in a high Ca2+solution (85 mm CaCl2; see “Experimental Procedures”). Upon exchange of the standard 90 mmNa+ with the high Ca2+ solution, all inward current was lost, indicating a lack of measurable permeation of Ca2+ ions through DIV-A1529D channels. This argues against Ca2+ current-dependent inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels. Ultra-slow inactivation occurred at more hyperpolarized voltages than the ionic current. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2, maximum inward current in DIV-A1529D occurred at potentials positive to −20 mV, whereas F noninactivating was minimal at approximately −60 mV. Similarly, integrated inward currents representing charge entry (Fig. 2, inset, Q) peaked at −20 mV and declined to 0 at −50 mV. These values are consistent with published data from wild type µ1 expressed inXenopus oocytes (32Zhou J.Y. Potts J.F. Trimmer J.S. Agnew W.S. Sigworth F.J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 33Cannon S.C. McClatchey A.I. Gusella J.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and in mammalian cells (34Ukomadu C. Zhou J. Sigworth F.J. Agnew W.S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 663-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the voltage yielding maximal ultra-slow inactivation and the voltage of maximum inward current and of maximum charge entry strongly argues against current-dependent inactivation. Given the U-shaped voltage dependence of ultra-slow inactivation, it was important to determine whether other inactivated states in DIV-A1529D also had nonmonotonic dependence on prepulse voltage. The following protocol was designed to obtain an estimate of the voltage dependence of inactivated states that were elicited by conditioning prepulses short enough to avoid entry of channels into ultra-slow inactivation. 1-s conditioning prepulses to various voltages were applied, and the available, noninactivated fraction of channels was gauged by a subsequent test pulse (Fig.3). Both in wild type µ1 and in DIV-A1529D channel availability after 1-s conditioning prepulses decreased monotonically with depolarization, asymptotically approaching zero at potentials positive to −40 mV. The absence of U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation produced by a 1-s prepulse suggested that the ultra-slow inactivated state in DIV-A1529D was unlikely to be connected to those inactivated states that were produced by 1-s conditioning prepulses. Prepulses of 1-s duration have been shown to recruit a minimum of three inactivated states in µ1 (1Nuss H.B. Balser J.R. Orias D.W. Lawrence J.H. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 411-429Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the experiment shown in Fig. 3 suggested a monotonic voltage dependence of other than ultra-slow inactivated states, it failed to provide information regarding the relative partitioning among faster inactivated states at a given prepulse potential. Thus, we sought to explore whether conditioning prepulses of 1-s duration would be able to recruit a minimum number of three distinct states of inactivation in DIV-A1529D and, if so, whether any one of these states had a nonmonotonic voltage dependence similar to ultra-slow inactivation. Therefore, we examined the time course of recovery of DIV-A1529D channels after a 1-s conditioning prepulse to −50 mV (i.e. F noninactivating was at minimum) and to −10 mV (where F noninactivatingat maximum). As shown in Fig. 4the time course of recovery in DIV-A1529D was adequately fitted with three exponential decay functions (Equation 2), suggesting the presence of at least three inactivation processes (1Nuss H.B. Balser J.R. Orias D.W. Lawrence J.H. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 411-429Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The amplitudes of recovery from inactivation, reflecting the fraction of channels recovering from anyone distinct state were similar for both prepulse potentials (see legend to Fig. 4). This result indicates that within the range of examined prepulse voltages, the mutation DIV-A1529D did not affect the voltage dependence of inactivated states produced by brief prepulse durations. Thus, it is unlikely that brief prepulses could produce inactivated states showing U-shaped voltage dependence. The fact that inactivation produced by 1-s prepulses did not exhibit U-shaped voltage dependence argues against a serial Markovian kinetic scheme, where ultra-slow inactivation is reached via faster inactivated states. The voltage range where ultra-slow inactivation reached a local maximum was around −60 to −50 mV. This is the voltage range over which Na+ channels are activated,i.e. the channels pass through a number of closed states to reach a final open state. Therefore, we reasoned that ultra-slow inactivation could be connected to the kinetic processes of activation and/or deactivation. To test this we examined whether ultra-slow inactivation could be produced by repetitive brief depolarizations that enhance the probability of channels to undergo transitions between closed and open states. Fig.5A shows the effect of 3333 repetitive step depolarizations to −20 mV, applied from a holding potential of −120 mV. Each depolarization had a duration of 2 ms, followed by an interpulse interval of 28 ms, at −120 mV (33.3 Hz). The entire duration of the pulse train was 100 s. Each data point in Fig. 5 A indicates the inward current elicited by one out of 50 applied pulses. Clearly, the pulse train was associated with a slowly developing decline in peak inward current, reflecting cumulative channel inactivation. After 100 s the 33.3 Hz train was stopped, and recovery from cumulative inactivation was monitored by repetitive 20-ms test pulses to −20 mV, applied at 20-s intervals from a holding potential of −120 mV. The time course of recovery was very slow, and the initial current level (before the 33.3 Hz train) was not reached until >200 s had elapsed at −120 mV. Fitting a double exponential function to the normalized time course of recovery after the train (Fig. 5 B, line) revealed that ∼36% of the channels recovered from ultra-slow inactivation (τ = 85 s). Table Ipresents a quantitative comparison between the fraction of channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation, produced by a single 15-s prepulse to −50 mV, by a 33.3-Hz pulse train, and by a 20-Hz pulse train (n= 6 for each protocol). During the trains 2-ms step depolarizations to −20 mV were applied for a total duration of 100 s. The cumulative amount of time the channels spent at depolarized potentials was 6.6 and 4 s during the 33.3- and 20-Hz trains, respectively. After each train the time course of recovery was examined as described for the train in Fig. 5. The data in Table I demonstrate that the fraction of channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation (A 2) was significantly greater after each train than after the single prepulse, even though channels spent substantially less time at depolarized potentials during each train than during the constant voltage. Previously we showed that during a single 300-s depolarization to −20 mV only ∼10% of channels entered the ultra-slow inactivated state, whereas following a 300-s depolarization to −60 mV, ∼70% of channels became ultra-slow inactivated. During the depolarizing trains channels were either at the holding potential of −120 mV or at the depolarized potential of −20 mV. Neither of these potentials should recruit a substantial amount of ultra-slow inactivation. The fact that multiple repeated depolarizations drove substantially more channels into ultra-slow inactivation than a single prolonged depolarization to the same potential suggests that ultra-slow inactivation is f"

Caspase-8 then activates downstream effector caspases, which cleave the structural and regulatory proteins necessary for cell survival (14Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem.

In unstimulated cells TNFR-1 is localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network (17Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore must move to the plasma membrane to be accessible to TNF. Because Golgi vesicles are known to be associated with actin, myosin IIA, and myosin IIB, it is likely that myosin motor activities are an important regulatory component of this translocation step (18Heimann K.

A role for myosin II motor activities in TNF has been suggested in a previous study where an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), the principal protein kinase responsible for activation of myosin II, delayed TNF-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation (21Wright S.C. Zheng H. Zhong J. Torti F.M. Larrick J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this report we describe our examination of the role of myosin II motor activities in regulating the intracellular trafficking of TNFR-1 and its associated DISC proteins during TNF-induced apoptosis. The results presented in this study highlight a new role for myosin II motor activities at an early step of apoptotic signaling that regulates translocation of TNFR-1 to or within the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONAlthough a detailed characterization of the signaling pathways emanating from TNFR-1 has been compiled, little is known about signaling mechanisms that regulate the intracellular or intramembrane trafficking of this death receptor. The pivotal importance of myosin II motor activities in other contractile processes like mitosis, migration, and cellular shape changes, including muscle contraction, are well established. In this study we show that myosin II motor activity also has an important role in regulating the apoptotic signaling cascade activated by TNF and is directly involved in translocation of TNFR-1 to a biotin-accessible location on the cell membrane. The experiments in this report utilized both direct and indirect modulation of myosin II motor activities by pharmacological agents, or the expression of a dominant negative or WT MLCK, to link changes in RLC phosphorylation to changes in the rate of TNF-induced apoptotic cell death in MDCK cells. These results show that translocation of TNFR-1 to a biotin-accessible membrane location is a myosin II-dependent motor process that can occur in the absence of TNF in response to either increased intracellular calcium or to LPS, a physiological activator of cytokine signaling.Myosin II Motor Activities Regulate TNF-induced ApoptosisMLCK is the primary regulator of myosin II ATPase activity, and in contrast to most other Ser/Thr protein kinases, MLCK has a single, well characterized physiological substrate, the myosin II RLC. Phosphorylation of myosin RLC by MLCK leads directly to activation of myosin II ATPase and myosin II force production. Based upon this pathway we hypothesized that if myosin II motor activities have a role in regulating TNF signaling, then changes in the total MLCK activity in cells will directly impact the progression of apoptosis. Consistent with this proposal, our results demonstrate that increasing or decreasing the total MLCK activity in cells, either by over-expression of WT MLCK or dominant negative KD MLCK or by the use of a specific inhibitor of MLCK, ML-7, leads to a corresponding change in RLC phosphorylation and to either potentiation or abrogation of TNF-induced apoptosis.By examining the signaling pathway that is initiated by TNF, we show that the downstream activities of the caspases that are activated by TNF signaling respond in parallel to changes in myosin motor activity. In addition, we have noted a rapid reorganization of both FADD and caspase-8 into small aggregates in response to TNF. Although it is unclear whether the aggregates are associated with TNFR-1, the data suggest that the formation of FADD and caspase-8 aggregates is linked to myosin II motor activities, as evidenced by the difference in the rates of TNF-induced aggregation observed in MDCK cells expressing WT and KD MLCK. The rapid aggregation and coordinated increase in caspase-8 activity are consistent with the recently proposed model of proximity-induced auto-activation (13Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to other studies we do not see the formation of large cytoplasmic filamentous aggregates, called death effector filaments, that have been described for FADD and caspase-8 (34Siegel R.M.

This distinction could be because we are examining changes in intracellular distribution by endogenous FADD and caspase-8, which may only form smaller aggregates, and suggests that the larger, filamentous death effector filaments are a consequence of over-expression.Finally, we also show that the translocation of TNFR-1 from a biotin-inaccessible to a biotin-accessible plasma membrane location is linked to myosin motor activities. This observation is consistent with previous studies showing that the bulk of TNFR-1 is localized to the trans-Golgi (17Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that myosin II forces can power the translocation of a Golgi-derived vesicle containing TNFR-1 to the plasma membrane (18Heimann K.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion are several recent reports showing that nonmuscle myosin IIA and possibly IIB as well as F-actin are associated with distinct Golgi vesicles. The association of actomyosin filaments with Golgi-derived vesicles that contain TNFR-1 could provide the necessary forces for the intracellular trafficking of these vesicles (18Heimann K.

Alternatively, or additionally, these results suggest that myosin II motor activities may translocate TNFR-1 within the plasma membrane from a biotin-inaccessible to a biotin-accessible location.Is TNF Required for Translocation of TNFR-1 to the Plasma Membrane?These results raised the issue of whether stimulation of cells with TNF is required for receptor translocation or whether actomyosin motor activities alone can promote translocation of TNFR-1 to the cell membrane. Experiments using either LPS or ionomycin both showed that activation of myosin II motor activities is sufficient to result in translocation of TNFR-1 to the plasma membrane in the absence of TNF. Treatment of MDCK cells with ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, increases RLC phosphorylation, and this is paralleled by a rapid increase in the level of biotinylated TNFR-1 detected on the plasma membrane. Similarly, treatment of MDCK cells with LPS, an inflammatory response mediator, also results in increased RLC phosphorylation and a parallel increase in surface expression of TNFR-1. Rapid and sustained increases in intracellular calcium have been demonstrated in septic shock induced by endotoxin (LPS) (38Baldwin T.J. Ward W. Aitken A. Knutton S. Williams P.H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Song S.K. Karl I.E. Ackerman J.J. Hotchkiss R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pagani R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, LPS-induced septic shock is known to cause a rapid, contractile response in endothelial cells through increased RLC phosphorylation (32Essler M. Staddon J.M. Weber P.C. Aepfelbacher M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6543-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that increases in intracellular calcium occur in response to LPS. This would lead to activation of MLCK, to result in increased RLC phosphorylation, stimulation of myosin II motor activity, and translocation of TNFR-1 to the plasma membrane where ligand binding would activate TNFR-1 signaling. We also considered the possibility that the response to LPS for these MDCK cells occurs via LPS-induced synthesis of TNF. This does not appear to be a likely possibility, as increases in RLC phosphorylation and translocation of TNFR-1 to the plasma membrane are detected within 15 min of LPS addition to the cultures, making it unlikely that de novo expression and autocrine stimulation by TNF is involved in translocation of TNFR-1. Finally, we show that pretreatment of the cells with LPS can increase the extent of apoptosis as well as lead to a sustained accumulation of TNFR-1 on the plasma membrane. Together these findings are consistent with the suggestion that LPS can activate myosin II motor activities to result in the translocation of TNFR-1. In addition, these results suggest that LPS activation of myosin motor activities may serve to prime cells for TNF-induced signaling.Is TNFR-1 Translocation Dependent on MLCK Activity?Several experiments in this report show that the surface level of TNFR-1 is decreased in TNF-stimulated MDCK cells expressing KD MLCK. In addition, MDCK cells treated with ionomycin in the presence of the MLCK, inhibitor ML-7 also have decreased surface levels of TNFR-1. Together these experiments suggest that the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK may be involved directly in the activation of myosin II motor activity for TNFR-1 translocation. However, even the over-expression of a dominant negative KD MLCK is insufficient to completely block the apoptotic effects of TNF. One reason for this finding may be that the exogenously expressed 150-kDa KD MLCK is unable to compete completely with the endogenous 220-kDa MLCK expressed in MDCK cells because these two forms of MLCK have distinct intracellular locations. 2P. J. Gallagher, unpublished observation. Alternatively, other protein kinases known to phosphorylate myosin II RLC, such as Rho-dependent kinase, p21-activated kinase, or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent death-associated protein kinase may act either independently of or in addition to MLCK (42Amano M.

Additional studies will be required to define the relative contributions of the two MLCK forms as well as other RLC protein kinases to receptor trafficking in cells.The growing list of myosin II motor activities that includes contractile processes such as migration, cytokinesis, and muscle contraction illustrates the pivotal importance of myosin functions. In this report we show that myosin II motor activities are important at an early step in TNF signaling and power the translocation of TNFR-1 to or within the plasma membrane. We also show that activation of myosin II motor activities independently of TNF stimulation is sufficient for translocation of TNFR-1 to a biotin-accessible membrane location and can occur as a result of increasing intracellular calcium. Together these results suggest a model by which TNF receptor movements may be regulated (Fig. 8). In this model the relationship between calcium, MLCK, myosin II activity, and the intracellular distribution of TNFR-1 are emphasized. Stimulation of cells with TNF, ionomycin, or LPS is postulated to cause an increase in intracellular calcium and result in the activation of myosin II motor activity through RLC phosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent MLCK. The activation of myosin motor activities provides the force for translocating TNFR-1 containing vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane where they fuse to expose the receptor for ligand binding. Alternatively, or in addition, myosin II motor activities may drive the redistribution of TNFR-1 within the plasma membrane. Following movement to or within the plasma membrane, the binding of TNF then induces trimerization of TNFR-1 followed by the recruitment of TRADD, FADD, and caspase-8, to result in activation of the cell death pathway. Activation of TNFR-1 may also lead to a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+to provide additional myosin-driven translocation of the receptor. Overall these studies show that myosin II motor activities are important for the translocation and regulation of the surface level of TNFR-1 and ultimately for the response of the cell to TNF. The inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)1 has an important role in many diverse cellular events, including cell proliferation and apoptosis (1Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev.

Of the two receptors for TNF, TNFR-1 is associated principally with signaling that results in either apoptosis or activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (5Goeddel D.V. Chest. 1999; 116: 69S-73SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Binding of TNF to TNFR-1 initiates death signaling by inducing trimerization of TNFR-1, aggregation of the cytoplasmic death domains, and recruitment of TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) to the cytoplasmic death domain of TNFR-1 (3Hsu H.

Subsequently, Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD/MORT1) is recruited to form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which initiates apoptosis through recruitment and activation of procaspase-8 (FLICE/MACH/Mch5) (3Hsu H.

Caspase-8 then activates downstream effector caspases, which cleave the structural and regulatory proteins necessary for cell survival (14Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem.

While many of the molecules involved in transducing TNF-mediated cell death in vivo have been identified, there are still aspects of TNF signaling that are not understood, particularly with respect to the cellular mechanisms that regulate trafficking and translocation of TNFR-1 and DISC components to form an active death signaling complex. In unstimulated cells TNFR-1 is localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network (17Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore must move to the plasma membrane to be accessible to TNF. Because Golgi vesicles are known to be associated with actin, myosin IIA, and myosin IIB, it is likely that myosin motor activities are an important regulatory component of this translocation step (18Heimann K.

A role for myosin II motor activities in TNF has been suggested in a previous study where an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), the principal protein kinase responsible for activation of myosin II, delayed TNF-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation (21Wright S.C. Zheng H. Zhong J. Torti F.M. Larrick J.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this report we describe our examination of the role of myosin II motor activities in regulating the intracellular trafficking of TNFR-1 and its associated DISC proteins during TNF-induced apoptosis. The results presented in this study highlight a new role for myosin II motor activities at an early step of apoptotic signaling that regulates translocation of TNFR-1 to or within the plasma membrane. DISCUSSIONAlthough a detailed characterization of the signaling pathways emanating from TNFR-1 has been compiled, little is known about signaling mechanisms that regulate the intracellular or intramembrane trafficking of this death receptor. The pivotal importance of myosin II motor activities in other contractile processes like mitosis, migration, and cellular shape changes, including muscle contraction, are well established. In this study we show that myosin II motor activity also has an important role in regulating the apoptotic signaling cascade activated by TNF and is directly involved in translocation of TNFR-1 to a biotin-accessible location on the cell membrane. The experiments in this report utilized both direct and indirect modulation of myosin II motor activities by pharmacological agents, or the expression of a dominant negative or WT MLCK, to link changes in RLC phosphorylation to changes in the rate of TNF-induced apoptotic cell death in MDCK cells. These results show that translocation of TNFR-1 to a biotin-accessible membrane location is a myosin II-dependent motor process that can occur in the absence of TNF in response to either increased intracellular calcium or to LPS, a physiological activator of cytokine signaling.Myosin II Motor Activities Regulate TNF-induced ApoptosisMLCK is the primary regulator of myosin II ATPase activity, and in contrast to most other Ser/Thr protein kinases, MLCK has a single, well characterized physiological substrate, the myosin II RLC. Phosphorylation of myosin RLC by MLCK leads directly to activation of myosin II ATPase and myosin II force production. Based upon this pathway we hypothesized that if myosin II motor activities have a role in regulating TNF signaling, then changes in the total MLCK activity in cells will directly impact the progression of apoptosis. Consistent with this proposal, our results demonstrate that increasing or decreasing the total MLCK activity in cells, either by over-expression of WT MLCK or dominant negative KD MLCK or by the use of a specific inhibitor of MLCK, ML-7, leads to a corresponding change in RLC phosphorylation and to either potentiation or abrogation of TNF-induced apoptosis.By examining the signaling pathway that is initiated by TNF, we show that the downstream activities of the caspases that are activated by TNF signaling respond in parallel to changes in myosin motor activity. In addition, we have"

Conventional kinesin was originally identified as a fast moving (∼30 µm/min) microtubule-based motor in squid giant axons (3Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), and it is believed to function as a heterotetramer consisting of two heavy chains and two light chains (reviewed in Ref. 4Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1105-1171PubMed Google Scholar). It has since been identified in virtually all cell types and has multiple roles in vesicle trafficking (5Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Microinjection of antibodies specific to kinesin heavy chain had no effect on mitotic progression of early sea urchin embryos (10Wright B.D. Terasaki M. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and no mitotic defects in kinesin heavy chain mutants have been detected in Drosophila melanogaster (11Saxton W.M. Hicks J.

However, severe defects in early mitoses were found in C. elegans kinesin heavy chain mutants (12Hall D.H. Plenefisch J. Hedgecock E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115 (abstr.): 389Google Scholar). In contrast to conventional kinesin, many KRPs are known to have mitotic functions, including roles in spindle formation, spindle maintenance, and chromosome movement. These mitotic KRPs include members of the BimC subfamily, the C-terminal subfamily, the MKLP1 subfamily, chromokinesins, and others (reviewed in Refs. 13Endow S.A. Eur. J.

Henikoff, The Kinesin Home Page at www.blocks.fhcrc.org/∼kinesin.2E. A. Greene and S. Henikoff, The Kinesin Home Page at www.blocks.fhcrc.org/∼kinesin. Whereas most of the biochemical characterization performed on these motors has been on recombinantly expressed protein or protein fragments, the characterizations of the biochemical properties of kinesins and KRPs in their native forms from natural host cells have been limited. In the case of conventional kinesin, which has been the most extensively studied kinesin in native form, the cell types from which it has been isolated and thoroughly studied are restricted for the most part to brain tissue and early embryonic cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1105-1171PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, only two KRPs have been isolated from natural host cells. These are KRP85/95 and KRP130, both of which were purified from embryonic cells and found to exist in multimeric complexes (16Cole D.G. Chinn S.W. Wedaman K.P. Hall K. Vuong T. Scholey J.M.

In order to study human kinesins and KRPs in their native forms, we have developed a method for the purification of microtubule motor proteins from HeLa cells. We were especially interested in mitotic kinesins; thus, we used cells that were blocked in the mitotic stage of the cell cycle. In this study, we describe a method for the large scale purification of native kinesin and KRPs and focus on the purification of three motors: conventional kinesin, HSET (humanspleen, embryo, testes; Ref. 18Ando A. Kikuti Y. Kawata H. Okamoto N. Imai T. Eki T. Yokoyama K. Soeda E. Ikemura T. Abe K. Inoko H. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and CENP-E (centromere protein-E). We found that the active form of purified HeLa cell kinesin lacks light chains and moves microtubules at ∼30 µm/min. In addition, we purified the KRP HSET, a 75-kDa protein that moves microtubules at a rate of ∼5 µm/min. Finally, we purified the native form of the mitotic KRP, CENP-E, and found that although it binds to microtubules, it apparently lacks microtubule gliding activity. HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension in 20-liter carboys maintained on large spinner plates at 37 °C in half Ham's F-12 medium and half Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium supplemented with modified Eagle's medium-nonessential amino acids, penicillin (5000 units/ml), streptomycin (5 mg/ml), 10 mm Hepes, 1.5 g/liter glucose, and 2% iron-rich calf serum. Asynchronously dividing cells were collected from exponentially growing cultures after reaching a density of ∼106 cells/ml (∼4% of the cells were in mitosis, and 96% were in interphase). A highly enriched mitotic cell population (90% of cells in mitosis) was obtained by incubation with 12 nm vinblastine sulfate for 20 h (one complete cell cycle). Approximately 70 liters of cells from several carboys were harvested using a continuous flow rotor adapter system (Sorvall model KSB-R, Kendro Laboratories, Newtown, CT) in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge. The cell suspension was pumped into a modified SS-34 rotor with a peristaltic pump and centrifuged continuously at 8000 rpm. Cell pellets were washed once by resuspension in 50 ml of 50 mm Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 0.05% sodium azide at pH 6.9 (PEM 50) and sedimented to a pellet in a tabletop clinical centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of PEM50 buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 µm microcystin, and a protease inhibitor mixture (2.5 µm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm tosyl arginine methyl ester, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin) (PEM50-P). The resuspended cells were lysed by pulse sonication at low energy on ice at 0 °C. Cell lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice to ensure complete microtubule disassembly in order to maximize the proportion of soluble motor proteins. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C) to obtain a clarified high speed supernatant (HSS). The HSS, which contained between 1 and 2 g of protein in 50–100 ml, was batch-adsorbed to 50–100 ml of hydrated DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman, Maidstone, England) (equal volumes of HSS to hydrated DE52) by incubation on a rocking platform (4 °C for 30 min). The slurry was then poured into a 2.5 × 50-cm column and allowed to pack. The flow-through (DE-FT), which contained the motors characterized in this study, was collected. The column was then washed with two column volumes of PEM50-P, which was added to the DE-FT. The remaining adsorbed proteins were eluted with ∼1½ column volumes of 150 mm NaCl in PEM50-P, and the eluate, which contained additional motors, was collected but not further pursued here. The proteins present in the DE-FT fraction were precipitated by the gradual addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation (w/v) and incubation (24 h, 4 °C). Precipitated proteins were sedimented by centrifugation in a Sorvall centrifuge (SS-34 rotor, 20,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 4–8 ml of PEM100-P (identical to PEM50-P but containing 100 mm Pipes). Resuspended samples were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor, 4 °C), and depending upon the motor of interest, the resulting supernatant (∼8–10 ml) was loaded onto a 2.5 × 120-cm column containing either 500 ml of a BioGel-A 1.5-m or 500 ml of a BioGel-A 15-m gel filtration matrix. Proteins were filtered through the columns with PEM100-P, and 7-ml fractions were collected. HSET and CENP-E were identified in specific column fractions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with specific antibodies, and conventional kinesin was identified by immunoblotting and analysis of motor activity (see “Results”). Microtubule motors in the gel filtration fractions were further purified by a microtubule affinity procedure. First, microtubules were polymerized by the stepwise addition of taxol (final taxol concentration, 20 µm) to a solution of 150 µm purified bovine brain tubulin in PEM100-P buffer at room temperature. The motors were then adsorbed onto the taxol-stabilized microtubules by the addition of the column fractions and 2 mm AMPPNP to the microtubule suspension and incubation on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 1 h. The microtubules and adsorbed motors were sedimented by centrifugation in a Beckman L5–50 high speed centrifuge (60 Ti rotor, 4 °C, 100,000 × g, 1 h). The resulting pellets were washed two times in 5 ml of PEM100-P containing 20 µmtaxol, 0.1 mm AMPPNP, and 300 mm NaCl. The washed microtubules were then sedimented as described above and resuspended in 500 µl of a release buffer consisting of PEM100-P, 20 µm taxol, 10 mm MgATP, and 300 mmNaCl. The motors were released from the microtubules by incubation for 1 h at 0 °C on ice with occasional gentle mixing on a vortex mixer or occasional homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were centrifuged as described above, yielding released proteins in the supernatants and microtubules and bound proteins in the pellets. Final purification of motors was accomplished by sucrose density centrifugation. The supernatants were applied to 4.6-ml 5–50% sucrose gradients in PEM100-P buffer, and the gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman L5–50 high speed centrifuge using a SW50 swinging bucket rotor for 14 h (200,000 × g, 4 °C). Forty-five two-drop fractions were collected by hand after puncturing the bottom of the tube with a 22-gauge needle. Fluorescent microtubule gliding assays were used to characterize the motors at various steps in the purification procedures. Short stable microtubules were prepared by polymerizing purified bovine brain tubulin in the presence of 1 mm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol at 37 °C and shearing through a 25-gauge needle five times. Rhodamine-labeled microtubule segments were assembled onto the short microtubules by incubation with a mixture of rhodamine-tubulin and purified bovine brain tubulin (8:1 ratio) plus 1 mm GTP and 1 mm MgCl2 (1 h, 37 °C). The fluorescent microtubules were stabilized by the addition of taxol (20 µm), sedimented by centrifugation through a taxol-containing 60% glycerol cushion in PEM100 (200,000 ×g, 1 h, 4 °C), and resuspended in 40 µl of PEM100 containing 20 µm taxol and antifade reagents (1 mg/ml catalase, 1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 m glucose). The microtubules were diluted 1:20 in PEM100 buffer containing 20 µm taxol and the same antifade reagents as above in the gliding assays. Three aliquots of a single protein sample were sequentially perfused into a flow cell chamber (chambers of ∼3-µl volume were made using a glass microscope slide, two pieces of double stick tape, and a glass coverslip) and maintained in a humid environment produced by inverting a glass Petri dish over the chambers surrounded by wet paper towels. Each sample was allowed to remain for 3 min (room temperature) and then removed by wicking with Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Chambers were then washed with 10 µl of PEM100-P plus 20 µm taxol. Three µl of rhodamine-labeled taxol-stabilized microtubules, diluted 1:20 in PEM100-P plus 20 µm taxol, were then perfused into the chambers and allowed to incubate for 2 min at room temperature. The chambers were then washed with PEM100-P plus 20 µm taxol and 10 mm ATP, and both sides of the chambers were sealed with VALAP (vasoline, lanolin, paraffin; 1:1:1). Images were collected every 3–15 s using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope (A. G. Heinze, Lake Forest, CA), Hamamatsu Orca II camera, Uniblitz shutter, and controller driven by a Metamorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging, Westchester, PA). For determination of kinesin directionality, we constructed microtubules composed of brightly fluorescent and dimly fluorescent segments (modified from Ref. 19Hyman A.A. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1991; 14: 125-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brightly labeled microtubule seeds were prepared by incubating 1.5 µl of 10 mg/ml rhodamine-labeled bovine brain tubulin, 0.75 µl of glycerol, and 0.25 µl of PEM100 buffer containing 10 mmGTP for 1 h at 37 °C. Seeds were sheared five times with a 25-gauge needle that had the beveled tip removed with scissors. Sheared seeds (0.5 µl) were incubated with 2.5 µl of 10 mg/ml rhodamine labeled tubulin, 6 µl of PEM100, and 1 µl of 10 mm GTP (1 h, 37 °C). To cross-link the resulting brightly labeled microtubules, 1 µl of 15 mm ethylene glycol bis(succinamidyl succinate) was added, the solution was incubated (15 min, 37 °C), transferred into 50 µl quenching buffer (10 mm sodium glutamate, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50% sucrose), mixed by vortexing, and incubated (room temperature, 1 h). The solution was then applied to a 200-µl 60% sucrose cushion in PEM100 and centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 200,000 × g. The microtubule pellet was resuspended in 25 µl of PEM100 and sheared by passage 10 times through a 25-gauge needle to produce short brightly labeled seeds. Dimly fluorescent microtubules were then polymerized off the plus-ends of brightly labeled seeds by incubation of 20 µl of seeds, 2 µl of 10 mg/ml rhodamine-labeled tubulin, 10 µl of 10 mg/ml unlabeled purified bovine brain tubulin, 12 µl of 10 mg/ml NEM-modified bovine brain tubulin (19Hyman A.A. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1991; 14: 125-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 18 µl of PEM100, and 6.7 µl of 10 mm GTP for 45 min at 37 °C. Microtubule constructs were stabilized by the addition of 3.3 µl of 0.4 mm taxol in methanol and gentle vortexing. The stabilized microtubule constructs were applied to two 200-µl 60% sucrose cushions in PEM100 containing 20 µm taxol and centrifuged for 45 min at 200,000 ×g. Final microtubule pellets were resuspended in a total of 32 µl of PEM100 containing 20 µm taxol and antifade components described above. The fluorescent microtubule constructs were used at a 1:20 dilution in motility assays. Proteins with known S values were centrifuged through 5–50% sucrose gradients in PEM100 buffer for 14 h at 200,000 × g. The protein standards used were catalase (11.3 S), β-amylase (8.98 S), and bovine serum albumin (4.4 S). Two-drop fractions were collected from each gradient, protein peaks were identified by the Bradford protein assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar), and the fraction volume was plotted against the known S values to generate a standard curve. A monoclonal kinesin heavy chain antibody (SUK-4) was used for immunoblots at a dilution of 1:1000 (Covance, Richmond, CA). HSET antibodies were generously provided by Dr. Duane Compton (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) and used for immunoblots at a dilution of 1:1000. Antibodies to CENP-E were generously provided by Dr. Tim Yen (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) and used for immunoblots at a dilution of 1:6000. Our primary goal was to characterize motors from mitotic cells; thus, a highly enriched mitotic cell population was obtained by incubation of a 106 cells/ml suspension with 12 nm vinblastine sulfate for one cell cycle (see “Experimental Procedures”). This concentration was chosen to produce a cell population with a high mitotic index (90%) and intact spindles (21Jordan M.A. Thrower D. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2212-2222PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jordan M.A. Thrower D. Wilson L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 401-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined that we could isolate motor proteins in sufficient quantities for characterization from about 70 ml of packed cells, obtained from ∼70 liters of suspension culture. A flow chart outlining the basic purification scheme for motor proteins present in the mitotic cells is shown in Fig.1. For the present study, we focused on the purification and characterization of three of the motors: conventional kinesin, HSET, and CENP-E. These motors were identified and followed during the purification procedures using specific antibodies and fluorescent microtubule gliding assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that the initial HSS (see “Experimental Procedures”) contained a robust motor activity that moved microtubules at a rapid rate of ∼30 µm/min at 25 °C (Fig. 2). The individual microtubules glided for several hundred µm without dissociating from the glass surface; thus, the motor appeared to be processive. Based on these properties, we suspected that the fast motor might be conventional kinesin, and we designed a purification scheme for its isolation. The HSS was batch-absorbed to DEAE-cellulose, packed into a column, and eluted with PEM50-P (see “Experimental Procedures”). The protein flow-through fraction (DE-FT; Fig. 1), which contained the fast motor as well as other motors (data not shown), was collected, concentrated, and fractionated on a BioGel-A 1.5-m gel filtration column (Fig. 3). The fractions containing the fast motor (fractions 34–42) were pooled (Fig. 4, lane 1) and subjected to a microtubule affinity purification step in the presence of AMPPNP, a procedure routinely used for affinity purification of kinesin and KRPs (4Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1105-1171PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of proteins present in the pooled fractions did not adhere to the microtubules (Fig. 4, lane 2), while the fast motor bound tightly to taxol-stabilized microtubules in the presence of 2 mm AMPPNP (data not shown). The microtubules with the bound fast motor and other proteins were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (see “Experimental Procedures”) and resuspended in PEM100-P containing 300 mm NaCl. Proteins that dissociated from the microtubules in the presence of NaCl are shown in Fig. 4, lane 3. The microtubules and all proteins that remained bound in the presence of NaCl were again sedimented and resuspended in PEM100P plus 10 mm MgATP and 300 mm NaCl to release the proteins that were bound in an ATP-sensitive manner (Fig. 4, lane 4). The released proteins were then fractionated on a 5–50% sucrose gradient, and two-drop fractions were collected (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fast motor fractionated as a single peak in fractions 26–29 of the gradient (data not shown). The pooled fractions contained a single polypeptide that migrated at ∼120 kDa (Fig. 4,lane 5, upper arrow) and a trace amount of residual bovine brain tubulin (Fig. 4, lane 5, lower arrow). No other proteins could be detected on heavily overloaded Coomassie Blue-stained gels or on silver-stained gels (data not shown); thus, we conclude that the motor had been purified to homogeneity. The purified protein had a sedimentation coefficient of ∼7 S as determined by comparison with proteins of known S values (data not shown).Figure 3Fractionation of the fast motor activity by gel filtration chromatography. DE52 flow-through proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, centrifuged to a pellet, resuspended in PEM100-P, and applied to a BioGel-A 1.5-m gel filtration column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Samples from fractions eluted from the column were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize total protein. Column load (L) and molecular weight standards (M) are shown, and the column fractions are indicated by fraction number. Sizes of molecular mass standards are indicated in kilodaltons. Each fraction was subjected to a microtubule gliding assay, and the results are indicatedabove each fraction number; a plus sign indicates the presence of the fast gliding activity, and a minus sign indicates that the fraction did not support microtubule gliding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Purification of kinesin by microtubule affinity and sucrose gradient centrifugation.

Molecular mass standards (M) are indicated in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 120-kDa protein was identified as conventional kinesin heavy chain by mass spectrometry. The band was excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel, and the protein was sequenced by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (Harvard Microchemistry Facility). The sequences of multiple individual tryptic fragments of the protein corresponded exactly with sequences present in human ubiquitous kinesin heavy chain (data not shown). In addition, the kinesin heavy chain antibody, SUK-4, recognized the 120-kDa polypeptide on immunoblots (Fig. 4, lane 5′), further indicating that the protein was conventional kinesin. The active purified kinesin motor did not appear to contain light chains, since no additional protein bands could be detected either by Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 4, lane 5) or by silver stain (data not shown). To determine if kinesin light chains were present in the active kinesin motor fractions, we performed Western blots using antibodies against the conserved region of kinesin light chain. No cross-reactivity to the antibodies was detected in the active motor fractions. The antibodies did, however, recognize light chains in other gradient fractions 3DeLuca and Wilson, unpublished observation. and so clearly were able to detect light chains. Therefore, the active human 7 S conventional kinesin that we isolated is composed solely of the heavy chain(s). The purified 7 S kinesin moved microtubules at a rate of 32.2 ± 1.5 µm/min at 25 °C (n = 240), a rate similar to that of the activity detected in the clarified lysate. When assayed at physiological temperature (37 °C), the gliding rate increased ∼2-fold to 61.5 ± 2.0 µm/min (n = 50). The directionality of the kinesin was tested using polarity-marked fluorescent microtubules prepared with NEM-labeled tubulin (19Hyman A.A. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1991; 14: 125-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microtubules glided with their brightly labeled minus-ends leading (Fig. 5), indicating that the kinesin is a plus-end-directed motor. However, when directionality was tested using polarity-marked microtubules in the absence of NEM, the microtubules glided in both directions (data not shown). To determine whether the HeLa cell kinesin was similar to other conventional kinesins, we examined the nucleotide specificity of the gliding activity and inhibition by known kinesin inhibitors. As shown in Table I, HeLa cell kinesin could utilize GTP to produce microtubule gliding but at only 10% of the efficiency of ATP. Neither 1 mm ATPγS, 1,N 6-etheno-ATP, nor 8-bromo-ATP supported microtubule gliding. Microtubule gliding was supported by 1 mm 2′-deoxy-ATP, 3′-deoxy-ATP, and 2′,3′-dideoxy-ATP, but the rate was reduced to 84, 63, and 18%, respectively, of the gliding rate in the presence of 1 mm ATP. As reported in TableII, the HeLa cell kinesin gliding was inhibited with 1 mm AMPPNP, whereas gliding was not affected by 2 mm NEM. Finally, vanadate inhibited the gliding of kinesin at 100 µm but not at 50 µm.Table INucleotide specificity of HeLa cell kinesinNucleotideRate of gliding (percentage of control)a%ATP100GTP10 ± 4ATPγS01, N 6-ethenoATP08-Bromo-ATP02′-Deoxy-ATP84 ± 63′-Deoxy-ATP63 ± 82′3′-Dideoxy-ATP18 ± 2a Control gliding is the gliding rate of purified kinesin at 25 °C in the presence of 1 mm ATP (32.7 ± 1.9 µm/min, n = 92).

HeLa cells blocked in mitosis by vinblastine were used as the source material for purified kinesin, since we were primarily interested in isolating mitotic motor proteins. However, we also purified kinesin from asynchronous HeLa cells, which consisted primarily of cells in interphase (∼96%). The biochemical properties of kinesin purified from the interphase cells were not distinguishable from those of the kinesin purified from mitotic cells. Specifically, the active form of the motor consisted only of heavy chains and induced plus-end-directed microtubule gliding at a rate of ∼30 µm/min (data not shown). We found, using specific antibodies, that the DE-FT fraction also contained HSET, the human homolog ofDrosophila Ncd (non-claretdisjunction).

https://openalex.org/W1998911006,"A screening for multicopy suppressors of the G1/S blockage of a conditional sit4 hal3mutant yielded the NHA1 gene, encoding a Na+,K+/H+ antiporter, composed of a transmembrane domain and a large carboxyl-terminal tail, which has been related to cation detoxification processes. Expression of either the powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ena1 Na+/H+-ATPase or the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Sod2 Na+/H+ antiporter, although increasing tolerance to sodium, was unable to mimic the Nha1 function in the cell cycle. Mutation of the conserved Asp residues Asp266-Asp267 selectively abolished Na+ efflux without modifying K+ efflux and did not affect the capacity of Nha1 to relieve the G1 blockage. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that the region near the carboxyl-terminal end of Nha1 comprising residues 800–948 is dispensable for sodium detoxification but necessary for transport of K+ cations. Therefore, this portion of the protein contains structural elements that selectively modulate Nha1 antiporter functions. This region is also required for Nha1 to function in the cell cycle. However, expression of the closely related Cnh1 antiporter from Candida albicans, which also contains a long carboxyl-terminal extension, although allowing efficient K+transport does not relieve cell cycle blockage. This indicates that although the determinants for Nha1-mediated regulation of potassium transport and the cell cycle map very closely in the protein, most probably the function of Nha1 on cell cycle is independent of its ability to extrude potassium cations."

We previously reported that a ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, known as ITF2, is up-regulated during this switch, and we now report that treatment of melanocytes with melanocyte-stimulating hormone down-regulates expression of ITF2. To more fully characterize the involvement of ITF2 in regulating melanogenic gene transcription, ITF2 sense or antisense constructs were introduced into melan-a melanocytes. Gene and protein expression analyses and luciferase reporter assays using promoters from melanogenic genes showed that up-regulation of ITF2 suppressed melanogenic gene expression as well as the expression of Mitf, a melanocyte-specific transcription factor. In addition, stable ITF2 sense transfectants had significant reductions in pigmentation and a less dendritic phenotype compared with mock transfectants. In contrast, ITF2 antisense-transfected melanocytes were more pigmented and more dendritic. These results demonstrate that up-regulation of ITF2 during the pheomelanin switch is functionally significant and reveal that differential expression of a ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor can modulate expression of melanogenic genes and the differentiation of melanocytes.

The eumelanin/pheomelanin ratio is regulated in mice by at least three genetic loci termed agouti,POMC, and extension. Those loci encode agouti signal protein (ASP),1proopiomelanocortin (a precursor of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)), and the MSH receptor, called the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), respectively (for review, see Refs. 3Barsh G.S.

ASP, which is produced in hair follicles, acts on follicular melanocytes to switch them from producing eumelanin to pheomelanin, whereas MSH has the reverse effect (3Barsh G.S.

In mice wild-type at the agoutilocus, eumelanin is usually produced by follicular melanocytes during hair growth (6Siracusa L.D. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 423-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, ASP is transiently expressed from days 4 to 7 of the hair growth cycle and signals follicular melanocytes to produce pheomelanin rather than eumelanin (5Jackson I.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 587-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Eumelanin and pheomelanin differ not only in their gross appearance but also in their chemical composition and in the structure of melanosomes in which they are synthesized and deposited (2Ozeki H.

Several studies have shown that ASP acts as a competitive antagonist of the MC1R and that the switch between eu- and pheomelanogenesis involves the opposing effects of ASP and MSH as ligands for that receptor (4Cone R.D.

This suggests that ASP could affect the downstream signaling of the MC1R leading to the transcriptional down-regulation of melanogenic genes. We have recently shown (20Kobayashi T. Vieira W.D. Potterf S.B. Sakai C. Imokawa G. Hearing V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2301-2309PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sakai C. Ollmann M. Kobayashi T. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Imokawa G. Barsh G.S.

All genes currently known to be important to eumelanin production (including tyrosinase, Tyrp1,Dct, Pmel17, and pinkeyed-dilution) are transcriptionally down-regulated during pheomelanogenesis (20Kobayashi T. Vieira W.D. Potterf S.B. Sakai C. Imokawa G. Hearing V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2301-2309PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lamoreux M.L. Zhou B.K. Rosemblat S. Orlow S.J. Pigm. Cell Res. 1995; 8: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the dramatic differences elicited during pheomelanogenesis, both with respect to the structural reorganization of melanosomes and the chemistry of melanins produced, suggest that there must be genes that are up-regulated during this switch. In a recent study (24Furumura M. Sakai C. Potterf S.B. Vieira W. Barsh G.S. Hearing V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7374-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we used high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and differential display to begin identifying such up-regulated genes. Several genes were identified with one of the most interesting being a transcription factor termed ITF2 (also known as SEF2). ITF2 is a member of the ubiquitous Class A basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family termed E proteins. Members of that family, which include the isoforms ITF2A and ITF2B, bind a consensus DNA sequence CAXXTG also known as an E-box (25Voronova A. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4722-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). E-box-binding proteins share a common bHLH motif that mediates their dimerization and a basic region located upstream of the HLH domain serves for DNA binding (26Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). ITF2 has the capacity to regulate the expression of various tissue-specific genes that results from its ability to form homo- or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins. In melanocytes, a melanocyte-specific Class C bHLH-zip (or bHLH leucine zipper) transcription factor, termed microphthalmia (Mitf in mice and MITF in humans), is critically important for melanoblast development and also for regulation of melanogenic gene expression in mature melanocytes (16Aberdam E.

Based on those findings and our own results, our hypothesis is that ITF2 might form homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, and because ITF2 is up-regulated during pheomelanogenesis, this might result in the transcriptional down-regulation of melanogenic genes. Because Mitf is the principal regulatory transcription factor that regulates the expression of melanogenic genes, opposing effects of ITF2 and Mitf might be important in modulating melanocyte differentiation. The functional significance of ubiquitously expressed bHLH proteins has recently become well recognized in terms of the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression in various types of cells such as myocytes, pancreatic cells, and B-lymphocytes (26Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, ITF2 has been shown to inhibit the activities of various tissue-specific gene promoters (34Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol.

In this study, we present evidence that ITF2 can modulate melanogenic gene expression in concert with its effects on Mitf expression and function. Our findings suggest that these ubiquitous bHLH proteins function in melanocytes as regulators of melanogenesis that control melanocyte differentiation and modulate the expression of melanogenic enzymes in response to extrinsic physiological factors.

C3H/HeJ agouti mice (A/A; B/B; C/C) and C57BL/6J (C3H/HeJ F1) mice (A/a; B/B; C/C) were purchased from Charles River (Kingston, NY). C57BL/6J non-agouti black mice (a/a; B/B; C/C) and C57BL/6J lethal yellow mice (Ay/−; B/B; C/C) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Lethal yellow mice were maintained by matings between heterozygous lethal yellow (Ay/a) male and black (a/a) female mice. Sibling non-agouti (a/a) and heterozygous non-agouti (A/a) were produced via matings of male C57BL/6J (a/a) mice and female C57BL/6J (C3H/HeJ F1) (A/a) mice. All mice were housed in the animal facility of NCI/National Institutes of Health. The melan-a melanocyte line (44Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Hart I.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 39: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) derived from non-agouti black mice (a/a; B/B; C/C) was kindly provided by Dr. Dorothy C. Bennett (St. George's Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom). Melanocytes were cultured at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, 5% FBS, 70 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and 100 µm 2-mercaptoethanol at pH 7.2 until reaching semiconfluence as reported previously (21Sakai C.

Typically 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 150-mm-diameter dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h; treatment with 100 nm MSH or 10 nm ASP was then initiated for 4 days. Controls were cultured in the absence of MSH and ASP but with similar volumes of ASP storage buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 50 mmNaCl). Anesthetized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their dorsal skins were dissected. Immediately after removing fat and subcutaneous tissue, hair follicles were scraped off with a razor blade and were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were pulverized and homogenized in 5 volumes (v/v) of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin) in a Microson Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor XL (Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) using three 30-s pulses. Melan-a melanocytes were treated with 100 nm MSH or 10 nm ASP for a total of 4 days as described above. For immunoblot analyses of nuclear proteins, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (45Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared for Western immunoblot analyses by sonicating harvested cells in Nonidet P-40/SDS cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and 100 µm PMSF), as described previously (21Sakai C. Ollmann M. Kobayashi T. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Muller J. Vieira W.D. Imokawa G. Barsh G.S. Hearing V.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (10 µg/lane) were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following transblotting onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 1.5 h at 25 V, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Antibodies to detect tyrosinase, Tyrp1, or Dct were used at a 1/1500 dilution (normal rabbit serum was used as a control), whereas antibodies to Mitf were used at a 1/1000 dilution. Membranes used to detect ITF2 were treated overnight with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat milk and 0.25% Nonidet P-40 as previously described (35Liu Y. Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Luntz-Leybman V. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19269-19276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and this blocking solution was also used for antibody incubation and washing steps instead of TBS-T. Antibodies to ITF2 were used at a 1/1000 dilution. Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse immunoglobulins at a 1/2000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech. To produce the desired ITF2 antisense RNA for the RNase protection assay, we obtained a 0.8-kb fragment of ITF2A cDNA from a melan-a melanocyte cDNA library (34Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). That clone contains 798 base pairs of the ITF2A cDNA 5′-end that overlaps 1073–1711 of ITF2B cDNA. Total RNAs from skin tissues and melan-a melanocytes were extracted with a TRIZOL Total RNA Isolation Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For RNase protection analyses, template plasmid DNA was linearized with the appropriate restriction endonuclease, and antisense RNA was synthesized in vitrousing Riboprobe System-T7 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in the presence of [α-32P]CTP according to the manufacturer's protocol. One µg of total RNA and 105 cpm of riboprobe were co-precipitated and allowed to anneal prior to RNase digestion using a HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protected RNA fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide, 40% urea gels and visualized with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5–10 µg) was denatured, electrophoresed through 1.25% agarose gels, and then blotted to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) using a TurboBlotter System (Schleicher & Schuell) and UV light cross-linking (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Radioactive probes were generated with a Prime-It RmT random prime labeling kit (Stratagene) with [α-32P]dCTP. A 1.1-kb XbaI fragment of pcDNA3.1(−)ITF2 was used to detect ITF2. The Mitf probe used was a 1.3-kb HindIII-NotI fragment cut from Mitf provided by Dr. Heinz Arnheiter (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) that contains the full open reading frame (46Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expression vectors PGK-ITF-2A and PGK-ITF-2B mouse cDNAs containing theNotI-SalI and SspI-NotI fragments of the full-length cDNAs including the coding regions of ITF2A and ITF2B, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. Ilona S. Skerjanc (Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario, Ontario, Canada). For stable transfection, the 2.3-kbBamHI-XhoI fragment of PGK-ITF2B containing the coding region was transferred into the BamHI-XhoI site of a plasmid expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for sense orientation (pcDNA3.1-ITF2B) and a pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) for antisense orientation (pcDNA3.1-ITF2B-RV). To construct the expression vector pcDNA3.1-Mitf, a full-length Mitf cDNA (47Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Heinz Arnheiter) was isolated and subcloned into the plasmid expression vector pcDNA3.1(−). Construction of reporter plasmids pGL3-Tyr, pGL3-Tyrp1, and pGL3-Dct, which contain the mousetyrosinase, mouse Tyrp1, and human Dctpromoters, respectively, was done as described previously (30Bertolotto C. Busca R. Abbe P. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A pGL2 vector containing a 2.3-kb fragment 5′ to the transcription start site of the Mitf gene (pMITF-2256) was kindly provided by Dr. Masayoshi Tachibana (Saitama Cancer Institute, Saitama, Japan) (48Tachibana M. Takeda K. Nobukuni Y. Urabe K. Long J.E. Meyers K.A. Aaronson S.A. Miki T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Melan-a melanocytes were plated 2 days before transfection, and COS1 cells were plated 16 h before transfection in six-well plates. Using SuperFect reagent, melanocytes (∼80% confluent) or COS1 cells (∼60% confluent) were co-transfected with 2.5 µg of DNA consisting of 2 µg reporter plasmid, 0.3 µg of expression plasmid, and 0.05 µg of Renilla luciferase expression vector pRL CMV (Promega Corp.). The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 2.5 µg with sheared salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the QIAfilter plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activities using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.) and a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Luciferase activities were normalized forRenilla luciferase activity using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Melan-a cells (5 × 105 cells/dish) were seeded into 150-mm culture dishes in RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.4, supplemented with 5% FBS and 70 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Two days later, the cells were transfected with 20 µg of pcDNA3.1-ITF2B (or pcDNA3.1-ITF2B-RV) and with 1 µg of the pEF6/HIS blasticidin S selection vector (Invitrogen) using the SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then incubated for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS, then trypsinized, and seeded at a 1/5 dilution in 150-mm culture dishes in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FBS. The cells were switched the next day to a selective RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 µg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen). After 7 days of culture in the selective medium, 12 representative blasticidin S-resistant clones from each of the sense or antisense transfectants were expanded in 12-well dishes. Ten days later, surviving blasticidin-resistant clones were trypsinized, mixed together, and used for additional experiments as stable ITF2 sense or ITF2 antisense transfectants. For light microscopy, cells growing in six-well plates (treated as noted in the legend to Fig.6) were photographed using an inverted Olympus microscope under phase contrast and bright field microscopy. For electron microscopy, cells were harvested, centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C, and fixed for 2 h at 23 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3; the fixative was then removed and the samples were stored in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% sucrose at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently processed with graded alcohols and embedded in epoxy resin for electron microscopy in the usual manner. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, viewed, and photographed with a LEO EM912 Omega electron microscope as detailed previously (21Sakai C. Ollmann M. Kobayashi T.

For immunoprecipitation assays, 107 melan-a melanocytes were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. For immunoprecipitation of hair follicle proteins, 200 µg of protein from hair samples were diluted to 1 ml with immunoprecipitation buffer (IPB) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. These extracts were subsequently sonicated at 4 °C in a Microson Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor XL for three 30-s pulses at setting 8 followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants w"

This movement may trigger the chain of conformational changes leading to metarhodopsin I (M-I = 478 nm) and the signaling state metarhodopsin II (M-II, 380 nm), which binds the G-protein Gt (5Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The crucial steps in these activating conformational changes are the proton translocation from the retinal-Schiff base to its counterion at Glu113with concurrent breakage of the salt bridge and the subsequent proton uptake that disrupts interactions near Glu134 (5Okada T.

Current evidence suggests that the all-trans-retinal provides a rigid scaffold for the correct adjustment of the structurally sensitive proton translocations (7Meyer C.K. Böhme M. Ockenfels A.

This study arose from the idea to probe the retinal site by light absorption in the active M-II state. When the normal activating pathway is reverted by photolysing M-II with blue light (λ <420 nm), one measures a shift of the absorption maximum indicating reprotonation of the retinal-Schiff base and proton release, a photoproduct with λmax = 500 nm is formed that was so far identified with the 11-cis- or 9-cis-retinal bound ground state (12Matthews R.G.

However, we will show that this photoproduct does not represent a photoregenerated ground state of rhodopsin or isorhodopsin but rather a product with new properties. Because photoexcitation of the signaling state fails to restore the ground state in vertebrate rhodopsin, the regeneration through the complex cellular metabolism (for review see Ref. 17Palczewski K.

Bovine rod outer segments were prepared from fresh dark-adapted retinas by means of a discontinuous sucrose gradient method and stored at −80 °C. Washed rhodopsin membranes were prepared by removing the soluble and membrane-associated proteins from rod outer segment disc membranes by repetitive washes with a low ionic strength buffer and subsequently washed with fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin (18Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Pulvermüller A. Schröder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37679-37685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The membrane suspension was stored at −80 °C until use. FTIR samples were prepared by centrifugation (20Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In approximately 40 µl of washed membranes (0.3 mm rhodopsin), the pH was adjusted by a few microliters of diluted NaOH or HCl. The suspension was centrifuged for 25 min at 100,000 × g, yielding 2.2 mm rhodopsin in the pellet (from absorption at 500 nm). The buffer solution was removed, and the pellet was transferred to a 30-mm diameter temperature-controlled transmission cell with two BaF2windows and a 5-µm polytetrafluorethylene-gasket. FTIR measurements were performed with a Bruker ifs 66-V spectrometer equipped with an LN2-cooled HgMnTe detector (J15D-series, EG&G Judson). After equilibration for 1 h, a set of 4 transmission spectra was recorded (for details see Ref. 20Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After a 20-s illumination with a 150-watt fiberoptic light source filtered through heat (Schott KG2) and a 495-nm long pass filter, a second set of spectra was recorded. The sets of spectra were averaged, and the M-II minus Rh difference spectrum was generated (we use the convention that the spectra of the conversion A → B are calculated as B − A and termed B − A difference spectrum). The spectra were recorded in the absorbance mode. For photolysis of M-II, the sample was illuminated through a bandpass filter optics (400 ± 20 nm) resulting from the cut-off characteristics of the fiberoptics and a Schott UG1 filter. After illumination for 30 s, the P (photoreverted M-II) minus M-II difference spectrum was generated as described above. To obtain the difference spectra of M-III, an M-II sample was allowed to decay for 2 h at room temperature and at pH 7.0. Then the spectra were taken from the decay product, and the sample was illuminated with green light for 30 s. Subtraction of the decay product spectra (“after” minus “before” illumination) yielded the M-II′ minus M-III difference spectrum. Throughout this study, we use the term M-II′ when an M-II-like species is formed from states other than the rhodopsin ground state. For flash experiments, aliquots of the FTIR preparation were used. M-II was photolysed by a 400-nm light flash (bandwidth is ∼50 nm, Schott BG1) (for details see Ref. 15Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1937-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To follow the formation of P-products, the absorption change at 540 nm was recorded. This wavelength was chosen to minimize the reconversion of the P-products (λmax = 470–500 nm) to M-II′. To monitor the formation of M-II, the samples were photolysed by a 500-nm light flash, and the absorption change was recorded at 380 nm. After recording the infrared spectra, samples (Rh, M-II, or P, see Fig. 1) were removed from the BaF2window of the infrared cuvettes and immediately solved in ice-cold ethanol (21Scherrer P. Mathew M.K. Sperling W. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The solution was stirred for 2 min, and the same amount of heptane was added. After stirring for another 2 min, the sample was centrifuged for 1 min, and the heptane-phase was analyzed immediately in a Hewlett Packard HPLC device (Series 1050) equipped with a Silica Gel 60 column (5 µm) with 5% diethyl ether/heptane at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The traces are of absorption changes at 350 nm and are normalized to total retinal. The procedure to extract retinal oximes was followed as published previously (17Palczewski K. Van Hooser J.P. Garwin G.G. Chen J. Liou G.I. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Landers G.M. Olson J.A. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 438: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but with 10 mm hydroxylamine, 10% SDS, mobile phase, and 12% diethyl ether/heptane. The proportion of each isomer in the samples was determined from the sum of the total peak areas of its syn- andanti-retinal oximes and calculated according to the following extinction coefficients (ε360, in heptane):syn-all-trans, 54,900;anti-all-trans, 51,600;syn-11-cis, 35,000;anti-11-cis, 29,600;syn-13-cis, 49,000; andanti-13-cis, 52,100 (23Groenendijk G.W. de Grip W.J. Daemen F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 304-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Concentrated rod disc membrane suspensions were placed in transmission FTIR cuvettes (20Bartl F. Ritter E. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and either were used directly for UV-visible flash photolysis and FTIR difference spectroscopy or resuspended for retinal extraction and HPLC analysis. To ensure a quantitative extraction with retention of configuration, the retinal extraction was performed in the presence of hydroxylamine (17Palczewski K. Van Hooser J.P. Garwin G.G. Chen J. Liou G.I. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Both the syn and the anti forms of retinaloxime were fully resolved. Fig. 1 A shows HPLC traces of both the native retinaldehydes (left) and of retinaloximes formed with hydroxylamine (right). The data are from the freshly prepared dark-kept samples (Rh), an aliquot after green illumination for 20 s (generating M-II), and an aliquot after green and subsequent blue illumination (generating the photolysis product of M-II termed P). The relative amounts of retinal extracted from these samples were similar for retinal aldehydes and retinal oximes (Fig. 1 A, right). In the fresh membranes, most of the extracted chromophore is in the 11-cis-form with a fraction of approximately 13 ± 3% (maximum deviation in three experiments relative to the total retinal) of all-trans-retinal. The green illumination led to virtually complete conversion into M-II and a correspondingly higher amount (95%) of extracted all-trans-retinal (Fig.1 A). Subsequent blue illumination for 30 s photolysed >60% M-II formed as estimated from the characteristic M-II bands in the FTIR difference spectra (see below). It generated a corresponding amount of “photoreverted” P-product with reprotonated retinal-Schiff base as monitored by the red-shifted absorption maximum in the UV-visible spectra (λmax = 470–500 nm (14Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) (data not shown). The amount of trans-retinaloxime extracted from the sample after blue light illumination and formation of P-product was slightly lower than in the M-II sample (Fig. 1 A,right). However, the decrease relative to thetrans-isomer formed with M-II was 25% at maximum and not 60% as expected from the amount of the P-product. The fraction ofcis-isomers extracted was 16 and 9% for 11-cis- and 13-cis-retinal, respectively. To minimize the effect of variable amounts of all-trans-retinal in the Rh preparation (freshly prepared dark-kept membranes, Fig. 1 A), the fractions of the retinal isomers were calculated relative to the increase of all-trans-retinal between rhodopsin and M-II. Fig. 1 B shows the FTIR difference spectra of the Rh → M-II and M-II → P conversions measured on the same samples as they were used for HPLC. In the M-II minus Rh difference spectrum (green), a first class of spectral features (protein bands) reflects structural alterations in the protein,i.e. changes in the hydrogen bonding and protonation of carboxyl groups (Asp83, Glu122, and Glu113, at 1768, 1748, and 1712 cm−1, respectively) and in the peptide backbone (amide I and II bands at 1700–1620 and 1570–1500 cm−1, respectively) (24Siebert F. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-323Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The second class of bands (retinal bands) arises from changes in retinal geometry and retinal-protein interaction reflected in C-C stretching vibrations (fingerprint region, 1238 cm−1 band and its satellites) and hydrogen out of plane vibrations (HOOP region, 960/970 cm−1). Retinal-related bands also appear in the 1550–1570-cm−1 region (C-C stretching vibration), thus interfering with the amide II bands. The difference spectrum of M-II photolysis (blue, normalized to the 1768-cm−1band) expresses the protein bands with inverse polarity, producing a mirror image of the difference spectrum of M-II formation. This does not apply to the retinal C-C stretching vibrations reflecting the geometry of the chromophore (24Siebert F. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-323Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar); the fingerprint and HOOP bands are small and show a new pattern that is different from the forward path. Specific for M-II photolysis is a new band at 1350 cm−1, which is only seen with photoreversal and not detected in the forward pathway. This band may reflect new interactions of the reprotonated Schiff base with the receptor environment. Band positions at 1302 cm−1 and 1400 cm−1 were recently assigned to the C-H and N-H in-plane-bending vibrations, respectively, of the retinal chromophore in bacteriorhodopsin (25Heberle J. Fitter J. Sass H.J. Büldt G. Biophys. Chem. 2000; 85: 229-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Blue flash photolysis of the FTIR samples (Fig.2 A) reproduced the previous finding on suspensions (14Arnis S. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9333-9340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that P is a mixture of two products with reprotonated Schiff base, P470 and P500(subscripts indicate λmax). A high affinity C-terminal peptide from the Gt α-subunit inhibits the conversion of M-II to P500, which identifies P470 as a state that does not interact with Gt (15Ernst O.P. Meyer C.K. Marin E.P. Henklein P. Fu W.Y. Sakmar T.P. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1937-1943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At pH 4.0, the only product formed is P470, which enables the separation of both products in the FTIR spectra. Fig. 2 A shows the spectral differences between M-II and the P-products. The only distinct feature in the P470 minus M-II difference spectrum (Fig.2 A) is the positive band at 1558 cm−1, suggesting that P470 is structurally similar to M-II. This assigns the ensemble of protein bands reflecting deactivation to P500 and fits to the observation that P500 but not P470 is affected by the peptide. Extended blue illumination in photoequilibrium (80% of the initial M-II converted into P-products as defined by the infrared spectrum) produced a steady increase of extracted cis-retinal forms (50% after 20 min, data not shown). At pH 4.0 (where P470 is present), 11-cis-isoform and 13-cis-isoform predominated, whereas at pH 6.0 (with both P470 and P500present), the 9-cis-isoform was seen additionally. During the formation of the cis-species in equilibrium, the infrared spectra of both P500 and P470 did not change significantly. Fig.3 A compares the difference spectra for the conversions M-II → P and P → M-II′ (top,blue and green). The two difference spectra are a perfect mirror image of each other including the fingerprint region ∼1238 cm−1. This shows that chromophore/protein interactions in these two products are reversible in contrast to the rhodopsin → M-II conversion (see Fig. 1 B). The thermal decay of M-II leads in parallel to the hydrolysis of the retinal-Schiff base (yielding opsin and free all-trans-retinal) and to the formation of one or several species with protonated retinal-Schiff base termed metarhodopsin III (M-III, broad UV-visible absorption with λmax ≈ 470 nm). M-III is inactive toward Gt (26Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C. Beach J.M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6761-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). With the formation of M-III, the FTIR protein bands assigned to M-II have disappeared (data not shown) (27Rothschild K.J. Gillespie J. DeGrip W.J. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 345-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Klinger A.L. Braiman M.S. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1244-1255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Photolysis of M-III for 30 s with green light reverts up to 40% back to an M-II-like product (M-II′) with a difference spectrum (Fig. 3 A, bottom,green) that shows all essential features of the “reverted reversal” M-II′ minus P spectrum including the protein bands and the fingerprint. Flash illumination (Fig. 3 B) of M-III for 20 µs generates a fast increase of 380 nm absorption. Although this experiment does not identify the product, it is probably a form of M-II, because it is formed with a rate similar to that of M-II formation from the rhodopsin ground state. Also, the efficiency of formation is similar when accounting for the reduced spectral overlap between the excitation spectrum of the flash and M-III as compared with the ground state. Moreover, M-II′ is an active species, which is able to bind G-protein. 2M. Heck, unpublished results.The extraction of retinals from M-III (generated by the decay of M-II for 1.5 h at 20 °C) and M-II′ shows a small shift towardcis-species in the relative weight of retinal isomers that accompanies the formation of M-I′ (Fig. 3 C). The most significant states of the photoreceptor rhodopsin are the light-sensitive ground state and the active state metarhodopsin II, which binds and activates the G-protein. The switch between these two states is operated bycis-/trans-isomerization of the chromophore retinal followed by thermal relaxation and proton transfer reactions. However, it has long been known that the presence of bound all-trans-retinal is compatible with both active and inactive states of the receptor linked to photoproducts M-II and M-III, respectively (26Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C. Beach J.M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6761-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 1-54Google Scholar, 30Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 99-142Google Scholar). The salient result of this study is that the conversion between M-II- and M-III-like products can also be induced by the absorption of blue or green light, respectively. Although the trigger mechanism of this reversible second switch remains to be elucidated, the results indicate that the underlying chromophore-protein interaction may not involve isomerization around the retinal C11-C12 double bond. The data indicate a reaction scheme as shown in Fig. 4 A. The normal pathway is shown as an outer circle; it comprises the formation of M-II via the Batho and Lumi intermediates, its decay into opsin and all-trans-retinal and the regeneration of ground state rhodopsin from opsin and metabolically supplied 11-cis-retinal. The inner circle contains the thermal decay of M-II into M-III and the photolytic pathways that were newly identified in this study. Here we neglect the “hybrid” product P470, which is M-II-like by its structure but bears a protonated Schiff base. The products P500 and M-III are significantly different in λmax, indicating alterations in chromophore-protein interaction. We have grouped them into the same class of intermediates, because they have in common the photoconversion by green light to an M-II-like product. They are also similar in their infrared spectrum (including the new band at 1350 cm−1), and they both show the largely red-shifted absorption, which indicates a reprotonated retinal-Schiff base. The second switch between the M-III/P500 and M-II/M-II′ products is illustrated in Fig. 4 B. M-III and M-II are separated by a difference in energy of ∼35–40 kJ mol−1, based on ΔH0 of M-I → M-II (42 kJ mol−1(31Cooper A. Converse C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) and the ΔG0 between M-I and M-III (∼−8 kJ mol−1 (26Kibelbek J. Mitchell D.C. Beach J.M. Litman B.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6761-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). Thus, the second switch is expected to operate on a shallower energy profile (∼15%) than the ground state and/or Batho activation switch. With the limited time resolution of the available techniques, any conclusions about the mechanism of the deactivation switch rely on a comparison of the starting and final products of thermal decay and photolysis. However, the FTIR spectra have clearly shown that neither the fingerprint nor the hydrogen out of plane bands of the retinal seen in the M-II minus rhodopsin difference spectrum are reverted in the P500 minus M-II or M-II′ minus M-III spectra. This demonstrates that the chromophore-protein interaction in the M-II decay or photolysis products (M-III and P500, respectively) is not the same as in the ground state. It raises the question of which form of the chromophore is actually present in P500, and whether a reversal of the cis- andtrans-isomerization is the trigger that reverses the structural changes seen in the spectra. Not only the spectrometric data but also the retinal extraction data are in conflict with this obvious explanation, because the amount of C11-C12 cis-isomer extracted from P500 was significantly smaller than the stoichiometric. Explanations for this latter finding include: (i) P500contains the C11-C12 cis-isomer, butcis is partially transformed to trans during the extraction procedure; (ii) the conversions between the M-II-like and the M-III-like or P500-like products proceed in a two-photon process involving successive trans- andcis- and cis- andtrans-isomerizations; (iii) the photochemical trigger of the conversion is different from C11-C12 double bond isomerization. Although an extraction artifact (i) cannot be excluded, it is unlikely by the observations made with M-III photolysis. In this case, both the starting and the final product are supposed to bind the retinal in the all-trans-form. And indeed, from both M-III and its photolysis product, M-II′, all-trans-retinal was the predominantly extracted isomer with a slight, if any, shift toward 11-cis- and 7-cis-retinal. In principle, a possible solution could arise from a two-photon process (ii). For example, in the M-III photolyzed in the experiment (Fig. 3), the chromophore could have been transferred from its original binding site to another site in concert with the formation of protonated retinal-Schiff base. Such forms of M-III have indeed been observed (29DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 1-54Google Scholar). In the two-photon process, a first absorption would isomerize the chromophore. After rapid breakage of the Schiff base bond, the chromophore would return into the original binding site, and a second photon would then photoconvert this newly formed ground state into M-II′. In this study, this possibility was addressed by flash photolysis of M-III. The data are consistent with the notion that M-II′ is formed by flash photolysis from M-III with the same relative efficiency as with continuous illumination. This would limit the time interval between the two photoexcitations in the assumed two-photon process to 20 µs. Although we cannot exclude that low amounts of M-III-like byproducts are formed, most of the M-III species present under our experimental conditions and identified in the FTIR spectra will contain the retinal in its original site or be just “put aside” so that it can readily return into the position it had in M-II. A rough measure for the time it takes to assemble the free retinal chromophore with its binding site is given by the regeneration of rhodopsin from 11-cis-retinal and opsin apoprotein, which takes seconds (18Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the third mechanism (iii) must be considered a real possibility. The data show that not only 11-cis- but also 7-cis- and 13-cis-isomers are readily detected by the extraction procedure applied. This makes it unlikely that other persistently formed isomers would have escaped the analysis. For the related proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, a light-induced conformational change was found when the protein was regenerated with locked retinal, which cannot isomerize around the C11-C12 double bond. It was discussed that polarization changes in the excited state of the chromophore could trigger a conformational change in the protein that persists even after the chromophore has returned to the ground state (33Aharoni A. Weiner L. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21010-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Haupts U. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

In a recent study on rhodopsin regenerated with locked retinal, it was shown by retinal extraction and HPLC analysis that the chromophore can undergo light-induced isomerization around bonds other than the locked C11-C12 double bond (11Jang G.F.

In a parallel FTIR analysis, a retinal fingerprint band at 1206 cm−1 appeared that probably reflects the isomerization, but indications of structural changes or changes of the protonation state of carboxyl groups could not be obtained to any significant degree. It was concluded that light-induced changes in the chromophore do occur but cannot induce the activating structural changes in the opsin moiety of the receptor when starting from the protonated Schiff base situation in the ground state (11Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P.P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A band in the same region appears also in the present reversal or “reverted reversal” spectra (from conversions M-II → P or P/M-III → M-II′, respectively) as part of a chromophore fingerprint, which replaces the normal fingerprint motif at approximately 1238 cm−1 (arising in the forward pathway as a consequence of the steric trigger in Batho and Lumi and persisting through M-I/M-II (24Siebert F. Isr. J. Chem. 1995; 35: 309-323Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar)). The presence of the 1206-cm−1 band shows that chromophore alterations other than 11-cis- totrans-isomerization do occur in rhodopsin and that they are reflected in the FTIR spectrum. Because predominantly all-trans-retinal was extracted from the photoreverted species, photoisomerization in the majority of P-product formed can only be transient or metastable. However, the protein is persistently deactivated as seen in the spectral changes and in the blockade of the reversal reactions by bound Gt peptide (Fig. 2). The activating forward pathway of rhodopsin leading to helix motion and the exposure of cytoplasmic interaction sites (5Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 6Sakmar T.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

This overcomes the structural constraints imposed by the salt bridge between these two locations. The interactions of the retinal β-ionone ring and of the hydrocarbon chain with the protein environment are different in the meta statesversus the ground state configuration (5Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 8Jäger F. Jäger S. Kräutle O. Friedman N. Sheves M. Hofmann K.P. Siebert F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7389-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anchored in the new interactions and with the Schiff base bond deprotonated, photochemical conversions may be selected that are fundamentally different from those that determine the forward pathway. It will take more extended analyses to find out how this new path proceeds and how similar P500 is to Lumi and/or M-III. On the one hand, the new band at 1350 cm−1 is a distinct property of the photoreversible pathway opened by photolysis of M-II (Figs. 1 and 3) and not seen when starting from the ground state of normal or locked retinal (11Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P.P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the band at 1206 cm−1, which appeared in the spectra of the rhodopsin with locked retinal (see above), may be a part of the fingerprint motif in the reversal or reverted reversal spectra (Figs. 1 and 3). What we can state is that although a different type of chromophore-protein interaction occurs in M-III or P500 as compared with the ground state, the full set of structural changes appears in the spectra. We propose that in forming or leaving the active state, the different crucial elements are coupled to each other (like the spokes of an umbrella) so that the entity of transformations can be triggered by different mechanisms. Although in vitrotechniques are not sensitive enough to determine the activity of P500 or M-III, it is probable that it is higher than the 11-cis-retinal bound ground state. This would mean that only the 11-cis-isomer can impose the stringent constraints that make the ground state so inactive. The presence of a second rhodopsin-like state is in line with the findings that photoregeneration from early intermediates restores the visual absorption of the ground state but not all of its physiological functions (36Paulsen R. Bentrop J. Nature. 1983; 302: 417-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of substantial bleaching and dependent on the irradiation conditions, the P-products are expected to accumulate, which may influence bleaching adaptation phenomena. The current observations may also be relevant for the potential physiological role of M-III as a storage form (29DeGrip W.J. Rothschild K.J. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 1-54Google Scholar, 30Hofmann K.P. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh Jr., E.N. Molecular Mechanism in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2000: 99-142Google Scholar). The new data underline the exclusivity of the normal photolytic pathway in vertebrate rhodopsin. They show that the ground state, which is relevant for normal green light single quantum detection in the rod cell, cannot be reached by photoreversal. Thus, it must arise from a chemical reaction between 11-cis-retinal and the apoprotein. This may elucidate why it takes a complex metabolic process to regenerate vertebrate rhodopsin. It may be the only possible way to achieve a sufficiently stable chromophore-protein configuration to ensure the exceedingly low noise of the transduction process in rods.

The molecular and biochemical characterization of this organelle has provided evidence that it has an orthovanadate-sensitive plasma membrane-type Ca2+ ATPase for Ca2+ uptake (3Docampo R. Scott D.A.

Evidence for non-mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum-located Ca2+ uptake has been more elusive and based on the presence of a low capacity and high affinity orthovanadate-sensitive Ca2+ uptake in permeabilized cells and the ability of these cells to buffer [Ca2+] in the range 0.05–0.1 µm (9Vercesi A.E. Hoffmann M.E. Bernardes C.F. Docampo R. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), features in common with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA)1 of animal cells (10Carafoli E. Brini M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, like mammalian cells (11Parodi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), calcium is needed for the correct folding and assembly of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of T. cruzi, which depends on chaperones such as the Ca2+-binding protein, calreticulin (12Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Biochemical distinction of the different Ca2+ pumps present in T. cruzi has been hampered by the lack of distinguishing features such as specific inhibitor sensitivity. Orthovanadate inhibits all types of Ca2+ ATPases (10Carafoli E. Brini M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of animal SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPases (13Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2988) Google Scholar), is ineffective in inhibiting Ca2+ uptake in permeabilizedT. cruzi (14Moreno S.N.J.

Parasitol. 1993; 59: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, a molecular approach to studying individual pumps is necessary. Expression of genes identified as encoding Ca2+-ATPases and localization of the corresponding proteins is necessary, as the plasma membrane-type Ca2+ATPase/SERCA paradigm does not necessarily apply in non-animal cells; a SERCA-type gene in tomato is expressed in different parts of the cell (16Ferrol N. Bennett A.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1159-1169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a Tca1 gene has been identified in T. cruzi (6Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes a protein with homology to mammalian plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases but with characteristics that place it in a novel category of Ca2+-ATPases along with the vacuolar Ca2+-ATPases described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), Dictyostelium discoideum (18Moniakis J. Coukell M.B. Forer A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The gene is expressed at a high level in the amastigote stage and is localized to acidocalcisomes and the plasma membrane of the parasite (6Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that a gene from T. cruzi(TcSCA) complemented yeast mutants defective in Ca2+ pumps by restoring their growth in EGTA. The protein encoded by the TcSCA gene localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum of different stages of the parasite and, in contrast to the acidocalcisomal Ca2+-ATPase (6Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is expressed at similar levels in the different developmental stages of the parasite. T. cruzi amastigotes and trypomastigotes (Y strain) were obtained from the culture medium of L6E9 myoblasts by a modification of the method of Schmatz and Murray (21Schmatz D.M. Murray P.K. Parasitology. 1982; 85: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as we have described before (14Moreno S.N.J. Vercesi A.E Pignataro O.P. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem.

The contamination of trypomastigotes with amastigotes and intermediate forms or of amastigotes with trypomastigotes or intermediate forms was always less than 5% unless otherwise stated.

T. cruzi expression vector pTEX was a gift from David Engman, Northwestern University (Chicago, IL). Antibodies against T. brucei BiP and T. cruzicalreticulin were kindly provided by James D. Bangs and Armando Parodi, respectively. The antibody against the acidocalcisomal Ca2+-ATPase was described before (6Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Alexafluor 564-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All basic recombinant DNA techniques followed standard procedures described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. To amplify the TcSCAgene, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 40 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min using 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase with 50 ng of T. cruzi genomic DNA, 1 µm each oligonucleotide primer, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm each deoxynucleoside trisphosphate in a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). The PCR products were separated in an agarose gel, purified, and cloned into pGEM-T-easy. The sequences of the primers used for the PCR were: F4, 5′-GC(T/C/A/G)GG(T/C/A/G)AT(T/C/A)(C/A)G(T/C/A/G)GT(T/C/A/G)-3′, that corresponded to AGIRV in the loop region (amino acids 612–615 inTcSCA), and R2, 5′-(A/G)TC(T/C/A/G)GT(T/C/A/G)AC(T/C/A/G)A(A/G)(A/G)TT(T/C/A/G)AC(A/G/C)(T/C)A-3′, which corresponded to WVNLVTD in the M6 region (amino acids 788–794 inTcSCA). To make a T. cruzi subgenomic library, the genomic DNA was completely digested by BglII, and DNA fragments of 5–10 kilobases were purified from the gel and ligated into λZAP-Express vector. The resulting library was screened by plaque hybridization with the PCR clone as a probe in a manner described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52418) Google Scholar) was performed automatically with the Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and a 373A DNA automatic sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (version 8.0, GCG, Madison, WI). Hydropathy plot analysis was performed by using the Kyte and Doolittle method (26Kyte J. Doolittle D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17062) Google Scholar). The cDNA was synthesized by using reverse transcriptase, total RNA, and oligo(dT) as a primer and amplified by PCR using primers corresponding to the T. cruzi splice leader sequence (5′-ATAGAACAGTTTCTGTAC-3′) and a TcSCA sequence (5′-CGAATTCAGCTCCCGTGTAA-3′). PCR conditions were the same as described above except that the annealing temperature was 60 °C. To obtain the vector for TcSCA expression in the yeastS. cerevisiae, a BamHI/EcoRI fragment that contained 261 bp of the 5′-end-untranslated region and 1951 bp of the 5′-end of the TcSCA open reading frame (ORF) was ligated into S. cerevisiae expression vector pYES2. TheBamHI/SalI fragment at the 5′-end of theTcSCA ORF was replaced with theBamHI/SalI-digested PCR fragment amplified by the primer pair (5′-CCCGGATCCAGGATGGCGCTTCTTTCACTCCC-3′ and 5′-CGTGGGAAGTTCATTAGTAC-3′) to give the yeast Kozak consensus sequence (ANNATGG) (27Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and a BamHI site to the 5′-end of the ORF. The 1079 bp of the 3′-end of the TcSCA ORF were added to the plasmid at the EcoRI/HindIII site by theEcoRI/HindIII-digested PCR fragment amplified by the primer pair (5′-AGAGGCCATCTGCAGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-CCGCCTCTAGAAGCTTTTATTTTATTCGTCA-3′). The resulting plasmid was named TcSCA/ pYES2 and used to transform yeast cells. To obtain the vector for green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged TcSCA-encoding protein (TcSCA), a BamHI/HindIII fragment that contained the entire TcSCA ORF was ligated into theBamHI/HindIII site of pBluescript KS(-). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to introduce a uniqueNheI site in the ORF to insert GFP into the loop region of TcSCA. For this purpose, a pair of primers (5′-GATGGAGATCTTTACGCTAGCCCTGGACGGTAATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATTACCGTCCAGGGCTAGCGTAAAGATCTCCATC-3′) that correspond to a part of the loop region (amino acids 371–381) containing a NheI site and complementary to each other were used to amplify the whole plasmid with the mutation by using PfuTurboDNA polymerase. The DNA product was then digested by DpnI to eliminate the methylated, non-mutated parental DNA template and used to transform Escherichia coli. The GFP fragment withNheI sites was amplified by PCR with a primer pair (5′-GGGGGGCTAGCCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGA-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGCTAGCATCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGTG-3′), and the GFP-containing plasmid pXG- GFP+2′ (28Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was digested by NheI and ligated into the NheI site of the TcSCA ORF in pBluescript KS(−). The BamHI/HindIII fragment containing the entire TcSCA ORF with the GFP insertion was ligated into the BamHI/HindIII site of T. cruziexpression vector pTEX (29Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The resulting vector was named TcSCA-GFP/pTEX and was used to transform T. cruziepimastigotes. For Southern blotting, total DNA from epimastigotes (10 µg/lane) was digested with BamHI,BglII, HindIII, SalI, SphI, and EcoRI, separated on 1.0% agarose with TAE (40 mm Tris, 20 mm acetic acid, 1 mmEDTA (pH 8.0)) buffer, and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membrane. The blot was probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeledTcSCA DNA. DNA was isolated by standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the Northern blot analysis total RNA was isolated from trypomastigotes, epimastigotes, and amastigotes of T. cruzi with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose gels with 2.2 mformaldehyde, 20 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 8 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes. DNA probes were prepared using random hexanucleotide primers and a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Prime-a-Gene labeling system) and [α-32P]dCTP. RNA probes were prepared from linearized double-stranded DNA templates with either T3 or T7 promoter sequences upstream of the probe sequence using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Riboprobe in vitro transcription system) and [α-32P]dUTP.

Benson D.R. Parsons M. Elkon K.B. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of Northern blots were done with an ISI-1000 digital imaging system (Alpha Inotech Corp.) and standardized using the intensity of TcP0 transcripts and assuming a similar level of expression of this gene in all stages (31Furuya T. Kashuba C. Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6428-6438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the densitometric values were compared by taking into account the amount of RNA added to each lane in three different experiments. A DNA fragment encoding the 518-amino acid, COOH-terminal domain of TcSCA protein was generated by polymerase chain reaction using T. cruzi genomic DNA as a template. A 5′ primer (primer 1) containing an NheI site (5′-GCTAGCGTGGCGATTGCGCTTGCCGT-3′) and a 3′ primer (primer 2) encoding an HindIII site (5′-AAGCTTCAAGGCCTCCGGTAGACCAC-3′) were used. The product was subcloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of the pET-28a(+) expression vector, resulting in a construct that encoded the protein fused next to a six-histidine tag that allowed its purification on nickel-agarose columns. This plasmid was checked by DNA sequencing to ensure that the correct construct had been obtained. The recombinant plasmid was transfected into the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli, and cells were grown in LB medium. Gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm when the cell density reached an A 600 of 0.6. The cells were harvested after a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, sonicated (4 × 30 s with 30-s intervals at 4 °C) in 5 mm imidazole, 500 mmNaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.9), and centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min for separation into pellet and supernatant fractions. The pellet, which contained inclusion bodies, was used to extract TcSCA for antibody production following the instructions outlined for inclusion body purification in the His·Bind® kit (Novagen, WI). The protein was renatured by dialysis and concentrated to one-tenth volume. Rabbits received 250 µg of fusion protein injected subcutaneously with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco). Subsequent injections were performed at 3-week intervals using 250 µg of fusion protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Difco). Serum was collected before the initial injection (preimmune serum) (via the ear nick method) and 1 week after every immunization. Once the desired specific antibody titer had been achieved, the rabbit received a final booster injection and was terminated by exsanguination 1 week later. The antiserum was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Aliquots of sonicated lysates of different stages of T. cruzi containing 10 µg of total protein were mixed with an equal amount of nonreducing 2× SDS buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.6), 20% glycerol (v/v), 6.0% SDS (w/v), and 0.4% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min before application of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were separated using 7.5% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto nitrocellulose (NitroPure, MSI, Westborough, MA) using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus by standard techniques. Subsequent processing steps were done in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk, washed three times, and incubated with primary antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed three times, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000), washed three times, and processed for chemiluminescence detection following the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Photographic exposures of 5 s to 1 min were made. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, parasites were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Sigma) for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 3 min and blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, the parasites were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of the antibody (anti-TcSCA) against the 55.3-kDa expressed protein followed by 1:100 of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary antibody, both at room temperature. Control preparations were incubated with preimmune serum (1:50) or without the primary antibody. Immunofluorescence images were obtained with an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope digital image system (6Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lu H.G. Zhong L. Chang K.P. Docampo R. J. Biol.

For dual labeling with GFP-tagged TcSCA, the same methods were used, except that the primary antibodies against calreticulin, BiP, or T. cruzi Tca1 Ca2+-ATPase was used at a 1:150 dilution, and an Alexafluor 564-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was used at 1:300. Yeast strain K616 was transformed with TcSCA/pYES2 or the vector alone by the lithium acetate method (33Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.-T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by plating them on synthetic complete medium minus uracil (SC-URA) (23Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cells obtained from a single colony were grown overnight in SC-URA liquid medium with 2% galactose at 30 °C. The resulting cell suspension was used to inoculate the same medium to an initial A 600 of 0.01. Either CaCl2 or EGTA was added to the medium at various concentrations to change free-Ca2+ levels. Growth at 30 °C was monitored by measuringA 600 after 24 or 48 h. For the assay of Mn2+ sensitivity, yeast grown in SC-URA plus 2% glucose was inoculated into glucose or galactose medium at an initialA 600 of 0.4, and the A 600was measured at daily intervals for 4 days. Epimastigotes of T. cruzi (Y strain) were transformed with TcSCA-GFP/pTEX or vector alone by electroporation. Cells at the logarithmic phase of growth were washed once with Zimmerman postfusion medium (132 mm NaCl, 8 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 90 µm CaCl2) and suspended in the same medium at a concentration of 1 × 108cell/ml. The cell suspension (0.5 ml) was mixed with the plasmid DNA (50 µg), electroporated twice with a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 1.5 kV with a 0.4-cm path length, no resistance, and a 20-microfarad capacitance, and resuspended in 5 ml of liver infusion tryptose medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After an overnight incubation at 28 °C, G418 was added at 200 µg/ml for selection of the stable transfectants. Yeast microsomes were isolated by a modification of a previous procedure (23Liang F. Cunningham K.W. Harper J.F. Sze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8579-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Yeast (∼8-ml packed volume) were added to 4 ml of YL buffer (10% sucrose, 25 mm K-Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1.5% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (pH 7.5), and 12 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) in the chamber of a Biospec Bead Beater, and vortexed for 3 min, which resulted in 80–90% cell lysis. The beads were washed by gravity with YL buffer, and the supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatants from this centrifugation were layered on top of a step gradient of 25%/45% sucrose in 25 mm K-Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5) and centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 108,000 ×g max for 2 h. The 25%/45% interface was diluted 5-fold in 25 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 50 min. The microsome pellet was resuspended in 125 mm sucrose, 20 mm K-Hepes, 65 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2). Protein was assayed with the Bio-Rad protein assay. 32P-labeled phosphoprotein formation was assayed according to Schatzmann and Burgin (34Schatzmann H.J. Burgin H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The reaction mixture (150 µl) contained 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02 mmMgCl2, 75 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.0), and 15 µg of microsomal protein. Where indicated, 0.5 mmLaCl3 was added to prevent dephosphorylation of the pump. To test cation dependence, CaCl2 was added to a total concentration of 1.232 mm, resulting in a final free Ca2+ concentration of 220 µm. The reaction was started by adding [γ-32P]ATP (2 µCi/reaction; 3,000 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 19 µm and terminated after 30 s at 0 °C by adding 0.2 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm ATP, and 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation. Where indicated, 0.8 mm hydroxylamine in 0.6 sodium acetate (pH 5.3) was added to the pellet and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After two washes with trichloroacetic acid solution, the pellet was suspended in 20 µl of sample buffer and subjected to acidic SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and autoradiography. To clone the SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPase gene of T. cruzi, a region containing a conserved Ca2+-ATPase sequence was amplified from T. cruzi genomic DNA. To design degenerate oligonucleotide primers, amino acid sequences of SERCA-type Ca2+-ATPases of different species were retrieved from GenBankTM, and regions with the highest similarity were located. Two primers (F4 and R2) were selected according to these domains, and the PCR was carried out with T. cruzi genomic DNA as a template. One of the PCR products (∼650 bp) reacted strongly with a DNA probe from the Leishmania mex"

To define a functional role for the protein in pancreatic secretion, recombinant CRHSP-28 (rCRHSP-28) was introduced into streptolysin-O-permeabilized acinar cells, and amylase secretion in response to elevated Ca2+ was determined. Secretion was enhanced markedly by rCRHSP-28 over a time course that closely corresponded with the loss of the native protein from the intracellular compartment. No effects of rCRHSP-28 were detected until ∼50% of the native protein was lost from the cytosol. Secretion was enhanced by rCRHSP-28 over a physiological range of Ca2+concentrations with 2–3-fold increases in amylase release occurring in response to low micromolar levels of free Ca2+. Further, rCRHSP-28 augmented secretion in a concentration-dependent manner with minimal and maximal effects occurring at 1 and 25 µg/ml, respectively. Covalent cross-linking experiments demonstrated that native CRHSP-28 was present in a 60-kDa complex in cytosolic fractions and in a high molecular mass complex in particulate fractions, consistent with the slow leak rate of the protein from streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells. Probing acinar lysates with rCRHSP-28 in a gel-overlay assay identified two CRHSP-28-binding proteins of 35 (pp35) and 70 kDa (pp70). Interestingly, preparation of lysates in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ resulted in a marked redistribution of both proteins from a cytosolic to a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, suggesting a Ca2+-sensitive interaction of these proteins with the acinar cell cytoskeleton. In agreement with our previous study immunohistochemically localizing CRHSP-28 around secretory granules in acinar cells, gel-overlay analysis revealed pp70 copurified with acinar cell secretory granule membranes.

Activation of these epithelia by neural and humoral agents stimulates the exocytosis of secretory granules at the apical plasma membrane in a process that is largely controlled by cellular Ca2+. In pancreatic acinar cells, Ca2+ release is initiated in the apical pole and then propagates through the cell periphery to the basal cytoplasm. The cyclic reuptake and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores create an oscillatory mode of signaling with spatial and temporal characteristics that are unique to the specific type and concentration of physiologic stimulus (for review, see Refs. 1Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go V.L.W. Dimagno E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar, 2Williams J.A. Groblewski G.E. Ohnishi H.

Although the high concentrations of Ca2+ generated in the apical cytoplasm are necessary for secretory granule trafficking and exocytosis to occur, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular events elicited by this ion is lacking. The secretory pathway in acinar cells is a multifactorial process beginning with the microtubule-directed transport of newly formed zymogen granules (ZGs)1 to the apical cytoplasm. To reach the plasma membrane ultimately, ZGs are released from microtubules and must penetrate a prominent subapical cytoskeletal web composed of actin and intermediate filaments (4Ku N.O. Zhou X. Toivola D.M. Omary M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1108-G1137PubMed Google Scholar). ZG movement along microtubules was shown to involve motor proteins from both the microtubule minus end-directed dyneine/dynactin complex (5Kraemer J. Schmitz F. Drenchkhahn D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as the plus end-directed kinesin family (6Marlowe K.J. Torgerson R.R. Anderson K.L. Miller L.J. McNiven M.A. Eur. J.

Similarly, a potential role for myosin motor proteins in facilitating ZG exocytosis has also been described based on the localization of myosin I to ZG membranes (8Pouncell-Hatton S. Perkins P.S.

In addition to ZG movement via cytoskeletal motor proteins, a selective reorganization of subapical actin filaments in response to acinar cell stimulation has been described (9Torgerson R.R.

On the other hand, complete depolymerization of filaments fully arrested agonist-induced secretion, indicating that distinct alterations in these structures are necessary for normal secretion to occur (11Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Valentijn et al. (13Valentijn J.A. Valentijn K. Pastore L.M. Jamieson J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) recently reported that just prior to reaching the plasma membrane, ZGs release the small GTP-binding protein Rab3D and become coated with filamentous actin in a process that may facilitate the movement of granules across the terminal web. Interestingly, other studies utilizing actin filament-destabilizing agents in pancreatic lobules demonstrated an integral role for the subapical web in controlling the compensatory retrieval of ZG membranes back into the cell after exocytosis (14Valentijn K.M. Gumkowski F.D. Jamieson J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar, 15Valentijn K. Valentijn J.A. Jamieson J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Actin filament destabilization not only inhibited membrane retrieval, but also led to the inhibition of secretion by sequestering granule contents into large vacuolar structures that appeared continuous with the apical plasma membrane (14Valentijn K.M. Gumkowski F.D. Jamieson J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to nerve and endocrine cells, the final step in ZG fusion with apical plasma membrane is mediated by protein components of the SNARE apparatus (for review, see Ref. 16Gaisano H.Y. Pancreas. 2000; 20: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Acinar cells possess a number of isoforms of the SNARE protein family members (16Gaisano H.Y.

Although it is clear from these studies that a considerable overlap of regulatory proteins exists between acinar cells and other secretory cell types, it is also evident that acini express unique regulatory proteins to direct the cytoskeletal and membrane fusion events that coordinate ZG exocytosis. Utilizing a proteomic approach to identify proteins that are functionally regulated by Ca2+ in exocrine pancreas, we previously purified a regulated phosphoprotein, termed CRHSP-28 (19Groblewski G.E.

Basset P. Genomics. 1996; 35: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CRHSP-28 belongs to a novel tumor protein D52 family (TPD52) comprised of at least three homologous genes that may undergo alternative splicing to create different protein products (27Nourse C.R. Mattei M.-G. Gunning P. Byrne J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using polyclonal specific antibodies, we recently demonstrated that CRHSP-28 is abundant in digestive epithelial cells specializing in protein secretion including acinar cells from pancreas, salivary, and lacrimal glands, as well as chief cells, paneth cells, and goblet cells present throughout the gastrointestinal mucosa (20Groblewski G.E. Yoshida M. Yao H. Williams J.A. Ernst S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G219-G226PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a lack of hydrophobic membrane-association motifs, CRHSP-28 partitions between soluble and particulate fractions after cell lysis. Further, immunohistochemical localization indicates a high concentration of CRHSP-28 surrounding secretory granules in the apical cytoplasm of acini (20Groblewski G.E. Yoshida M. Yao H. Williams J.A. Ernst S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G219-G226PubMed Google Scholar). These findings together with the acute Ca2+ sensitivity of CRHSP-28 phosphorylation suggest that the protein may be involved in modulating acinar cell secretion. To test this hypothesis, the present study takes advantage of the high solubility of purified recombinant CRHSP-28 protein (rCRHSP-28), allowing its introduction into SLO-permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells. The ability of rCRHSP-28 to restore partially the Ca2+-dependent secretory activity after the leakage of soluble proteins from the intracellular compartment directly demonstrates an important role for CRHSP-28 in the later steps of the secretory pathway. Investigation of the molecular interactions of CRHSP-28 led to the identification of a 70-kDa CRHSP-28-binding protein (pp70) that is present in ZG membranes. It is proposed that CRHSP-28 functions in acinar cell secretion by modulating the delivery of secretory granules to the apical plasma membrane via dynamic interactions with the pp70 protein. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, and Percoll were purchased from Sigma, and a protease mixture containing leupeptin, AEBSF, and E-64 was from Calbiochem. Bovine serum albumin and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3)1 cross-linker, and protein A beads were from Pierce; SLO was from Difco, a Phadebas amylase assay kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and protein determination reagent was from Bio-Rad. The anti-rat cysteine string protein polyclonal antibody was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia). Bacterial expression and purification of human rCRHSP-28 protein and characterization of the affinity-purified anti-CRHSP-28 polyclonal antibodies have been detailed previously (19Groblewski G.E.

Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase digestion as described previously (28Burnham D.B. Williams J.A. J. Biol.

Acini were suspended in a buffer consisting of (in mm) 10 HEPES, 137 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 1.28 CaCl2, 0.6 Na2HPO4, 5.5 d-glucose, 2l-glutamine, and an essential amino acid solution. The buffer was supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, gassed with 100% O2, and adjusted to pH 7.4. Cells were maintained at 37 °C for 1 h prior to performing assays. Acini were suspended in a permeabilization buffer containing (in mm) 20 PIPES (pH 6.6), 139 K+-glutamate, 4 EGTA, 1.78 MgCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 unit/ml SLO. The SLO was allowed to bind to the cells on ice for 10 min and was then removed by washing at 4 °C in the same buffer without SLO. Acini were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes (200 µl/tube) containing the indicated amounts of rCRHSP-28. The cell suspension was then diluted with an equal volume of the same buffer containing enough CaCl2 to create the desired final concentration of free Ca+2. The quantity of Ca2+ added to the buffer was calculated based on dissociation constants using a computer program as described (30Kitagawa M. Williams J.A. De Lisle R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G157-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were immersed in a 37 °C water bath and incubated with gentle mixing for the indicated times. At the end of the incubation period, cells were cooled in an ice bath and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The content of amylase in the medium was determined using a Phadebas assay kit. Data were calculated as the percent of total cellular amylase present in an equal amount of cells measured at the start of the experiment. SLO-permeabilized acini were exposed to basal or stimulatory concentrations of free Ca2+, and at indicated times, cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge. Proteins present in the medium were precipitated in 15% trichloroacetic acid and then solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Cell pellets were sonicated in a lysis buffer containing (in mm) 50 Tris (pH 7.4), 25 NaFl, 10 tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 benzamidine, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Total protein was measured using a Bio-Rad assay reagent. Equal amounts of cellular protein (50 µg/sample) and equal volumes of culture medium were analyzed for CRHSP-28 content by immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence. The intensity of the CRHSP-28 signal was quantified using a PDI model DNA35 scanner interfaced with the Protein and DNA Imageware system (Huntington Station, NY). Acini were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 µg/ml leupeptin by repeated freeze/thawing in liquid nitrogen. The BS3 cross-linking reagent was prepared fresh in H2O and added to lysates at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mm glycine at 4 °C for 10 min. Soluble and particulate fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, immobilized to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 and 3% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated sequentially with 2–4 µg/ml rCRHSP-28 and 0.5 µg/ml anti-CRHSP-28 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. CRHSP-28-binding proteins were then detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000). For pp70 cell fractionation experiments, acini were sonicated in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and containing 1 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared by centrifugation (100,000 ×g). Particulate fractions were sonicated further in the same buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and centrifuged again to produce a membrane- and Triton-insoluble fraction. The detergent-insoluble proteins were dissolved directly in SDS buffer. Equal amounts of cytosolic and membrane protein (40 µg) and equal volumes of detergent-insoluble protein (1/10 of total volume) were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by gel-overlay or immunoblotting. CRHSP-28 was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of lysate (0.7 mg) from 32P-labeled acini as described previously (31Groblewski G.E. Wang Y. Ernst S.A. Kent C. Williams J.A. J. Biol.

A role for CRHSP-28 in pancreatic secretion was examined utilizing a well characterized SLO-permeabilized acinar cell preparation (11Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 18Padfield P.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Kitagawa M. Williams J.A.

Isolated acini were permeabilized with SLO and exposed to basal (≤ 10 nm) or stimulatory (10 µm) concentrations of free Ca2+. Secretion of the digestive enzyme, amylase, into the medium was measured at various times over 30 min. Consistent with previous studies utilizing SLO-permeabilized acini (30Kitagawa M. Williams J.A. De Lisle R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G157-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Padfield P.J. Panesar N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G647-G652PubMed Google Scholar), the highest rate of Ca2+-stimulated secretion occurred during the first 10 min of incubation when 6.1% of total cellular amylase was released into the medium (filled squares). A considerably slower rate of secretion occurred during the following 10-min intervals adding up to 9.5 and 11.9% of total cellular amylase at 20 and 30 min, respectively. Basal secretion in low Ca2+ represented 3.2% of total over the entire 30 min incubation (open squares). To illustrate the diminished secretory response caused by SLO permeabilization of cells, secretion from intact acini stimulated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin is included on the graph for comparison (triangles). Intact and SLO-treated acini showed similar rates of secretion over the first 10 min of stimulation; however, secretion at later times was diminished significantly in the permeabilized cells. Introduction of rCRHSP-28 into permeabilized acini had no effect on secretion during the first 10 min of Ca2+-stimulation (filled circles); however, rCRHSP-28 augmented secretion by greater than 160% of untreated cells when measured at 20 and 30 min. Basal secretion in low Ca2+ was not altered by rCRHSP-28 at any time (open circles), indicating that the ability of the protein to modulate secretion was dependent on increased cellular Ca2+. The addition of rCRHSP-28 to cells that had been pre-permeabilized for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in incubation buffer containing the protein had no significant effect on amylase secretion (not shown). Rather, it was necessary for rCRHSP-28 to be present in the medium throughout the entire incubation period to see a significant effect. For control measures, rCRHSP-28 was introduced into the SLO-permeabilized cells in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Accordingly, rCRHSP-28 represented ∼2% of the total protein in the incubation medium, demonstrating the specificity of the CRHSP-28 effect. Previous studies indicate that SLO permeabilization of acini is complete within 2–5 min at 37 °C and is not altered by micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+ (11Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 30Kitagawa M. Williams J.A. De Lisle R.C. Am. J.

To ensure complete permeabilization of cells in our preparations, diffusion of the 12-kDa cytosolic protein cyclophilin A from acini was analyzed by immunoblotting following SLO treatment (Fig. 2 A, top gel). The majority of cyclophilin A was lost rapidly from permeabilized acini within 2 min and was completely absent from the intracellular compartment by 5 min. Moreover, elevation of Ca2+ in the medium did not influence the rate or extent of cyclophilin A leakage. To examine the loss of native CRHSP-28 from permeabilized acini, the content of the protein both inside and outside the cells was measured over time following SLO treatment (Fig. 2, A–C). In contrast to the rapid and complete diffusion of cyclophilin A, a much smaller proportion of CRHSP-28 was lost from the intracellular compartment over 15 min when cells were incubated in basal Ca2+. With prolonged exposures of the blots, it was estimated that 50% of CRHSP-28 remained in the cells after 15 min, consistent with the levels of the protein found in the particulate fraction after cell lysis (see Fig. 5). Interestingly, elevation of Ca2+ in the medium enhanced CRHSP-28 leakage from acini significantly at all time points (Fig. 2 B). Complementary results were obtained when measuring CRHSP-28 levels in the extracellular medium (Fig. 2 C). Again, CRHSP-28 slowly diffused from the cells over the 15-min incubation, and its appearance in the medium was clearly enhanced at each time point when Ca2+ was elevated. Corresponding with previous studies utilizing SLO-permeabilized acini (30Kitagawa M. Williams J.A. De Lisle R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: G157-G164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Padfield P.J. Panesar N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G647-G652PubMed Google Scholar), amylase secretion in these preparations was stimulated by physiological levels of free Ca2+ with maximal release occurring between 3 and 10 µm Ca2+ (Fig.3). The addition of rCRHSP-28 to cells enhanced secretion significantly over the entire range of Ca2+ concentrations. The effects of the protein were most pronounced at low stimulatory levels of Ca2+ (0.1–1 µm) when secretion in the absence of rCRHSP-28 was at a minimum. Indeed, rCRHSP-28 augmented secretion greater than 3-fold when stimulating cells with 0.3 µm Ca2+. In addition, rCRHSP-28 enhanced secretion in a concentration-dependent manner with a minimal response detected at 1 µg/ml of protein and a maximal 210% of control increase occurring at 25 µg/ml of protein when stimulating the cells with 1 µm free Ca2+ (Fig.4). Surprisingly, higher concentrations of rCRHSP- 28 (≥50 µg/ml) consistently diminished, and in some cases inhibited, secretion. An identical biphasic concentration response to rCRHSP-28 was also observed when stimulating cells with 10 µm free Ca2+ (not shown).Figure 4Concentration-dependent effects of rCRHSP-28 on Ca2+-stimulated secretion.SLO-permeabilized acini were incubated with the indicated concentrations of rCRHSP-28 and stimulated with 1 µm free Ca2+. Control cells received no rCRHSP-28. Data are the mean ± S.D. of two independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CRHSP-28 has a bipolar charge distribution composed of a basic middle region flanked by acidic amino and carboxyl termini (Fig.5 A). In addition, the protein contains a putative leucine zipper motif between amino acids 21 and 72, suggesting that it may form homo- and/or heteromeric complexes through coiled-coil interactions (35Byrne J.A. Nourse C.R. Basset P. Gunning P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Our results demonstrate that newly synthesized wild-type pro-AR (50 kDa) is delivered directly to the basolateral membrane domain with >95% efficiency, where it is sequentially cleaved within the ectodomain to release several soluble amphiregulin (AR) forms. Analyses of a pro-AR cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant (ARTL27) and two pro-AR secretory mutants (ARsec184 and ARsec190) indicated that the pro-AR cytoplasmic domain is not required for efficient delivery to the plasma membrane, but does contain essential basolateral sorting information. We show that the pro-AR cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant (ARTL27) is not sorted in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, with ∼65% of the newly synthesized protein delivered to the apical cell surface. Under base-line conditions, ARTL27 was preferentially cleaved from the basolateral surface with 4-fold greater efficiency compared with cleavage from the apical membrane domain. However, ARTL27 ectodomain cleavage could be stimulated equivalently from either membrane domain by a variety of different stimuli. The metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 could inhibit both base-line and stimulus-induced ectodomain cleavage of wild-type pro-AR and ARTL27. These results indicate that the pro-AR cytoplasmic domain is required for basolateral sorting, but is not essential for ectodomain processing. Preferential constitutive cleavage of ARTL27 from the basolateral cell surface also suggests that the metalloprotease activity involved in base-line and stimulus-induced ARTL27 ectodomain cleavage may be regulated differently in the apical and basolateral membrane domains of polarized epithelial cells.

Six mammalian EGF-like growth factors have been identified, including EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin (AR), betacellulin, and epiregulin. All six EGFR ligands are synthesized as transmembrane precursors that are cleaved to release biologically active soluble growth factors, which act in an autocrine and/or a paracrine manner (2Lee D.C. Fenton S.E. Berkowitz E.A. Hissong M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 51-85PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies indicate that membrane-anchored EGF-like precursors may also be biologically active at the cell surface (3Wong S.T. Winchell L.F. McCune B.K. Earp H.S. Teixido J.

In the case of HB-EGF, data from previous reports indicate that membrane-anchored and soluble forms of HB-EGF may have distinct EGFR signaling activities (10Iwamoto R. Handa K. Mekada E. J. Biol.

Taken together, these observations suggest an important regulatory role for ectodomain cleavage in EGF-like ligand activities. Two potential regulators of ectodomain cleavage of an EGF-like ligand are its delivery to and presentation at the cell surface. Several studies have investigated the importance of membrane-anchoring and cytoplasmic domains of different EGFR ligands in modulating ligand presentation at the plasma membrane. Analysis of transport of different soluble and membrane-anchored EGF-like ligands in the secretory pathway has shown that the membrane-anchoring domain is required for delivery of a ligand precursor to the correct receptor population at the plasma membrane, thereby preventing inappropriate intracrine signaling within the secretory pathway (12Wiley H.S.

For pro-TGF-α, the cytoplasmic domain also appears to be important for transport in the early secretory pathway. Deletion analysis of the pro-TGF-α cytoplasmic domain indicates that the C-terminal consensus PDZ domain-binding motif (TVV) is critical for efficient maturation and transit through the early secretory pathway (13Briley G.P.

In polarized epithelial cells, newly synthesized pro-TGF-α is sorted directly to the basolateral membrane domain (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent mutagenesis studies and chimeric analyses of the pro-TGF-α cytoplasmic domain indicate that the cytoplasmic domain contains dominant basolateral sorting information. 2P. J. Dempsey, K. S. Meise, and R. J. Coffey, manuscript in preparation. 2P. J. Dempsey, K. S. Meise, and R. J. Coffey, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, pro-EGF is not sorted in polarized epithelial cells, and its delivery to the cell surface is independent of its cytoplasmic domain (18Dempsey P.J. Meise K.S. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Coffey R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic domain sorting information not only defines spatial compartmentalization of different EGFR ligands in polarized epithelial cells, but can also determine ligand accessibility to basolateral EGFRs and modulate constitutive release at the different membrane domains (1Damstrup L. Kuwada S.K. Dempsey P.J. Brown C.L. Hawkey C.J. Poulsen H.S. Wiley H.S. Coffey R.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol.

Other less well characterized protein interactions with the pro-TGF-α cytoplasmic domain have been identified and have been postulated to be involved in ligand presentation and signaling (19Shum L.

In addition, the cytoplasmic domains of several membrane proteins regulate ectodomain shedding (20Kahn J. Walcheck B. Migaki G.I. Jutila M.A. Kishimoto T.K.

Biochem. 1998; 69: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic domain is not essential for ectodomain cleavage. However, recent studies using artificial membrane-anchored EGF ligands indicate that the membrane-anchoring domains can modulate constitutive and stimulated ligand release and endocytic trafficking as well as confer differential sensitivity to synthetic metalloprotease inhibitors (24Dong J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). AR belongs to a subset of EGFR ligands that contain heparin-binding activity within their extracellular domains. For EGF-like growth factors capable of binding to heparin, ligand binding and subsequent activation of EGFR can be modulated by cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans or by addition of heparin (25Piepkorn M. Pittelkow M.R. Cook P.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 715-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). AR is a bifunctional modulator of cell growth, but in general acts as an autocrine growth factor for both normal and transformed cells (1Damstrup L. Kuwada S.K. Dempsey P.J. Brown C.L. Hawkey C.J.

Interestingly, comparison of AR and EGF mitogenic signaling indicates that soluble AR may have distinct signaling properties associated with the EGFR cytoplasmic domain (27Wong L. Deb T.B.

Cell-surface pro-AR is sequentially cleaved, and phorbol esters and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors can stimulate ectodomain processing in a metalloprotease-dependent manner (28Martinez-Lacaci I.

In polarized colonic epithelial cells, cellular distribution and release of endogenous AR are restricted to the basolateral membrane domain, suggesting that AR signaling is spatially compartmentalized (1Damstrup L. Kuwada S.K. Dempsey P.J. Brown C.L. Hawkey C.J. Poulsen H.S. Wiley H.S. Coffey R.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to examine the role of the pro-AR cytoplasmic domain in trafficking and sequential processing of pro-AR in polarized epithelial cells. We demonstrate that newly synthesized pro-AR is directly sorted to the basolateral membrane domain in polarized MDCK cells, where it is sequentially cleaved to release soluble AR forms into the basolateral conditioned medium. Analyses of pro-AR cytoplasmic domain truncation and secretory mutants show that the cytoplasmic domain is not required for efficient delivery of pro-AR to the plasma membrane, but is essential for basolateral sorting. A newly synthesized pro-AR cytoplasmic deletion mutant (ARTL27) is missorted and expressed in both the apical and basolateral membrane domains in polarized MDCK cells. We show that ARTL27 is preferentially cleaved from the basolateral membrane domain under constitutive conditions; however, efficient stimulated cleavage can occur from either membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells.

Rainbow markers and the ECL kit were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The long form of recombinant human AR was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The synthetic hydroxamate metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 (31Davies B. Brown P.D. East N. Crimmin M.J. Balkwill F.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2087-2091PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Helen Mills (British Biotech, Oxford, United Kingdom). Phenylarsine oxide,A23187, ionomycin, calmidazolium chloride, and trifluoperazine dimaleate were obtained from Calbiochem. Pervanadate was freshly made for each experiment as follows. 1 m solutions of sodium vanadate and H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were prepared and then mixed to give a 0.5 m solution of pervanadate. As pervanadate is unstable, this was diluted into the cell culture at the indicated concentration of 100 µmwithin 20 min of preparation. Monoclonal antibodies to human AR (AR 6R1C2.4 (AR mAb) and AR 4.14.18) were used in this study (32Thorne B.A. Plowman G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Piepkorn M. Underwood R.A. Henneman C. Smith L.T. J. Invest.

Affinity-purified rabbit antiserum to mouse immunoglobulin was purchased from Cappel Laboratories (Durham, NC). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). MDCK strain II cells were obtained from Dr. Enrique Rodriguez-Boulan (Cornell University Medical College, New York). MDCK strain II cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) as previously described (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For culture on Transwell filters (0.4-µm pore size; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), cells were seeded at 1 × 105 and 5 × 105 on 12- and 24-mm Transwell filters, respectively. For cells grown on Transwell filters, the medium was changed daily. The integrity of the cell monolayer was assessed using a Millicell electrical resistance system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Experiments were performed when transepithelial resistance was >200 ohms/cm2. Human AR cDNAs encoding wild-type pro-AR and the AR cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant (ARTL27) were obtained from Dr. Greg Plowman (Sugen, Redwood City, CA) (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The two AR secretory constructs (ARsec184) and (ARsec190) have been described previously (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All AR cDNA constructs were subcloned into the pCB6-CMV expression vector and stably transfected into MDCK strain II cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as previously described (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected MDCK strain II cells were selected in medium containing 500 µg/ml G418. Individual clones were initially screened by indirect immunofluorescence. Subsequently, high expressing AR clones were identified by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. All cells were grown on 24-mm Transwell filters in the appropriate medium for 4–6 days. To increase AR expression in transfected cell lines, cells were treated with 5 mm sodium butyrate in the appropriate medium for 16–18 h before labeling. For pulse labeling (2h), cells were rinsed twice with serum-free,l-cysteine/l-methionine-free DMEM (DMEM−) and incubated in DMEM− for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with 1–2 mCi/ml Tran35S-label as previously described (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled at 37 °C for the indicated amounts of time, rinsed once with 18 °C chase medium (DMEM containing 10-fold excessl-cysteine and l-methionine), and incubated at 37 °C with chase medium for the specified times. Cells were grown on 24-mm Transwell filters as described above. All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Prior to biotinylation, cells were rinsed three times with PBS containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mmMgCl2 (PBS+). For polarizing cells, 1.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate in PBS+ was added to either the apical or basolateral compartment, and cells were incubated for 30 min. The compartment not receiving labeling reagent was filled with 2 ml of PBS+ containing 0.2% BSA (PBS/BSA). Following biotinylation, cells were rinsed and washed twice with ice-cold 100 mm glycine in PBS+ and rinsed three times with PBS/BSA. Filters were then cut out, and cell lysates were prepared as described (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For direct delivery experiments, Tran35S-label labeling was combined with cell-surface biotinylation. After labeling, cells were chased at 37 °C for various times as described and then cooled on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS+. Labeled proteins that arrived at the cell surface were detected by domain-selective biotinylation as described above. Following biotinylation, cells were washed and lysed, and AR immunoprecipitation was performed as described below. To measure cell-surface biotinylated AR, AR immunoprecipitates were eluted with SDS buffer as previously described (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three-fourths of the eluted protein was diluted in lysis buffer and re-immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose. The remaining one-fourth of the eluted protein was used to determine total labeled protein. All AR immunoprecipitation protocols were performed at 4 °C or on ice as previously described (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed under reducing conditions on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel unless otherwise specified. For metabolically labeled samples, gels were fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried, and fluorography was performed with BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For unlabeled biotinylated samples, proteins were electrophoretically transferred overnight at 30 V to nitrocellulose (0.2 µm; Bio-Rad). These membranes were subsequently rinsed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBS-T), blocked for 1 h in TBS-T containing 3% BSA, and incubated with either 125I-labeled streptavidin or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. For membranes probed with 125I-labeled streptavidin, AR was detected by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat film. For membranes probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, AR was detected using an ECL Western blotting kit, and fluorography was performed using BioMax MR film. Immunofluorescent staining of MDCK-AR and MDCK-ARTL27 cells cultured on 12-mm Transwell filters was performed as previously described (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All staining procedures were performed on ice or at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. For AR staining, cells were paraformaldehyde-fixed and stained with 2 µg/ml AR mAb. Specificity of AR staining was confirmed by preincubating this antibody overnight with 100 ng/ml recombinant AR prior to staining. Monoclonal antibody MOPC-21 (Sigma) was used as an isotype antibody control. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM4 confocal microscope. Polarized cellular localization was visualized byz-scanning the images. Human AR sandwich ELISA was used to measure AR in conditioned media and cell lysates as described (26Dong J. Opresko L.K. Dempsey P.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Coffey R.J. Wiley H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6235-6240Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, capture antibody (AR mAb) was absorbed to wells overnight (0.2 µg/ml) and blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and secondary antibody (0.1 µg/well biotinylated mAb AR 4.14.18) was added for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 0.05 µg/ml peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h at 37 °C. Substrate (0.5 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) was added for 5 min, and the reaction product was read in a microplate reader at 490 nm. The standard was recombinant human long form AR diluted in culture medium. To measure apical release of AR from cells grown on Transwell filters, AR levels in the apical conditioned medium were corrected for AR released from cells growing on the sides of Transwell filters as previously described (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of AR release was also performed in the absence and presence of 20 nm mAb 528 (an EGFR-neutralizing antibody) (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells seeded on 24-mm Transwell filters were biotinylated as described above. Following biotinylation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS+ and once with serum-free DMEM. To measure processing of cell-surface biotinylated AR, cells were incubated for the indicated times with serum-free DMEM containing Me2SO (control), 5 µm BB-94, a stimulus (1 µmphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 100 µm pervanadate, 10 µm phenylarsine oxide, 25 µmA23187, 1 µm ionomycin, 5 µm calmidazolium chloride, or 50 µm trifluoperazine dimaleate), or a combination of BB-94 and stimulus. After 30 min, the medium was collected, and cell lysates were prepared as previously described (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequently, AR immunoprecipitations were performed, and biotinylated AR was detected by Western blotting as previously described (29Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To verify apical release of AR from cells grown on Transwells, either Tran35S-label labeling combined with cell-surface biotinylation or unlabeled cell-surface biotinylation experiments were performed. After biotinylation, filters were excised from Transwell inserts, washed, and placed in fresh serum-free medium. Base-line and stimulated AR cleavage assays with isolated filters were performed as described above. These studies confirmed that >80% of the apically released biotinylated AR was derived from the apical membrane domain of the intact cell monolayer (data not shown). Unless otherwise stated, experiments were performed with two to three different clonal cell lines for each AR construct, and results are representative of at least three experiments with similar results. We have recently shown that endogenous pro-AR is expressed predominantly on the basolateral cell surface of two polarizing human colon cancer cell lines (1Damstrup L. Kuwada S.K. Dempsey P.J. Brown C.L. Hawkey C.J. Poulsen H.S. Wiley H.S. Coffey R.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To further examine the cell-surface localization of pro-AR in polarized epithelial cells, MDCK cells stably expressing human wild-type pro-AR (MDCK-AR) were grown on Transwell filters and examined by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig.1 A, pro-AR was localized to the basal and lateral surfaces of the MDCK cell monolayer. This localization is similar to that observed for endogenous human pro-AR in the polarizing human colon cancer cell lines (1Damstrup L. Kuwada S.K. Dempsey P.J. Brown C.L. Hawkey C.J. Poulsen H.S. Wiley H.S. Coffey R.J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but is quite different from cell-surface localization of pro-EGF and pro-TGF-α in polarized MDCK cells. In MDCK cells, pro-EGF accumulates preferentially on the apical surface (18Dempsey P.J. Meise K.S. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Coffey R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas pro-TGF-α is distributed primarily on the lateral surface (17Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To biochemically characterize cell-surface distribution of pro-AR in MDCK-AR cells under steady-state conditions, unlabeled cell-surface biotinylation experiments were performed. Cells grown on Transwell filters were selectively biotinylated in either the apical or basolateral membrane domain. AR immunoprecipitates from total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Under steady-state conditions, several different molecular mass pro-AR species were detected predominantly in the basolateral membrane domain (Fig. 1 B). Two major pro-AR forms were detected, one of 50 kDa and a 26/28-kDa doublet. In some experiments, an additional minor 16-kDa cell-surface AR form was also detected (data not shown; see Figs. 2 and 3) (29"
https://openalex.org/W1992442297,"Recently we showed that signaling across beta3-integrin leads to activation of calpain and formation of integrin clusters that are involved in Rac activation. The subsequent activation of Rac and Rho leads to the formation of focal complexes and focal adhesions, respectively. The goal of the present study was to determine whether different proteins link the integrin to the cytoskeleton in the different complexes. We show that talin is present in focal adhesions but not in the calpain-induced clusters. alpha-Actinin colocalized with integrin at various sites, including the calpain-induced clusters. Skelemin, a protein shown recently to interact with beta1- and beta3-integrin in vitro, colocalized with integrin in calpain-induced clusters but was absent from focal adhesions. Cells transiently expressing skelemin C2 motifs, which contain the integrin binding site, failed to form integrin clusters or to spread on a substrate for beta1- and beta3-integrins. These results 1) suggest a dynamic reorganization of integrin complexes during cell spreading, 2) show that different cytoskeletal proteins link integrins in different complexes, and 3) demonstrate that skelemin is responsible for linking integrin to the calpain-induced clusters, and 4) show that the integrin-skelemin interaction is essential for transmission of signals leading to the initial steps of cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2029523122,"The plasma zymogen prothrombin (II) is converted to the clotting enzyme thrombin (IIa) by two prothrombinase-catalyzed proteolytic cleavages. Thus, two intermediates, meizothrombin (mIIa) and prethrombin-2 (P2), are possible on the reaction pathway. Measurements of the time courses of II, mIIa, P2, and IIa suggested a channeling phenomenon, whereby a portion of the II is converted directly to IIa without free mIIa and P2 as obligatory intermediates. Evidence for this was that the maximum rate of IIa formation preceded the maximum in the level of either intermediate. In addition, analysis of the data according to a model that included two parallel pathways through mIIa and P2 indicated that about 40% of the II consumed did not yield free mIIa or P2. Further studies were carried out in which II was continuously infused in a reactor at a constant rate. Under these conditions II, mIIa, and P2 reached constant steady-state levels, and IIa was produced at a constant rate, equal to that of II infusion. During the steady state, traces of II, mIIa, and P2 were introduced as radiolabels. Time courses of isotope consumption were first order, thus allowing the rates of consumption of II, mIIa, and P2 to be calculated. Under these conditions the rate of II consumption equaled the rate of IIa formation. Rates of consumption of the free intermediates, however, were only 22 (mIIa) and 15% (P2), respectively, of the rate of thrombin formation. Thus, both the time course experiments and the steady-state experiments indicate that an appreciable fraction of II is channeled directly to IIa without proceeding through the free intermediates mIIa and P2.

Thrombin also activates anticoagulant and antifibrinolytic feedback in the presence of the endothelial surface protein thrombomodulin (3Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of prothrombin is a crucial step of the coagulation system. Its product, thrombin, can lead to procoagulant, anticoagulant, and antifibrinolytic effects subject to local tissue and circulatory conditions (4Fenton J.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 370: 468-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activation of prothrombin takes place within the prothrombinase enzyme complex that consists of a coagulant-active phospholipid surface, the enzyme factor Xa, the cofactor, factor Va, and Ca2+ (5Nesheim M.E. Surv. Synth. Pathol. Res. 1984; 3: 219-232PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mann K.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 229-233Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Mann K.G. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1992; 116: 1330-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Although factor Xa alone will slowly catalyze prothrombin activation, the activation rate increases 278,000-fold when the full complex is assembled (8Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. Blood Coagulation.

Chem. 1980; 255: 1170-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two bond cleavages are required for prothrombin activation, one at Arg274–Thr275 and the other at Arg323–Ile324 (bovine numbering). Thus, two activation pathways are possible with the characteristic intermediates meizothrombin and prethrombin-2. In the absence of factor Va prethrombin-2 is the predominant intermediate, with or without phospholipid (11Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of both factor Va and phospholipid meizothrombin is the predominant intermediate (12Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the kinetics of activation of prothrombin, meizothrombin, and the pair fragment 1.2 plus prethrombin-2 in the presence of factor Va, but in the absence of phospholipid, are consistent with a predominant meizothrombin pathway (13Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that factor Va directs the reaction toward the meizothrombin pathway. To understand more fully the pathways of prothrombin activation, the present studies were performed in the presence of factor Va but in the absence of the phospholipid surface component. This approach was taken to focus on the effects specifically attributable to factor Xa and factor Va and to simplify the analysis by reducing the system from four to three components. Bovine blood, used for the isolation of prothrombin, factor X, and factor V, was obtained at Ross McFedridge Abattoir of Glenburnie, Ontario, Canada. Acetonitrile, EDTA, and Tricine1 were obtained from BDH, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; phenylalanylphenylalanyl arginyl chloromethyl ketone was obtained from Behring Diagnostics, La Jolla, CA.

Soybean trypsin inhibitor is used during the isolation of prothrombin, and measurable levels of this inhibitor of factor Xa remain with the isolated prothrombin. To remove this contaminant, isolated prothrombin was subjected to gel filtration as described previously (13Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor X isolation was modified by replacing the DEAE-Sephadex (17Boskovic D.S. The Cofactor Effects of Factor Va on Prothrombin Activation in the Absence of Phospholipid, M.Sc. thesis. Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada1989Google Scholar) with a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 16.3 cm). Factor Xa was activated with the purified factor X activator from Russell's viper venom, and factor Xa was isolated by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose as described previously (18Krishnaswamy S.

Ecarin was isolated from lyophilizedE. carinatus venom using chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (19Hibbard L.S. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Kunitz inhibitor of factor Xa was isolated from a lyophilized preparation of soybean trypsin inhibitor by an adaptation of the published method (20Kassell B. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 853-862Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 500 mg of crude lyophilized soybean trypsin inhibitor preparation (Sigma, catalog number T-9128) was dissolved in 100 ml of 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min to remove particulate material. The supernatant was loaded on a pre-equilibrated DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 18 cm), while collecting 8-ml fractions, followed by the buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to base line. Elutions were carried out by stepwise increases in NaCl levels (until the absorbance returned to base line) at concentrations of 34, 130, 170, and 250 mm. The collected fractions were then assayed for Kunitz inhibitory activity against bovine factor Xa (17Boskovic D.S. The Cofactor Effects of Factor Va on Prothrombin Activation in the Absence of Phospholipid, M.Sc. thesis. Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada1989Google Scholar). The peak fraction following elution by 250 mm NaCl was retained. Two IODO-BEADS (Pierce) were rinsed twice with 1 ml of 400 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm ε-amino-n-caproic acid, pH 7.4, prior to the final addition of 500 µl of the same buffer. To this was added 10 µl of Na125I (1 mCi), and the tube was shaken intermittently for 5 min at 22 °C. This buffer with 125I then was transferred into a tube containing 500 µl of 0.2 mg/ml bovine prothrombin (1 ml final). This tube then was incubated on ice for 10 min with intermittent shaking. Iodination was quenched by the addition of 10 µl of 1.0 m sodium metabisulfite followed by intermittent shaking for 2 min. The iodinated prothrombin then was separated from free 125I by gel filtration on G-25 Sephadex (7 × 200 mm) while collecting 1-ml fractions. Absorbance at 280 nm was determined for each fraction. Disintegrations from 1 µl of each sample were counted using an LKB Minigamma 1275 gamma counter. The peak containing the125I-prothrombin then was dialyzed against 50% glycerol/H2O and stored at −20 °C. Approximately 1.5 mg of ecarin stock (1 ml) was dialyzed, at 4 °C, against 100 ml of 100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0. The volume of the dialysate was brought to 3 ml with the same buffer. 1.5 g of activated CH-Sepharose 4B was washed with 200 ml of 1 mm HCl followed by 200 ml of 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. This resin then was added to the ecarin solution with stirring, and the intrinsic fluorescence of the supernatant (after a brief centrifugation) was periodically measured. When the coupling was complete, the remaining reactive groups of the resin were blocked by addition of 1.5 ml of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. To neutralize traces of a contaminating enzyme activity, the ecarin-Sepharose suspension was treated with phenylalanylphenylalanyl arginyl chloromethyl ketone (20 µm final) for 2 h at 22 °C. Following this, it was washed with 100 ml of 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4. The ecarin-Sepharose then was stored at 4 °C. Stock factor Xa (5 mg) was dialyzed against 500 ml of 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 6.5, at 4 °C for 2 h. A 5-ml aliquot of packed Sepharose CL-4B was washed with 100 ml of 2m Na2CO3 (ice-cold) in a sintered glass funnel. The resin then was activated with 2 ml of CNBr/acetonitrile (1 g of CNBr in 2 ml of acetonitrile), followed by washing with 200 ml of ice-cold H2O and 200 ml of 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 6.5. The resin then was transferred into the factor Xa solution and gently stirred overnight at 4 °C. The resin was blocked by washing it with 200 ml of 1 mTris, pH 7.8, followed by 200 ml of 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.002% sodium azide, pH 7.4. The factor Xa-Sepharose was stored at 4 °C. A 10-ml reaction was set up comprising 1 µm prothrombin, 100 nm factor Va, 4 nm factor Xa, and 10 µm DAPA in 20 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% PEG, pH 7.4, 22 °C. The DAPA was included in order to inhibit the thrombin and thereby eliminate thrombin feedback cleavages of prothrombin and prothrombin activation products (8Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three control samples (300 µl each) were taken, for time = 0, prior to onset of the reaction by the addition of factor Xa. Following this, further 300-µl samples were removed at specific times and quenched by adding them to 30 µl of 100 µm Kunitz inhibitor, 50 mm sodium citrate, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG, pH 7.4, and placing them on ice. When all the samples were collected, they were processed for the determination of prothrombin, prethrombin 2, meizothrombin, and thrombin levels by exploiting the overt or latent activity toward the chromogenic substrate S-2238. To distinguish each of these species, all of the above samples were further sub-sampled by diluting 10 µl of each with 190 µl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), DAPA (526 nm), in 0.20 m Tris, 0.15m NaCl, 0.02 m CaCl2, and 0.1% PEG, pH 7.4, to make 4 diluted samples. Each was then treated with one of the following four protocols, A–D. Protocol A consists of the addition of 5 µl of a solution of 12 µm antithrombin and 10 units/ml heparin, followed by incubation for 10 min; then addition of 5 µl of 500 µg/ml human platelet factor 4 followed by incubation for 3 min; and finally, addition of 5 µl of 0.4 mg/ml ecarin followed by incubation for 5 min. Under these conditions the initial antithrombin/heparin treatment inhibited all thrombin present in the sample. In the absence of heparin, both thrombin and meizothrombin are protected by DAPA from inhibition by antithrombin (21Cote H.C.F. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the presence of heparin, however, only meizothrombin is protected. The treatment with the human platelet factor 4 neutralized the heparin and thus allowed subsequently produced thrombin to remain active. Treatment with ecarin resulted in the production of thrombin from pre-2 and mIIa from prothrombin. Thus, the final chromogenic substrate activity represents the combined activities of mIIa, mIIa generated from prothrombin, and thrombin generated from pre-2. Protocol B consists of the addition of 5 µl of a solution of 12 µm antithrombin and 10 units/ml heparin, followed by incubation for 13 min; and then addition of 5 µl of 0.4 mg/ml ecarin followed by incubation for 5 min. The continued presence of antithrombin/heparin ensured that all thrombin was inhibited, while retaining the activities of the original mIIa as well as the mIIa generated from prothrombin by ecarin. Protocol C consists of simply incubation for 5 min. These samples thus contain the activities due to mIIa and thrombin. Protocol D consists of the addition of 5 µl of a solution of 12 µm antithrombin and 10 units/ml heparin followed by incubation for 18 min. This treatment allowed only the chromogenic substrate activity of mIIa to remain intact. After each of these treatments 10 µl of each sample was assayed for chromogenic substrate activity by adding them to respective microtiter wells containing 290 µl of 0.2 mm S-2238, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.1% PEG, pH 7.4, and incubation at 22 °C. Time courses of absorbance at 405 nm were then measured in a microtiter plate reader. At this stage the effective concentration of DAPA is 32 nm. Thus, for each sample containing prothrombin (P), prethrombin 2 (P2), thrombin (T), and meizothrombin (M), in various proportions, four rates of hydrolysis of S2238 were obtained (RA, RB, RC, and RD), each corresponding to one of the above protocols A–D. Levels of prothrombin, prethrombin 2, thrombin, and meizothrombin were then calculated according to the following equations. In these equations k is a constant determined from calibration of the assay with thrombin. The factor of 1.13 accounts for an empirically determined 13% difference between the assay responses to meizothrombin and thrombin under these conditions (Equations (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4)).[P]=1.13k(RB­RD)(Eq. 1) [P2]=k(RA­RB)(Eq. 2) [M]=1.13kRD(Eq. 3) [T]=k(RC­RD)(Eq. 4) A 30-ml reactor consisting of a plastic beaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer was set up partially filled (20 ml) with 0.3 µmprothrombin, 100 nm factor Va, and 4 nm factor Xa (added last to start the reaction) and 10 µm DAPA in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.004% Tween 80, pH 7.4, 22 °C. A 250-µl syringe (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) was filled with 77.5 µmprothrombin in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.004% Tween 80, pH 7.4, and the prothrombin solution was infused into the reactor at a constant rate of 3.87 µl/min, using a Harvard Apparatus Compact Infusion Pump. Three control samples (50 µl each) were taken, for time = 0, prior to initiation of the reaction by the addition of factor Xa. The onset of infusion coincided with the start of the reaction. Following this, additional 50-µl samples are removed at specific times, quenched by the addition to 5 µl of 100 µm Kunitz inhibitor, 50 mm sodium citrate, 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.004% Tween 80, pH 7.4, and placed on ice. At the end of the experiment, the samples were assayed for levels of prothrombin, prethrombin 2, meizothrombin, and thrombin as described above. In order to measure the rate of consumption of prothrombin, meizothrombin, or prethrombin 2 under steady-state conditions, a trace of radiolabeled protein (∼107 cpm) was added 15 min after the start of the reaction (by 15 min steady state is attained). Subsequent samples (50 µl) to be used for analysis of isotope were added to the above sampling mixture (5 µl) that also contained 20 µm d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. They subsequently were supplemented with 20 µl of a solution containing prothrombin (200 µg/ml), 50 mmTris, 37.5 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 22.5% glycerol, and 0.02% Serva blue. The samples were heated at 90 °C for 4 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE in Tricine buffer (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 20% ethanol, 6% trichloroacetic acid for 2 h, and then stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. They were subsequently dried using Bio-Gel wrap in Plexiglas frames at 37 °C. Autoradiographs were made with Kodak XAR 5 film, and radioactive bands were excised and counted in a γ-scintillation counter. 125I-Labeled meizothrombin and the pair fragment 1.2:prethrombin 2 were made immediately prior to the start of the experiments by adding radiolabeled prothrombin (4.0 × 107 cpm) in 300 µl of 20 mm HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, 5.0 mm CaCl2, 0.004% Tween 80, 20 µm DAPA, pH 7.4, to 300 µl of ecarin-Sepharose or factor Xa-Sepharose, pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The slurry was mixed and briefly centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The resin with 125I-labeled prothrombin was then incubated at 22 °C for 40 min to quantitatively generate meizothrombin or fragment 1.2:prethrombin 2. The resin was then resuspended in 500 µl of the buffer and reprecipitated by microcentrifugation. An aliquot (400 µl) of the supernatant was then added to an ongoing steady-state reaction in the reactor. Time course data were modeled according to Equations (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7), where C 1 andC 2 are catalytic efficiencies for conversion of P to M and P2, respectively, and C 3 is that for direct conversion of P to T without obligatory free intermediates.C 4 and C 5 are the catalytic efficiencies for the respective conversions of free M and P2 to thrombin.d[P]dt=−(C1+C2+C3)[P][E](Eq. 5) d[M]dt=C1[P][E]−C4[M][E](Eq. 6) d[P2]dt=C2[P][E]−C5[P2][E](Eq. 7) If [E] of Equations (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7) were to remain constant over the course of the reaction, Equations (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7) could be solved as explicit functions of time with free E as a constant. Experience showed, however, that this was not the case because the time course of P could not be fit with randomly distributed residuals to a single exponential decay. Thus, ratios were taken to eliminate [E]. Equation 8 is the ratio of Equations 5 and6. Separating the variables d[M] and d[P] in Equation 8 yields Equation 9. Integration of Equation 9 yields Equation10. In these equations, C T =C 1 + C 2 +C 3.d[M]d[P]=−C1CT+C4CT[M][P](Eq. 8) d[M]=−C1d[P]CT+C4[M]dln[P]CT(Eq. 9) [M]=C1CT([P0]−[P])−C4CT∫ln[P]ln[P0][M]dln[P](Eq. 10) Division of both sides of Equation 10 by ([P0] − [P]) results in the linear Equation 11, where Y andX are given by Equations 12 and 13.Y=−C1CT−C4CTX(Eq. 11) Y=[M]([P]0−[P])(Eq. 12) X=1[P0]−[P]∫ln[P]ln[P0][M]dln[P](Eq. 13) The integral included in the term X is evaluated for each time point by determining the area under a plot of Mversus lnP between the points ln[P] and ln[P0]. The data pairs (X and Y) were then subjected to least squares linear regression to Equation 11(and an identical equation for the Pre-2 data) to find best values ofC 1/C T,C 2/C T,C 3/C T = 1 −C 1/C T −C 2/C T,C 4/C T, andC 5/C T. The first three give the relative rates of prothrombin conversions to M, P2, and direct conversion to thrombin, respectively. The last two, respectively, give catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m) of free M and P2 conversion to thrombin, relative to the total catalytic efficiency of prothrombin consumption. In the steady-state experiments with radiolabeled prothrombin, meizothrombin, or fragment 1.2:prethrombin-2, first order rate constants for consumption of the radiolabeled species were determined by nonlinear regression of the data to a single exponential decay equation versus time of sampling under steady-state conditions. The rate constant was then multiplied by the steady-state concentrations to determine the rates of consumption under steady-state conditions. In these latter experiments flows along each path were therefore determined directly, without the need for a mathematical model of the reaction kinetics whereby rates could be inferred. The only implicit assumptions in the reactor experiments is that the steady-state rate is equal to the rate constant multiplied by the level of the reactant. The time courses of prothrombin, meizothrombin, prethrombin 2, and thrombin during the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin are shown in Fig.1. The substrate prothrombin showed a roughly first order decline in concentration. The intermediates showed a characteristic increase over time up to a maximum value, followed by decline thereafter. The meizothrombin concentration peaked at about 3.5 min, and the prethrombin 2 concentration peaked at about 10 min. The time courses of prothrombin, meizothrombin, and prethrombin 2 are qualitatively consistent with free meizothrombin and prethrombin 2 as obligatory intermediates in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The time course of thrombin, however, is not consistent. The thrombin concentration rises immediately upon initiation of the reaction, without the characteristic lag typical of a mechanism with obligatory intermediates. If free meizothrombin and prethrombin 2 were obligatory intermediates, the maximum rate of thrombin formation would be expected to occur sometime in the interval bound by the times in which the levels of the intermediates reached their maxima (i.e.between 3.5 and 10 min). Since this did not occur, the time course of thrombin generation suggests that some direct conversion of prothrombin to thrombin occurred without equilibration of free intermediates with the prothrombinase complex. In order to quantify the flow of prothrombin to thrombin, the time course data were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time courses of five experiments such as the one depicted in Fig. 1 were analyzed. Plots of the parameters indicated by Equations (Eq. 11), (Eq. 12), (Eq. 13) under “Experimental Procedures” for meizothrombin (Fig. 2 A) and prethrombin 2 (Fig. 2 B) were linear, as predicted by Equation 11. Thus, from the vertical intercepts and slopes, the rate constants (relative to the rate constant for prothrombin consumption) for conversion of prothrombin to meizothrombin or prethrombin 2, and relative rate constants for conversion of the intermediates to thrombin could be calculated. The results of these experiments are summarized in TableI. The relative rate constants for conversion of prothrombin to meizothrombin and prethrombin 2 are 0.30 and 0.31, respectively. Thus, according to this analysis, 30% of the prothrombin that is consumed produced meizothrombin and 31% produced prethrombin 2. By contrast, 39% was directly channeled to thrombin without free meizothrombin or prethrombin 2 as obligatory intermediates. Interestingly, whereas the relative rate constants (relative catalytic efficiencies) for cleavage of the Arg323–Ile324 in prothrombin (C 1) and prethrombin 2 (C 5) are about the same (0.30 and 0.40), the rate constant for cleavage of the Arg274–Thr275 bond in meizothrombin (C 4) is 10-fold greater than that for cleavage of the same bond in prothrombin (C 2). In addition, the rate constant for cleavage of Arg274–Thr275 in meizothrombin (C 4) is 7.9-fold greater than the rate constant for cleavage of the Arg323–Ile324 bond in prethrombin 2.Table IRelative rate constants for prothrombin activationC 1C 2C 3C 4C 50.2910.2210.4882.370.2910.3700.3750.2553.150.3950.3480.2830.3693.940.3040.2330.3190.4482.950.4900.2580.3350.4073.140.499Mean ± S.D.0.300 ± 0.0520.307 ± 0.0520.393 ± 0.0803.11 ± 0.500.396 ± 0.088Rate constants are expressed relative to the rate constant for prothrombin consumption.

C 4 andC 5 are the rate constants for conversion of meizothrombin and prethrombin-2 to thrombin, respectively. Because the analysis of the flows of prothrombin to thrombin, either directly by channeling or indirectly through intermediates, requires a model of kinetics, the validity of the conclusions reached by the analysis is dependent on the validity of the model. Thus, an alternative approach was sought that does not rely on a model of kinetics. A reactor was set up in which prothrombin was infused at a constant rate, thereby driving the system into the steady state with constant levels of prothrombin, meizothrombin, and prethrombin 2, and with thrombin produced at a rate equal to the rate of infusion of prothrombin. Under these conditions the rate constants for consumption of prothrombin, meizothrombin, and prethrombin 2 could be measured with radiolabeled proteins, and rates of consumption could be calculated from the rate constants multiplied by the steady-state concentration. This provided a direct measure of flow without the need for a model of kinetics. Upon the initiation of prothrombin infusion (Fig. 3), the prothrombin and meizothrombin levels became constant within the first 5–10 min of infusion, the prethrombin 2 approached a steady state within 30–40 min, and thrombin production was linear with respect to time over the entire 1-h course of the infusion. In separate experiments, trace quantities of radiolabeled prothrombin, meizothrombin, or the pair fragment 1.2:prethrombin 2 were added 20 min after the initiation of the infusion (i.e. in"

The pathogenesis caused by C. perfringens infection has been attributed to the toxins including extracellular enzymes produced by this organism (4Rood J.I. Cole S.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 621-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the fact that C. perfringens is the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in higher animals (5Borriello S.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: S242-S250Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), there is little doubt that this organism is endowed with enzymes capable of degrading gastrointestinal mucous glycoproteins. Although several glycosidases from C. perfringens have been detected and studied (4Rood J.I. Cole S.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 621-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hatheway C.L. Clin. Microbiol.

While using sialidases for structural analyses of sialoglycoconjugates, we found that commercially available sialidases prepared from C. perfringens ATCC10543 were contaminated with an unusual endoglycosidase capable of releasing a disaccharide, GlcNAcα1→4Gal, from porcine gastric mucin (PGM).1 The mucous glycoproteins containing this unique terminal disaccharide are specifically secreted from the mucous neck cell and pyloric gland of the stomach and Brunner's gland of the duodenum (7Ishihara K.

This report describes the isolation and characterization of this unusual endo-β-galactosidase from C. perfringens ATCC10543. Because this clostridial endo-β-galactosidase specifically releases the disaccharide GlcNAcα1→4Gal from PGM, we propose to call this endoglycosidase, a GlcNAcα1→4Gal-releasing endo-β-galactosidase (Endo-β-GalGnGa).DISCUSSIONCommercially available sialidases have been widely usedin vitro and in vivo to study the effect of desialylation of glycoconjugates. To ensure that changes after sialidase treatment are truly attributed to the removal of sialic acids, the sialidase used should be free from other contaminants. This work was initiated after an observation that commercially available sialidases prepared from C. perfringens ATCC10543 (12Cassidy J.T. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3501-3506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were contaminated with an endoglycosidase capable of releasing a disaccharide from PGM. We have purified and characterized this unique endoglycosidase from the culture supernatant of C. perfringens. We found that this enzyme was retained by a Sephacryl S-200 HR column and could be released from the column using methyl-α-Glc. This step provided an effective one-step purification of this enzyme in electrophoretically homogeneous form. Using NMR spectroscopy (Figs. 2 B and 3 and Table II) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 4 B), we have shown unequivocally that this enzyme released GlcNAcα1→4Gal from GlcNAcα1→4Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcα1→4Galβ1→ 3)GalNAc-ol by specifically cleaving the internal Galβ1→4GlcNAc linkage in this hexasaccharide-alditol. Thus, this enzyme is an endo-β-galactosidase. However, the enzyme was not able to release GlcNAcα1→4Gal from the GlcNAcα1→4Galβ1→3GalNAc-ol branch in the hexasaccharide-alditol. Using anti-Tn antigen mAb, we were able to show indirectly that the enzyme also released GlcNAcα1→4Gal from GlcNAcα1→4Galβ1→3GalNAcα1→Ser/Thr in PGM (Fig. 5). This may suggest that the pyranose structure of the aglycon, GalNAc, is important for the enzyme. Whether or not the enzyme is able to release GlcNAcα1→4Gal from the GlcNAcα1→4Galβ1→3GlcNAc sequence remains to be elucidated. Oligosaccharides containing this structure are currently not available.Three different types of microbial endo-β-galactosidase have been reported. They are: (i) the endo-β-galactosidase that cleaves the endo-β-galactosyl linkages in polylactosaminoglycans (23Fukuda M.N. Matsumura G. J. Biol.

The endo-β-galactosidase presented in this report is distinct from the aforementioned three endo-β-galactosidases. Because this novel endo-β-galactosidase specifically releases GlcNAcα1→4Gal from PGM, we propose to call this clostridial endoglycosidase a GlcNAcα1→4Gal-releasing endo-β-galactosidase (Endo-β-GalGnGa).Although the β-linked GlcNAc is found commonly in glycoconjugates, the α-linked GlcNAc is relatively rare. It is well known that glycan chains of heparin and heparan sulfate contain α-linked GlcNAc.

Spicer S.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In man, the occurrence of this mucin was found to be exclusively limited to the gastric gland mucous cells, such as mucous neck and pyloric gland cells, Brunner's gland of the duodenum, and accessory gland of the pancreaticobiliary tract. Thus, class III mucin is also termed gastric gland mucous cell-type mucin. Immunohistochemical analysis of the human alimentary tract indicates that HIK1083 mAb specifically reacts with class III mucin, suggesting that this mucin contains terminally linked GlcNAcα1→4Gal residues (36Ota H.

By using a cDNA encoding α4GnT which is responsible for the biosynthesis of GlcNAcα1→4Gal-epitope, Nakayama et al. (8Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Class III mucin has also been found in gastric adenocarcinoma (37Nakamura N. Ota H. Katsuyama T. Akamatsu T. Ishihara K. Kurihara M. Hotta K. J. Histochem.

Endo-β-GalGnGa was found to remove the GlcNAcα1→4Gal epitope expressed on the cell surface of gastric adenocarcinoma AGS-α4GnT cells (Fig. 6). The physiological consequence of releasing the GlcNAcα1→4Gal disaccharide from gastric mucin is not known at the present time. Because the GlcNAcα1→4Gal-epitope is expressed only in the gastroduodenal mucin, the removal of this disaccharide from the mucin may facilitate the passage of C. perfringens from the stomach to the intestine, the primary site of infection by this bacterium. This hypothesis can be tested in the future by comparing the pathogenicity of the wild type C. perfringens with that of the mutant devoid of Endo-β-GalGnGa activity.The existence of such an unusual endo-β-galactosidase in C. perfringens ATCC10543 is very intriguing. This unique endo-β-galactosidase should become useful for studying the structure and biological function of glycoconjugates containing the GlcNAcα1→4Gal epitope. Clostridium perfringens, a ubiquitous anaerobic bacterium commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of higher animals and in soil, has been known to cause a wide variety of diseases in man and animals (1Smith L.D. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1979; 1: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Niilo L. Can. Vet. J. 1980; 21: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sterne M. Br. Vet. J. 1981; 137: 443-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathogenesis caused by C. perfringens infection has been attributed to the toxins including extracellular enzymes produced by this organism (4Rood J.I. Cole S.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 621-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the fact that C. perfringens is the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in higher animals (5Borriello S.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20: S242-S250Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), there is little doubt that this organism is endowed with enzymes capable of degrading gastrointestinal mucous glycoproteins. Although several glycosidases from C. perfringens have been detected and studied (4Rood J.I. Cole S.T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 621-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hatheway C.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 66-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), none has been shown to cleave sugar chains found in a specific class of gastrointestinal mucin. While using sialidases for structural analyses of sialoglycoconjugates, we found that commercially available sialidases prepared from C. perfringens ATCC10543 were contaminated with an unusual endoglycosidase capable of releasing a disaccharide, GlcNAcα1→4Gal, from porcine gastric mucin (PGM).1 The mucous glycoproteins containing this unique terminal disaccharide are specifically secreted from the mucous neck cell and pyloric gland of the stomach and Brunner's gland of the duodenum (7Ishihara K. Kurihara M. Goso Y. Urata T. Ota H. Katsuyama T. Hotta K. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, this mucin is also called the gastric gland mucous cell-type mucin. This report describes the isolation and characterization of this unusual endo-β-galactosidase from C. perfringens ATCC10543. Because this clostridial endo-β-galactosidase specifically releases the disaccharide GlcNAcα1→4Gal from PGM, we propose to call this endoglycosidase, a GlcNAcα1→4Gal-releasing endo-β-galactosidase (Endo-β-GalGnGa). DISCUSSIONCommercially available sialidases have been widely usedin vitro and in vivo to study the effect of desialylation of glycoconjugates. To ensure that changes after sialidase treatment are truly attributed to the removal of sialic acids, the sialidase used should be free from other contaminants. This work was initiated after an observation that commercially available sialidases prepared from C. perfringens ATCC10543 (12Cassidy J.T. Jourdian G.W. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Paradoxical concanavalin A staining, a sequential histochemical method involving periodate oxidation, sodium borohydride reduction, ConA binding, and horseradish peroxidase reaction, has been used to identify mucosubstances called class III mucin (35Katsuyama T. Spicer S.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In man, the occurrence of this mucin was found to be exclusively limited to the gastric gland mucous cells, such as mucous neck and pyloric gland cells, Brunner's gland of the duodenum, and accessory gland of the pancreaticobiliary tract. Thus, class III mucin is also termed gastric gland mucous cell-type mucin. Immunohistochemical analysis of the human alimentary tract indicates that HIK1083 mAb specifically reacts with class III mucin, suggesting that this mucin contains terminally linked GlcNAcα1→4Gal residues (36Ota H.

By using a cDNA encoding α4GnT which is responsible for the biosynthesis of GlcNAcα1→4Gal-epitope, Nakayama et al. (8Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Endo-β-GalGnGa was found to remove the GlcNAcα1→4Gal epitope expressed on the cell surface of gastric adenocarcinoma AGS-α4GnT cells (Fig. 6). The physiological consequence of releasing the GlcNAcα1→4Gal disaccharide from gastric mucin is not known at the present time. Because the GlcNAcα1→4Gal-epitope is expressed only in the gastroduodenal mucin, the removal of this disaccharide from the mucin may facilitate the passage of C. perfringens from the stomach to the intestine, the primary site of infection by this bacterium. This hypothesis can be tested in the future by comparing the pathogenicity of the wild type C. perfringens with that of the mutant devoid of Endo-β-GalGnGa activity. The existence of such an unusual endo-β-galactosidase in C. perfringens ATCC10543 is very intriguing. This unique endo-β-galactosidase should become useful for studying the structure and biological function of glycoconjugates containing the GlcNAcα1→4Gal epitope."

Smad3 binds to CAGA box, whereas Smad1 and Smad5 preferentially bind to GC-rich sequences. The β-hairpin loop in the amino-terminal Mad homology 1 (MH1) domain is the direct DNA-binding site of Smad3; however, the amino acid sequences of the β-hairpin loop of Smad3 and Smad1/5 are identical, suggesting that other regions may be responsible for the differential DNA binding of Smad3 and Smad1/5. To identify regions other than the β-hairpin loop responsible for specific DNA binding of Smad3, we generated chimeras containing various regions of Smad3 and Smad1. Luciferase assays using a TGF-β-responsive reporter (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc and gel-mobility shift assays using 3xCAGA as a probe revealed that α-helix 2 (H2) in the amino-terminal part of the MH1 domain plays an important role in specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of Smad3. Luciferase assays using natural TGF-β-responsive reporters also revealed the functional importance of H2 in the Smad3 MH1 domain in direct DNA binding. Smad3 thus binds to DNA directly through the β-hairpin loop, and H2 supports specific DNA binding of Smad3.

Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Pepide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Part I. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 419-472Google Scholar, 2Reddi A.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The TGF-β superfamily proteins bind to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II, and transmit intracellular signals through Smad proteins (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are directly activated by type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, form complexes with common-partner Smads (Co-Smads), and translocate into the nucleus where they regulate transcription of target genes. The third class of Smads, inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), interfere with the signaling activity of R-Smads and Co-Smads in TGF-β superfamily signaling. R-Smads are further classified into two subtypes, i.e. those activated by the activin and TGF-β signaling pathways (referred to as AR-Smads in this report) and those activated by the BMP signaling pathways (BR-Smads) (4Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In mammals, Smad2 and Smad3 serve as AR-Smads, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are BR-Smads. Members of the BMP family, including BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, and growth/differentiation factor-5 activate BR-Smads. In addition, AMH binds to a complex composed of AMH type II receptor and BMP type IB receptor and activates BR-Smads (5Gouédard L. Chen Y.-G. Thevenet L. Racine C. Borie S. Lamarre I. Josso N. Massagué J. di Clemente N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27973-27978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that BMP-3 does not induce bone formation in vivo and that it binds to activin type II and type IB receptors and transmits activin-specific signals (6Daluiski A. Engstrand T. Bahamonde M.E. Gamer L.W. Agius E. Stevenson S.L. Cox K. Rosen V. Lyons K.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, members of the TGF-β superfamily might be classified based on their abilities to activate either AR-Smads or BR-Smads. In the nucleus, R-Smads regulate transcription of target genes through direct binding to DNA, interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, and recruitment of transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors (4Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 7Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinities for DNA binding of Smads are relatively low, and Smads may regulate transcription of certain target genes mainly through indirect DNA binding via other transcription factors, e.g. FAST/FoxH family proteins (8Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). However, direct DNA binding of Smads is essential for transcriptional regulation of certain genes. Smad3 and Smad4 have been shown to bind to CAGA boxes and related sequences (9Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

In contrast, Smad1, Smad5, Drosophila Mad, and Medea have been shown to bind to GC-rich sequences (GCCGnCGC) (13Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A.

Hamamoto K. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

Smads have conserved motifs in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions, termed Mad homology 1 (MH1) and MH2 domains (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). MH2 domains are important for interaction with serine/threonine kinase receptors, formation of Smad oligomers, interaction with various DNA-binding proteins, and transcriptional activation. MH1 domains, on the other hand, contain nuclear localization signals (18Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and are responsible for direct DNA binding. In addition, MH1 was shown to interact with certain DNA-binding proteins (4Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the MH1 domain of Smad3 revealed that the β-hairpin loop protrudes from the core structure of MH1 and that it is responsible for DNA binding of Smad3 (20Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Smad2 cannot directly bind to DNA, because a 30-amino acid insert region (loop 2) located in the amino-terminal part of the MH1 domain interferes with the DNA binding of Smad2 (21Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Importantly, the amino acid sequences of β-hairpin loops are identical in all R-Smads, and that of Smad4 (Co-Smad in mammals) is also highly conserved compared with those of R-Smads. However, Smad1 and Smad5 bind to GC-rich sequences, which are different from CAGA box, and this differential DNA binding ability may, at least in part, be responsible for differences in the biological activities induced by activins/TGF-βs and BMPs. To determine the reasons for the differential DNA binding abilities of Smad3 and Smad1/5, we generated chimeric molecules composed of different parts of Smad3 and Smad1. The present findings obtained by transcriptional response assays and gel-mobility shift assays indicate that α-helix 2 (H2) located in the amino-terminal part of MH1 plays an important role in specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation activity of Smad3. The original constructions of FLAG-pcDNA3, constitutively active forms of human BMP type IA and TGF-β type I receptors (BMPR-IA(QD) and TβR-I(TD), respectively), Smad1, Smad3, Smad4, and FAST1/FoxH3 cDNAs were previously described (14Kusanagi K.

Smad1 and Smad3 chimeras were prepared by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach. To obtain efficient levels of protein expression, some constructs were subcloned into another expression vector, pcDEF3 (23Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A.

R mutant mink lung epithelial cells, which lack functional TβR-I, or P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with an appropriate combination of promoter-reporter constructs, expression plasmids, and pcDNA3 (14Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Total amounts of transfected DNAs were the same in each experiment, and values were normalized usingRenillaluciferase activity. Gel-mobility shift assays were performed as described (14Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 27Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from COS7 cells transfected with appropriate combinations of plasmids were used. 3xCAGA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. Three-mg aliquots of cell lysates were added to premix solution containing poly(dI·dC) and 4 × 104 cpm of the labeled probe. Complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. We first prepared two Smad1/3 chimeras, i.e. 3-1-1 containing the MH1 domain of Smad3 and the linker and MH2 of Smad1, and 1-3-3 containing the MH1 of Smad1 and the linker and MH2 of Smad3 (Fig.1A). In agreement with previous reports that MH2 domain specifically interacts with type I serine/threonine kinase receptors (28Lo R.S. Chen Y.-G. Shi Y. Pavletich N.P. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the 1-3-3 chimera containing the Smad3 MH2 domain was phosphorylated by a constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I(TD), whereas the 3-1-1 chimera containing the Smad1 MH2 domain was phosphorylated by a constitutively active form of BMP type IA receptor, BMPR-IA(QD) (data not shown). We next investigated transcriptional activation activity of these chimeras using (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, which is known to be specifically activated by AR-Smads (9Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). The 3-1-1 chimera but not wild-type Smad1 activated transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc in response to BMPR-IA(QD) (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.1 C, TβR-I(TD) strongly induced transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, most likely through activation of endogenous Smad2 and Smad3. Smad3 induced further increase in the transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc in the presence of TβR-I(TD). In contrast, the 1-3-3 chimera did not significantly induce additional increase in the transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc in the presence of TβR-I(TD). These results indicate that the MH1 domain of Smad3 is responsible for specific transcriptional activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc. We also used 3GC2-Lux, which contains the GC-rich sequence of the mouseSmad6 promoter, and is specifically activated by BR-Smads (16Ishida W. Hamamoto K. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Wild-type Smad1 induced transcription of 3GC2-Lux upon activation by BMPR-IA(QD), but the 3-1-1 chimera failed to do so (Fig.1 D). We also tested wild-type Smad3 and the 1-3-3 chimera, but neither of them induced transcription of 3GC2-Lux upon TβR-I(TD) stimulation (data not shown). Our findings suggest that activation of 3GC2-Lux is not solely dependent on the MH1 domain of Smad1 and that other regions may also participate in activation of this reporter, possibly through interaction with other DNA-binding proteins. We therefore focused on the transcriptional activity of Smad1/3 chimeras using (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc in the present study. We next examined whether the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal half of MH1 domain is important for specific transcriptional activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc by Smad3. We divided the MH1 domains into the amino-terminal (N region) and carboxyl-terminal halves (C region) and constructed chimeras as shown in Fig. 2A. The β-hairpin loop is located in the C region. In addition to the 3-1-1 chimera, the 31-1-1 chimera containing the N region of Smad3 MH1 domain induced significant transcriptional activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc upon activation by BMPR-IA(QD), although the activity of the 31-1-1 chimera was less than that of the 3-1-1 chimera (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the 13-1-1 chimera failed to induce transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, suggesting that the N region of Smad3 MH1 domain plays an important role in activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc. The C region may also be important for transcriptional activation because the 3-1-1 chimera was more potent than the 31-1-1 chimera; however, the C region may require the N region for efficient transcriptional activation. We also examined the transcriptional activity of chimeras 13-3-3 and 31-3-3, containing the linker and MH2 domain of Smad3 (Fig.2 C). TβR-I(TD) strongly induced transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, and Smad3 further induced transcriptional activation as shown in Fig. 1 C. The 31-3-3 chimera containing the N region of the Smad3 MH1 domain also increased the transcriptional activity induced by TβR-I(TD), although it was less potent than wild-type Smad3. In contrast, the 13-3-3 chimera containing the N region of the Smad1 MH1 domain failed to induce additional increase in the transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc. We next investigated the DNA binding abilities of Smad1/3 chimeras to 3xCAGA by EMSA. The 3-1-1 and 31-1-1 chimeras bound to 3xCAGA upon stimulation by BMPR-IA(QD); this binding was more prominent in the presence than in the absence of Smad4 (Fig.3A). In contrast, wild-type Smad1 and the 13-1-1 chimera only weakly bound or did not bind to the probe. Similarly, the wild-type Smad3 and the 31-3-3 chimera bound to DNA in the presence of TβR-I(TD), and this binding was enhanced in the presence of Smad4 (Fig. 3 B). Two shifted bands were detected in the presence of Smad4 as previously reported (27Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither the 1-3-3 nor the 13-3-3 chimera bound to DNA in either the absence or presence of TβR-I(TD) and Smad4. These results are in good agreement with those of luciferase assays using (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (Figs. 1 and 2) suggesting that transcriptional activation of the (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc reporter is induced by direct binding of Smad chimeras to CAGA boxes. Because the N region of Smad3 is important for direct DNA binding of Smad3, the N region was further investigated using (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc. The N region contains three α-helices termed H1, H2, and H3 (20Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We divided the N region into two parts,i.e. the Na region containing the most amino-terminal part including H1 and H2, and the Nb region containing the remaining part of the N region including H3, and prepared chimeras as shown in Fig.4A. In the presence and absence of BMPR-IA(QD), the 313-1-1 chimera was as potent as the 3-1-1 chimera in activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (Fig.4 B). In addition, the 311-1-1 chimera significantly induced transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc in the absence and presence of BMPR-IA(QD). In contrast, the chimeras containing the Na region of Smad1, i.e. the 131-1-1 and 133-1-1 chimeras, failed to activate transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, similar to 13-1-1 and wild-type Smad1. When the chimeras containing the linker and MH2 domains of Smad3 were examined, those containing the Na region of Smad3, i.e. 313-3-3, 311-3-3, and 31-3-3 were found to induce transcriptional activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc both in the presence and absence of TβR-I(TD) (Fig. 4 C). On the other hand, the chimeras containing the Na region of Smad1, i.e. 133-3-3 and 131-3-3, did not activate transcription of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc. DNA binding of the Smad1/3 chimeras was also studied by EMSA using 3xCAGA as a probe. In agreement with the results obtained by luciferase assay, the chimeras containing the Na region of Smad3, i.e.31-1-1 and 311-1-1, bound to the probe upon BMPR-IA(QD) stimulation in the presence of Smad4 (Fig.5A). When the chimeras containing the linker and MH2 domain of Smad3 were investigated, those containing the Na region of Smad3, i.e. 313-3-3 and 31-3-3, were found to bind to DNA upon stimulation by TβR-I(TD) both in the presence and absence of Smad4 (Fig. 5 B). These findings revealed that the Na region is more important than the Nb region for direct DNA binding of Smad3. We further explored which parts of the Na region are most important for the specific transcriptional activation and DNA binding of Smad3. The Na region includes H1 and H2, which are conserved between Smad3 and Smad1, while the remaining parts of the Na region are less conserved (Fig. 6A). We generated mutants of Smad1 in which amino acid residues in the Na region were replaced by corresponding amino acid residues of Smad3. These mutants were termed Smad1[I], Smad1[II], Smad1[III], Smad1[IV], Smad1[H2C], and Smad1[H2KS]. Similarly, Smad3 mutants,i.e. Smad3[I], Smad3[II], Smad3[III], Smad3[IV], Smad3[H2A], and Smad3[H2DA], in which amino acid residues in the Na region were replaced by those of Smad1, were prepared (Fig.6 A). Luciferase assays using these chimeras revealed that Smad1[I], Smad1[II], and Smad1[H2C] were inactive, similar to wild-type Smad1, whereas Smad1[III] and Smad1[H2KS] acquired the ability to activate (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, similar to the 311-1-1 chimera (Fig. 6 B). We also found that Smad3[I], Smad3[II], and Smad3[H2A] were as potent as wild-type Smad3, whereas Smad3[H2DA], Smad3[III], and the 133-3-3 chimera were less potent than wild-type Smad3 in transcriptional activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (Fig. 6 C). Smad1[IV] and Smad3[IV] were functionally similar to Smad1[III] and Smad3[III], respectively, in transcriptional activation of (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc (data not shown). Analyses by EMSA using 3xCAGA also showed that the 311-1-1 chimera, Smad1[III], and Smad1[IV] bound to DNA upon stimulation by BMPR-IA(QD) in the presence of Smad4, whereas the 13-1-1 and 131-1-1 chimeras and Smad1[I] bound only weakly to the DNA (Fig.7A). The 313-3-3 and 31-3-3 chimeras and Smad3[I] bound to the probe in the presence and absence of Smad4 upon TβR-I(TD) stimulation, but the 133-3-3 chimera and Smad3[III] and Smad3[IV] did not (Fig. 7 B). We further studied Smad constructs with mutations in H2. Smad1[H2KS] acquired the ability to bind to DNA, similar to the 311-1-1 chimera and Smad1[III], whereas Smad1[H2C] bound only very weakly to the probe (Fig. 7 C). Furthermore, the DNA binding ability of Smad3[H2DA] but not that of Smad3[H2A] was greatly reduced, similar to that of Smad3[III] (Fig. 7 D). These findings suggest that the amino acids Lys-36 and Ser-37 in H2 are most important for specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of Smad3. Because (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc is an artificial promoter-reporter construct containing nine tandemly repeated CAGA boxes, we investigated the transcriptional activities of Smad1/3 chimeras and mutants using natural TGF-β-responsive reporters. p800-Luc contains the TGF-β-responsive element of thePAI-1 promoter (24Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8A, the chimeras containing the Na region of Smad3, i.e. 313-1-1, and 311-1-1, significantly induced transcription of p800-Luc in the presence of BMPR-IA(QD). Smad1[III] and Smad1[IV] also induced transcription of p800-Luc in the presence of BMPR-IA(QD), although they were less potent than the 313-1-1 and 311-1-1 chimeras. In contrast, neither the chimeras containing the Smad1 Na region nor the Smad1[I] mutant significantly induced transcription of the reporter. When the chimeras or mutants containing the linker and MH2 domains of Smad3 were examined, those containing the Smad3 Na region and the Smad3[I] mutant were found to induce transcription upon TβR-I(TD) stimulation. In contrast, the chimeras containing the Smad1 Na region and the Smad3[III] and Smad3[IV] mutants were less active than Smad3 (Fig.8 B). Thus these results were in agreement with those obtained using (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc. We also examined the activity of Smad3 chimera using AR3-Luc, which contains the promoter region the of Xenopus Mix.2 gene. The DNA binding of FAST/FoxH family proteins is required for transcriptional activation of AR3-Luc (25Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Fig. 8 C shows that FAST1/FoxH3 induced transcription of AR3-Luc in the presence of TβR-I(TD), which was further enhanced by Smad2. In contrast, Smad3 did not significantly induce transcription of AR3-Luc, probably because the direct binding of Smad3 to DNA altered the configuration of Smad/FAST1/DNA complexes (21Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Similar to Smad2, the chimera 133-3-3 enhanced transcription of AR3-Luc in the presence of FAST1/FoxH3 and TβR-I(TD), suggesting that this chimera did not bind to DNA and functioned in a fashion similar to Smad2. The effects of Smad chimeras were examined using a BMP-responsive reporter, Tlx2-Lux (26Tang S.J. Hoodless P.A. Lu Z. Breitman M.L. McInnes R.R. Wrana J.L. Buchwald M. Development. 1998; 125: 1877-1887PubMed Google Scholar), and using P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Smads induce transcriptional activation of Tlx2-Lux through a GC-rich sequence. 2K. Kusanagi, M. Kawabata, H. K. Mishima, and K. Miyazono, unpublished data. Smad1 significantly induced transcriptional activation in both the presence and absence of BMPR-IA(QD) (Fig. 8 D). The 131-1-1 chimera induced transcription of Tlx2-Lux, although it was less potent than wild-type Smad1. In contrast, other chimeras, including 13-1-1 and 133-1-1, were not able to activate transcription of Tlx2-Lux, suggesting that the Tlx2 gene is activated by a mechanism different from that for genes containing the Smad3-binding elements. Smads have conserved MH1 and MH2 domains in their amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions, respectively, which are linked by linker regions. The MH2 domain plays important roles in interaction with type I receptors, hetero-oligomerization of Smads, binding to various transcription factors, and transcriptional regulation by recruitment of transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors (3Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 7Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the linker region has not been fully elucidated, but recent studies have revealed that Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are members of the HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, bind to a PY motif in the linker region of Smads and that they induce ubiquitin-dependent degradation of R-Smads and I-Smads (30Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 31Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L.

A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). MH1 domains are conserved in R-Smads and Co-Smads, but the amino acid sequences of I-Smads are divergent from those of other Smads. The MH1 domain has multiple functions; MH1 physically interacts with the MH2 domain, and MH1 and MH2 repress each other's function (35Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The MH1 domain was also shown to directly bind to DNA and to interact with certain DNA-binding proteins, including c-Jun and vitamin D receptor (4Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Recently, the MH1 domain of R-Smads but not of Co-Smads has been shown to contain a nuclear localization signal, which plays an important role in the nuclear transport of R-Smads upon receptor activation (18Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The question arises how R-Smads exhibit different biological activities in response to TGF-βs/activins and BMPs. R-Smads can interact with different transcription factors, e.g. Smad3 binds to FAST/FoxH proteins, c-Jun/c-Fos, TFE3, and vitamin D receptor, whereas Smad1 preferentially binds to OAZ and Hoxc8 (4Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition to their differential interaction with DNA-binding proteins, Smad3 and Smad1 bind to distinct DNA sequences, resulting in exhibition of specific biological functions of TGF-βs/activins and BMPs. The β-hairpin loop in the MH1 domain of Smad3 is the direct DNA-binding site (20Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). An important question is why Smad3 and Smad1 bind to different DNA sequences even though their β-hairpin loop amino acid sequences are identical. The present study revealed that H2 in the MH1 domain plays an important role in specific DNA binding of Smad3. Consistent with this, analysis of the three-dimensional structure of Smad3 MH1 domain revealed that H2 is located near the β-hairpin loop in solution (20Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 are AR-Smads activated by TGF-β and activin type I receptors. Although they are structurally highly similar to each other, analysis using mouse embryo fibroblasts derived fromSmad2- or Smad3-deficient mice revealed that they have specific roles in TGF-β signaling (36Piek E. Ju W. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Boettinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Smad2 does not bind to DNA because the loop 2 (Fig. 9) interferes with the DNA binding of Smad2 (21Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transgenic analysis using the GAL4/UAS system revealed that aDrosophila homologue of Smad2/3 (dSmad2) is functionally more similar to human Smad2 than to human Smad3 (37Marquez R.M. Singer M.A. Takaesu N.T. Waldrip W.R. Kraytsberg Y. Newfeld S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1639-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Although dSmad2 does not contain the loop 2, it does not bind to DNA because of the difference in the amino acid sequence in the β-hairpin loop (38Das P. Inoue H. Baker J.C. Beppu H. Kawabata M. Harland R.M. Miyazono K. Padgett R.W. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, Nagarajan and Chen reported that the most amino-terminal region of the MH1 domain (corresponding to the N region in this report) was important for the functional difference between Smad2 and Smad3 but that deletion of the loops 1 and 2 (Fig. 9) did not change the transcriptional activity of Smad2 (39Nagarajan R.P. Chen Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to two previous reports (21Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) reporting that by deletion of the loop 2, Smad2 bound to the CAGA sequence and functioned similarly to Smad3. The reason for the different results in these reports is currently unknown. There are only four amino acid differences in the amino-terminal regions of Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 9). Thus, the major functional difference between Smad2 and Smad3 may be due to the presence of the loop 2 in Smad2, but other parts in the N region of Smad2 might also contribute to the difference in certain functions of Smad2 and Smad3. It remains to be determined how BR-Smads bind to GC-rich sequences. The β-hairpin loop of Smad3 binds to the CAGA boxes most efficiently, but can bind to related sequences as well (11Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 20Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). However, the 131-1-1 chimera containing the Na region of Smad1 could weakly induce transcription of 3GC2-Lux, but the 13-1-1 and 133-1-1 chimeras failed to do so,2 suggesting that Smad1 may bind to GC-rich sequences in a fashion different from that of Smad3 and that both the Na and the C regions of MH1 may play a role in the direct DNA binding of Smad1. Smad4 has been shown to bind to the CAGA boxes as well as the GC-rich sequences (11Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 15Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, the N region of Smad4 is highly divergent from those of Smad3 or Smad1. Therefore, the DNA binding specificity of Smad4 may be determined in a manner distinct from those of Smad3 and Smad1. Because R-Smads and Smad4 form oligomeric complexes (27Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 40Chacko B.M. Qin B. Correia J.J. Lam S.S. de Caestecker M.P. Lin K. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20688-20694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the role of the DNA binding of Smad4 in transcriptional activation is an important question that should be answered in the future. It should also be noted that DNA binding of R-Smads may not be absolutely required for transcriptional activation in TGF-β superfamily signaling. For transcriptional activation of theMix.2 gene, direct DNA binding of R-Smads is not essential because FAST1/FoxH3 and FAST2/FoxH2 strongly bind to DNA (21Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Moreover, direct DNA binding of Smad3 may alter the configuration of the Smad oligomer-DNA complex resulting in repression of transcription (29Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The present findings also support this notion; the Smad3 chimera that contains the Na region of Smad1 and lacks the ability to bind to DNA induced transcription of AR3-Luc similar to Smad2. Mutations in Smad2 and Smad4 but not those in Smad3 have been identified in various cancers including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (4Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Although genetic alterations in the MH1 domain are less frequent than those in the MH2 domain, mutations in certain portions of the MH1 domain of Smad4 may result in dramatic decrease in DNA binding ability of Smad4, possibly due to disruption of the overall structure of MH1 (42Jones J.B. Kern S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mutations of the Smad4 MH1 domain have also been shown to lead to rapid degradation of Smad4 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (43Morén A. Itoh S. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4396-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that protein kinase C induces phosphorylation of Ser-37 of Smad3, resulting in loss of DNA binding ability of this molecule (45Yakymovych I. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Souchelnytskyi S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the DNA binding ability of Smads may be physiologically regulated by protein modification and pathologically altered by mutations of proteins. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the importance of H2 of the Smad3 MH1 domain in direct binding of Smad3 to specific DNA sequences. It will be important to determine how BR-Smads and Co-Smad recognize specific DNA sequences and how they contact DNA as R-Smad/Co-Smad complexes. We thank J.-M. Gauthier for (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc, D. J.

In this work we describe the endotoxin binding properties of a series of 23-residue peptides based on the sequence corresponding to the antisense strand of themagainingene. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of these peptides reveals that they have the tendency to perturb both the inner and outer membranes of test pathogens. Structurally these peptides are amphiphilic and adopt helical conformations in membranes. Three of the seven peptides tested have high affinities for endotoxin that approach the values shown by polymyxin B, a cyclic cationic acylated decapeptide, which is used clinically in treating extreme cases of sepsis. The kinetic parameters obtained using stopped-flow methods and BIAcoreTM analysis, when considered in conjunction with the isothermal titration calorimetry-derived thermodynamic parameters, allow us to highlight the key structural features essential for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognition by these peptides. The studies stress the role of ionic forces in the initial recognition of LPS. The fortification of the strength of these ionic charges increases affinity for LPS, whereas the hydrophobic residues involved in interactions are more amenable to disruptions in contiguity. Peptides that improve these features further are expected to perform better as endotoxin-neutralizing agents. Many naturally occurring peptides exhibit lipopolysaccharide binding properties.

Sepsis, being a complex combination of both local and systemic inflammatory responses, requires a multipronged interventional strategy to contain the various phases of disease progression (16Wong P.M.

Of the many interventional modalities, the sequestration of LPS by small peptides or proteins is quite an attractive one, and indeed many naturally occurring peptides (such as magainins, cecropins, bombins, mellitins, etc.) have intrinsic LPS binding activity (16Wong P.M.

Most of these peptides form amphipathic α-helices. Although their cationic nature facilitates their anchorage to the negatively charged bacterial surface, their amphiphilicity and high helical propensity promote their formation of helices in membranes. The insertion of such amphipathic helices in membranes underpins their membrane disruption activity (21Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect.

Among the naturally occurring antibacterial peptides, magainins display activity against not only the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but also against protozoa. Many analogs of magainins, including those corresponding to the antisense strand of its gene, have been synthesized (21Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect.

We report here the design of novel analogs of magainins with improved amphiphilicity and the tendency to adopt the α-helical motif in a membrane-bound environment. The peptides were evaluated for antimicrobial activity, helicity, membrane permeability, and hemolytic activity, which are compared with the properties of polymyxin B, one of the most commonly used agents for combating endotoxic shock (31Thomas C.J. Gangadhar B.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12428-12434Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Thomas C.J. Surolia A.

Pharmacother. 1999; 33: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these studies highlight the importance of the contiguity of the surface-exposed positive charges and amphiphilic α-helicity with antimicrobial- and endotoxin-compromising activity (31Thomas C.J. Gangadhar B.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12428-12434Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LPS and lipid A (from Escherichia coli55:B5, 111:B4), polymyxin B, lysosyme, 1-N-phenylnapthylamine (NPN), andO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside were obtained from Sigma. 5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl)-PMB was prepared as described earlier (35Schindler M. Teuber M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1975; 8: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All other reagents used in the study were of the highest available purity. Milli Q water was used to prepare all solutions. Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a NovaSyn semimanual peptide synthesizer and cleaved from thep-hydroxymethylphenoxymythylpolystyrene resin using 1,2-ethanedithiol (0.15 ml), deionized water (0.5 ml), and trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml). The peptides thus obtained were purified using a VYDAC reverse phase C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column in an acetonitrile/water gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were labeled with the dansyl group by passing dansyl chloride in dimethylformamide over the peptide-bound resin prior to cleavage and deprotection. The dansyl peptides complexed to LPS had an emission maximum at 495 nm when excited at 340 nm. The peptides and their dansylated derivatives were checked for purity by mass spectrometry using a Kratos matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight system. LPS from E. colistrain 55:B5 was purified further as described earlier (36Srimal S. Surolia N. Balasubramaian A. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All the LPS/lipid A samples in the appropriate buffer were vortexed for 10 min at 70 °C and mixed with equimolar quantities of triethylamine with respect to the anionic groups in those samples. Samples were sonicated at room temperature using a Braun sonicator for 5 min prior to use. Endotoxin in the samples was quantified by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay in pyrogen-free water using LPS from Endosafe™ as the standard according to the method of Yin et al. (37Yin E.T. Galanos C. Kinsky S. Bradshaw R.A. Wessler S. Luderitz O. Sarmiento M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the peptides were determined by amino acid analysis using Waters Pico-TagTM systems, whereas those of PMB and polymyxin B nonapeptide were determined by molar absorbance and weight, respectively (36Srimal S. Surolia N. Balasubramaian A. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The minimum inhibitory concentration values of each peptide were determined with different microorganisms by the broth dilution method. Briefly, each peptide was serially diluted in a 96-well plate, and the wells were inoculated with 15 μl of ∼105 colony-forming units/ml of the test organism. The plates were covered and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The lowest concentration at which the peptides inhibited microbial growth completely was taken to be the minimum inhibitory concentration value. Freshly collected rabbit blood containing heparin was centrifuged and washed to remove the buffy coat, and cells were washed four times in 0.85% saline. Serially diluted peptides in saline were prepared and added to red blood cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The extent of hemolysis was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 600 nm. Peptides were added to LPS solutions (5 μg/ml and 3.5 μm dansyl-PMB) in 1 ml of 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl (PBS buffer), and the loss in fluorescence was recorded. A plot of the inverse of the percent inhibition as a function of the inverse of the inhibitor concentration gave the IC50 value (i.e. the inhibitor concentration causing 50% displacement of the bound dansyl-PMB from the LPS lamellae). To study the permeabilizing ability of the peptides on the outer membrane,E. coli (UB1005) cells (in overnight culture, diluted in LB and grown to an OD of 0.7 at 600 nm) were suspended in 5 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm KCN. NPN (with an overall concentration of 10 mm) was added to 1 ml of these cells, and the basal fluorescence was recorded. Varying concentrations of peptides were then added to the solution, and the increase in fluorescence was recorded as a function of time. To study the uptake of lysozyme, 500 μl of cells were mixed with 50 μl of the lysozyme and varying concentrations of peptides. To ensure that the uptake of NPN and lysozyme is being monitored specifically, all the control experiments were conducted as prescribed (38Moore R.A. Bates N.C. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 29: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 39Loh B. Grant C. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Inner membrane permeabilization was determined by the measurement of β-galactosidase activity in E. coli ML-35 usingO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as the enzymatic substrate. Log phase cells were suspended in 1 ml of 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl after extensive washing with the same.O-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside was added to the solution to make the effective concentration 1.5 mm. At zero time different peptides were added to the solution, and the production of O-nitrophenol was monitored as a function of time at 420 nm (41Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Biochemistry. 1978; 84: 370-383Google Scholar). All CD measurements were performed in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter interfaced to a microcomputer for automatic data collection and analysis. The data were collected with a bandwidth of 1 nm, response time of 8 s, and scan speed of 10 nm/min. Each data point was an average of 4 accumulations. CD measurements were made in PBS both in the presence and absence of liposomes (l-α -dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/LPS or l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/lipid A, 8:2). The effective concentrations of the peptide and liposome were 4 μm and 3 mm, respectively. The machine was calibrated using an aqueous solution of d-10-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 nm. The data are reported as mean residue ellipticity. All fluorescence measurements were made using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorimeter. A slit width of 5 nm for both the monochromators was used. The samples and the cell were maintained at a constant temperature (±0.1 °C) using a Lauda water bath. Averages of 10 measurements were taken for each reading. All the ITC experiments were performed as previously reported by Srimal et al. (36Srimal S. Surolia N. Balasubramaian A. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) using an OMEGA MicroCal Inc. high sensitivity microcalorimeter. A typical titration involved 15–20 injections at 3-min intervals consisting of 4-μl aliquots of peptide solution into the sample cell (volume, 1.344 ml) containing lipid A (50 mm). The titration cell was stirred continuously at 400 rev/min. The molecular mass of LPS was taken to be 20,000 Da. The heats of dilution of the peptides in the buffer alone were subtracted from the titration data. The resulting data were then analyzed to determine the binding stoichiometry (n), the association constant, and the enthalpy change (ΔH b0) as described earlier (37Yin E.T. Galanos C. Kinsky S. Bradshaw R.A. Wessler S. Luderitz O. Sarmiento M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).ΔG b0 andΔSb were calculated from the fundamental equation of thermodynamics.ΔGb0=−RT lnKbEquation 1 ΔSb=(ΔHb0−ΔGb0)/TEquation 2 Fast reaction kinetic experiments in the fluorescence mode were performed on an Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus . The dead time of the instrument was measured as described by Tonomuraet al. (41Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Biochemistry. 1978; 84: 370-383Google Scholar) and was found to be 1.2 ms. For dansyl peptide-LPS interactions the samples were excited at 340 nm, and emissions were monitored beyond 420 nm by means of a cut-off filter at right angles to the excitation beam. The sample syringes and the cell were maintained at a constant temperature (±0.1 °C) by means of a Lauda water bath through jackets surrounding the cell and syringes. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements were made in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 150 mmNaCl). For measuring the effects of ionic strength on the kinetic parameters, experiments were conducted by adding varying concentrations of NaCl. All traces are the cumulative average of 5–10 successive kinetic profiles. The analyses of the stopped-flow traces were done by curve fitting using the Marquardt algorithm based on the routine curves. All curves were fitted to mono-, bi-, and triexponential equations with floating end points. All curve fitting and subsequent analysis was done on an ARCON 5000 RISC work station supplied by the manufacturer. Binding kinetics were determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a BIAcoreTM 2000 biosensor system. The peptides were covalently immobilized on the certified grade CM5 sensor chips at concentrations of 40 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, using the amine coupling kit supplied by the manufacturer. Nearly 400–500 resonance units of the peptides were immobilized under these conditions in which 1 resonance unit corresponds to an immobilized peptide concentration of ∼1 pg/mm2. The unreacted moieties on the surface were blocked with ethanolamine. All measurements were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 3.4 mm EDTA. For the determination of on rates, LPS (25–125 nm) flowing at the rate of 5 μl/min in the same buffer was used. Off rates were evaluated by passing a solution of 1 mm PMB in the same buffer at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The surface was regenerated by a 10-s pulse of 10 mm NaOH flowing at 50 μl/min. Lipid A containing monolayers and liposomes was prepared as described previously (34Evans M.E Feola D.J. Rapp R.P. Ann. Pharmacother. 1999; 33: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The monolayers and tethered liposomes were washed repeatedly with running buffer prior to use. Association (k 1) and dissociation (k −1) rate constants were obtained by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data using the BIA evaluation 3.0 software. The dissociation rate constant is derived using the equation Rt=Rt0e−k−1(t−t0)Equation 3 where the Rt is the response at timet, R t0 is the amplitude of the initial response, and k −1 is the dissociation rate constant. The association rate constant k 1 can be derived using Equation 2 from the measuredk −1 values.Rt=RMax[1−e−(k1C+k−1)(t−t0)]Equation 4 where R t is the response at timet, R Max is the maximum response,C is the concentration of the analyte in the solution,k on is the association rate constant, andk off is the dissociation rate constant.K a(k 1/k −1) is the association constant, and K d(k −1/k 1) is the dissociation constant. The inset of Fig.1 shows the sequence of the peptides used in the study and their serial numbers. The typical minimum inhibitory concentration values of the peptides used in the study are shown against various Gram-negative bacteria in TableI. Peptides 1, 2, and 3 among these peptides were found to have the highest antimicrobial activity.Table IMIC values for the peptides used in the studyPathogenPeptide1234567PMBμm/mlE. coli55B51.82.02.55.210.514.5250.6UB10052.12.53.15.512.515.520.50.4S. typhimurium (Lab strain)4.86.06.08.510.510.515.50.5S. aureus (Lab strain)55253030—1-a—, no observable MIC even above 100 μm/ml.———P. aeruginosa (Lab strain)3.04.54.510.512.512.520.50.41-a —, no observable MIC even above 100 μm/ml. Open table in a new tab Peptides 1,2, and 3 were found to be highly hemolytic with peptide 7 being poorest as a hemolysin, whereas peptide 4 was moderately so. However, their hemolytic activity was lower than that of PMB (Fig. 1, light gray bars). The displacement of dansyl-PMB from its complex with LPS has been proven to be an excellent probe for identifying cationic binding sites on both the endotoxin as well as whole bacterial cells. The dansyl group exhibits high fluorescence in the bound state, which declines upon displacement by other ligands that compete for the same binding site(s). Peptides 1, 2, and 3 display the highest degree of fluorescence quenching, whereas peptide 7 displays the lowest degree and peptides 4,5, and 6 display moderate degrees. Interestingly the activities of peptides 1 and 3 approach that of PMB (Fig. 1, black bars). Gram-negative species of bacteria have two membranes separating the cytoplasmic and periplasmic contents. The ability of peptides to permeabilize often determines their antimicrobial activity. NPN has weak fluorescence in the aqueous medium, which increases in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. Normally NPN is excluded by the bacterial cells. Permeabilization of their outer membranes facilitates the uptake of NPN by the inner membranes. Hence the fluorescence of NPN increases considerably, which indicates the extent of permeabilization. Thus the permeabilization of the outer membrane of bacteria by peptides shows that among the peptides, peptides 1–3 disrupted the outer membrane more effectively (Fig.2). The degree of cell disruption because of the action of lysozyme was monitored by a decrease in the A600 as a function of the peptide concentration. Peptides 1,2,3, and 4 facilitated this uptake at a minimum concentration of 10 μg/ml, whereas PMB was able to achieve the same at 0.8 μg/ml. Peptides 5 and 6 did not induce lysozyme uptake, whereas peptide 7 facilitated uptake only above 15 μg/ml (40Hancock R.E. Raffle V.J. Nicas T.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1981; 19: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Inner membrane permeabilization was also determined by the unmasking of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase in a permease-negative mutant. The lag time for the unmasking of β-galactosidase was ∼1 min after the addition of the peptides. Thus peptides 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 exhibited both inner and outer membrane permeabilization and facilitated the lysozyme uptake. Peptides 5 and 6 were relatively ineffective. In the absence of liposomes or trifluoroethanol, all peptides tested showed a characteristic unordered structure, whereas in the presence of liposomes containing LPS or lipid A, the peptides exhibited a maxima of ∼208 and 220 nm (Fig.3). Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements yielded binding constants (K a) in the range of 1.2 × 106 to 2.1 × 105m−1 with endothermic changes in enthalpies in the range of 2.7–27 kJ/mol for the binding of these peptides to lipid A (Fig.4 and TableII). Peptide 1, which exhibited the maximal antimicrobial activity, also exhibits the maximum affinity for LPS and lipid A in the ITC experiments. This trend is also followed by other peptides (Table II). From the temperature dependence of the change in enthalpies, negative changes in the heat capacities for the interactions of these peptides with the endotoxin are observed.Table IIThermodynamic parameters for the lipid A binding to peptides at 20 °CPeptidenK a × 10−5ΔH boΔSbΔG bom−1kJ mol−1KJ−1 mol−1kJ mol−110.8512.326.5207.234.220.929.724.2196.933.530.895.719.7179.232.840.953.814.8159.031.851.023.514.1155.931.660.950.879.5105.821.570.890.022.773.318.8 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig.5, when dansylated peptides are titrated with increasing concentrations of endotoxin, their fluorescence increases progressively with time. All the peptides associated and dissociated from lipid A in a monoexponential manner. Kinetically determined K a(K a=k1/k−1) values correlated well with those obtained by ITC (TableIII). The temperature dependence of the reaction shows that lipid A does not undergo any major phase variation in the temperature range used.Table IIIStopped flow kinetics of the interaction of lipid A with peptidesPeptidek 1 × 10−3k −1K a × 10−5m−1s−1s−1m−118.30.07111.826.30.0788.4035.10.0865.9343.20.0923.4753.10.0943.2961.20.1300.9270.20.7300.02 Open table in a new tab A typical sensorgram for the binding of the varying concentrations of peptide 2 to endotoxin containing monolayers is shown in Fig. 6. The occurrence of a rapid enhancement in the resonance units on the association of peptide 2 to the lipid monolayer with time reflects the accompanying changes in the mass during the reaction. The fit of the sensorgram gives the association and the dissociation rates for the interaction of lipid A with the peptide as 3.2 × 105m−1 s−1 and 0.092 s−1, respectively. The distributions of the residuals indicated that the time dependence of resonance units for both the association and the dissociation reactions is fitted satisfactorily to a monoexponential reaction. Peptides 1 and 2 have the highest affinity for lipid A (Table IV). The values ofK a for peptide-endotoxin interactions are lower in experiments in which the peptides were covalently linked to the CM-5 dextran surface and endotoxin was perfused over them.Table IVKinetic parameters of binding of lipid A to peptides at 20 °C (SPR analysis)Peptidek 1 × 10−3k −1K a × 10−5m−1s−1s−1m−118.9 (53)0.078 (0.071)11.4 (7.4)26.6 (3.1)0.081 (0.078)8.1 (3.8)35.3 (2.7)0.086 (0.081)6.1 (3.1)43.3 (1.1)0.091 (0.089)3.62 (1.2)53.1 (0.9)0.092 (0.089)3.3 (0.97)61.4 (0.7)0.125 (0.91)1.1 (0.76)70.2 (0.01)0.70 (0.81)0.02 (0.012)Values in parentheses indicate kinetic parameters obtained in experiments wherein the peptides were immobilized and endotoxin was perfused over them at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Open table in a new tab Values in parentheses indicate kinetic parameters obtained in experiments wherein the peptides were immobilized and endotoxin was perfused over them at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. A number of peptides recently have been identified and characterized in terms of their antibacterial activity and structure. In many cases minor variations in their amino acid composition or sequence have been found to either increase or abrogate their activities. In this study we have incorporated changes in their amino acid sequence at defined positions to probe the role of amphiphilicity, helicity, and hydrophobicity for LPS/lipid A binding with the aim of rationalizing their antibacterial activity. ITC experiments show that the binding of these antibacterial peptides with endotoxin is entropically driven, indicating the dominance of hydrophobic interaction for these reactions. Negative values of ΔCp attest further to the primacy of hydrophobic forces in the overall stabilization of the endotoxin-peptide complex. The role of hydrophobic forces in the above is supported also by the examination of their amphipathic helical propensity wherein an excellent correlation between their hydrophobicities with their thermodynamic parameters is observedi.e. peptides with poor hydrophobicities yield diminished ΔH and ΔCp values. The thermodynamics of the association reaction of these peptides with lipid A show that the changes in enthalpy and entropy are compensatory in nature. The compensatory effect is often exhibited by many protein-ligand interactions wherein the experimental conditions are fixed and the structure of the ligand is varied. The observation of enthalpy entropy compensation suggests that all these peptides recognize lipid A in a similar manner. Stopped-flow fluorescence studies show that dansylated peptides bind to lipid A and dissociate from the latter in a monophasic manner. Thus the overall pathway for the reaction of these peptides with endotoxin is best described byP+Lk1⇔k−1PLfEquation 5 where P is the peptide, L is lipid A, andPL f is the final peptide lipid A complex. Thermodynamic parameters determined kinetically are in agreement with those obtained by ITC experiments. Hence the occurrence of any additional step(s) that we are not observing but which contribute significantly to the overall energetics of the system can be ruled out, viz the kinetic data span the reaction in its entirety. Surface plasmon resonance experiments are invaluable for dissecting out the kinetics and mechanism involved in biologically relevant ligand-macromolecule interactions. The experiments in which peptides are immobilized and lipid A is perfused over them show a slightly diminished association and faster dissociation kinetics leading to slightly lower values of K a as compared with experiments in which lipid A is immobilized and peptides are perfused over it. This could be related to the differential accessibility of peptide segments upon immobilization, viz the peptide may adopt a slightly different and restricted conformational state leading to diminished lipid A binding activity. These restrictions are not apparently imposed when the peptides are injected over the tethered liposomes or monolayers that contain lipid A. The studies also indicate that there are no changes in the affinity of these peptides to LPS/lipid A bearing liposomes or monolayers, indicating that the peptides appear to recognize endotoxin in a similar fashion despite a difference in the mode of their presentation, i.e. as monolayers or bilayers. Recently we have shown that PMB recognizes LPS in a biphasic manner and also that PMB is able to specifically “take off” lipid A from both liposomes and monolayers (33Thomas C.J. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). None of the peptides tested in the study have this important property of PMB (33Thomas C.J. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29624-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Imparting them with this property of PMB should help in improving their efficacy. The circular dichroism studies show that the peptides adopt a helical structure in the presence of lipid A containing liposomes as well as in the presence of helix promoters such as SDS and trifluoroethanol (Fig. 3). Many biologically active antibacterial peptides such as andropins, cecropins, sarcotoxin, etc. adopt a helical structure with clear amphiphilicity in the presence of membranes (21Boman H.G. Agerberth B. Boman A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chen H.M. Wang W. Smith D. Chan S.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1336: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Christensen B. Fink J. Merrifield R.B. Mauzerall D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The helical conformations of these peptides allow them to disrupt the membrane structure in general by channel formation, which in turn disrupts proton motive force as well as induces the leakage of cell components, leading to cell death. All peptides used in the study have been designed in a manner such that in a helical conformation one face of the helix is entirely made of charged residues, whereas the opposite face is made up of hydrophobic residues. The reference peptide (peptide 3) exhibits this property and hence displays very good antimicrobial activity (Table I). This peptide also has a high affinity to lipid A. Peptide 1, in which a leucine at the 14th position of peptide 3 (the reference peptide) is changed to a threonine residue, shows even higher bioactivity and affinity for lipid A in comparison. Inspection of the helical wheel diagram (Fig. 7) shows that hydrophilic patch is extended by this substitution while retaining substantial hydrophobicity, which perhaps explains its higher affinity for the endotoxin. Peptide 2, which has two changes (N4K and N22K) introduced into the reference peptide (peptide 3), shows higher activity than the latter. However, its activity is compromised when compared with peptide 1. Thus the replacement of Asn by a more polar Lys increases the activity of the peptide by almost 2-fold. Peptide 7, which incorporates a change of lysine to a proline at position 4, shows the lowest affinity to endotoxin as well as the least antimicrobial activity. Proline substitution compromises the activity by disrupting the contiguous array of positive charges in the peptide. These observations suggest the significance of ionic forces in the LPS recognition by this family of linear peptides. The second set of peptides has changes that incorporate breaks in the contiguity of the hydrophobic patch that do not seem to affect dramatically the binding affinities, e.g. peptide 4, which has the change L13T, has diminished antimicrobial activity in comparison with the reference peptide (peptide 3), but the lipid A affinities are still comparable. Likewise, peptide 5, in which the hydrophobic patch is disrupted at two residues by the changes L10T and L13T, shows nearly similar affinities for lipid A as those of the L13T peptide. Peptide 6, which has the highest number of disruptions (L9T, L10T, and L13T) in the hydrophobic patch, shows only slightly lowered affinity for lipid A when compared with peptides 4 and 5. Thus these peptides can tolerate breaks in the continuity of the hydrophobic patch and still retain lipid A binding property but exhibit dramatic loss in their activities when their polar face is tampered with. We have demonstrated that peptides derived from the antisense strand of the magainin gene exhibit high affinity toward LPS and lipid A. Peptides 1 and 2 have affinities for LPS and lipid A that approach that of PMB. The biochemical assays show that these peptides enforce their antimicrobial activity by disrupting both the inner and the outer membranes of the pathogenic organisms. The biophysical characterization of the interactions stresses the vital role of the ionic charges in the initial binding and the role of the hydrophobic forces in membrane disruption activity. Peptides possessing the ability to bind to LPS have always been alluring targets as potential leads for combating bacterial infections because of their lower antigenicity and better pharmacokinetics as compared with large proteins of similar or better efficacy. The results of these studies provide us with grounds to believe that the optimized distribution of positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids based on an amphiphilic helical motif can help us in realizing such goals."
https://openalex.org/W2167934763,"The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a specialized chaperone for members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, which also binds heparin. Previous studies have identified a triplicate repeat sequence within RAP that appears to exhibit differential functions. Here we generated a series of truncated and site-directed RAP mutants in order to define the sites within RAP that are important for interacting with heparin and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). We found that high affinity binding of RAP to heparin is mediated by the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP, whereas both the carboxyl-terminal repeat and a combination of amino and central repeats exhibit high affinity binding to LRP. Several motifs were found to mediate the binding of RAP to heparin, and each contained a cluster of basic amino acids; among them, an intact R282VSR285SR287EK289motif is required for high affinity binding of RAP to heparin, whereas two other motifs, R203LR205R206 and R314ISR317AR319, also contribute to this interaction. We also found that intact motifs of both R203LR205R206 and R282VSR285SR287EK289are required for high affinity binding of RAP to LRP, with the third motif, R314ISR317AR319, contributing little to RAP-LRP interaction. We conclude that electrostatic interactions likely contribute significantly in the binding of RAP to both heparin and LRP and that high affinity interaction with both heparin and LRP appears to require mostly overlapping sequence motifs within RAP.

Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 2Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two unique features differentiate RAP from other general ER chaperones. First, whereas most other ER chaperones function primarily in substrate folding, RAP functions both in receptor folding (3Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Second, RAP is a specialized chaperone that functions primarily with members of the LDL receptor gene family, whereas other ER chaperones interact with a variety of structurally and functionally divergent proteins that are synthesized and folded in the ER. Although the chaperone function of RAP was defined primarily with the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) (3Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L.

A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), evidence accumulated to date suggests that RAP is likely to function as a chaperone for other members of the LDL receptor gene family (8Biemesderfer D. Dekan G. Aronson P.S. Farquhar M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F1011-F1020PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sato A. Shimada Y. Herz J. Yamamoto T. Jingami H. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25877-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The function of RAP during folding may be primarily to inhibit indiscriminate disulfide bond formation, in particular inter-molecularly between different LRP molecules during and after their translation (3Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The function of RAP during the trafficking of receptors within the early secretory pathway is to prevent premature ligand interaction with the receptors (2Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 6Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This function of RAP is consistent with the fact that RAP universally antagonizes ligand interaction with all members of the LDL receptor gene family. In this respect, it resembles the function of the invariant chain in regulating the peptide binding activity of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules within the secretory pathway (11Sant A.J. Miller J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Largely because of its ability to inhibit the binding of ligands, recombinant RAP has been used extensively in the study of the biological properties and functions of members of the LDL receptor gene family (2Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Several groups of investigators have studied the structure of RAP. In those works, the primary structure of RAP has been shown to comprise of a sequence of about 100 amino acids, repeated three times (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3404-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Ellgaard L.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The boundaries of these repeats have been similarly offered as either 1–100, 101–200, and 201–323 (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol.

Thogersen H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), based upon sequence alignment and biophysical characterization. Although the three repeats of RAP share a high degree of homology to each other (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L. Nielsen P.R. Etzerodt M. Gliemann J. Thogersen H.C. Eur. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), they appear to exhibit differential functions. For example, repeat 1, but not repeat 3, can inhibit interaction of activated α2-macroglobulin to LRP, whereas repeat 3, but not repeat 1, can promote proper folding of LRP (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of full-length RAP has not yet been solved, but the solution structure of the first repeat has revealed that portion of the structure to consist of three helices that are oriented in an anti-parallel bundle (15Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is highly likely that these three helices in repeat 1 are complemented by a fourth helix in the structure of full-length RAP. This proposition was supported by denaturation studies which showed that repeat 1 apparently interacts with some other portion of the RAP structure, and we suggested that a putative helical segment in repeat 2 (residues 134–159) was a possible candidate for completing the four-helix bundle (16Rall Jr., S.C. Ye P. Bu G. Wardell M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24152-24157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The notion of interaction between repeats 1 and 2 is now also supported by functional data, as we report in this manuscript. Previous studies find that RAP is a heparin-binding protein (17Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Orlando R.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15172-15178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the biological significance of this interaction is presently unknown. The carboxyl-terminal region of RAP has been implicated in heparin binding (17Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but the exact motif(s) that are important for designating high affinity for heparin are unknown. It is additionally not clear whether such heparin binding motifs are also those in RAP that mediate its binding to LRP. In this study we have generated multiple RAP constructs coding for RAP peptides of different lengths from throughout its structure as well as site-directed mutants of full-length RAP. We utilized these RAP mutants to investigate the interaction of each with both heparin and LRP in order to study whether these two functions utilize overlapping or distinct sequences within RAP. We identified three basic amino acid sequence motifs within repeat 3 of RAP that contribute both high affinity binding to RAP and high affinity binding to LRP. Human recombinant apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) was kindly provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber (The Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease). Heparin-Sepharose was prepared by coupling porcine intestinal mucosal heparin (Grampian Enzymes, Arthrath, UK) to Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been activated with cyanogen bromide as previously described (20Menzel H.J. Kladetzky R.G. Assmann G. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 310-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human antithrombin (at3) was isolated from fresh frozen plasma using heparin-Sepharose as previously described (21McKay E.J. Thromb. Res. 1981; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Glutathione-agarose beads were from Sigma. Rainbow molecular size markers were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were reagent grade from Sigma. A column containing 1 ml of heparin-Sepharose was prepared and attached to an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The resin was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then 200 µg of tested protein in the same buffer was loaded, and the column was washed for 10 column volumes. Bound protein was eluted in the same buffer using a linear gradient of up to 1 m NaCl over 20 column volumes. The column was then washed with 2 m NaCl and equilibrated again in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, before the addition of the next sample. Each sample was analyzed at least three times, and standard deviations were calculated. The method for constructing GST/RAP fusion constructs has been described previously (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human RAP cDNA (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) was used as the template for polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products representing each construct (see Fig. 2) were subcloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs generated by polymerase chain reaction were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of GST/RAP constructs was performed essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and as described previously (17Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except with the addition of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture in the lysis buffer. All the purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, before performing experiments and/or storage. For some experiments, RAP was released from the GST/RAP fusion protein by thrombin cleavage, after which it was re-purified using heparin-Sepharose. MEF-7 cells were derived from RAP knockout mouse embryos (6Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated the day before the experiments and were ∼80% confluent at the time of labeling. Metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine was performed essentially as described previously (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first depleted of cysteine by using cysteine-free medium and then labeled with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed with PBS with 1 mm CaCl2and 0.5 mm MgCl2 containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture. After pre-clearing with protein A-agarose, cell lysates were divided into equal parts and incubated separately with 50 nm GST or 50 nm each of the GST/RAP constructs at 4 °C for 16 h. Glutathione-agarose resin was then added to each tube to bind GST/RAP·LRP complexes. The agarose beads were then washed and pelleted, and the attached LRP was analyzed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5% polyacrylamide) under reducing conditions. The radiolabeled LRP band intensity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Previous studies implicate binding of RAP to heparin (17Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3161-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, its affinity to heparin relative to other heparin-binding proteins was unknown. Thus, we compared purified RAP to apoE3 and at3 for its binding to heparin-Sepharose. As seen in Fig.1, RAP was eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column at a salt concentration of 0.55 m, whereas human apoE3 and at3 were eluted at salt concentrations of 0.67 and 0.85 m, respectively. The affinity of apoE3 and at3 to heparin agrees well with those described in previous studies (21McKay E.J. Thromb. Res. 1981; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,23Shelburne F.A. Quarfordt S.H. J. Clin.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, RAP exhibits a high affinity binding to heparin comparable with that of apoE3. To identify the region(s) within RAP that is important for heparin and LRP binding, we generated various GST/RAP constructs (Fig.2). The design of these truncated RAP constructs was influenced by previous structural and functional studies (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, the GST/RAP-1 fusion contains full-length human RAP. GST/RAP-2 contains RAP that lacks the last four amino acids, HNEL, the sequence in RAP that functions as an ER retention signal (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 27Bu G.J. Rennke S. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST/RAP-3 contains a truncated RAP with all of repeats 1 and 2 and only the amino-terminal half of repeat 3. GST/RAP-4, GST/RAP-5, and GST/RAP-6 contain RAP sequences representing the first, second, and third repeats of RAP, respectively, with slightly overlapping regions (5Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). GST/RAP-7 contains RAP in which a classical ER retention signal, KDEL, has replaced the native HNEL sequence. GST/RAP-8 contains that portion from within repeat 1 of RAP that was seen to form a three-helical bundle in a solution structure (15Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and GST/RAP-9 and GST/RAP-10 contain RAP residues representing the first two and the last two helices seen in the solution structure (15Nielsen P.R. Ellgaard L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Poulsen F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7521-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of repeat 1, respectively. GST/RAP-11 and GST/RAP-12 are two constructs containing RAP sequences that partially cover repeat 2. GST/RAP-13, GST/RAP-14, GST/RAP-15, GST/RAP-16, GST/RAP-21, and GST/RAP-22 contain RAP sequences representing various portions of repeat 3. Finally, GST/RAP-17, GST/RAP-18, GST/RAP-19, and GST/RAP-20 contain RAP sequences that represent combined regions of repeats 1 and 2. All GST/RAP fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose resin. Fig. 3 A represents Coomassie Blue-stained gels showing the migration and purity of these proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As seen in the figure, all the purified fusion proteins, except for GST/RAP-6 and GST/RAP-15, are >90% pure and exhibit expected molecular sizes. GST/RAP-6 includes, in addition to the full-length fusion protein, an extra band of ∼27 kDa. This band is detected with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 3 B), but not anti-RAP antibody (data not shown), and likely represents a degradation product of GST/RAP-6 containing mostly the GST portion of the fusion protein. GST/RAP-15 shows doublet bands, both of which react with anti-GST and anti-RAP antibodies (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the lower band is likely a degradation product of the full-length fusion protein. The integrity of the purified GST/RAP fusion proteins was also determined by Western blot analyses using anti-GST antibody as shown in Fig.3 B and anti-RAP antibody (data not shown). We next examined the binding of each GST/RAP construct to heparin-Sepharose using fast protein liquid chromatography analysis. As shown in TableI (also Fig. 5 A), all but five GST/RAP constructs bind to heparin, although with various affinities. The full-length RAP fusion protein (GST/RAP-1) was eluted at a salt concentration of 0.55 m, the same as that of RAP alone (see Fig. 1), suggesting that the GST tag within the GST/RAP fusion protein neither contributes to nor interferes with RAP binding to heparin; neither did GST on its own bind to the heparin-Sepharose column under the chromatographic conditions used in these studies (data not shown). Other GST/RAP constructs that exhibit high affinity binding to heparin include GST/RAP-2, GST/RAP-6, GST/RAP-7, and GST/RAP-13. Relative to GST/RAP-13, significant loss of heparin affinity was seen in GST/RAP-14, GST/RAP-16, GST/RAP-21, and GST/RAP-22, suggesting that residues 311–319 in RAP are required for high affinity binding to heparin. It is important to note that although high affinity binding of RAP to heparin requires this sequence, it alone is not sufficient to constitute a high affinity heparin-binding site. This is demonstrated by GST/RAP-15, a fusion containing a shorter RAP sequence than GST/RAP-13 but also with the 311–319 sequence and yet a lower affinity binding to heparin (0.37 m). The difference between GST/RAP-13, with high heparin affinity, and GST/RAP-15, with lower affinity, is residues 221–275, which themselves did not bind heparin (see GST/RAP-14). When an additional 15 residues was added to GST/RAP-14, however, giving GST/RAP-16 (residues 221–290), low affinity binding to heparin was seen, implicating the basic sequence R282VSR285SR287EK289 as contributing to the high affinity binding of GST/RAP-13. Thus, it appears that high affinity binding of RAP to heparin requires residues 310–319 as well as the more minor heparin-binding site located between residues 280 and 290. The ER retention signal (HNEL, residues 320–323) at the extreme carboxyl terminus is not required for high affinity heparin binding since neither deletion (GST/RAP-2) nor replacement of this signal with the classical ER retention signal KDEL (GST/RAP-7) altered the high affinity binding of RAP to heparin. Examination of the binding patterns of all GST/RAP constructs to heparin allowed us to identify several other low affinity heparin-binding sites, each of which contains at least three basic amino acid residues. These sites along with the site within RAP required for high affinity binding to heparin are listed in TableII.Table IAffinity of GST/RAP constructs to heparin-SepharoseGST/RAP constructsAffinity to heparin-sepharose(M[NaCl] ± S.D.)mGST/RAP-10.55 ± 0.007GST/RAP-20.59 ± 0.010GST/RAP-30.39 ± 0.002GST/RAP-40.32 ± 0.002GST/RAP-50.27 ± 0.005GST/RAP-60.54 ± 0.005GST/RAP-70.56 ± 0.002GST/RAP-80GST/RAP-90GST/RAP-100GST/RAP-110.33 ± 0.006GST/RAP-120GST/RAP-130.54 ± 0.010GST/RAP-140GST/RAP-150.37 ± 0.003GST/RAP-160.24 ± 0.005GST/RAP-170.21 ± 0.003GST/RAP-180.29 ± 0.002GST/RAP-190.30 ± 0.005GST/RAP-200.39 ± 0.005GST/RAP-210.28 ± 0.002GST/RAP-220.32 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab Table IIPutative heparin and LRP binding sites within RAP, their distributions, and contributions to bindingBasic sequence clusterPutative structureHeparin bindingPutative heparin-binding siteLRP bindingR203LR205R206Loop+++A+++R282VSR285SR287EK289Helical (loop)++++B++++R314ISR317AR319Loop++C++K9PSPK13R14Loop++d++R116LEK119LWHK123AK125TSGK129Helical++e− Open table in a new tab Several studies indicate an involvement of electrostatic interactions between LRP and its ligands (28Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1089-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To examine whether such regions that are important for heparin binding also participate in LRP binding, we analyzed the binding affinity of each GST/RAP construct to native LRP obtained from the membranes of mouse MEF-7 cells (6Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For these studies, MEF-7 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h. The lysates were then divided into equal parts for incubation with either excess GST alone or various GST/RAP constructs. The potential GST/RAP·LRP complexes were then pelleted with glutathione beads to which the GST moiety of the RAP fusion protein bound, and the attached proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The use of cell lysates in these analyses avoided denaturation of LRP, which occurs in ligand-blotting assays using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Shown in Fig. 4 are the results of a representative experiment. As seen in the figure, GST/RAP-1, but not GST, brought down the 35S-labeled LRP, with both LRP subunits (LRP-515 kDa and LRP-85 kDa) detected. The other GST/RAP constructs were employed in the same assay and demonstrated a range of binding affinities to LRP. The band intensity from each interaction was quantified and plotted as a percentage of that of GST/RAP-1 (Fig.5 B). In this way we determined that the GST/RAP fusion proteins with high affinity binding to LRP included GST/RAP-1, GST/RAP-2, GST/RAP-6, GST/RAP-7, and GST/RAP-20. Comparison of these fusions with other GST/RAP fusions that exhibited either no or low affinity binding to LRP indicated that amino acid residues 201–210 of RAP were required for high affinity LRP-binding. We noted that although GST/RAP-3 (residues 1–250) contained all the sequence elements of GST/RAP-20 including residues 201–210 and was actually longer, it showed lower affinity to LRP. This is possibly due to the fact that the region important for high affinity LRP binding (residues 201–210) had a different conformation in GST/RAP-3 relative to GST-RAP-20 because GST-RAP-3 terminated halfway through a structural domain of RAP (16Rall Jr., S.C.

Finally, binding of RAP to LRP was slightly enhanced by either deletion of the ER retention signal (GST/RAP-2) or replacement of this signal with the classical ER retention signal KDEL (GST/RAP-7), suggesting that the native HNEL sequence may negatively influence the RAP-LRP interaction. To further analyze the relationship between the heparin and LRP binding motifs within RAP, we examined the effects of heparin on RAP binding to LRP. For this we examined the binding of GST/RAP-1, GST/RAP-6, and GST/RAP-20 to LRP in the same manner as that described for Fig. 4, except in the absence or presence of either excess heparin (100 µg/ml) or EDTA (10 mm). Shown in Fig.6 are the results of a representative experiment. As seen in the figure, EDTA inhibited the binding of each of the three GST/RAP fusion proteins to LRP, consistent with the fact that binding of RAP to LRP is Ca2+-dependent (5Bu G. Geuze H.J.

Here we demonstrate that localization of SHP-2 is regulated by cell density in a cell adhesion-dependent manner.

In all cases, the total protein level of SHP-2 was not changed. Fluorescent cell staining revealed that SHP-2 was co-localized with actin stress fibers to the cell peripheral at low cell densities but was diffused in the entire cytoplasm at high cell densities. Transient transfection of cells with truncated forms of SHP-2 demonstrated that the catalytic domain of the enzyme was responsible for the density-regulated distribution of SHP-2, but the catalytic activity was not required. An in vitro co-sedimentation study demonstrated direct binding of full-length and SH2 domain-truncated forms of SHP-2 to F-actin.

Furthermore, disruption of the SHP-2 gene in mice caused death of mouse embryos at mid-gestation (18Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggested a role of SHP-2 in cell adhesion and migration. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 blocked insulin growth factor-1-stimulated chemotaxis (19Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Zhao Z.J. Lacalle R.A. Martinez A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor-induced membrane edge ruffling and chemotaxis were suppressed in cells expressing the Tyr1009 to Phe mutant form of platelet-derived growth factor-receptor β, which lacks SHP-2 binding ability (20Qi J.H. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14455-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fibroblast cells derived from SHP-2-deficient mice exhibited impairment in cell migration and spreading and in integrin-induced activation of Src family tyrosine kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130cas(21Yu D.H.

Furthermore, upon integrin engagement, a fraction of SHP-2 moves to focal contacts where it binds to tyrosine phosphorylated SHPS-1, a transmembrane glycoprotein with characteristics of adhesion molecules (22Oh E.S. Gu H. Saxton T.M. Timms J.F. Hausdorff S. Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Pawson T. Neel B.G. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3205-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These data indicate an essential role of SHP-2 in integrin-mediated cell signaling. SHP-2 also plays an important role in the control of cell shape by contributing to cytoskeletal organization. It has been shown that overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of SHP-2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells or Rat-1 fibroblasts induced a marked change in cell morphology accompanied by substantial increases in the numbers of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion contacts (23Inagaki K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horikawa T. Fukunaga K. Tsuda M. Ichihashi M. Kasuga M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, expression of the same SHP-2 mutant markedly increased the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions and inhibited scattering of the cells (24Kodama A. Matozaki T. Fukuhara A. Kikyo M. Ichihashi M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2565-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, SHP-2 was found to be necessary for morphological transformation by v-Src because v-Src-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of podosomes were compromised in SHP-2-deficient cells (25Hakak Y. Hsu Y.S. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3164-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell density has major effects on cell activities including cell morphology, motility, and cytokinesis. In this study, we have investigated the effects of cell density on intracellular distribution of SHP-2. We found that cell density regulates localization of SHP-2. At low cell densities, SHP-2 was co-localized with F-actin. To our knowledge, this is the first example that a tyrosine phosphatase constitutes a part of actin stress fibers. Polyclonal anti-SHP-2 antibody (C-18) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and cytochalasin D were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ΔSHP-2 is an SH2 domain-truncated form of SHP-2 (amino acid residues 200–593), whereas ΔSHP-2M represents its catalytically inactive Cys to Ser mutant form. Both constructs were built with the pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen) as described (26Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Purified SHP-2 and ΔSHP-2 enzymes were obtained from recombinantEscherichia coli cells as described previously (27Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length SHP-2 was also expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. colicells by using the pGex-2T vector. The fusion protein designated GST-SHP-2 was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column. GST alone was purified following the same procedure and was used as a control. HeLa, HepG2, NIH-3T3, and HT-1080 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Confluent cells were trypsinized, washed with the culture medium, and replated in 10-cm plastic tissue culture plates at densities of 0.2–6 × 106 cells/plate. Transfection of HT-1080 cells with pRC/CMV-ΔSHP-2 and pRC/CMV-ΔSHP-2M was carried out by using the FuGENE6 cell transfection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To culture HeLa cells in suspension, Cytostir suspension culture flasks (Knotes) were used, and the cells were grown at 0.1–10 × 105/ml under constant stirring at 30 rpm. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed on ice in 0.5–1 ml of Buffer A containing 25 mmβ-glycerolphosphate (pH 7.3), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µm pepstatin A, and 1 µg/ml aprotinin. Unless indicated otherwise, lysis of attached cells was performed directly on the plates. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was referred to as the Triton X-100-soluble fractions. The pellets were washed once with Buffer A and then extracted with SDS gel sample buffer containing 1% SDS followed by boiling and was referred to as Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. For Western blotting, cell extracts (usually containing 10 µg of proteins) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and then with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection was made by employing a ECL Western blotting reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips (Becton Dickinson Labware) in complete cell culture medium. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min followed by further wash with PBS. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then blocked by 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) followed by 5% goat serum in PBS. For detection of actin filaments, namely, F-actin, the treated cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (5 µg/ml in PBS). For indirect immunofluorescent staining of SHP-2, the cells were incubated with 1:100 diluted anti-SHP-2 antibody for 2 h at room temperature and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and visualized by using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. Cell images were captured with a cooled CCD digital camera (Princeton Instruments, Inc.) and processed by using the Adobe Photoshop software. G-actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle following the procedure of Pardee and Spudich (28Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The purified G-actin showed a homogenous band on SDS gels. G-actin was diluted to 2 mg/ml in the depolymerization buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mmCaCl2. GST-SHP-2, GST, SHP-2, and ΔSHP-2 were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The solutions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to remove any possible precipitation, and the supernatants were used for binding assays. Equal volumes of G-actin and GST-SHP-2, GST, SHP-2, or ΔSHP-2 were mixed. Polymerization of actin was triggered by addition of 2 mKCl, 20 mm ATP, 1 m MgCl2, and 0.1m EGTA to final concentrations of 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA. The samples were incubated on ice for 2 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatants were removed and used to make SDS gel samples. The pellets were washed with the same polymerization buffer and centrifuged as above. The final pellets were dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer. GST and GST-SHP-2 were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-GST antibody, whereas SHP-2 and ΔSHP-2 were detected by using anti-SHP-2 antibody. As an important transducer of cell signaling, SHP-2 has a major implication in cell migration (3Feng G.S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Because cell migration is regulated by cell density, SHP-2 may play a role in density-dependent cellular processes. We plated four different cell lines, including HeLa, HepG2, NIH 3T3, and HT-1080 in plastic cell culture dishes at densities of 0.2–6 × 106/10-cm plate. After overnight culturing, cells were lysed on the plate with a buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100. The protein level of SHP-2 was determined by Western blotting with an anti-SHP-2 polyclonal antibody. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 1, cell density had a profound effect on the protein level of SHP-2 in the Triton X-100-soluble cell fraction with all the cell lines tested. At low cell densities, SHP-2 was hardly detected. As the cell density increased, a marked elevation of SHP-2 level was observed. As a control, the protein level of focal adhesion kinase FAK was not affected by the change in cell density (Fig. 1, middle panel). In fact, our recent studies showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK decreased as the cell density increased (29Xu F. Zhao Z.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We used HeLa cells to investigate further the effects of cell density on the SHP-2 protein level. The cells were plated at a low density and cultured for 6 days. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1, the level of SHP-2 was lower at day 1 but gradually increased as the cells approached confluency. We also investigated the change of SHP-2 level during a shorter time course (Fig. 1, bottom panel, right). Trypsinized HeLa cells were plated at low, medium, and high densities (0.2, 1, and 6 × 106/plate) and cultured cells for 3, 6, and 24 h. Before plating, the trypsinized suspension cells displayed a high level of soluble SHP-2. A near total depletion of soluble SHP-2 was seen after 3 h of plating at the low cell density (0.2 × 106/plate), and a slight gradual increase was observed by 24 h. When cells were plated at higher densities (1 and 6 × 106/plate), the level of soluble SHP-2 was constantly high. These data thus suggest that cell density modulated SHP-2 protein level in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. As noted above, the level of soluble SHP-2 in trypsinized suspension cells was high, and thus the decrease must be related to cell attachment to the plates. To further investigate the effects of cell adhesion on SHP-2 solubility, we cultured HeLa cells in suspension as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HeLa cells grew in suspension medium at a rate similar to that observed with adherent cell culture. Western blot analyses demonstrated a constantly high level of SHP-2 in HeLa cells cultured in suspension despite cell densities and the time the cells were cultured in suspension (Fig.2, upper panel). However, once the cells were transferred to cell culture plates and allowed to attach to the plates at a low density, the level of soluble SHP-2 decreased dramatically. As expected, when the attached cells approached confluence on the plates, the level of soluble SHP-2 was recovered. To further the study, we detached the cells plated at the low density (0.2 × 106/plate) by incubating them in PBS at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Interestingly, this caused a total recovery of SHP-2 in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2, lower panel). PBS treatment of the cells plated at higher densities exhibited no effects on SHP-2, which remained in the soluble fraction. These results indicate that the protein level of SHP-2 in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction is associated with both cell density and cell attachment. The protein level of SHP-2 in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction may not necessarily reflect the total protein level of SHP-2 in the cells. To clarify this, we extracted cells first with Buffer A and then re-extracted the pellets with the SDS sample buffer containing 1% SDS. As shown in Fig.3, a significant portion of SHP-2 was found in the Triton X-100-insoluble pellets when cells were grown at a low density. As the density increased, the SHP-2 level in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction increased, but that in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction displayed a concurrent decrease. As expected, when the cells were directly extracted with SDS gel sample buffer containing 1% SDS, the total level of SHP-2 showed no change at different cell densities. Similar results were obtained with HT-1080 cells (Fig. 3, bottom panel). In this case, a nonspecific band below SHP-2 served as an internal control to show a protein whose protein level was not affected by cell density. Taken together, the data suggest that cell density regulates cellular distribution of SHP-2. Cytoskeletal proteins constitute a major part of the Triton X-100-insoluble cell pellets. Partition of SHP-2 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction implies that it may be associated with cytoskeleton. To find the exact intracellular localization of SHP-2, we performed immunofluorescent cell staining with anti-SHP-2 antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 4. At low cell densities, SHP-2 was condensed at the periphery of cells with a fiber-like structure. At high densities, however, SHP-2 was diffused in the entire cytosol. We then co-stained the cells with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin that detects F-actin. In low density cells, F-actin staining essentially superimposed the SHP-2 staining, indicating that SHP-2 is co-localized with the actin stress fibers formed by F-actin. At high cell densities, SHP-2 was dissociated from the actin stress fibers. It should be noted that the distribution of the actin stress fibers at low cell densities was different from that at high cell densities. At low cell densities, actin stress fibers are distributed around the periphery of cells, whereas they were dispersed over the ventral surface in high-density cells. In addition, at lower density, the cells appeared larger because of extensive spreading. To further verify the co-localization of SHP-2 with F-actin, we treated cells with cytochalasin D to break actin stress fibers. As shown in Fig. 4, cytochalasin D caused total disruption of the fiber-like structure of SHP-2 together with the actin stress fibers. Interestingly, SHP-2 remained co-localized with F-actin with a punctuated pattern in the cytochalasin D-treated cells. To dissect which part of the SHP-2 molecule is responsible for the distribution of SHP-2 at low cell density and whether catalytic activity is required, we expressed an SH2 domain-truncated form of the enzyme and the correspondent catalytically inactive mutant. We chose HT-1080 cells for transient expression of the truncated enzymes. As shown in Fig. 5, both ΔSHP-2 and ΔSHP-2M displayed a density-regulated distribution pattern similar to that of the endogenous full-length SHP-2. These results suggest that neither the SH2 domains nor the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is required for the binding of SHP-2 to actin fibers. Therefore, the interaction may be independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Co-localization of SHP-2 with actin fiber suggests an interaction of SHP-2 with F-actin. The interaction can be direct or can be mediated by other proteins. To examine the possible direct interaction, we performed in vitro binding assays by using purified GST-SHP-2, SHP-2, and ΔSHP-2. GST was used as a control. The data shown in Fig.6 indicate co-sedimentation of SHP-2, SHP-2, and ΔSHP-2 with F-actin. As a negative control, no co-sedimentation of GST with F-actin was observed. These results suggest that SHP-2 directly bind F-actin and that the interaction is mediated by the catalytic domain. However, considering the relative amounts of actin and SHP-2 used in the binding assays and the fraction of SHP-2 co-sedimented with F-actin, the binding is far from stoichiometric. There might be other factors facilitating a stronger binding in vivo. In the present study, we have demonstrated that cell density regulates intracellular distribution of SHP-2 and that SHP-2 is co-localized with the entire actin stress fibers at low cell densities. To our knowledge, this is the first example that a tyrosine phosphatase is co-localized with F-actin fibers. By supporting the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in a number of cellular processes including cell shape, motility, chemotaxis, endocytosis, exocytosis, and cell division. Change in the rigidity of the cortical actin network constitutes an important process in the cellular response to receptor activation. Being a major component of the actin fibers when cells are at low densities and are poised to expand, SHP-2 must have a crucial role. Our data thus provided a novel mechanism by which SHP-2 regulates cell signaling and controls cell activities. The data also provided an explanation for the changes in morphology and cytoskeletal organization of cells with defective SHP-2 expression (23Inagaki K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horikawa T. Fukunaga K.

The actin network is regulated by a variety of actin-binding proteins. The important role of the small molecular weight GTPases of the Rho family has been well accepted (30Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 31Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Involvement of tyrosine kinases in cytoskeletal control has also been well documented. Src family members regulate actin assembly and cell shape by inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of a diversity of cytoskeletal-associated proteins including cortactin, talin, paxillin, p130cas, WASP, and FAK (32Cooper J. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 33Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). In particular, actin cross-linking activity of cortactin and its calpain-mediated proteolysis are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (34Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 35Huang C. Tandon N.N. Greco N.J. Ni Y. Wang T. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19248-19252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FAK is another major tyrosine kinase involved in cytoskeletal regulation (36Hanks S. Polte T. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). It regulates cell adhesion that mediates cell and extracellular matrix interactions. FAK phosphorylates p130cas and paxillin in response to integrin-mediated adhesion, and the phosphorylation is also regulated by Rho (37Flinn H. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar). The third major tyrosine kinase that regulates cytoskeletal organization is Abl (38Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Abl has a C-terminal actin binding motif, and it induces cytoskeletal abnormalities when expressed as an oncogenic BCR-Abl (38Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Salgia R. Li J.L. Ewaniuk D.S. Pear W. Pisick E. Burky S.A. Ernst T. Sattler M. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Clin.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17542-17550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As counterparts of tyrosine kinases, PTPs have also been implicated in cytoskeletal regulation. Treatment of cells with PTP inhibitors such as phenylarsine oxide and pervanadate resulted in profound changes in cell morphology and actin distribution (42Bennett P. Dixon R. Kellie S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar, 43Retta S.F. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Defilippi P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp.

Cell. 1997; 88: 39-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphatase activity was markedly increased when actin stress fibers were disassembled by cell detachment or by cytochalasin D, a drug known to rapidly disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. When PTP inhibitors such as vanadate and phenylarsine oxide are added in combination with cytochalasin D, focal adhesions and actin stress fibers are preserved from the cytochalasin D-mediated disruption (45Defilippi P.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PTPs play an important role in assembly of actin cytoskeleton. Many PTPs have been shown to be involved in cell adhesion and integrin signaling. These include SHP-2 (21Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14349-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, SHP-2−/− cells displayed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK accompanied by enhanced focal adhesions and impaired cell migration (21Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that FAK is hyper-phosphorylated on tyrosine at low cell density and is dephosphorylated at high cell density (29Xu F. Zhao Z.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cell density-regulated distribution of SHP-2 described in the current study may play a role in regulating the phosphorylation of FAK. Above all, co-localization of SHP-2 with entire actin stress fibers makes SHP-2 a unique player in regulating the actin network. Our study not only revealed co-localization of SHP-2 with actin stress fiber but also demonstrated that this is regulated by cell density. Cell density has a major role in regulation of cellular activities such as cell migration and proliferation. Translocation of SHP-2 is one way that the regulation is carried out. Regulation of PTPs by cell density has been extensively studied. It has been shown that PTP activity in the membrane fractions of contact-inhibited Swiss 3T3 cells was much higher compared with proliferating cells and that cells overcome density-dependent growth inhibition in the presence of vanadate, a nonspecific PTP inhibitor (59Pallen C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DEP-1, a receptor PTP, is dramatically induced when cells reach high densities (60Ostman A. Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). RPTPκ and RPTPµ, which are localized to cell-cell contacts, are also up-regulated by increasing cell density (61Gebbink M.F. Zondag G.C. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 62Fuchs M. Muller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Both enzymes can mediate homophilic interaction that results in accumulation of the enzymes at cell-cell contracts. In addition, RPTPκ is associated with β-catenin and γ-catenin/plakoglobin (62Fuchs M. Muller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16712-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas RPTPµ binds directly to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin and regulates its tyrosine phosphorylation (63Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 64Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This contact-induced clustering of RPTPs presumably causes dephosphorylation of intracellular substrates at cell-cell contact regions. Up-regulated by increase in cell density, all of these PTPs may play a negative role in cell proliferation. In contrast, as an intracellular enzyme, SHP-2 is unique by interacting with the entire actin stress fibers inside of the cells when cells are at low densities poised to proliferate. Association of SHP-2 with F-actin may regulate its enzymatic activity, thereby affecting cell growth. When cells reach a high density, SHP-2 becomes diffused in the cytosol where it stays at the inactive state as defined by the purified enzyme (27Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro binding of SHP-2 to F-actin suggests that co-localization of SHP-2 with actin stress fiber may be mediated by direct interaction of these proteins. Because the association is foundin vivo only when cells are at low densities, other proteins and factors may be involved. The presence of SHP-2 on the entire actin fiber suggests the general importance of the enzyme in regulating the actin network. The physiological substrates of SHP-2 are still to be defined. Some of the possible targets include c-Src, cortactin, and c-Abl, which are associated with actin fibers. In addition, actin itself may also be a target of SHP-2. In fact, actin is phosphorylated on tyrosine in Dictyostelium, and the phosphorylation is associated with changes of cell shapes (65Howard P.K. Sefton B.M. Firtel R.A. Science. 1993; 259: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTP1 inDictyostelium cells appears to control the phosphorylation (66Howard P.K. Sefton B.M. Firtel R.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of actin in mammalian cells has not been reported. This may be due to the transient nature of tyrosine phosphorylation that turns over rapidly. After all, protein tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation exist in a dynamic balance, and likewise, the cytoskeletal structure is under constant reorganization inside cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015542839,"Under normal conditions, tumor suppressor protein p53 exists in the cell in its latent form and is unable to function as a transcription factor. The allosteric model of p53 regulation postulates that the extreme portion of p53 carboxyl terminus (aa 364–393) binds to the core domain of the protein, thereby abrogating specific DNA binding in that region. In this study we propose an alternative mechanism of p53 functional regulation, which involves a separate molecule acting in trans to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity. Through the use of chimeric proteins of p53, p63γ and p73β, we show that the extreme COOH-terminal domain of p53 exerts a powerful and specific inhibitory effect on the p73- and p63-driven expression of a reporter gene. Moreover, fusion of p53 extreme COOH terminus to a completely unrelated transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 also results in significant inhibition of transactivation activity. Since p73, p63, or Gal4-VP16 cannot associate with any part of the p53 molecule, we conclude that p53(aa 364–393) represses transcriptional activity of chimeric proteins and p53 itself through the binding of external negative modulator(s) in that region and not by the allosteric mechanism of regulation. In accordance with the “distinct inhibitor” hypothesis, the activity of wild type p53 is substantially increased by overexpression of chimeric proteins bearing p53(aa 364–393), which might be due to the competitive removal of transcriptional inhibitor(s). Our findings provide the basis for the identification of such negative modulators of p53 transcriptional activity.

Our findings provide the basis for the identification of such negative modulators of p53 transcriptional activity. amino acid(s) polymerase chain reaction green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis TATA-binding protein The product of tumor suppressor gene p53 regulates a multitude of cellular processes, most notably inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to various forms of genotoxic stress such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and low intracellular concentration of ribonucleosides (1Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Functioning as a transcription factor, p53 activates the expression of a number of its downstream target molecules, including cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (WAF1, Cip-1), DNA repair protein GADD45, and a host of apoptotic mediators such as Bax, AIP, PIG, and others (for review, see Ref. 2Bates S. Vousden K.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Human p53 protein has been extensively characterized both structurally and functionally (3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6667) Google Scholar, 4Chen X. Ko L. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of p53 harbors the transactivation region (aa1 1–42) that interacts with basal transcriptional machinery in inducing various gene expression, but also contains binding sites for negative regulators of p53 transcriptional activity (Mdm2, E1B). The core domain of p53(aa 113–290) is critical to the p53 function as a transcription factor and encompasses residues involved in sequence-specific DNA binding. The DNA-binding domain is the single most frequent site of missense mutations in the p53 gene that contribute to the process of malignant transformation in the cell (5Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7397) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of the p53 protein contains the oligomerization domain (aa 319–364), which is essential for tetramer formation, as well as regulatory sequences in the extreme COOH-terminal end (aa 364–393). In the last few years, the extreme COOH-terminal end of p53(aa 364–393) has been the subject of intense scrutiny because of its role in the regulation of p53 functional activity. Under basal conditions, p53 exists in the cell at low levels and in its latent form. According to the current allosteric model of regulation, such latency is achieved through the association of extreme COOH-terminal region with the core domain of the protein, which effectively blocks sequence-specific DNA-binding sites and disables p53 as a transcription factor (6Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has been shown that deletion of aa 364–393, phosphorylation or acetylation of several residues in that region, as well as specific antibody binding, all dramatically induce p53 transactivation activity (7Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 9Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 21: 3167-3174Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the cell, the disassociation of the COOH terminus from the core domain and subsequent increase in the p53 transactivation activity is believed to be triggered by binding of single-strand DNA or DNA ends to the carboxyl terminus (10Zotchev S.B. Protopopova M. Selivanova G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4005-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The latter observation supports the notion that p53 functions as a sensor of DNA damage in the cell and is activated by the presence of DNA breaks. However, the experimental evidence that supports the allosteric model of p53 regulation can also be interpreted in favor of an alternative mechanism, including binding of transactivation inhibitors at the extreme COOH terminus of p53. In our laboratory we have constructed a number of chimeric proteins by systematically exchanging various domains between p53 and its close homologue p73β (11Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). During the course of screening such chimeric proteins for their ability to transactivate p53-responsive elements in a reporter gene, we have observed a dramatic inhibition of p73 functional activity, compared with wild type, when the extreme COOH-terminal portion of p73 was replaced with aa 364–393 of p53. Since previously published in vitro binding data demonstrate that wild type p53 and p73 do not physically interact (11Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Davison T.S. Vagner C. Kaghad M. Ayeda A. Caput D. Arrowsmith C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18709-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the current allosteric model of p53 regulation cannot explain the inhibitory effect conferred on p73 by aa 364–393 of p53. To gather further evidence to support our “distinct repressor” mechanism, we have created additional chimeric constructs and confirmed that the inhibitory effect of p53(aa 364–393) on other proteins is specific and not restricted to the p53 family members. In addition, we demonstrate here that p53 transcriptional activity could be significantly increased by overexpression of mutant chimeric proteins that contain p53(aa 364–393). These results support our hypothesis of possible transcriptional inhibitor(s) binding at the extreme COOH terminus of p53 and offer an alternative to the existing “allosteric” model of p53 regulation. cDNA clones of human p73β, p53, and p63γ have been described previously (11Gu J.

Fusion chimeras were generated using two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers that encoded 18-nucleotide regions of complimentarity between the sequences to be fused (11Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Single amino acid substitutions (R273H for p53 and R293H for p73) were introduced into the wild type and chimeric constructs using PCR as described by us (11Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out in PerkinElmer thermocycler using 1× Pfu PCR reaction buffer with MgSO4, 1× GC melt solution (to facilitate dissociation of double-stranded template DNA), 2.5 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol each of 5′ and 3′ primers, 1 unit ofPfu DNA polymerase, and 50 ng of template DNA. All constructs were cloned into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3.0 vector using BamHI and XbaI restriction sites and expressed in Escherichia coli following established procedures. The pcDNA3.0-Gal4 DNA-binding domain (aa 1–147), pcDNA- 3.0-VP16 activation domain (aa 413–491), and pGL3-G5SV plasmids were a kind gift of Dr. Y. Shi (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Gal4 DNA-binding domain and VP16 activation domain were PCR-amplified separately and subcloned into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3.0 resulting in Gal4-VP16 fusion construct. Fragments of p53(aa 364–393 and 291–319) were subsequently fused in frame to the COOH terminus of Gal4-VP16 using EcoRI and XbaI sites. Large scale plasmid DNA preparation was obtained using a Qiagen Maxi kit. Final plasmid yield and purity were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm and by restriction digest. Construct identities were further verified by DNA sequencing (Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, MA). p53−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, 293T cells, human small cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells, and human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 10% bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For luciferase assays, 1–2 × 105 H1299, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Saos-2, or 293T cells were plated onto 30-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to reach approximately 60% confluence by incubating overnight. Transient cell transfections were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (14Yuan Z.-M. Shioya H. Ishiko T. Sun X. Gu J. Huang Y.Y. Lu H. Kharbanda S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1999; 399: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with either PG13-Luc (Promega) (0.5 µg/plate) or with pGL3-G5SV (0.5 µg/plate) and with various chimeric constructs (1–3 µg of DNA/plate). For competition experiments, 50 ng of wild type p53 plasmid was used either alone or with 2 µg of mutant chimeric proteins. Empty vectors were used to standardize for total DNA amount. Additionally, pRL-TK vector (Promega) was included to provide a low level of Renillaluciferase expression and serve as transfection efficiency control. Luciferase activity was quantified 36 h post-transfection using the Dual Luciferase detection system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions and a Lumat9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Relative luciferase activity was determined as a ratio ofFirefly (PG13, pGL3-G5SV) to Renilla (pRL-TK) luciferase expression. All experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. To determine protein expression levels, H1299 or 293T cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes and transfected with 2–5 µg of either wild-type, chimeric, or mutant construct DNA and with green fluorescent protein (GFP) pEGFP-C1 plasmid (CLONTECH) (0.5 µg/plate) as a transfection efficiency control. Cell lysates were prepared 36 h, and proteins were analyzed using anti-FLAG (M5; Sigma), and anti-GFP (CLONTECH) antibodies. 293T cells were also transfected with FLAG-tagged mutant p53(R273H), p73β(R292H), and wild type Mdm2 (5 µg DNA/plate each), allowed to grow for an additional 24 h, and harvested for subsequent protein-protein interaction studies. GST constructs of p53 carboxyl (aa 319–393) and amino (aa 1–42) termini, as well as GST-p53(aa 364–393), have been generated previously in our laboratory according to the published protocols (11Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R. Yuan Z.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 293T cells transfected with FLAG-p53(R273H), FLAG-p73β(R293H), and pCMV-Mdm2 were harvested by scraping into cold phosphate-buffered saline, briefly centrifuged, and the cell pellet was lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were further diluted to 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with 15 µl of GST beads containing p53 COOH or NH2terminus for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and immunocomplexes were liberated from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were then electrophoresed through 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Membranes were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody solution and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nitrocellulose membranes were then stripped of antibodies and probed with anti-Mdm2 following a similar protocol. GST proteins were visualized using Ponceu S staining. It has been demonstrated that p63 and p73, two close structural homologues of p53, can transactivate p53-responsive promoters (13Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillet E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V.

Therefore, it seemed feasible for us to create chimeric constructs utilizing these proteins to test whether the inhibitory effect of the p53 COOH terminus (p53CT) is accomplished through the allosteric mode of regulation or through a “distinct repressor” mechanism. Should a separate repressor be involved in the p53 regulation, then p73- or p63-mediated transcriptional activity would be down-regulated by the introduction of p53CT. Otherwise, the allosteric model would hold true if the negative regulatory effect of p53CT were not transferable to either p73 or p63. To discern between the two models of p53 functional regulation, a series of chimeric constructs of p73/p53 or p63/53 were generated, and their transcriptional activity was assessed in the p53-null cells. We utilized chimeric proteins of p53 and its homologues in our studies because, in contrast to deletion mutants, they most likely maintain three-dimensional conformations similar to those of wild type proteins. In addition to several chimeric constructs of p53 and p73 that had been generated previously by us (Fig.1A), the following chimeras were created during the course of this study: fusion of p73(aa 1–391) and p53(aa 291–319) and fusion of p63(aa 1–397) and p53(aa 364–393) (Fig. 4A). To confirm that the inhibitory effect of the p53 extreme COOH terminus is not exclusive to the p53 family members, sequences of p53(aa 364–393 and aa 291–319) were also fused to a completely unrelated transcriptional activator Gal4-VP16 (Fig.5A).Figure 4A, additional chimeric constructs of p53, p73, and p63. In the course of this study several additional constructs were generated using techniques described under “Experimental Procedures”: unrelated to the COOH terminus sequence of p53(aa 291–319) was fused to p73(aa 1–391), and the extreme COOH terminus of p53(aa 364–393) was fused to p63(aa 1–397). B, Western blot analysis of chimeric proteins. Chimeric construct cDNAs (3 µg each), along with pEGFP-C1 (0.5 µg), were transfected into H1299 cells, and cell lysates were probed with anti-FLAG and anti-GFP using Western blot. C, negative regulatory effect of p53(aa364–393) is specific. 1 µg of either wild type p73 or p73(53aa291–319) was co-transfected into H1299 cells with PG13-Luc and pRL-TK plasmids (0.5 and 0.05 µg/plate, respectively). Luciferase activity detection was conducted as described previously.D, inhibitory influence of p53 extreme COOH terminus is transferable to p63. Wild type p63, as well as p63(53aa 364–393) chimera (1 µg each), were transfected into H1299 cells and analyzed for their transcriptional activity using PG13-Luc reporter plasmid as described in C.

Mean ± S.D. from three separate experiments, each carried out in duplicate, is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The identity of chimeric proteins was confirmed by transfecting H1299 or 293T cells with 2–5 µg of purified plasmid DNA and conducting anti-FLAG Western blot of cell lysates. Abundant immunosignal was detected for all constructs, with molecular weights corresponding to the expected size of chimeric products (Figs. 1 B,3B, 4 B, and 5 B). Notably, while protein expression levels were comparable for all chimeras, they possessed different transcriptional activities. Transcriptional activity of p53-p73 chimeric proteins was assessed using luciferase reporter gene containing p53-responsive elements. 1 µg of each construct DNA and reporter plasmid (0.5 µg/plate) was co-transfected into p53-null H1299 cells. Analysis of the luciferase gene expression (Fig. 1 C) revealed that constructs containing p53-p73 oligomerization domain “swap” (constructs p53(73aa345–390) and p73(53aa319–364)) induced luciferase gene expression to the same degree as wild type p53 and p73β, respectively. On the contrary, a dramatic inhibition of luciferase activity was detected when either the entire COOH terminus of p53 or only its last 30 residues were fused to p73 (constructs p73(53aa319–393) and p73(53aa364–393)), defining the residues from 364 to 393 as the inhibitory domain. If the last 30 residues of p53 down-regulate its transcriptional activity, then substitution of this domain would relieve the inhibitory effect. Indeed, fusion of the corresponding portions of p73 into the p53 sequence (constructs p53(73aa345–499) and p53(73aa391–499)) was associated with the complete abrogation of functional repression when compared with wild type p53. Identical transcriptional activity profiles were also obtained in Saos-2 cells and p53 −/−mouse embryonic fibroblasts (data not shown), thereby eliminating the possibility of cell type-specific effects. To determine whether p53CT inhibited p73 transcriptional activity via the association with the p73 DNA-binding domain, as predicted by the allosteric model, we set out to study the ability of full-length p73 to bind p53CT in vitro. 293T cells were transfected with either vector alone, mutant p53 or p73 (mutant isoforms were used to ensure high level of protein expression), or with Mdm2, which served as positive control because of its well documented ability to bind to the p53 NH2 terminus. Following cell lysate incubation with GST fusion proteins of p53 carboxyl (GST-p53CT) or amino (GST-p53NT) termini and thorough washing to minimize nonspecific binding, proteins were released from glutathione beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and studied using anti-FLAG and anti-Mdm2. As expected, p53 readily associated with its carboxyl terminus that contained the oligomerization domain (Fig.2, lane 3). In contrast, GST-p53NT, which formed a complex with Mdm2 (Fig. 2, lane 11), did not exhibit any detectable interaction with p53 (Fig. 2,lane 4), demonstrating the specificity of our binding assay. Under the same conditions, neither GST-p53CT nor GST-p53NT displayed any apparent binding to p73 (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and8). Taken together, these results indicate that p53CT, when fused into the corresponding region of p73, potently inhibits the transcriptional activity of p73 in the absence of any physical association with the p73 molecule, an observation that is inconsistent with the allosteric model of regulation by p53CT. In light of the results reported above, we hypothesized that a distinct inhibitory molecule might be negatively modulating the transcriptional activity of chimeric proteins and p53 itself via binding at the extreme COOH terminus. If such an inhibitory molecule exists, then chimeric proteins that contain the extreme COOH-terminal p53 sequence could compete with wild type p53 for inhibitor binding and thus allow p53 to function at its full transactivation potential. To test this hypothesis, we expressed wild type p53 in H1299 cells in combination with PG13 luciferase reporter and chimeric proteins that harbored both the p53(aa 364–393) sequence and an appropriate point mutation in their DNA-binding domain (Fig.3 A). We intentionally utilized chimeric proteins as a delivery vehicle for the extreme carboxyl terminus of p53, since overexpression of short COOH-terminal peptides alone results in their diffused subcellular distribution due to the lack of nuclear localization sequence. 2Z.-M. Yuan, unpublished observations. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of mutant constructs revealed their complete functional incompetence due to their inability to bind DNA. As expected, both mutant p53 and mutant p73(53aa319–393) completely abolished p53 activity through oligomerization with the wild type protein. In sharp contrast, co-expression of mutant p73(53aa364–393) chimera resulted in the increase of p53-driven luciferase expression by more than 3-fold. A similar “de-repression” effect on p53 was observed when mutant p53(73aa345–390) was used (Fig. 3 C). Both of these chimeric proteins were unable to form tetramers with wild type p53 because of their p73 oligodomains and contained last 30 amino acids of p53. These data indicate that p53 can be functionally activated by the introduction of the exogenous COOH-terminal domain as part of chimeric proteins. The above results lend further support to our model of p53 functional regulation by a distinct molecule bound at the p53 COOH terminus. Our findings strongly implicated the last 30 residues of p53 in the inhibition of p73-mediated transactivation through a mechanism distinct from the allosteric model. However it is also possible that the inhibitory effect rendered by the p53CT was due to an alteration of the p73 conformation caused by the domain swap rather than the inhibitory nature of the p53CT. To test this possibility, an additional chimera, as shown in Fig.4 A, was created to determine whether the inhibitory effect of the p53CT was indeed specific. Fusion of the p53 sequence from outside of the COOH terminus (53aa291–319) to truncated p73(aa 1–391) had no inhibitory effect on the luciferase gene expression in H1299 cells (Fig. 4 C). To demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of p53CT is not restricted to p53 or p73 only, we introduced this sequence into p63γ, another structural homologue of p53 (Fig. 4 A). Transcriptional activity of the p63(53aa364–393) chimeric protein in H1299 cells was reduced by approximately 70% compared with wild type p63 (Fig.4 D). In addition, we fused p53(aa 364–393), as well as the p53 sequence from outside the COOH terminus (aa 291–319), to Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 5 A). The luciferase reporter that contained five Gal4-binding sites upstream of the SV40 promoter (pGL3-G5SV) was used to record transcriptional activity of these constructs in 293T cells. Gal4-VP16(53aa364–393) fusion had significantly lower transcriptional activity than either Gal4-VP16 alone or Gal4-VP16(53aa291–319) (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed in H1299 cells. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that the last 30 amino acid residues of p53, in addition to repressing p53 functional activity, also potently and specifically inhibit p63, p73, and Gal4-VP16 transcriptional activity. Induction of p53 often determines cellular fate and is therefore subject to complex and strict control through several pathways. p53 protein stability, for example, is tightly regulated via p53-Mdm2 autoregulatory negative feedback loop, where Mdm-2 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and targets p53 for rapid proteosomal degradation (16Kubbutat M.G.H. Vousden K. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 6: 250-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Restriction of p53 functional activity is yet another mechanism of controlling illicit p53 signaling. The currently used allosteric model of p53 functional regulation stipulates that the extreme COOH-terminal region of p53(aa 364–393) is able to associate with the core domain of the protein, thereby blocking sequence-specific DNA binding sites and preventing p53 from exerting its transactivation effects (6Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide first experimental evidence to support an alternative model of p53 functional latency, which might be preserved by binding of a distinct inhibitory factor at the extreme carboxyl terminus of p53. Using chimeric constructs of p53 and either p63, p73, or Gal4-VP16, we demonstrate that the extreme COOH terminus of p53(aa 364–393) potently and specifically inhibits p73, p63, and Gal4-VP16 transcriptional activity. Since our own in vitro protein binding data presented herein, as well as published reports of other investigators (12Davison T.S. Vagner C. Kaghad M. Ayeda A. Caput D. Arrowsmith C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18709-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), show that wild type p53 does not associate with p63, p73, or Gal4-VP16, allosteric model of regulation cannot explain the inhibitory effect of the p53 extreme COOH terminus. Therefore, it is plausible that a separate negative modulator, which is yet to be identified, could bind at the extreme COOH terminus of p53 and repress the transcriptional activity of chimeric proteins and, more importantly, preserve the latent status of endogenous p53 in the cell. It was suggested that one mechanism by which p53CT can down-regulate transcription is through its association with basal transcriptional machinery. For instance, suppression of Gal4 DNA-binding domain basal transcriptional activity by the COOH terminus of p53 has been reported previously by Horikoshi et al. (17Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), a finding that is consistent with our observations. Such inhibitory effect of p53CT was proposed to be due to its sequestration of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), which in turn supposedly leads to the disruption of transcription initiation complex. However, subsequent findings by Farmer et al. (18Farmer G. Friedlander P. Colgan J. Manley J.K. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of TBP in the same experimental context fails to alleviate p53-mediated transcriptional repression. Therefore, there might be an alternative mechanism of transcriptional repression by p53CT. Results of our competition experiments support this notion and further exclude p53CT association with TBP as a single mode of transcriptional inhibition. Overexpression of p53(aa 364–393) as part of chimeric proteins along with wild type p53 results in the significant up-regulation of p53 transcriptional activity, contrary to the expected inhibition if only TBP were involved (presumably, overexpressed p53CT would bind TBP and abrogate transcription). We suggest that an increase in the p53-driven transcription in the presence of chimeric constructs bearing p53(aa 364–393) could be explained by the competitive withdrawal of putative inhibitor(s) of p53 functional activity. The de-repression effect of p53CT-containing chimeras that we observed is similar to that previously described for p53 short COOH-terminal peptides. When microinjected into the nucleus, these peptides can dramatically increase p53 DNA binding and functional activity (19Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Okan I. Fritsche M. Strom M. Groner B. Grafstrom R.C. Wiman K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Selivanova G. Ryabchenko L. Jansson E. Iotsova V. Wiman K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Selivanovaet al. (20Selivanova G. Ryabchenko L. Jansson E. Iotsova V. Wiman K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) detected direct interactions of the p53 COOH-terminal peptide with the DNA-binding domain of the proteinin vitro, while others reported similar binding of COOH-terminal peptides to the full-length p53 (21Muller-Tiemann B.F. Halazonetis T.D. Elting J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was argued that activation of p53 by the peptide is accomplished through competitive displacement of the native COOH terminus from the core domain and enhanced stability of the DNA-peptide-p53 complex. We, however, did not observe direct physical interactions of GST-p53(aa 364–393) with full-length p53 under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Moreover, it seems unlikely that in our competition experiments, large chimeric proteins bearing p53(aa 364–393) will bind to and remain associated with wild type p53, thus stabilizing p53-DNA complex, as proposed for COOH-terminal peptides. It seems more plausible that chimeras containing extreme carboxyl-terminal sequences of p53 will compete with full-length p53 for inhibitor binding thereby allowing de-repression of p53 functional activity. Certainly in the absence of conclusive crystallographic data on the full-length p53 and its correct conformational folding, we cannot completely rule out the allosteric model of regulation. However, our results clearly demonstrate that p53 extreme carboxyl terminus inhibits p73-, p63-, and Gal4-VP16-driven transcription, and none of these findings can be explained by the allosteric model due to the well documented lack of physical interactions between p53 and p63, p73, or Gal4-VP16. Our study therefore opens the possibility of identifying distinct molecule(s) responsible for preserving p53 transcriptional latency via binding at its extreme COOH terminus. Interference with the activation of latent p53 is believed to contribute to the process of malignant transformation in some human tumor cells (22Lutzker S.G. Levine A.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, further elucidation of mechanisms governing p53 repression and activation in the cell might prove useful in designing effective anti-cancer therapeutics. We thank Dr. Y.

The type 1 isoform of the bovine carrier known as ANT1, referred to as bAAC1 in this study, is predominantly expressed in heart mitochondria (8Powell S.J. Medd S.M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E.

Three isoforms of the yeast carrier (yAAC1, yAAC2, and yAAC3) are expressed in the mitochondria of S. cerevisiae depending on the environmental conditions (10Adrian G.S. McCammon M.T. Montgomery D.L.

Of these, yAAC2 is the major isoform responsible for growth with a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol or lactate (11Lawson J.E. Douglas M.G. J. Biol.

In addition, each of three homologous domains of the AAC of N. crassacontains information for mitochondrial targeting (21Endres M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recently, we succeeded in functionally expressing mammalian mitochondrial bAAC1 and human AAC1 (hAAC1) in the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Hatanaka T. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although bAAC1 and hAAC1 were expressed slightly in yeast mitochondrial membranes, their expression was significantly improved by replacement of their N-terminal regions, which extend into the cytosol, with the corresponding regions of the yeast carriers yAAC1 and yAAC2. The oxidative phosphorylation ability of the AAC-disrupted yeast strain WB-12, in which the intrinsic AAC genes are disrupted, was complemented well by the enhanced expression of chimeric bAAC1 and hAAC1. Furthermore, the transport activities of the bAAC1 chimeras were very similar to that of bAAC1 in bovine heart mitochondria, indicating that the bAAC1 chimeras functioned like native bAAC1 in bovine heart mitochondria. From these results, the N-terminal regions of yeast carriers are thought to be important for efficient expression of the AAC in the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane, but not for its transport function (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Hatanaka T. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As an extension of this study, we examined the effects of N-terminal regions of various lengths and amino acid sequences on the expression of derivatives of bAAC1 and yAAC2 in the yeast mitochondrial membrane. This study should be helpful for understanding the mechanism of expression of the AAC in the yeast mitochondrial membrane. The haploid strain of S. cerevisiae W303-1B (MATα ade2-1 leu2-3,112 his3-22,15 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100) (11Lawson J.E. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14812-14818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. S. Shimizu (Osaka University). The AAC-disrupted yeast strain of WB-12 (MATα ade2-1 trp1-1 ura3-1 can1-100 aac1::LEU2 aac2::HIS3) and the single-copy type yeast shuttle vector pRS314-YA2P containing TRP1 were prepared as described (22Hashimoto M.

Other materials and reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. DNA fragments corresponding to the open reading frames encoding bAAC1 and yAAC2 were prepared by PCR using amplimers (Table I, part A) as described (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T.

Open table in a new tab DNA fragments encoding the various derivatives of bAAC1 shown in Fig.1 A were prepared by replacement of a 42-base pairNdeI-NaeI fragment encoding the N-terminal segment of bAAC1 with DNAs encoding the corresponding segments of yAAC1 and yAAC2 and those encoding the artificial segments. DNAs encoding these N-terminal segments were prepared by PCR using the primers listed in Table I (part B). DNA encoding the tandem-repeated N-terminal region of yAAC1 was obtained by ligation of a DNA encoding the N-terminal region Met1–Gln10 of yAAC1 to the 5′-end of a DNA encoding the second N-terminal segment of yAAC1 through theNheI site. The creation of an NheI site resulted in substitution of Met1′ of the second repeat with Ala. The DNA fragments encoding yAAC2 derivatives shown in Fig.1 B were prepared similarly. For replacement of the N-terminal region of yAAC2, a restriction site of NaeI in a DNA encoding yAAC2 was created at the position corresponding to anNaeI site in a DNA of bAAC1 by PCR using the primers shown in Table I (part C). By ligation of NdeI-NaeI fragments encoding various N-terminal regions with the 5′ terminus of the prepared DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal region of yAAC2 through the created NaeI site, we prepared DNAs encoding derivatives of yAAC2. Of these derivatives, DNA fragments encoding Y2Δ/Y2 derivatives, the structures of which are shown in Fig.1 B, were prepared by PCR using the downstream primers shown in Table I (part B) and the upstream primer HT501. All the DNA fragments prepared were subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pRS314-YA2P for transformation of the AAC-disrupted yeast strain WB-12 (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown as described (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria were prepared as described (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Total proteins in yeast cells were obtained by alkaline lysis with NaOH/β-mercaptoethanol and subsequent precipitation with acetone as described (24Horvath A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The concentration of protein was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) in the presence of 1% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gel was performed following the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The amounts of various AACs were determined by Western blotting using antiserum against either a synthetic peptide of the bAAC1-specific sequence (His39–Ile60) or that of yAAC2 (Asn53–Lys75) as reported previously (4Hatanaka T. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The intensities of the immunostained bands were determined from the absorbance at 560 nm in a Shimadzu Chromato-scanner (Model CS-9000). Northern blotting was performed using a specific probe of theNaeI-BamHI fragment encoding either bAAC1 or yAAC2 as described previously (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Hatanaka T. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The band intensities of autoradiograms were measured with a Fuji BAS-1500 Mac bioimaging analyzer. In this study, we examined the effects of the length and sequence of the N-terminal region extending into the cytosol on the expression of bAAC1 and yAAC2 in yeast mitochondria. We prepared various derivatives of these AACs in which the N-terminal regions were replaced with peptides of various lengths and sequences derived essentially from those of bAAC1, yAAC1, and yAAC2 (Fig. 1). For simplicity, we abbreviated these AACs as B, Y1, and Y2, respectively, and their structural features are shown by their N-terminal region/trunk AAC. Namely, Y2/B represents a class of bAAC1 (B/B) derivatives with an N-terminal region derived from that of yAAC2. In addition, the sequence numbers of the N-terminal regions of the derivatives and those with a deletion (Δ) or reversion (R) are shown in parentheses. Namely, Y2-(1–17)Y1-(8–16)/B is a derivative of bAAC1, the N-terminal region of which contains sequence 1–17 of yAAC2 connected to sequence 8–16 of yAAC1; and Y2Δ(3–6)/B is a Y2/B derivative, the N-terminal region of which consists of sequences 1–2 and 7–26 of yAAC2, but is devoid of sequence 3–6. Y2R-(3–20)/Y2 is a yAAC2 (Y2/Y2) derivative in which sequence 3–20 of the N-terminal region of yAAC2 is reversed (Y2-(1,2,20–3,21–26)/Y2). The length of the N-terminal region is shown by the number of amino acid residues (n). Then values of bAAC1, yAAC1, and yAAC2 are 11, 16, and 26, respectively. The prepared expression vectors encoding these AAC derivatives were introduced into the AAC-disrupted yeast strain WB-12. These yeast transformants were grown, and the amounts of these AAC derivatives expressed in yeast mitochondrial membranes and their total amounts in the yeast cells were examined by Western blotting. Recently, we found that the slight expression of bAAC1 in the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane was significantly improved by replacement of its N-terminal region with the corresponding region of yAAC1 or yAAC2 (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The expression of the Y2-(1–26)/B chimera (n = 26) in the Y2/B class was greater than that of the Y1-(1–16)/B chimera (n = 16) in the Y1/B class (for their N-terminal sequences, see Fig. 1 A). These bAAC1 chimeras correspond to y2NbhAAC and y1NbhAAC, respectively, in our previous report (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of the remarkable expression of the bAAC1 chimeras in the yeast mitochondrial membrane, we examined the effect of the length of the N-terminal region of Y2-(1–26)/B on its expression in yeast mitochondria by deleting stepwise the amino acid residues in its N-terminal region. The sequences of the N-terminal regions of the Y2Δ/B derivatives are summarized in Fig. 1 A. For construction of DNAs encoding these derivatives, the first N-terminal residue was replaced with Met as a start codon for translation. Taking into consideration the fact that the Ser2 residues of mature bAAC1 and yAAC2 areN α-acetylated (8Powell S.J. Medd S.M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Fiore C. Trezeguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the second residue was substituted with Ser. We prepared DNA fragments encoding various Y2Δ/B derivatives and inserted them into the single-copy plasmid pRS314-YA2P with the promoter region of the yAAC2 gene. The expression vectors thus prepared were introduced into the yeast strain WB-12, in which the intrinsic yAAC1 and yAAC2 genes are disrupted (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 23Hatanaka T. Takemoto Y. Hashimoto M. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Terada H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2001; 24: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also prepared transformants of bAAC1, Y2-(1–26)/B and Y1-(1–16)/B. First, we examined the growth of these WB-12 transformants on plates containing 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 3% glycerol (YPGly) as a non-fermentable carbon source. As shown in Fig.2, the Y2-(1–26)/B and Y1-(1–16)/B transformants grew well in contrast to WB-12 and the transformant of bAAC1 (B-(1–11)/B), indicating that the oxidative phosphorylation ability of WB-12 was well complemented by introduction of these bAAC1 chimeras, but not by native bAAC1, as we observed previously (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The growth rates of the transformants of Y2Δ/B derivatives were determined to be less than those of the Y2-(1–26)/B transformants, with the growth rate depending on the length of the N-terminal region (n) (Fig. 2). The growth doubling times of the Y2Δ(3–17)/B, Y2Δ(3–11)/B, Y2Δ(3–6)/B, and Y2-(1–26)/B transformants in liquid YPGly medium were >50, 24, 15, and 8 h, respectively. The Y2Δ(3–22)/B transformant essentially did not grow like WB-12 and the bAAC1 transformant. In addition, the growth doubling time of Y1-(1–16)/B was ∼24 h. To determine the amounts of these derivatives expressed in yeast mitochondrial membranes, we next carried out SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of the mitochondrial proteins using antiserum against a synthetic peptide of the bAAC1-specific sequence His39–Ile60, which reacted well with 34-kDa Y2-(1–26)/B and 32.5-kDa Y1-(1–16)/B and to the same degree as that of 30-kDa native bAAC1 (22Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This antiserum did not cross-react with yAAC2 (Fig. 3, WT andyAAC2 lanes), and immunostained bands were detected for Y2Δ(3–6)/B, Y2Δ(3–11)/B, and Y2Δ(3–17)/B, but not for Y2Δ(3–22)/B, as shown in Fig. 3. From the immunostaining band intensities, we determined the amounts of the derivatives expressed in yeast mitochondria, and the results are summarized in Fig. 4 as a function of the length of the N-terminal region (n). Although expression of Y2Δ(3–22)/B (n = 6) was not clear, other derivatives were distinctly expressed. The expression of Y2-(1–26)/B was the highest, and that of Y2Δ/B derivatives increased with increases inn. The amounts of Y2Δ(3–17)/B, Y2Δ(3–11)/B, and Y2Δ(3–6)/B were ∼3, 18, and 67%, respectively, of that of Y2-(1–26)/B, and those of bAAC1 and Y1-(1–16)/B were ∼1 and 18%, respectively, of that of Y2-(1–26)/B. The expression of bAAC1 was as low as that of Y2Δ(3–17)/B with the same n of 11, and the expression of Y1-(1–16)/B (n = 16) was almost the same as that of Y2Δ(3–11)/B (n = 17), although the amino acid sequences of their N-terminal regions were quite different. These results show that the length of the N-terminal region of yAAC2 is essentially important for efficient expression of bAAC1 derivatives in yeast mitochondrial membranes. We next examined the effect of the N-terminal sequence on the expression of bAAC1 derivatives in the yeast mitochondrial membrane by changing the sequences of the N-terminal regions of the derivatives, keeping the length the same as that of Y2-(1–26)/B (n = 26). The N-terminal regions of the bAAC1 derivatives examined were as follows: a repeat of the N-terminal region of yAAC1 (Y1Y1/B), reversed sequences of the N-terminal region of yAAC2 (Y2R/B), and composite sequences of the N-terminal regions of yAAC2 and yAAC1 (Y2Y1/B), as shown in Fig.1 A. The WB-12 transformants of Y1Y1/B and Y2Y1/B derivatives such as Y1-(1–10)Y1-(2–16)/B, Y2-(1–11)Y1-(2–16)/B, and Y2-(1–17)Y1-(8–16)/B grew on YPGly plates with doubling times of ∼23, 13, and 8 h, respectively (Fig. 2). After Western blotting (Fig. 3), we determined their amounts expressed in the yeast mitochondrial membrane. Their expression was not the same, being ∼30, 75, and 95% of that of Y2-(1–26)/B, respectively (Fig. 4). Hence, the sequence of the N-terminal region, as well as its length, affects the expression of bAAC1 derivatives. We further examined the expression of Y2R/B derivatives. For this, we prepared the Y2R-(3–20)/B and Y2R-(12–20)/B transformants with n = 26 (Fig.1 A) and examined their growth on YPGly plates and in liquid YPGly medium. They all grew (Fig. 2), and their doubling times were 24 and 9 h, respectively. The amounts of their expression in mitochondrial membranes were determined from the immunostained band intensities by Western blotting (Fig. 3). The amounts of Y2R-(3–20)/B and Y2R-(12–20)/B were determined to be ∼22 and 92%, respectively, of that of Y2-(1–26)/B (Fig. 4). Here again, expression was dependent on the sequence of the N-terminal region. It is noteworthy in Fig. 4 that the expression of Y1-(1–10)Y1-(2–16)/B and Y2R-(3–20)/B was similar to that of Y1-(1–16)/B (n = 16) and Y2Δ(3–11)/B (n = 17), being 20–30% of that of Y2-(1–26)/B. Therefore, it is possible that bAAC1 derivatives are expressed up to this level depending on the length of the N-terminal region, irrespective of its sequence. As the sequence Ser3–Leu11 was common to the N-terminal regions of the well expressed derivatives Y2-(1–17)Y1-(8–16)/B, Y2R-(12–20)/B, and Y2-(1–26)/B, this sequence was suggested to be effective for efficient expression of bAAC1 derivatives in yeast mitochondria. Although Y2-(1–11)Y1-(2–16)/B contained this effective sequence, its expression was lower than that of the well expressed derivatives. This might be due to the lack of the sequence Pro15-Ala16-Pro17, which is commonly observed in the well expressed derivatives. To further understand the role of the N-terminal region, we next studied its role in the expression of yAAC2. For this, we examined the expression of yAAC2 by changing the length and sequence of its N-terminal region, as we did with bAAC1 derivatives. For examination of the effect of the length of the N-terminal region, we constructed DNA fragments encoding various Y2Δ/Y2 derivatives such as Y2Δ(3–6)/Y2 (n = 22), Y2Δ(3–11)/Y2 (n = 17), Y2Δ(3–17)/Y2 (n = 11), and Y2Δ(3–22)/Y2 (n = 6) (see Fig. 1 B); inserted them in"
https://openalex.org/W2013157191,"A phospholipid-controlled interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of vinculin is thought to be a major mechanism that regulates binding activities of the protein. To probe the mechanisms underlying these interactions we used chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis directed at histidine residues. Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) modification of the C-terminal, but not the N-terminal, domain greatly decreased affinity of the N-terminal-C-terminal binding, implicating histidine residues in the C-terminal. Mutation of either or both C-terminal histidines (at positions 906 and 1026), however, did not affect N-C binding at neutral pH. The H906A mutation did prevent DEPC effects and also prevented the normal decrease in binding affinity for the N-terminal at lower pH. We found that the wild type C-terminal domain, but not the H906A mutant, underwent a conformational change at pH 6.5, reflected in an altered circular dichroism spectrum and apparent oligomerization. Phospholipid also induced conformational changes in the wild type C-terminal domain but not in the H906A mutant, even though the mutant protein did bind to the phospholipid. Finally, the sensitivity of the N-C interaction to phospholipid was much reduced by the H906A mutation. These results show that H906 plays a key role in the conformational dynamics of the C-terminal domain and thus the regulation of vinculin.

Volk T. Volberg T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of vinculin within adhesions is not clear, it is critical for mammalian development (2Xu W. Baribault H. Adamson E.D. Development. 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is highly conserved from nematode to human (3Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10177-10185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is a multidomain protein with a 90-kDa globular head and a 30-kDa tail connected by a proline-rich domain (4Otto J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 16: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Each of these domains has been shown to have binding sites for several other proteins (e.g. talin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, actin), and thus vinculin may function as an integrator or sensor (reviewed in Refs. 5Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 6Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M.

In cells vinculin is found in soluble form as well as bound in the dense assemblies of proteins at adhesion sites (9Schlessinger J. Geiger B. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1983; 3: 399-403Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Its incorporation into adhesion sites has been shown to be dependent upon its interaction with other proteins (10Ball E. Freitag C. Gurofsky S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and it is thought that interactions between its N- and C-terminal domains control its binding proclivities (11Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12611-12619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Johnson R.P. Craig S.W.

Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus the observed tight association of the N-terminal head and C-terminal tail domains within the soluble protein acts to mask binding sites for several adhesion and signaling proteins. This self-association has been shown to be decreased by PIP21 (15Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), implicating this lipid in the regulation of vinculin location and activity. The interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains is of great interest because it is key to understanding vinculin regulation. The interacting regions of the domains have been mapped to small oppositely charged sequences (15Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but how binding might be turned on and off is not known. Conformational changes in the C-terminal domain have been detected by alterations in limited proteolysis patterns or cross-linking (18Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that the domain undergoes structural rearrangements in response to lipids or upon actin binding. Circular dichroism spectroscopy also points to conformational changes in the domains upon binding to each other (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Despite the recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain showing a mainly α-helical bundle (19Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the nature of such conformational changes is not clear. Because lipid binding sites have been mapped to the C-terminal (20Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Tempel M. Goldmann W.H. Isenberg G. Sackmann E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 228-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 22Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10211-10222Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), it may be changes in this domain that result in vinculin activation by altering the binding site for the N-terminal domain. In this model dissociation of the N-terminal would then expose binding sites in both domains, but further evidence is necessary to clarify the events. A few observations point to a key role for histidine residues in the N-terminal-C-terminal interaction. First, proteolytic cleavage of native vinculin left the head and tail regions of the molecule still tightly associated, but they could be separated at lower pH (pH 5) (23Groesch M.E. Otto J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our own work has shown a pH-sensitive interaction between the expressed N-terminal (amino acids 1–266) and C-terminal (amino acids 877–1066) domains, with half-maximal inhibition occurring between pH 6 and 7 (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Second, truncation of the last 15 residues from the C-terminal domain left a molecule that could not bind lipid at neutral pH but could do so at pH 5.5 (19Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus at least two properties of vinculin change in the pH range where histidine side chains become protonated. Third, there are several highly conserved histidine residues in both the N- and C-terminal domains. With the aim of understanding vinculin regulation, we have previously expressed in bacteria and characterized the two terminal domains of the molecule (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we report studies investigating the potential role of histidine residues in the interaction between them. Evidence gleaned from chemical modification and mutagenesis of two histidines in the C-terminal implicates histidine 906 as a key player in conformational changes that affect lipid binding and oligomerization as well as interdomain binding. This points to ionic interactions as a driving force in C-terminal conformational flexibility. Recombinant DNA techniques were from Sambrook et al. (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Vinculin constructs V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of His-906 and His-1026 to alanine was performed using a polymerase chain reaction protocol (25Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers used were CAGACAGCTGGCTGATGAAGC for H906A and GATGCTGGTGGCCAATGCCCA for H1026A. The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were cloned, sequenced, and placed in pGEX-KG (26Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). To make the double H906A,H1026A mutant, restriction fragments containing the individual mutations were ligated together. Proteins were induced, isolated, and cleaved from their glutathione S-transferase partner as described (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Vinculin domains V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) (25 µm) were reacted with DEPC (0.5 mm) in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 75 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at 20 °C for 10, 30, and 60 min prior to quenching with 2 mm imidazole. Following dialysis to remove unreacted DEPC, the number of modified residues was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 240 nm (ε = 3200m−1) (27Rai S.S. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31131-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in the degree of DEPC modification between the 10- and 60-min reactions. The far-UV spectra of vinculin domains were measured using a Jasco-J810 spectropolarimeter. Solutions contained 2.5 µm V-(877–1066), V-(877–1066/H906A), V-(877–1066/H1026A), or V-(877–1066/H906A+H1026A) in 20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. Spectra were measured between 190 and 260 nm. The effect of PI on the spectra of each construct was determined. Solutions contained 2.5 µm V-(877–1066), V-(877–1066/H906A), V-(877–1066/H1026A), or V-(877–1066/H906A+H1026A) and 100 µm PI. PI in buffer alone did not give measurable spectra within the 190–260 nm range. Determination of the α-helical content of the constructs was determined using the CDNN deconvolution program (28Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions were measured using a solid-phase binding assay as described (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Binding was performed in 20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA. The activity of the DEPC-modified domains was determined by competition assay. V-(877–1066) was coated on the wells of a 96-well plate, and binding of 125I-labeled V-(1–266) was determined in the presence of the DEPC-modified proteins. The K i of DEPC-modified protein and PI inhibition of the interaction between V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) or V-(877–1066/H906A) was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (29Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar): K i = IC50/(1 + (125I-labeled V-(1–266)/K d). The effect of phospholipids on protein adsorbed to the 96-well plates was determined by coating wells with unlabeled protein at 15 µg/ml and 125I-labeled protein at trace concentrations for 2 h. Wells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h. Phospholipids were then added at 1000 µm in 100 µl of buffer for 10 h. After washing, the amount of labeled protein remaining on the plate was not significantly different from control wells incubated for 10 h with buffer alone. Size exclusion chromatography of the various proteins was performed using a 24-ml Superose 12 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples of 25 µg were run at 0.5 ml/min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. A sample of each fraction was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%), and the intensity of the band was measured using densitometry (Alpha InnoTech Corp.). Data were plotted as the percentage of the total protein eluting from the column measured in each fraction. PI (Doosan-Serdary Research Laboratories, Englewood Cliffs, NJ) was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in chloroform. PI was dried down from a chloroform stock under nitrogen gas and suspended in 20 mm MES, pH 6.8, 1 mmEGTA, and 75 mm NaCl. The lipid suspension was sonicated (5 × 2 min) on ice. Vinculin domains were labeled using IODO-GEN (Pierce, Brockville, Ontario) as described (30Judd R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and lipid binding was assayed using a gel filtration column. Protein samples were incubated with PI vesicles for 30 min at room temperature before 100-µl samples were loaded onto Ultrogel AcA 34 columns (8 × 0.5 cm) (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). Binding was performed in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, 75 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA. Fractions were collected in 200-µl aliquots. Each fraction was counted in a Wallac model 1470 γ-counter. Elution patterns of each protein were determined in the presence and absence of phospholipid. Phospholipid content in each fraction was measured using a detergent-dye solubilization assay as described (31Almog R. Anderson-Samsonoff C. Berns D.S. Saulsbery R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To directly probe for the role of histidine residues in the N-C domain interaction, each domain was treated separately with DEPC, which reacts specifically with histidine residues to produce carbethoxyhistidine. The extent of reactions was quantified by measuring the increase in absorbance of the modified peptides at 240 nm (ε= 3200 m−1) (27Rai S.S. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31131-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Maximal modification occurred within 10 min, and histidine residues in V-(1–266) were found to be 48 ± 15% modified (2.4 ± 0.6 of 5 histidine residues) whereas construct V-(877–1066) was found to be 90 ± 18% modified (>1.4 residues out of 2 modified). The effect of this modification on the structures of the proteins was examined using circular dichroism. For both V-(1–266) and V-(877–1066) there were measurable differences in the determined secondary structure. The unmodified V-(1–266) was calculated to be 64% α-helical, which decreased to 59% after DEPC, whereas the V-(877–1066) was found to be 43% helical before and 37% after DEPC treatment (data not shown). Interaction of the modified domains was measured using a solid-phase binding assay (Fig. 1). Unmodified V-(877–1066) was coated on 96-well assay plates, and binding of125I-labeled V-(1–266) was measured in the presence of variable concentrations of DEPC-modified V-(1–266), V-(877–1066), or the unmodified domains. The measured K i values for the modified proteins were 61 ± 14 nm for V-(1–266) compared with 87 ± 20 nm for the unmodified construct and 367 ± 45 nm for the modified V-(877–1066) compared with 70 ± 15 nm for the unmodified construct. These results provide strong evidence for the importance of histidine(s) in the C-terminal domain. Comparison of the vinculin sequences from four different species and one meta-vinculin sequence shows that the two histidines (His-906 and His-1026 from the human vinculin sequence) in the tail domain are totally conserved although they are not found in the related catenins. To examine the role of these histidines, three mutant constructs were made, expressed, and purified: the single mutants V-(877–1066/H906A) and V-(877–1066/H1026A), as well as the double mutant V-(877–1966/H906A,H1026A), for comparison with the wild type tail domain. The effect of the histidine mutations on the ability of the tail domains to bind to V-(1–266) was determined using a solid-phase binding assay. At pH 7.0, V-(877–1066) bound to V-(1–266) with aK d of 90 ± 30 nm, whereas the mutants V-(877–1066/H906A), V-(877–1066/H1026A), and V-(877–1066/H906A,H1026A) bound with K d values of 110 ± 20, 80 ± 10, and 130 ± 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Thus, surprisingly, at pH 7.0, there was no significant difference between the binding affinities of the wild type vinculin tail and the mutants. Because the pK of histidine is near 6, we also checked lower pH values. At pH 5.5 V-(877–1066) bound to V-(1–266) with aK d of 680 ± 110 nm showing a large decrease in binding affinity but with no loss in total binding capacity. This finding is consistent with the observation that low pH allows separation of the vinculin head and tail (23Groesch M.E. Otto J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins containing the His-906 mutation, however, did not show the decreased affinity at lower pH (Fig. 2 B). The mutant C-terminal domains with the His-906, His-1026, or both mutations bound to V-(1–266) with K d values of 120 ± 30, 470 ± 80, and 210 ± 40 nm, respectively. Therefore, the H906A mutation and not the H1026A seems to confer resistance to the loss of affinity at pH 5.5. To establish that the changes in binding affinity induced by the DEPC treatment resulted from His-906 modification, the H906A mutant was treated with DEPC. This modified protein was then tested for its ability to compete with V-(877–1066) for binding to V-(1–266). TheK i values for the competition of V-(877–1066), V-(877–1066/H906A), and the DEPC-modified V-(877–1066/H906A) in this assay were 85 ± 20, 140 ± 35, and 115 ± 30 nm, respectively (data not shown). Thus the H906A mutation protected the C-terminal domain from loss of binding affinity for V-(1–266) by DEPC treatment. The effect of the two single mutations and the double mutation on the structure of the vinculin tail domain was studied using circular dichroism (Fig. 3). At pH 7.0 there was little difference between the measured circular dichroism spectra of the histidine mutant and the unmutated V-(877–1066). At pH 5.5, however, the spectra showed measurable changes. In the wild type, ellipticity at 208 nm was decreased at pH 5.5, causing the ratio [θ222]/[θ208] to increase from 0.87 at pH 7.0 to 1.07 at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3 A). This change was also observed for the H1026A mutant but not for V-(877–1066/H906A) (Fig. 3,B and C). To define more precisely the pH dependence of the conformational transition, circular dichroism spectra were collected over a range of pH values. The conversion between [θ222]/[θ208] < 1 to >1 occurs at pH ∼6.5 (Fig. 4), which suggests that this conversion, like the conformational change in general, is reliant upon the histidine residue. The H906A mutant showed no, or very little, change, strongly supporting this idea.Figure 4Change in the [θ]208 and [θ]222 of V-(877–1066) and histidine mutants with pH. Circular dichroism spectra were collected for V-(877–1066) (A), V-(877–1066/H906A) (B), and V-(877–1066/H1026A) (C) between 200 and 260 nm. Spectra were collected over a pH range of 4.5–8.0. Data are plotted as the [θ]208 (○) and [θ]222(●).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine possible consequences of the conformational changes seen at low pH, gel filtration profiles of V-(877–1066) and each of the histidine mutants were studied under different pH conditions (Fig. 5). V-(877–1066) was found, at physiological pH, to elute with a molecular weight (M r) of ∼25,000, which is the approximateM r of the monomeric species. However, upon lowering the pH to 5.5, the eluting peak was shifted, indicating aM r of >100,000. Similar profiles were obtained when examining V-(877–1066/H1026A) (Fig. 5 C). The elution profile of V-(877–1066/H906A), however, was much less affected by acidic pH (Fig. 5 B). It is evident that both activity and conformational changes induced by lowered pH were abrogated by mutation of histidine 906 to a nonionizable residue. To test the possibility that this residue may also affect the activity and conformational changes induced by vinculin ligands, phospholipid was tested for its ability to alter the conformation and activity of V-(877–1066/H906A). Using a gel filtration-based lipid-binding assay, V-(877–1066/H906A) was found to interact with PI vesicles (Fig.6), like the wild type domain. Sixty-six percent of the mutant co-eluted with lipid, compared with 63% of the wild type. Despite this similarity in binding, the H906A mutant did not undergo lipid-induced changes in its circular dichroism spectrum (Fig.7). Circular dichroism of both the wild type (not shown) and H1026A mutant (Fig. 7) showed a roughly 20% decrease in the absolute value of the ellipticity in the 208–222 nm range in the presence of 100 µm PI. In contrast, the H906A spectrum remained unaltered in the presence of the lipid. These spectral changes were different from those seen at low pH (Fig. 3), but they still depended on the presence of histidine 906.Figure 7Circular dichroism of histidine mutants in the presence and absence of lipid. Circular dichroism spectra of V-(877–1066/H906A) (A) and V-(877–1066/H1026A) (B) were collected without lipid (solid lines) or in the presence of 100 µm PI (dotted lines). Spectra were collected from 200–260 nm at a protein concentration of 2.5 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because acidic lipids, notably PI and PIP2, inhibit N-C interactions, it was of interest to determine whether the interaction between the H906A mutant and V-(1–266) would be similarly affected. A range of concentrations of PI was included in an N-C binding assay (Fig. 8). Although lipid could interfere with H906A-N-terminal interactions, 5–10-fold higher concentrations were required. The K i of PI inhibition was determined to be 104 ± 1.5 µm, in contrast to theK i of 17 ± 1.4 µm determined for the PI inhibition for V-(1–266) binding to wild type V-(877–1066). Efforts to purify the tightly associated N- and C-terminal domains of vinculin after proteolytic cleavage of native vinculin first led to the application of low pH (pH 5.0) to separate the domains (23Groesch M.E. Otto J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Later work made it clear that the N-C interaction is a major regulatory mechanism and controls the binding activities of the molecule (12Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Inside cells, the lipid PIP2 is likely the factor that causes dissociation of the two domains (15Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), but the mechanism has not been studied. One possibility would be a simple competition for binding to the C-terminal domain between the N-terminal and the lipid; however, different conformations of the C-terminal have been detected by limited proteolysis suggesting more complicated pathways. Several factors pointed to histidines as possible key residues, and our experiments reported here have amply confirmed their importance. Our initial experiments showed that DEPC, a specific modifier of histidine residues in proteins (32Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), inhibited the N-C interaction by modifying residues in the C-terminal. This limited the possible targets to two histidines at positions 906 and 1026. These residues are located in quite different regions of the C-terminal crystal structure (Fig.9). Because we had mapped the binding site for the N-terminal domain to residues 1009–1036 (17Miller G.J. Dunn S.D. Ball E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11729-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we anticipated that His-1026 would be a target and used mutagenesis to alanine to test this idea. Surprisingly, neither the H906A nor the H1026A mutant showed defects in binding to the N-terminal at neutral pH, raising the possibility that DEPC was reacting with some other residue. To clarify the situation, DEPC treatment of the mutants was performed, and this showed that His-906 was indeed the important target. Thus, DEPC modification of histidine 906 inhibited binding to the N-terminal domain whereas a different modification (to alanine) did not. Possibly the increase in size of the histidine side chain resulting from chemical modification changed the structure enough to prevent binding. In support of this idea, the circular dichroism spectra indicate a somewhat different conformation after treatment. When a smaller side chain was substituted, no such conformational distortion occurred, and binding to the N-terminal domain could take place. One possibility is that electronic repulsion between the protonated histidine and other nearby positively charged residues may be a driving force for conformational change that is mimicked by the steric repulsion due to the larger size of the histidine side chain after DEPC treatment. To look for a possible role of this histidine in conformational dynamics we examined the effects of pH on normal and mutant C-terminal domains. Circular dichroism spectra showed clear evidence of changes. There was little change in the 222 nm region that reflects the amount of α-helix in the protein. Rather, ellipticity is decreased at 208 nm, changing the 208/222 ratio, often taken to indicate a rearrangement of α-helices (33Steinmetz M.O. Stock A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Faix J. Gerisch G. Aebi U. Kammerer R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one consequence of the change in conformation is a shift to a larger apparent size by gel filtration, probably corresponding to an oligomerization although a change in the shape of the molecule could contribute to it. Oligomerization of the C-terminal in the presence of phospholipids has been detected by cross-linking, and specific regions prone to oligomerization have been identified. One possibility is that the molecule “opens up” as postulated by Bakolitsa et al. (19Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) to expose its more hydrophobic interior that could then interact to form oligomers. Structural determination of the low pH-induced conformation will be needed to answer this question. Because the H906A mutant no longer undergoes conformational changes at low pH, protonation of His-906 in the wild type must be a key step, and the charged side chain then results in changes in the binding site for the N-terminal, some distance away in the molecule. The environment of His-906 in the crystal structure gives few obvious clues to a mechanism for this effect. The histidine is found in a basic region including arginines 903 and 910 and lysine 924 (Fig. 9). Phenylalanine 885 and aspartate 907 are also close neighbors. One interesting feature of the crystal structure is the presence of a sulfate ion in a pocket formed by His-906, Arg-910, and Lys-1061. This ion is likely a substitute for the natural ligand, possibly a phosphate or a carboxyl group. The area could provide a binding surface for negatively charged lipids. Nearby negative charge would also be expected to increase the pK of the histidine from the value of 6.0 for the free amino acid, possibly explaining the pH of 6.5 for the conformational change. Protonation of the histidine in a positively charged environment could lead to electrostatic strain that triggers shifts in the relative position of the helices. The reduced sensitivity of the H906A mutant to binding inhibition by PIP2 indicates that the histidine plays a role in phospholipid effects as well. Because binding to PIP2 by the mutant is normal, loss of the initial interaction is not an explanation. The lack of change in the circular dichroism spectrum of the mutant compared with the wild type protein in the presence of PIP2 suggests that a requisite conformational change does not occur in the mutant. The characteristics of the lipid-induced change in circular dichroism seen in the wild type C-terminal are different from those induced by low pH. Thus His-906 appears to be important for two different conformational changes. There is some evidence that the vinculin C-terminal also has a different conformation when bound to actin (18Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether the H906A mutation affects that interaction as well. Reduction of pH has been reported to mimic the effect of phospholipid binding to other proteins. In particular, apolipoprotein E (apoE) undergoes conformational changes at low pH analogous to those that occur upon its interaction with phospholipid (34Clement-Collin V. Leroy A. Monteilhet C. Aggerbeck L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This example may be of particular relevance as the N-terminal portion of apoE is structurally similar to the vinculin C-terminal (19Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The helices of the apoE four-helix bundle are believed to reorient, resulting in an extended conformation with increased phospholipid binding and insertion activity, and a parallel model has been proposed for vinculin. There are, however, no histidines in this region of apoE comparable with histidine 906 in vinculin so the mechanism must be different. Lower pH may affect a variety of interhelix interactions and, in apoE, allow expression of conformational flexibility. In fact, it has been proposed that the negatively charged, polar head groups on acidic lipids increase the electrical surface potential in membranes, which leads to a decrease in the surface pH (35van der Goot F. Gonzalez-Manas J. Lakey J. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus a decrease in pH will have similar effects on lipid binding for some proteins, with similar intramolecular mechanisms. Further experiments will be needed to see if this idea is applicable here, although the different circular dichroism spectra of lipid-bound versus low pH C-terminal suggests that the conformations are different. In summary, it is clear that His-906 plays a key role in the conformational changes of the vinculin C-terminal domain. In turn, the overall conformation and activity of vinculin is controlled by these changes. Thus the H906A mutant will likely be useful in examining how the protein functions and how it is regulated in its natural environment.

https://openalex.org/W2043366969,"When isolated rabbit gastric glands were permeabilized with digitonin, they lost their ability to secrete acid, as monitored by [14C]aminopyrine accumulation, and they never recovered by supplement with cytosol prepared from gastric mucosa. However, the permeabilized glands elicited acid secretion when brain cytosol was supplemented. Fractionation of gastric cytosol by gel filtration revealed that the fraction at 30 kDa stimulated permeabilized glands by itself, whereas the 200-kDa fraction potently inhibited brain cytosol-stimulated acid secretion. Brain cytosol contained only the former stimulatory factor. With further gel filtration, the 30-kDa activator was separated into two components, 20 kDa (peak 1) and 1.8 kDa (peak 2), both of which are necessary for full activity. We purified peak 1 from bovine brain, and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) was identified as the main component of the activity. The stimulating activity in brain and gastric mucosa correlated with the contents of PITP, and recombinant PITP mimicked the effect of peak 1, suggesting that PITP is one of the essential components in gastric acid secretion. When gastric glands were stimulated, the inhibitory activity, but not stimulatory activity, in the cytosol was increased. This suggests a regulatory mechanism such as stimulation translocates the inhibitory component from the secretory site on the membrane to cytosol. These results demonstrate a high degree of usefulness for our present model, the reconstituted digitonin-permeabilized gastric glands."

Di R., I Powers A. Fresco R. Tosolini A. Testa J.R. Pass H.I. Rizzo P. Carbone M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10214-10219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Lednicky J.A. Garcea R.L. Raptis L. SV40 Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 257-267Google Scholar). Neoplastic transformation by this virus is mediated mainly by its large tumor antigen (SVLT),1 a nuclear oncoprotein capable of transforming a variety of mammalian cell types (3Manfredi J.J. Prives C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar, 4Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis studies revealed that this ability may result from its interaction with a number of cellular gene products, including the tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and members of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (pRb) family (pRb, p107, p130; reviewed in Refs. 5Brodsky J.L.

SVLT binds to pRb family members and inactivates their ability to restrain cell proliferation. We have previously demonstrated that neoplastic transformation by SVLT requires the activity of the cellular Ras protooncogene product (c-Ras or Ras), which is a key player in a pathway that relays signals from membrane tyrosine kinases to the nucleus (7Raptis L. Marcellus R. Corbley M.J. Krook A. Whitfield J. Anderson S.K. Haliotis T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5203-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). SVLT was unable to fully transform cells where endogenous Ras levels were reduced through the introduction of a Ras antisense construct or the dominant-negative mutant, RasN17 (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). Later work (10Lee K.Y. Ladha M.H. McMahon C. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7724-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also showed that pRb inactivation in cells from pRb-null mice causes a dramatic increase in Ras activity. To investigate whether SVLT might be activating c-Raf (Raf), the most prominent Ras downstream target, recently shown to be important in opposing apoptosis (11Mikula M. Schreiber M. Husak Z. Kucerova L. Ruth J. Wieser R. Zatloukal K. Beug H. Wagner E.F. Baccarini M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of SVLT upon Raf catalytic activity. To examine whether activation of this pathway by SVLT requires extensive protein synthesis, we reconstituted the system in baculovirus/Sf9 insect cells, currently the most widely used model for measuring the activity of putative Raf regulators (12Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In conjunction with insect cell systems, we examined these relationships in mammalian cells, where these components were either stably or transiently expressed through transfection. The results show that, aside from Ras, SVLT can also activate Raf. Interestingly, this effect may be, at least in part, Ras-independent since SVLT-mediated Raf activation can take place in cell lines where Ras levels have been reduced through antisense Ras expression. SVLT-expressing rat F111 cells were prepared through infection with a pBabeHygro-based retroviral vector and hygromycin resistance selection (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). For the production of Ras-deficient cells, mouse 10T½ fibroblasts were transfected with a Ras antisense construct expressing the EJ-ras gene downstream and in the opposite orientation from the mouse metallothionein promotor. These cells express ∼30% the Ras levels present in the parental line. SVLT was expressed in these cells using the same retroviral vector and hygromycin resistance selection. A number of lines were produced that permanently express the Ras antisense and SVLT (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). c-Ras levels were restored to base-line levels in these cells as follows: a 2.3-kilobase pair fragment from the human c-Ha-ras-1 gene, coding for the four Ras exons and three introns as well as a poly(A) addition signal sequence, was introduced into the retroviral vector pDOL at the uniqueBamHI cloning site. The ψ2 packaging line was transfected with this plasmid, and the culture supernatant from a mixture of G418-resistant stable transfectants was used to infect the 10T½ cells and their derivatives. Due to aberrant splicing of the message in the packaging line caused by the ras introns, more than 95% of the infected target cells contain various combinations ofras gene exons, while a very small proportion of them expresses a correctly spliced c-Ha-ras gene (7Raptis L. Marcellus R. Corbley M.J. Krook A. Whitfield J. Anderson S.K. Haliotis T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5203-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This would ensure that the antisense Ras RNA is inactivated, while a functional, transforming Ras sense message is not being produced (7Raptis L. Marcellus R. Corbley M.J. Krook A. Whitfield J. Anderson S.K. Haliotis T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5203-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, approximately 1000 Ras-deficient 25B8, 25SV7t, or control 10T½ cells, growing in a 6-cm Petri dish, were infected with 3 ml of filtered culture supernatant from ψ2 cells transfected with this plasmid, and the Ras levels, as well as the phenotypic characteristics of the cells, were examined. Rat F111 and mouse 10T½ fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Freshly plated cells were transfected at 70–80% confluence using Superfect (Qiagen). Cell cultures were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection. Sf9 cells were grown at 27.5 °C, in TC-100 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The wt SVLT or the K1 SVLT mutant insert was excised from the original pSG5 vector (a gift of J. DeCaprio, Ref. 13Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Campbell K.S. Schweitzer R.C. Roberts T.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4979-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and subcloned in the BamHI site of the pVL1393 vector (PharMingen). This plasmid was transfected into insect Sf9 cells together with the BaculoGold vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions (PharMingen). Plaques were picked and recombinant virus propagated for use in infection experiments. The baculovirus encoding glutathione S-transferase-SVLT-(1–147) or glutathione S-transferase-SVLT-(1–147 D44N) mutant (14Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Pipas J.M.

Subsequently, the amplification products were cloned into pVL 1392 and recombinant baculoviruses produced using BaculoGold (PharMingen). Baculovirus infections were performed essentially as described (12Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,15Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The amounts of infecting viruses were adjusted to keep the amounts of the proteins being studied the same when protein production in a single infection was compared with the one in a double or triple infection. To accomplish this, preliminary experiments were performed, using different ratios of the infecting viruses over a range of multiplicities of infection at each ratio (16Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h later. Protein production was monitored by immunoblotting. Anti-active Mek antibodies (9120) were obtained from QCB/BIOSOURCE and New England Biolabs. The anti-Ras antibody pan-Ras Ab2 was from Oncogene Science, and anti-SVLT polyclonal antibodies 101 and 108 were from PharMingen. For Raf kinase assays, cells were lysed 48 h after transfection of mammalian cells or infection of Sf9 cells with the indicated combinations of expression vectors and Raf was immunoprecipitated with a C-terminal specific Raf antibody (a gift of R. Narsimhan). Following two washes in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), [γ-32P]ATP and protein substrate (kinase-dead Mek, K97M) were added to the immunoprecipitate and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (12Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by exposing the dried gels to x-ray film. Quantitation was performed by PhosphorImager analysis using the ImageQuant program. For anchorage-independent growth measurements, ∼104 cells were suspended in 2 ml of 0.33% agarose (Sigma) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, on top of a feeder layer of the same medium containing 0.7% agarose, in 6-cm Petri dishes (18Raptis L. Bolen J.B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 753-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth was recorded and photographs taken 10 days later under brightfield illumination. Focus formation assays were performed by plating ∼200 SVLT-expressing cells together with 104normal cells in a 6-cm Petri dish as described previously (19Raptis L. Vultur A. Raptis L. SV40 Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 153-166Google Scholar). Previous results showed that SVLT expression results in Ras activation (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). SVLT is also well known to interact in vivowith uncharacterized kinases (see Ref. 20Zhai W. Comai L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2791-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, and references therein). To examine whether SVLT might be activating Raf, a serine/threonine kinase and the most prominent Ras downstream target, we examined the effect of SVLT upon the Raf catalytic activity. To this end, we reconstituted the system in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells, a model which has been widely used in the past in assessing the effect of potential Raf regulators (12Morrison D.K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Raf, alone or in conjunction with SVLT, was expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus vectors and its activity examined by in vitro kinase assay (Fig.1). Detergent cell extracts were precipitated with an anti-Raf antibody and the Mek substrate added to washed immunoprecipitates together with [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer, the boiled samples resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins visualized by autoradiography of dried gels. In accordance with the well established notion that Raf's capacity for autophosphorylation is a direct reflection of its kinase activity assayed in vitro (17Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the ability of Raf to phosphorylate itself as well as the exogenously added Mek substrate was increased by SVLT expression (Fig. 1 A, lane 2 versus lane 3). As a control, we examined the effect of SVLT upon coexpressed kinase-dead Raf (Raf-K375M). As shown in Fig. 1 B (lanes 5 and 6), SVLT coexpression had no effect upon the background kinase activity associated with the mutated Raf. Similarly, coinfection with SVLT and an empty baculovirus vector lacking an insert did not reveal any Raf labeling (Fig. 1 B,lanes 7 and 8). These results taken together indicate that SVLT stimulates the catalytic activity of the Raf kinase in insect cells. To further quantitate the effect of SVLT upon Raf activity, we determined the degree of Raf stimulation by different amounts of co-expressed SVLT. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus vectors expressing either (i) Raf and Ras or (ii) Raf, Ras, and SVLT. As shown in Fig. 2, the catalytic activity of Raf immunoprecipitated from cells infected with a 1/20 dilution of the Raf-expressing vector was low (lane 2), but progressively increased upon coinfection with the SVLT-expressing vector, in proportion to the amount of SVLT in the cell, as assessed by Western blotting (lanes 3–5). This increase was evident even in the absence of Ras coexpression (lanes 10 and 12). Moreover, SVLT coinfection dramatically increased Raf kinase when the Raf vector was used at an 1/100 dilution (lane 6 versus lanes 7–9), although, as expected, the overall signal was weaker, due to the lower amounts of Raf protein expressed. The above results taken together suggest that, like the membrane-bound tyrosine-kinases (17Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), SVLT can stimulate the catalytic activity of Raf in this system. Extensive genetic and biochemical evidence has shown that full neoplastic transformation by SVLT requires binding to proteins of the retinoblastoma family (5Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the importance of pRb binding by SVLT for Raf activation, we tested the effect of the transformation-defective mutant K1, which is altered at the pRb binding site (Glu107 → Lys; Ref. 4Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with different amounts of recombinant baculovirus vectors expressing wt SVLT or the K1 mutant, and their effect upon the co-expressed Raf kinase measured as above. As shown in Fig.1 B, coexpression of the K1 mutant stimulated Raf activity but to a lesser extent than the wild type (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and4). These results indicate that, although the pRb binding site is required for full Raf activation by SVLT in Sf9 cells, some activation is present even in the absence of this sequence. The structure of SVLT as well as all other oncogenes of the polyoma viruses has evolved to include a conserved N-terminal DnaJ domain, which has been shown to be essential for their individual functions (5Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6DeCaprio J.A. Biologicals. 1999; 27: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R.

DnaJ proteins normally regulate the folding of protein substrates by the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperone family (22Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar). Both the critical importance of the J domain in SVLT function and the absolute requirement for the Hsc70 binding site incis with the known pRb and p53 binding motifs for SVLT-mediated transformation have been established (5Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6DeCaprio J.A. Biologicals. 1999; 27: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Sullivan C.S. Gilbert S.P. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the DnaJ domain for Raf activation by SVLT, the effect of a mutant known to disrupt the function of this domain (Asp44 → Asn; 1–147; see “Experimental Procedures,” Refs. 5Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Campbell K.S. Schweitzer R.C. Roberts T.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4979-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, and 14Campbell K.S. Mullane K.P. Aksoy I.A. Stubdal H. Zalvide J. Pipas J.M. Silver P.A. Roberts T.M. Schaffhausen B.S. DeCaprio J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1098-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) was tested. Sf9 cells were infected with different amounts of recombinant baculovirus vectors expressing wt SVLT or the D44N mutant, and their effect upon the co-expressed Raf kinase measured as above. As shown in Fig. 3, coexpression of this mutant stimulated Raf activity but to a lesser extent than the wild type (compare lanes 3 and9), indicating that full Raf activation by SVLT requires an intact DnaJ domain. To further investigate whether the observed Raf activation by SVLT is also occurring in mammalian cells, in the absence of viral infection and protein overexpression, we examined the stimulation of Raf kinase by SVLT in rat F111 fibroblasts. SVLT was expressed in these cells through the retroviral vector pBabeHygro, and a typical clone, FSV1a, was chosen for further study (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity of endogenous Raf was measured in these cells before or after stable SVLT expression using the kinase-dead Mek as a substrate, as described above. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of the Raf substrate is approximately 4 times as high in SVLT-expressing, FSV1a cells compared with their normal F111 counterparts. To test whether recombinant Raf can also be activated by SVLT after transient expression, we also measured the in vitro catalytic activity of exogenous glutathione S-transferase-tagged Raf, produced through transfection of plasmid pEBG-Raf (15Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) in the two lines. As shown in Fig. 4 B (lanes 2 and3), phosphorylation of the Raf substrate was twice as high in SVLT-expressing FSV1a cells. Furthermore, in addition to cell lines permanently expressing SVLT, we transiently coexpressed SVLT along with Raf by transfection in F111 fibroblasts and compared Raf activation with cells transfected with Raf alone. Detergent cell lysates were precipitated with GSH-Sepharose and Raf activity determined using the inactive Mek substrate as above. As shown in Fig. 4 B(lanes 4 and 5), Raf activity was approximately 3-fold higher in cells transiently transfected with SVLT and Raf (lane 5), compared with cells transfected with Raf alone (lane 4), whereas the SVLT-K1 mutant activated Raf to ∼60% of the wild type (lane 6). Similar results were obtained with SVLT-expressing mouse 10T½ cells (data not shown). The above data taken together indicate that, aside from Sf9 cells, SVLT can also activate the Raf kinase in rodent fibroblasts. The Raf protooncogene product has been shown to be physically and functionally associated with Ras, which is known to transmit signals from tyrosine kinase receptors to Raf and other downstream effectors. Therefore, we investigated the possibility whether Ras might be mediating the transmission of SVLT signals to Raf and its downstream effectors, or whether the effects of SVLT on Raf activity might be, at least partly, independent of Ras. To this end, we expressed SVLT through retroviral infection in 10T½-derived cell lines where Ras expression was down-regulated through transfection with a Ras antisense construct (line 25B8; see “Experimental Procedures”) (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). Individual colonies were picked, expanded into clones, and tested for SVLT levels by Western blotting, and clones with high SVLT levels (e.g.25SV7t) were examined further. Detergent cell lysates were prepared and Raf kinase activity measured using the kinase-dead Mek as substrate as described above (15Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5A, SVLT caused a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of the kinase-dead Mek Raf substrate, added to anti-Raf immunoprecipitates from the Ras-deficient 25B8 cells, indicating that Raf activation by SVLT is not substantially inhibited by Ras down-regulation. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5 B, activation of endogenous Mek by SVLT, as detected with an antibody specific for its activated form, can occur in the Ras-deficient cells to the same extent as in the parental line indicating that, in addition to Raf, Mek activation by SVLT can occur in the face of low endogenous Ras levels. pRb inactivation by SVLT has been demonstrated to lead to Ras activation (10Lee K.Y. Ladha M.H. McMahon C. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7724-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since, as shown above, SVLT is able to activate Raf in mammalian cells even after Ras down-regulation, it is possible that the presence of the pRb binding site might not be an absolute requirement for SVLT transformation in this system. Therefore, we examined the phenotypic effect of the K1 mutant, which is unable to bind pRb and can activate Raf to ∼60% the levels of the wt (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 2; Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6). Rat F111 clones stably expressing the K1 mutant were produced through transfection and examined for their transformation-related parameters (19Raptis L. Vultur A. Raptis L. SV40 Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 153-166Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, K1-expressing F111 cells (FK1) displayed a transformed morphology on plastic (A), although they were unable to grow in agar (C), indicating that this mutant is partially transforming in this system (25Srinivasan A. McClellan A.J. Vartikar J. Marks I. Cantalupo P. Li Y. Whyte P. Rundell K. Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4761-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, K1-expressing F111 cells produced ∼50% the number of discernible foci on plastic as formed by the wt. We have previously shown that full neoplastic transformation by SVLT requires the function of c-Ras (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 6, SVLT expression in the Ras-deficient, 10T½ fibroblasts (e.g. clone 25SV7t) did bring about morphological transformation (panel E versus panel F), although not the ability to grow under anchorage-independence conditions (H). These results are consistent with the interpretation that the Raf activation seen under conditions of low Ras levels may be sufficient to bring about a partial transformation. To ensure that the observed phenotype is indeed due to c-Ras down-regulation, c-Ras levels were restored to the base line by infection with the culture supernatant from ψ2 packaging cells transfected with a retroviral vector carrying an intron-containing, ras gene insert (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 7Raptis L. Marcellus R. Corbley M.J. Krook A. Whitfield J. Anderson S.K. Haliotis T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5203-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Infected cells displayed normal c-Ras levels by Western blotting and a near-normal growth rate within 20 days (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar), whereas their uninfected counterparts maintained the slow growth characteristics for at least a year in culture (7Raptis L. Marcellus R. Corbley M.J. Krook A. Whitfield J. Anderson S.K. Haliotis T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5203-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, infected 25SV7t cells were able to grow in agar in a manner indistinguishable from their counterparts with normal Ras levels (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, the high expression levels of a combination of Ras exons in the target lines under control of the strong murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat promotor are responsible for inactivation of the Ras antimessage, and thus restoration of normal growth rate and transformation by SVLT. Results from a number of laboratories have indicated that activation of Raf normally requires binding to Ras, which brings Raf to the plasma membrane for further activation through tyrosine phosphorylation (26Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 27Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, Ras-independent mechanisms for the activation of Raf and its downstream effectors have also been described in both insect and mammalian cells. For example, in baculovirus-infected insect cells, v-Src has been shown to activate Raf in a Ras-independent manner (16Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while in mammalian cells (28Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 29Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) integrin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-mediated Erk activation can occur via a Ras-independent pathway (30Chen Q.M. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Vultur A.M. Ross G. Tremblay E. Elliott B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 293-303PubMed Google Scholar, 32Burgering B.M. de Vries-Smits A.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7248-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the context of SVLT signaling, it was recently shown that SVLT transfection in NIH3T3 cells bypasses the requirement for Ras or Src function during platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis (33Broome M.A. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2867-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence point to the possibility that Raf activation by SVLT might be partly independent of Ras. 1) SVLT expression in Sf9 cells does increase the activity of co-expressed Raf, although to lower levels than the combination of SVLT plus Ras. Although the endogenous Ras might be able to compensate to some extent, its levels would be very low, compared to the virally expressed SVLT and Raf. 2) Albeit to lower levels than wt SVLT, the K1 mutant that cannot activate Ras (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar), is able to activate Raf. 3) Raf and Mek are activated by SVLT in mammalian cells, where endogenous Ras expression is down-regulated through the introduction of an antisense Ras construct, to similar levels as the parental line. How SVLT activates Raf is only speculative at the moment. Clues pointing toward the involvement of the cellular chaperone machinery are provided by our finding (Fig. 3) that the DnaJ homology domain SVLT mutant (D44N), which is unable to bind to and stimulate the activity of Hsp70 (5Brodsky J.L. Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5329-5334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has also a severely compromised ability to activate Raf. In support of this hypothesis, recent work has established that Raf is bound to and modulated in vivo by the chaperone machinery including the Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperone families (15Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Silverstein A.M. Grammatikakis N. Cochran B.H. Chinkers M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35van der Straten A. Rommel C. Dickson B. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 36Song J. Takeda M. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, although it appears possible that SVLT might activate Raf partly through Ras stimulation, under conditions of low Ras levels SVLT might be still activating Raf by sequestering hsp70, which was recently shown to inactivate Raf through Bag1 binding (36Song J. Takeda M. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The latter could also operate in the presence of Ras. The precise mechanism through which chaperone proteins might be mediating Raf activation will be addressed in future experiments. Examination of different transformation-related parameters in response to graded levels of oncogene expression in rat F111 cells previously revealed the existence of a hierarchy, with morphological transformation, focus formation, agar growth, and tumorigenicity requiring progressively higher levels of oncogene expression (37Raptis L. Lamfrom H. Benjamin T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2476-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In fact, the K1 mutant, which is able to only partially activate Raf,is able to partially transform rat F111 cells as judged by morphology on plastic, but not to anchorage independence, indicating that the observed Raf activation by this mutant might be sufficient for morphological transformation. This is in keeping with our results indicating that, although SVLT is not able to transform Ras-deficient cells to agar growth and tumorigenicity, it is able to induce morphological transformation, suggesting that this property may be exquisitely sensitive to weak SVLT signals, or that morphological changes may be independent of Ras (9Raptis L. Brownell H.L. Wood K. Corbley M. Wang D. Haliotis T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 891-901PubMed Google Scholar). In any event, the high Raf activity levels in the Ras-deficient, SVLT-expressing 25SV7t cells indicate that Raf activation does not equal full neoplastic transformation in this system. Additional, Ras-mediated pathways involving other Ras effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase could play a significant role. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates that SVLT can activate Raf, at least partly in a Ras-independent manner. Future experiments will examine whether this effect is mediated by SVLT's ability to modulate Raf's interaction with chaperone proteins, and in turn its catalytic activity. We thank E. Schaefer for the generous gift of antibodies against activated Mek and J. DeCaprio for gifts of SVLT mutants."
